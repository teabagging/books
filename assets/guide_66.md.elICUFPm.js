Her story is heartbreaking and very real. Finally, she and her little brother Rodney are able to live with their elderly grandmother and have a chance for happiness and real love when tragedy strikes again. Some V.C. Andrews stories really capture my attention and others do not. This one got my attention. I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Yes, these last two &quot;mini&quot; series are totally insulting to V. C. Andrews name and talent. She would not have written weak, empty-headed dramas about four teenaged girls feeling sorry for themselves. Where is the shock! Where is the horror! There was a time when V. C. Andrews was beating Stephen King in horror paperback sales, there is no horror here anymore. Very sad and depressing that the Ghostwriter has begun to ignore the die-hard ADULT fans of V. C. Andrews who read her because her novels were so gothic, so dark. I am so angry with these books I could spit nails, what would Stephen King's fans do if he started writing teeny-bopper romance melo-dramas? Ms. Andrews' was a HORROR novelist, and just because she was a woman, they are altering her style to a more sudsy, soapy variety. Dispicable!"},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"In the second story in the Wildflowers series we hear Star's story. Star likes to put up a tough bravado but the truth is her past is filled with pain. In Dr. Marlowe's therapy group she tells the story of parents that constantly fought, and a mother that never really wanted to have kids. As she continues to tell her story Misty, Jade, and Cat may realize that Star, under her wise cracks is just like them. I found this book to be a nice read, but not really up to par with the rest of the series. I liked reading this book. But compared to the other two in the series I've already read (Misty and Jade) it was just lacking something. Neverless I'm still reading the series (Cat is on my shelf right now and I'm going to buy the full-length novel Into the garden). I reccomend this book to fans of a series but try to get it from your library instead of spending your own money on it."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"I'm a huge V.C. Andrews fan. That is, the REAL VC, and not the ghost writer of Andrew Neiderman. My one star rating is for all the mini series books out there. What a marketing ripoff. By the time you buy each individual little book in the mini series, plus the final book that reunites them all, you will have spent considerably more than the price for one normal sized VC book. Now that the hype of the series has died down, i find that they go and finally publish all the books together in one massive volume, like they should have done in the first place. The real VC would not have pulled such a horrible money-making stunt like the publishers are doing. The mini-series books have a hastily-written feel to them, as if the publishers needed to get some kind of VC book out on the shelves asap, with little thought to the content, or even if the faithful VC fans would even care about a mini-series like this. The VC magic was totally absent from any of the mini-series books, and i felt like i was reading a &quot;young adult&quot; teeny-bopper VC Andrews, instead of the old &quot;adult&quot; VC Andrews we all love. I think all of the books in the mini-series should be put in the Young Adult section instead of in the horror section of the bookstore. They feel like a cross between a weak version of R.L. Stine books and some other book aimed at 12-year-olds. There really is a juvenile feel to these mini-series books that i did not like. The ghost writer has gotten worse with each series, and it was obvious many series ago that he has adopted his own modern writing style, even though the story is told in the first person. I never liked this current &quot;modernization&quot; of the VC Andrews stories. The older books were the best ever, because they were written by the real V.C. Andrews, and had memorable characters. Tell me, does any true VC fan care much for the new crop of characters in these mini-series?? NO! Compare the new books to the books in the Flowers In The Attic series and Heaven series. It's like compairing junk to a treasure. It's so obvious that the Andrews family is in all this for a share of the money they are making off the ghost writer's books. I wish Andrew Neiderman would stop attaching V.C. Andrews' name to the stuff he writes. VC would not be proud. Her stores were ten million times better and more interesting than these damned mini-series books. The fact that the name V.C. Andrews is a copyright is a shame. Why doesn't Andrew Neiderman just write the books and put his name on them? We all know he's the one writing the books, so just stop with putting VC Andrews on the cover. It's become a joke now. We all know the writing and story ideas are nowhere near as good as the ones the real VC used to write. Please skip all the books in any of the mini-series. If you want to read the REAL V.C. Andrews, then stick with the first few series she wrote. For those who don't know, she died in 1986, shortly after Dark Angel, the second book in the Heaven series, was written."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"My first V.C. Andrews book was &quot;Misty&quot; and I absolutely loved it! I was really excited to read Star, because she's my favorite of the four girls...and I was kind of disappointed. &quot;Star&quot; is really really good, but the first thirty five pages are kind of slow. It starts with Star being dropped off at Dr. Marlowe's office, today being her day to tell the other three girls (Cat, Jade, and Misty) her story. She starts with telling them how her mom's an alcoholic, and her dad left them when her and her brother (Rodney) were just little kids. Her mom soon meets someone, and they come home totally trashed, night after night, for quite some times. When this is happening, Star's little brother is getting hurt at home, and Star is having problems at school. Her grades are slipping. After a while, Star's mom dumps her and Rodney off to live with her grandma. When Star starts school, she meets Steve, and they quickly become boyfriend and girlfriend. Steve has the same problem as Star - his dad drinks and his mom is dead. But one night something horrible happens, and Star is changed forever.This book is REALLY good, but the beginning is kind of slow, which is the only reason it's not getting 5 stars. Some people say that this book is geared towards 6th graders ~ I highly disagree, and thought this was suggestive. It is good though!"},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"'Star' written by V.C. Andrews gets 5 stars because it was an excellent book for a teenage girl. The book shows teenage girls that they are not the only ones going through a rough time with adolescence. It made me realize that no matter how bad I think the problem is that I am going through, there is always some else out there going through something much worse. This book made me want to cry at times and I recommend it for any teenage girl who is having a hard time dealing with life right now. It will make you realize that what you are dealing with really isn't all that bad."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Star was so surprising to me. I never would have thought that V.C.Andrews would put a Black girl on the cover. As an avid fan,an African American and avid reader of V.C. Andrews, I was shocked. I thought the story was good. It's not as good as Heaven, or Flowers in the attic, but nonetheless, it was good."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"This was better than Misty and poor Star goes through a lot. not as exciting as I thought it would be, but at least it's about a black girl, which is different."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with this read. Having read and owning copies of all the original V.C. Andrews books and having been a captured reader of HER books, I can only say that when her reads came out originaly, I believed this writer to be a PHENOMENON, and still do! However this book, as well as many of the other books, written by 'other hired writers' just don't seem to cut it for me. These writings done after her death don't seem to have the same appeal and have never been able to capture her forte. For me, this book was another disappointment. In my mind there will never be anyone who can write her books and I think most of the new books written by 'other writers' just shouldn't be using her name. But that's just my opinion.I keep buying them or getting them at local library, so it's something in them that keeps me coming back. I think though, that it is the hope of finding another one that can equal Victoria's writing herself. And that's just never going to happen. Sorry."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Awesome this book is great. It really gets to your very heart and soul. The writing is truly the best."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Star was a really enjoyable short story. The V. C. Andrews series are really wonderful. However, I am not happy with how short the books are. I enjoy reading a book for a week. I pick up one of these &quot;Novels&quot; and its over in a couple of hours. Star is an excellent book about a young girls struggles and you can really empathize with her. I am looking forward to the rest of the series. My only disappointment is that it ends too soon. I do have to admit that every time I read a V. C. Andrews book I am looking for the thrill of Flowers in the Attic. I have yet to find a book of that quality."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"When I read Misty, I thought this was going to be a great series. Now Star reinforces it. This story is really edgy and a lot more contemporary. I can just see the eyes of the other girls opening as Star tells her tale. Great! I am really looking forward to Jade and Cat now."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Star share her story to these girls... oh boy, she been through a lot of stuff no other girls should endure... but this story could be true... a parent might run off and another parent not taking care of family so Star was left to take care of her brother... she could be a great mom but I doubt she want to be a mom in fear to be like her mother.... Can't wait to get last two books, Jade and Cat..."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"They might be short but they got a point to the story the girl that said they werent horror anymore your sick you dont know what horror is Did you know some familys are like that i know someone that life is like that its scary and horrofing read it again and think what if my father and mother left what if I had to do everything when that happens what if your relatives didnt want you your a ward of the state its not fun I know ive got some friends that had that happen to them stars only lucky she had a grandmother who cared so much!Think before you write next time!"},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Star is the most boring of all the Wildflowers. Maybe it's because her romance with the abused boy is so clich&eacute;d, or maybe it's because the lavish houses of Beverly Hills are missing. Whatever it is, something is lacking in this story. Might it be a talented writer?"},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Star's life hasn't been easy. Having an alcoholic mother, responsibility fell onto her shoulders at an early age. She was forced to be a parent to her younger brother, since her mother was always either passed out or getting drunk at the bar. After her father abandons his family, Star's mother takes up with a man named Aaron who she ends up running off with, forcing Star's grandmother to become guardian to the children.Like the first in the series, this is a story that (sadly) is unremarkable. Star never got to have a childhood; mothering her brother gave her adult responsibilities at the time of life where she should have been enjoying being a kid. On top of that, the one person she's close to also has an alcoholic parent, and this brings further tragedy into Star's life.I agree with people whose reviews say these stories are not like the real V.C. Andrews' books; the lives described are too typical/average to even compare, but putting that aside and taking them at their own merit, they're okay. More like relatable \\"me too\\" fiction than \\"woah, that's messed up\\" fiction."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"the reviews on here make me sad. star went through hell and back and everyone seems to hate star. i've been through hell and back just like star. i have almost died four times. been sexually abused and had several people i love die. the indifference people show star reminds me of the indifference people have towards me. people have treated me like they were thinking &#34;she brought all this upon herself by not being pretty enough&#34;.it's really sad when you grow up suffering and noone has heart enough to give a damn."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Star's not really better or worse than her predecessor, Misty. Her story isn't VCA caliber, but it's not a bad book for teens to read. It seems that Neiderman was relying on stereotypes for this book, but by itself it isn't a horrible read, just a lite teen book. Compared to the other books in this series, it's so-so."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Star acted more of a mom to her little brother Rodney while their own parents Aretha and Kenny were so busy squabbling with each other. Star and Rodney were lucky to move in with their grandma. I was glad she fell in love with Steve. I believe Star should have told her grandma about Steve's problems while he was alive. That way Steve's life would have been saved. Star took it very hard when Steve died. Yet her grandma didn't panic when she found out when her own granddaughter needed help."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Ok, so Star was good, I expected the worst and got one almost up to Misty, but not quite. Don't get me wrong, it is really good, but I hated something about it... something I can't identify. I guess I just can't quite picture it as much as the others. She did have a bad life, worse than Misty's for sure, but it was downright DEPRESSING! I know ones like FLowers in the Attic and My Sweet Audrina are both sad and maybe depressing, but something just *clicked* in them, I loved them, and I felt I was leaning outside the homes looking in, seeing, watching... and that's how it's supposed to be. I guess the thing I find most depressing about these *New* books is they catigorize them as &quot;Horror&quot;. Horror? No! They are stories of some little girl's life, and they aren't scary at all, just sad! I think sometime after Ruby series, the ghostwriter lost interest somewhere... I wish he'd get it back and make another &quot;Heaven&quot; series."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Was pretty good, but not as good as cat. its the 3rd best book in the wild flower series."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"This was a really great book, it makes you think about your own life, and how good your life really is.

It's part of a series, and they are all really good also, but i think this is the best one out of all of them."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"I was suprised when I read Misty and Star. I did not think I would like the mini books but, I must say I am going out now and buy Jade and Cat. They are not as good as the original V.C. Andrews' books but they will do."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"I too am one of the fans of the older, more intense novels. The only one in this series so far with anything even remotely shocking is &quot;Jade&quot;. The narrative style is horrible--considering that the girls are speaking, the language is very unconversational. Who would really tell an oral story using phrases like &quot;She looked at me sadly, her eyes searching me like two tiny headlights.&quot; Which brings me to another complaint: Every girl uses the cheesiest metaphors, and none have a distinctive voice--each story sounds like it's being told by the same girl. If I hadn't gotten these first three for 1/2 off, I'd be mad at the waste of money. But I guess they were worthy of 1 star and $2.00 each for keeping me mildly amused for a few hours... I will buy cat and the reunion novels but only when they too are 1/2 off or in the used bookstores. I agree with the person who said these last 2 series have been an insult to VC Andrews' name and writing!"},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"V.C ANDREW'S ghostwriter doesn't do it like i'm used to. But the storyline and the suspense kept me interested. I have JADE. Star's busy challenging Jade, as I would, in her place.

Short and all."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Star is boring thats the only word for it.I really do wish they would write the older type of books. Like Flowers in the attic is the best book ever. But then it goes downhill. I think the ghostwriter would make more money if he would stop trying to target new readers and stick with the older ones."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"I am such a fan of V.C. Andrews. I, like many other readers, have every book shes written (and the ghost writer). These books are so small and thin, compared to Flowers in The Attic and the other books i have with V.C. Andrews name on them. It takes no time at all to read these, i would recomend this book to someone in maybe 6th grade. Please go back to some of the older styles, like the Logan series or anything. These past 2 series just werent worth buying, i read them, but i wont read them over and over like i do her other books. Please change before you loose other avid readers of her books."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"I have every book written by VC Andrews and all the ones written by the ghostwriter. I must say that I am not impressed with the Orphans &amp; Wildflowers miniseries. I think they are sort of an insult to VC Andrews' name. While I enjoyed the books in these miniseries, I could also anticipate what would happen in the book. No shocks or suprises, like her early works. Bring back the psychological horror, and the shocking suprises, the way VC Andrews would write!!"},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"I have always been a V. C. Andrews fan. My mother bought me my first. I can not believe that anyone (or thing) would put down one of her books. I enjoy these mini-novels because I am left wondering what's next!

It will leave more in the stores for those of us who do like them!"},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"This book was really unsatisfying. I thought that the Orphans series was bad, but this is truly an embarassment. I miss the old thicker books. These books are like pre-teen drivel! I thought I'd never say this, but the series has forced me to never buy another VC Andrews book again. I just don't want to be disappointed anymore. It's too hard on my pocketbook."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Ok so once again it took me about an hour or two to read this book. All I can say is I'm not impressed. This book was 10 times more interesting than MISTY, which isn't saying much. These mini-series lack the shock and drama of a real Andrews book. I can't say enough how disappointed I am. I thought the Orphan series was bad but the Wildflowers are terrible! I have found nothing yet in either series that would make me gasp or swear to my husband that I'll put the book down when I read one more chapter. If not for the name V.C. Andrews on the cover I wouldn't look at it twice. I have better ideas than this ghostwriter! Maybe I should write a book..because I know what the readers want. As horrible as it may sound we want the rape and incest and anything that may make our hearts stop."},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"This book is much like the last bunch. Good but not very filling. These books should be longer. Why can't we have these and some nice long fun ones at the same time . It's not like V.C. is writing these herself anyway. Another writer doing the &quot;traditional&quot; type would be just as good as the let down you get from these short ones. You just get into it and boom! it's over. Still better than nothing. I know that I would be happy to have twice as much of this to read. I can always get more shelves"},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"Star, the second book in the Wildflowers is fantastic!!!!!! Star FINALLY gets to tell her story, of hope,heartbreak,shame, and the wish of a perfect family. She tells of a deadbeat father, and a drunken mother, parents far different from the other girls.

I can't wait to read Jade!!!!"},{"Title":"Star (Wildflowers)","review":"I enjoy reading V.C.

I will continue to buy books by V. C.

Please Mr. Neiderman, don't disgrace V. C. Andrews name and lagacy with another miniseries after this awful second one. Write books like the first three series of ghost written books, not R. L. Stine clones. If the horror and rage cannot be done again like in the books that SHE wrote, then at least return to the drama that was in the landry, cutler and logan series, I swear, these two miniseries are some of the worst books that i'm sort of emabarassed to have in my collection, but they have V.

Andrews."},{"Title":"Narrative: A Critical Linguistic Introduction (Interface)","review":"I had the privilege of attending a one year seminar on Narrative Analysis by Professor Michael Toolan, and compared with that lively and exciting experience, the book he wrote more than ten years before seems to lack something. It seems a bit on the dry side, but that's besides the point: You are probably not going to pick up a linguistic introduction to narrative for entertainment anyway.The book covers basic story structure (in search of a grammar of plot), time (order, duration, summary and scene - i.e. telling and showing, frequency), character, setting, focalization, free indirect discourse, sociolinguistics and more. You have to keep in mind that the approach here is linguistic.The book does not specifically deal with film narratives - if you want to focus on that, I recommend reading Seymour Chatman's &quot;Story and Discourse&quot; or Bordwell and Thompson's &quot;Film Art: An Introduction&quot;. However, even then, you might find the concepts summarized in this book helpful.On the whole, this is a very useful introduction, though it may be tough going in places. Other books you may find useful are &quot;Narratology - an introduction&quot; and &quot;Narrative Fiction&quot;."},{"Title":"Narrative: A Critical Linguistic Introduction (Interface)","review":"Toolan gives us a complete theoretical toolbox that, indeed, contains some sharp tools with which to analyze literary narratives. It's a good introduction, and as is mentioned early on, it's both linguistic and critical. The critical aspect is the book's strength: the author neatly summarizes past research (ranging quite broadly) and argues within the linguistic field in order to set up his own complex position on each aspect of narratology. The reader leaves with a sense of depth and sophistication - Genette, Bal, Halliday are all given due treatment. In particular, the treatment of Genette is so skillfully done that readers of the French critic may well find themselves reaching, instead, for Toolan in the future."},{"Title":"Out From Nassau","review":"I loved &quot;Out From Nassau&quot;! Fia Scheyer is a wonderful writer and did a marvelous job of creating and developing her characters.

It is very readable. It is indeed a pleasure to find such a fine book.Rufus Broadaway"},{"Title":"Out From Nassau","review":"The story and atmosphere of the book are compelling. The production values, however, are appalling and distracting. Was there no editor available who knows English? If they manage to do a second printing, for the sake of future readers, I hope they can afford to properly edit the text.Even with the obvious mistakes, the story itself makes reading the book worthwhile."},{"Title":"Out From Nassau","review":"Fia Scheyer's book, &quot;Out From Nassau&quot;, really captures the feel, sounds and smells of the Bahamas. Written with unusual sensitivity for the indigenous population, the book drives home the importance of human relationships. Ms. Scheyer's knowledge of the local seas as well as the local people, comes through on literally every page. And her weaving of this tale makes it amply clear what human values should be as Hannah makes her tough life choices.

As usual, Jim doesn't disappoint me with Garfield's antics. Poor Jon and Odie are Garfield's usual targets, and spiders too. I love the moments in the book when Garfield is busy squishing spiders. Those have become some of the funniest moments for Garfield. And I was laughing pretty hard when Jon hits his thumb with the hammer and he yells out &quot;mommy!&quot; and tries to retract that statement by saying &quot;ouch!&quot; but Garfield replies with &quot;too late&quot;. Another favorite moment is when Garfield and Jon tries to outdo each other by eating the hottest peppers there are. Classic Garfield. And as usual, Jon has trouble getting a date or one that can fit through the doorway of his house. I may be 27 years old but I will never outgrow Garfield. This is one cool cat that should never change."},{"Title":"Garfield Gets Cookin': His 38th Book","review":"This book is awesome, as usual.

Then Garfield says, \\"And that would be the stamp cut\\", and smiles. However, another favorite of mine in this book is when Jon gets a paper cut on his tongue and Garfield offers a potato chip. You know what happens then, Jon says, \\"NYAH GAH NYAH NYAH GAAAAH GAH GAH NYAH\\" (or something like that) because Garfield remembers how to make \\"Fun with salt\\".

Disturbed by the idea of \\"time\\" since his youth in Denmark, in his new book, Holtz tells why. I found the book interesting, informative, a keen addition to the series Holtz first announced in August, 2004. Holtz said then, \\"I would write a miracle.\\" I believe he has kept his promise. The Flint Hills project was completed in Kansas in 1973. The writing effort describing Holtz's collection of work in Kansas, was declared \\"finished\\" by the architect in 2006. By then, Flint Hills was a ruin, described by Holtz as: \\"...an American Stonehenge. It is rare Holtz \\"finishes\\" anything. He is presently involved with the Transit Authority of Mexico City, building and painting bus stops. But, it seems he long pursues a criticism of time and clock-watching. Published by Banter-Boy, San Francisco, Holtz latest book has a bright red cover but no lettering anywhere on the outside. This in keeping with Holtz's anti-classical, anti-Western, dadaist approach to creativity. Holtz is a vehement non-contradictory dadaist, working in the tradition of Walt Whitman. Consisting of 24 outbuildings and a \\"big\\" house, a \\"little\\" house, and a \\"sweeping\\" house, Flint Hills is located near the prairie town of Sonborough, Kansas (once a rail-head for Texas cattlemen driving heards of longhorn north). I await earnestly to read Holtz on architecture and his own short career as a builder. The Mexican bus stops may be particularly interesting. I am especially excited about his descriptions of \\"Bottle House\\" at Wimberley, Texas. But, for now, the dada \\"Flint Hills\\" will have to do. This is a good read for anyone interested in the struggle and strange history-biography of this little-known heavily-bearded and dirty man and his personal conflict with what he dubs--\\"anyone's irrational belief in 'time'.\\""},{"Title":"How to Win Customers and Keep them for Life AUDIO CASSETTES","review":"I initially read this book almost ten years ago, I was impressed then.

Spaceships are used only to travel within a solar system, e.g. between planets and the point in an inhabited system where the quadrail station is located.The quadrail was built 600 years ago and has been operated since then by a mysterious race nicknamed the \\"Spiders\\" who are part organic and part machine. Until now they have always tried to stand aloof from politics between other races. Apart from the spiders, there are twelve other intelligent races recognised as major powers by virtue of having at least five inhabited systems: the human United Nations, with exactly five worlds, is one of the least significant of these twelve powers.The story is told in the first person by Frank Compton, who used to be a top investigator for \\"Western Alliance\\" intelligence until he was fired for blowing the whistle on the bogus reports which had been used to justify the colonisation of Yandro, earth's fourth colony and hence the one which got UN officials the status of being a recognised empire.Frank has just emerged from a meeting at which he was offered a new job, when he is accosted by a young man who has just enough remaining strength to utter Frank's name before dropping dead with multiple bullet wounds. The message which the man has given his life to deliver brings Frank to the Spiders, who want him to investigate a threat to both the Quadrail and the Galaxy. They tell him that someone, they don't know who, appears to have found a way to smuggle warships through the Quadrail and is preparing to launch a war.Frank and his assigned partner, Bayta, who appears to be a human female but is very strange, begin to investigate. They soon begin to discover evidence of a vast and dangerous conspiracy which appears to threaten the entire galaxy - but is it the same as the one the Spiders warned about? And does Frank have a conflict of interest?Frank and Bayta are soon enmeshed in a complex web of intrigue in which nobody and nothing, including Frank and Bayta themselves, is quite what they seem.I had a little difficulty suspending disbelief in one or two of the ideas in this book - for example, how a railway network between the stars could be flexible enough to cope with the fact that stars move,and that the transfer stations would either have to orbit those stars or tend to fall into them. Once I'd got past that point and into the story I found it an entertaining and interesting read.Most of the other plot ideas are not as original as the idea of an intragalactic railway, although they way they are put together is unusual. I didn't feel the charactisation was as good as this author usually manages.Overall \\"Night Train to Rigel\\" is not up to the same level of brilliance as the best of Zahn's recent work such as \\"Warhorse\\", \\"Deadman Switch\\", or \\"The Icarus Hunt.\\" However, I thought it had a lot more going for it than some of the strongly negative reviews here make out, and I did enjoy reading it.UPDATE OCTOBER 2008\\"Night Train To Rigel\\" has been followed by a number of sequels and there are now four published or expected books in the \\"Quadrail\\" series, which are:1) \\"Night Train to Rigel\\"2) \\"The Third Lynx\\"3) \\"Odd Girl Out\\" and4) \\"The Domino Murders.\\""},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I have read and enjoyed some of Timothy Zahn's other works. So I thought I'd give this most recent book a look, but I was never really engaged. I found the early setup interesting, but as the book moved along, I never really found myself taking much interest in the characters or the plot.The main character is Frank Compton, an ex-government agent for a futuristic Earth. He receives instructions from a messenger (murdered just after he delivers his message) to claim a ticket to ride a transit system called the \\"Quadrail.\\" This amazing transportation system can transport people to various star-systems in days, but nobody except its operators understands just how it works. Mr. Compton is soon asked to participate in a mission that could determine the fate of the galaxy and assigned a partner, the mysterious Bayta.This book has its fair number of twists and some decent action as well. The problem was, I never really felt myself feeling interested in what did or didn't happen with the various characters, or even with the plot in general. Zahn just doesn't seem to concentrate on the right aspects here to really capture the interests of the reader. It's almost as if he's \\"phoning it in.\\" Sure, I enjoy a nice, light read sometimes, but I do like to feel like I can actually take an interest in the affairs of the characters."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"I've followed Zahn for a while, and given good reviews to a substantial number of his other books, because I enjoy them and they seem not to get much recognition on amazon.com. I've said often how I buy each one as soon as it comes out, knowing I'll get a fairly formulaic but also extremely exciting romp with some very clever plot twists.Well, outside of \\"formulaic\\", none of that describes this one. It seems like Zahn took the first half of The Icarus Hunt, perhaps my favorite of his, and removed all trace of humor and cleverness, then replaced the second half with something cliched and constantly, irritatingly predictable. Truly - the setup is EXACTLY the same, from the narrator having a shady job that the reader is not told, to a powerful and mysterious alien race controlling all of the transportation in the galaxy, to the main character recieving a job that is clearly more than it appears from someone with a hidden agenda, etc, etc. It does eventually go somewhere different from Icarus, but not somewhere good - instead, we're treated to a series of staggeringly easy to predict plot twists, resulting in a climax that, while somewhat enjoyable, is nowhere near Zahn's usual standards.Also, the Big Secret hanging over the story - what the narrator's original occupation was (this is constantly referenced in little side-comments, like \\"Serving two masters is indeed possible, so I decided to take the second job\\" and \\"I was actually making progress on my original job, too, in a twisted way\\") - turns out to be nothing more than, essentially, a punchline, revealed on the last page (though I'd figured it out well before). Compared to Icarus Hunt, where this same setup produced the greatest final plot twist I've ever seen...well, calling it \\"disappointing\\" is extremely mild.Zahn is a fantastic adventure sci-fi author. I highly reccomend Icarus Hunt or Angelmass or Warhorse, or the Conquerors Trilogy. Do not spend money on this book."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"Night Train to Rigel (2005) is the first SF novel in the Quadrail series. It is set a few decades in the future after Earth has been admitted into the Galactic community through the Quadrail system. The station costs a trillion dollars to construct outside Jupiter's orbit, but it then provides access to many destinations throughout the galaxy.The Quadrail system is run by the Spiders, an arachnid-like species. The trains travel through tubes that connect to stations in other solar systems. The four-railed tracks are built around iridescent Corelines running down the center of each tube.In this novel, Frank Compton is a former agent of Western Alliance Intelligence. He was fired for blowing the whistle on the Yandro scam. Several scapegoats in the UN were publicly terminated from their jobs over the scandal, but Comptom was also canned six months later.Bayta is a mysterious woman who serves as Compton's guide and liaison with the Spiders. She communicates with the Spiders through a form of telepathy. Bayta obviously knows various secrets, but is more closed-mouthed than Compton himself.Korak Fayr is a Belldic commando officer. He and his men have apparently gone renegade, picking their own missions. Compton has a few encounters with Fayr before learning his status among his superiors as a loose cannon.In this story, Compton has found another job and makes the final arrangements with his new boss. Upon leaving the hotel, however, he finds a person waiting for him on the street. He says a few things to Compton and then falls over dead. The boy has multiple wounds that should have put him to sleep or killed him much sooner. Compton finds only two items on his person: a Quadrail ticket to Yandro in Compton's name and a cash stick.Since Compton was thinking of leaving Earth in the next few days, he just accelerates his departure. He catches the next flight to the Quadrail station. Along the way, he notices a young woman following the same route.Once he reaches the train, he finds his seat in the last passenger car. Actually, it has a single file of seats down the center with freight on both sides. It currently holds only six other passengers besides himself. As he starts reviewing his information sheets, Compton falls to sleep.Upon awaking, Compton finds himself to be the only passenger in the car. Then Bayta introduces herself and informs him that he is on the way to a meeting arranged by the Spiders. At their destination, Compton is briefed on a situation that the Spiders would like him to investigate.Compton is presented with an unlimited Quadrail pass, but is also forced to accept Bayta as his companion. Her ability to communicate with the Spiders convinces Compton to drop his objections. Then they are returned to their train. Compton is moved to a compartment next to Bayta's quarters.Strange things begin to happen during their journey. First, two drunk Halkas (who are not really drunk) knock on his door. Then the same Halkas break into a lockbox, steal a knife, and attack Compton.A Bellco drunk becomes friendly with Compton. Later the Bellco and his companions knock Compton unconscious and stuff him in a bundle of spices. Eventually Compton learns that the Bellco is Fayr.This tale leads Compton from one confusing incident to another. He begins to realize that he is being used as a diversion. Compton becomes very angry with Bayta on several occasions, but decides to continue his role despite her withholding information from him. Apparently he has no need to know.Despite his ignorance of the reason for their actions, Compton makes his own decisions. Bayta gets exasperated with him, but she follows his agenda. Eventually, Compton contributes more than the Spiders ever expected due to his Intelligence experience.This story combines high tech with classic cinema scenarios. Several Hitchcock movies are mentioned within the tale. The next installment isThe Third Lynx. Enjoy!Highly recommended for Zahn fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of innovative space transport, unexpected villains, and competent intelligence agents. Anyone who has not previously read books by this author might want to start withThe Blackcollar, his first novel.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"NIGHT TRAIN TO RIGEL(2005) is a fast read at 350 hardcover pages, and is generally quite fun. However, the interstellar train travel scenario is concocted at best, and absurd on introspection - which gives a unbelievable background to the whole book.The aliens are actually somewhat interesting, and the rest of the story is fairly intriguing and believable - but the whole thing just doesn't hold together well because of the forced early 20th Century style train travel backdrop.Having said all that, I think this book would serve well to teenagers first getting into interstellar SciFi. I would have really liked this book in Jr. High School. The problem is, this book is not being sold as a \\"juvenile\\", which it really is. I give NIGHT TRAIN TO RIGEL 2 1/2 stars.NOTE: It is worth mentioning that the heroine in this book goes by the same unusual name (Bayta) as the heroine in Isaac Asimov's FOUNDATION AND EMPIRE(1952), which was the best book in the classic FOUNDATION TRILOGY; this was somewhat bothersome to me, as an aficianado of Asimov, but might not be to others. I suppose it is also worth mentioning that Asimov was the first SciFi writer to successfully put out a good SciFi mystery - THE CAVES OF STEEL(1954); which is still my favorite SciFi book, after having read over 300. As NIGHT TRAIN TO RIGEL is another attempt at SciFi mystery, perhaps this was Zahn's way of subtlely giving credit to Asimov."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"This is sort of a companion piece to The Icarus Hunt (by the same author). That book was a wonderful homage to Alistair MacLean, working all of MacLean's conventions into a classic MacLean thriller plot. But Night Train To Rigel is a bit different.There are multiple direct references to Hitchcock films (both explicit and otherwise). Much of the novel also has a generic Film Noir detective/horror story feel to it. But it still has a lot of the MacLean signatures as well.The plot is not quite as tight as The Icarus Hunt, and the initial misdirection is so big that it almost feels like two books grafted together once the real plot conflict is finally raised.The classic Pullman train setup is a wonderful image (sleeper cars and third class baggage cars to the stars at one light year per minute on a railroad through tubes connecting solar systems). But in the end it eventually comes off as something of a gimmick, used to justify all the conventions of the genre (like having to travel along the top of the train in order to reach a runaway engine).All in all, a good book if you know the background references that Zahn is playing with. As a pure standalone, though, I can understand the reviewers who thought the plot was overly complicated and overly driven by coincidences and deception. However, the same could also be said of many of the classic Hitchcock films which this book is trying to reference."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"I am an avid Timothy Zahn fan, he is an awesome writer who really knows how to develop an interesting tale. And what an imagination. But this book is pretty bad. It's the only book I've read of his that I actually think is bad. The character decisions are not too believable. There are some interesting aspects of the universe he tells about, such as the space trains. However, there isn't much told about those, and they don't really have anything to do with the story. The big mystery is regular Zahn kind of WOW how did you think of that, but all in all, this book is pretty bad. The dialogue is bad, characters are bad, believable factor is bad, and this really doesn't feel like Timothy Zahn's writing. Maybe he just had this idea and wanted to write it. I'm sure he has no problem getting published at this point. From any other author, this book would just be a failing statistic. I only gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it's Zahn. But this book was not good, it didn't hold my attention, and in the end it was a disappointment.I want to say again that Timothy Zahn is a great author, my favorite author who is still writing. Some excellent, highly recommended books are: Manta's Gift, Conquerors' Pride (first book of a great trilogy) and Heir to the Empire (even if you are NOT a Star Wars fan, this is the first book in a series that stands on its own).Zahn also has many great books that are out of print but available used, such as Spinneret, Warhorse, Deadman Switch, Triplet, and A Coming of Age. These are all excellent. Zahn truly has a unique imagination."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"Timothy Zahn is one of our most reliable producers of traditional action-adventure SF. His latest adult novel is Night Train to Rigel. Earth is the twelfth of the Twelve Empires: twelve alien races linked by an explicitly train-like interstellar travel system. The system is run by the Spiders, inscrutable aliens who do not allow details of their FTL method to be understood by anyone. But they do allow races access to this transportation network -- for a price. And those races who have colonized enough planets become part of the \\"N Empires.\\"At first blush this setup seems transparently an excuse to use a silly title like Night Train to Rigel. But so be it -- there have been worse backgrounds for good SF stories! The hero is Frank Compton, a former agent for Earth's intelligence service who was cashiered for his public criticism of the expensive plans to colonize the last planetary system required to make Earth an \\"Empire\\" in the Spiders' eyes. As the story opens he is accosted by a murdered man, and offered a ticket to Yandro, Earth's controversial colony in the Rigel system. He accepts seemingly on impulse -- though we learn that he has accepted another job, its nature not revealed until much later.Once onboard the train, Frank is quickly apprised of the nature of the commission implied by his acceptance of the ticket. It seems the Spiders are concerned about a potential future war among the Twelve Empires: a war that they had hoped to prevent by their strict policy against taking weapons on the trains. Frank acquires a mysterious human companion, a young woman named Bayta who can telepathically communicate with the Spiders.Frank and Bayta begin a journey along the interstellar railways, looking for the unidentified warmongers the Spiders want to find. Frank quickly realizes they are the objects of interest of a variety of entities, including an alien Frank had known on his previous job, and also his former boss, a man whom he has cause to hate. They survive attempts on their life, and attempts to frame them for murder, and they seem to be herded towards the Sistarrko system, which includes a resort on one of a pair of gas giant moons, a moon which is home to the extremely popular Modhri coral. And there, of course, (this being the kind of novel it is) they learn secrets affecting the future of the Galaxy... and they are in the position to affect said future.I must say that for the first half of the book or so I was annoyed. Zahn seemed to be driving his plot by a series of absurd coincidences and unlikely actions. But to be fair, he is aware of all this, and by the end of the book things are explained in a satisfying manner. The central idea of the book, and the eventually revealed good guys and (especially) Bad Guy, aren't terribly new ideas, but they are fairly well handled in this context. The book is pretty enjoyable, though the opening sections do drag a bit. As I suggested, Zahn redeems some of the weaknesses of the beginning by the end, and I ended up a pleased, but not really thrilled, customer."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"I enjoyed this space opera, from beginning to end and never put it down for long. It's a fluffy story, sure enough, but the way Zahn structured it, I kept reading to find out what the latest twist was all about. I love the idea of a train to the stars---which is very H.G. Wells, but also hangs together on a point of theoretical physics---down to the connecting vestibules between the cars which I could easily visualize, coming as I do from a time when American passenger trains were more common than today. Perhaps because I'd never read any other Zahn adventure, I wasn't plagued by the comparison some other reviewers can't seem to help but make with his other books, which I will now go on to read, starting with the more popularThe Icarus Hunt."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"I rate Sci-fi by the ingenuity of the writer's mode of space travel and type of space drive. Five stars given just for this story's unique mode of space travel.And I give 5 stars for a very clever plot line with many twists and turns. Great character creation! I ordered all the stories of this series because they're just a great fun read. This is the first of the series."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"This has got to be the oddest idea I have ever come across. Especially because it was written so seriously... as if Zahn were having a hard time deciding to write this for the hard boiled mystery thriller genre, or sci-fi.A few years ago, I read \\"Icarus Hunt\\" and thought it was maybe the best campy sci fi book I have read since I polished off Heinlein as a kid. I have tried several other books of his, and have never been able to finish any of them before this one. And \\"Night Train to Rigel\\" is one weird ride.This book has a lot of formulaic plotting you would typically find in an early MGM noir flick with Bogart or Mitchum. Most of the story takes place on an interstellar 'train'. Yes, train. The civilizations of the galaxy connect with one another through a series of train links. The train is reached at the edges of solar systems, and then you can travel anywhere you wish from there to anywhere via this train in a tunnel that goes faster than light speed.On board is an unusual human character \\"Frank Compton\\" who guides the story along. Similar to Han Solo or someone of that ilk. The trains are run by a species known as the 'spiders'. From what I can tell they have metalic skin and are an 'aspect' of a different civilization. They communicate telepathically and are non violent to the core. They hold the races of the galaxy apart and together, a forced co-existence that seems to work pretty well.The humans are the new kids on the block. I think they have been aware of the train for about 100 years at this point. They are the smallest and least significant interstellar players. their are a few other major characters here such as 'Bayta', human though works for the spiders, but this is primarily a one person story.The story was good enough for me to buy the sequel. I think that if you like cheesy sci fi, you will enjoy this one. Very well written for what it is. Set in a future galaxy in which interstellar travel takes place via the \\"Quadrail\\" which is a giant network of faster-than-light trains - yes, trains - running between solar systems. Spaceships are used only to travel within a solar system, e.g. between planets and the point in an inhabited system where the quadrail station is located."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"It is a pretty good read, but it ends rather abruptly leaving many questions unaswered, that is until you read the other books in the series that aren't mentioned anywhere on the cover."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"A lot of times I read a Timothy Zahn book in a matter of days. With this book it took me a few weeks. It just kind of drags along. Frank Compton is a kind of a fed up ex-operative who is definitely the best character in the story. Some of the people in it are really wooden. That is explained when we find out what's really going on. But Zahn takes too long to get there. The last 100 pages are entertaining, but I had to work hard to get to it. Don't be deceived by the title either. They never make it to Rigel. If you've never read any Zahn, I'd recommend you start with something likeThe Cobra TrilogyorManta's Gift"},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"I just finished this book, which I enjoyed very much. I am astounded to see all the poor reviews. I can't imagine they all read the same book.This is the first book by Zahn that I have read, so I have nothing else to compare it to, or to feel that part of this book is a repeat of any of his other books. I also was not expecting anything heavy or mind blowing. This story is obviously a fun romp melding mystery-on-a-train, space opera, military SF with a bit of noir for flavor. It was a fabulous page turner.The story was quite gripping, with many twists and turns. There was just enough foreshadowing to alert the reader to things not being what they seem, without giving it away. There were layers upon layers of mystery, and good tension between the two main characters.The mystery on a train, was the setting that ran through the whole story. It was well done, not only as transportation from one local to another, but as hideout, and setting of some parts of the adventures. The main characters, humans, meet and interact with many alien species on the train.Besides the main mystery that sets the story in motion, there is the mystery of the Spiders, the Quadrail itself, and what and who the two main characters are, and what other secret aims they are trying to achieve.The Space Opera portion is the many alien species, and the sprawling galactic civilization that connects them all. We meet many aliens, and learn a bit about them as people and about their species. The civilization and how it all works is often discussed, but there are hints of other explanations. Zahn works all the details in without using an infodump, and makes an interesting tapestry.There is also a bit of military SF with commandos and battles, along with the noir. The action moves the story along without overpowering it as some are wont to do.It reminds me of some of CJ Cherryh's early stuff. The writing is good, the story interesting, and the characters are strong. The ending was satisfying, and wrapped the story up, but I would like to see this as the start of a series."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"I've read a lot of space opera, some good, some merely OK. I think I have a feel for what works and what doesn't. With this book, its the pacing that absolutely kills any shred of enjoyment I may have had. Setting is OK, Alien races are marginally interesting, even the overall plotline is semi-inventive....but the pacing....pages and pages, even whole chapters, of characters explaining to each other what happened, what they think will happen, or what may have happened. Blah blah blah...I kept hoping something would happen...anything. Nope. All leading up to an extremely underwhelming climax. Asher and Banks have more action and excitement in an average chapter than what's to be found here. If you're reading this, trust me...skip it."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"This book is not meant to be thought-provoking; its characters are not meant to be great thinkers nor are they meant to overly developed; it is not written to become the next Great American Novel. No - it is meant to be a fun romp, an homage to the spy flicks that it constantly references. The old spy flicks of the 60s-80s (even some of the newer ones) don't give us great characters, deep thinking or plot developments - they give us action, conspiracies, villains - and nifty gadgets. And, in keeping with the science fiction aspect of this book - weird aliens. Read it for what it is - brain candy. And enjoy it for that. I won't go into plot details - other reviewers have done that. But if you are a fan of campy spy movies, sci fi kitsch or b-movies, I think you'll find this book to be a lot of fun.And, of course, go out and buy Timothy Zahn's many other fabulous books, which DO give you wonderful characters and plots - he has several that I have read and enjoyed just as much. This is a multi-faceted, very talented author. For those who are disappointed in this book - well, go and try a few of his Star Wars books - I guarantee, even if you aren't a fan of Star Wars, you WON'T be disappointed. They are marvelous!"},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"I've read at least 6 books by Zahn. All great. But I couldn't finish this one.

The alien Spiders assign the courageous Frank to stop a pending war on Yandro. Accompanied by the female human Bayta, a Spider mole, Frank rides the hops to the Quadrail galactic transit system from earth to Yandro.In Jurian space, the Halkas attack Frank and Bayta, but they escape only to learn that the enigmatic Modhra have caused the crisis at Yandro. Meanwhile Bellido insurgents want to destroy the intelligent coral on Modhran. As Frank struggles to figure out who is the enemy, Bayta warns him to avoid contact with the insidious coral while others recommend otherwise if he wants to learn first hand the truth why the coral is the center of a potential galaxy-wide war.Though there are too many twists young adult readers will enjoy this solid science fiction thriller because of the ethical hero's dilemma of sorting the enemy from friend as everyone even Bayta seems like they want to harm him. The action-packed story line has Frank and Bayta jumping from one escapade to another; so fans will have no time for a deep breath. Though the hazards are overdone to hide friend from foe, fans will enjoy this fine caper of one caring person ready to battle the universe to save the innocent though he does not know from whatHarriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"I thought the concept of this novel was interesting, which was why I bought it and took it home. I should have left it at the bookstore. While I don't mind the occasional Manly-man main character and his doormat token female story, it's got to be a well told and well written story with characters that are somewhat engaging. Barring good characters, the universe and the people who populate it have to be exceptional. Again, that didn't happen in this book. I felt like this books was a poor rip off of a pulpy detective novel with none of the intrigue. The alien races all blended into one another to the point I couldn't keep lizards, chipmunks, and bulldogs straight. Evil coral like the brain slugs from Futurama is an out there concept, but write it so it doesn't put me to sleep. Needless to say, I will not be seeking out and reading any of the sequels to this book."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"Despite the saying about not judging a book by it's cover, I'm as visual a creature as the next person, and I almost didnt borrow this book at the library when I couldn't find another book on the shelves.

A quick search of the man's pocket turns up a space-train ticket with Compton's name on it, a few bucks, and nothing by way of identification. Compton had been planning a move anyway, but with the police breathing down his neck for the unexplained death, heading off-planet seems like an even better idea. Once on the train, Compton finds himself drafted back into the spy-game. Assigned Bayta (an apparent human who can somehow communicate with the 'spiders' who run the space-train system), as an aide and minder, Compton is told a story about a vision, space-war, and the coming destruction of the system that keeps the civilized species at peace.With nothing to go on but a strange vision, Compton presses ahead--aware that by publically drafting him, the spiders have set him up as a fall-guy. Help and opposition are quick in coming and Compton and Bayta are hustled off to a resort planet where Compton can work his cover job, but also try to discover the real mystery--because someone is definitely trying to do something, even if the spiders' original story doesn't quite hold together.Author Timothy Zahn combines space opera, spy-thriller, and a bit of Hitchcockian train drama in an intriguing story of space. The eventual enemy might have come out of a Flash Gordon episode, and some of Compton's adventures are way over the top, but Zahn's engaging writing kept me going. On slight problem--perhaps to preserve Compton's secret, we didn't really get a feel for what made the ex-spy tick, which reduced my interest in his eventual success or failure.NIGHT TRAIN TO RIGEL falls a bit short of its potential, but it's still an enjoyable adventure."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"I found this book based on the SCI FI ESSENTIAL BOOK tag, as well as having read the Heir To The Empire trilogy numerous times.Alas, I found this book to be plodding, inconsistent, and just plain boring.

I think it failed at this.I admit that I have not read much of his non-Star Wars material; maybe I had to lofty expectations for Zahn. Whichever, I can still fall back and appreciate that man purely on his past work."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"Interesting start to the series.

The night he agrees to work for private enterprise, a body drops a train ticket at his feet. Apparently unfamiliar with the adage regarding curiosity, Frank Compton embarks on a galactic wide adventure.Frank's background is a bit sketchy. He appears to have been some type of agent which explains his many skills. Zahn does his normal good job of creating a reasonable scenario (reasonable based on my love of scifi perhaps) and crafting a wealth of unique alien characters.The plot moved well and there was plenty of action. It was a good story and I look forward to the next book in the five book series.I recommend it."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"Average work from a great writer. Pace was not fast. Really should read earlier books in the series first. But not bad and has interesting aliens and premise."},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"Part of a trilogy. This is a good one to read first. Yet another fantastic sci-fi trilogy by Timothy Zahn. I know that he gets a lot of attention for some of the Star Wars books that he wrote, however, don't neglect the rest of his works. It only gets better, and, how could someone go wrong with an imagination like that. I will probably continue to buy most of the books written by Timothy Zahn. Sci-fi with a heart!"},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"Zahn's Quadrail system reminded me of Williamson and Gunn's \\"Star Bridge\\", in which mysterious Tubes of energy linked planets together. The authors tried to finesse the problem of the Tubes' getting entangled as the stars moved by having the planet Eron, which was the terminus of all Tubes, sport Tube ends floating on mercury layers so that they could independently move around.In Zahn's vision, it appears that his Tubes are made of actual material rather than energy. So I became curious as to how much material it would actually take to build the Tube walls. I assumed that the inner radius of each Tube was 25 meters, and the wall thickness 10 cm. Given that, each light-year of Tube requires approximately 1.5 x 10E17 cubic meters of material. Given that the volume of Earth is 1.08E21 cubic meters, that implies that disassembling an Earth-sized planet would yield enough material for 7,280 light-years of Tube. Now this doesn't deal with masses or composition, only volume, nor required material for rails, propulsion systems, etc. Still I was surprised at the relatively modest requirements. Presumably a technology capable of building a train that can travel at 1 LY / min wouldn't balk at disassembling a few hundred Earth-sized planets to build their railway to the stars!"},{"Title":"Night Train to Rigel","review":"My first thought as I began reading this book was that it reminded me of an Eric Ambler story with a little Ian Fleming thrown in. It was thoroughly enjoyable. Frank Compton is a likable character and his near-miss adventures on his ride on the Quadrail, a transportation system connecting the world of the galaxy, are page-turners.Newly-dismissed from his job as an agent for Western Alliance for being a whistleblower, Compton is ready to begin an assignment for a private employer when a man stops him on the street, hands him a ticket for the Quadrail and drops dead at his feet. If that isn't an invitation to find out who did it and why they want him on that train, then Compton hasn't a curiosity-laden bone in his body. Fortunately, he does, so, putting his new boss' job on the backburner, he sets out.Soon he's beset by sinister characters who want to keep him from his destination, though he isn't certain what that is. His companion Bayta, an agent of the Spiders, the builders and operators of the Quadrail--and propertedly Compton's employers in this venture--is little help, remaining stone-faced throughout. Chance meetings--or are they?--with old friends/acquaintances/enemies, also abound, until Bayta and Compton reach their destination and discover who--or what--the villain really is. Immediately it's back to the beginning, with old enemies now becoming new allies, and new one allies becoming enemies, until no one is certain who to trust and who not, and Compton's two employers seemingly both involved.Night Train to Rigel is fast-paced and entertaining. The setting may be futuristic but with its characters and its themes of greed, political intrigue, and double-dealing, it could just as easily have been set in pre-WWII Europe, some time during the Cold War, or in a contemporary setting. Having read only one other Timothy Zahn book, one of his Young Adult series, I wasn't certain what to expect, but I got much more than I bargained for. This is a very enjoyable story. I liked Compton's character, especially his references to old twentieth-century suspense movies. Bayta tool a little longer to warm to but by the end of the book, she was also a character I wanted to know more about. Hopefully, in future books, I'll get that chance."},{"Title":"My Freight Train","review":"My Freight Train is the story of a little boy who imagines he is the engineer of a modern day freight train.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Thank goodness, it's an improvement on the last one! I enjoyed it. RJ gets mired down in details in the first half or so, but the second part picks up (thanks mostly to Mat, naturally, but Rand also takes care of some big business). Still, some tension and excitement has been lost. The pacing isn't quite what it used to be; events seem to happen, in a sort of dry outline format, and then it's on to the next character. There's little thought about events or what it means for character development. Near the end, something happens to Rand that supposedly makes him even more a tough guy, but it's not really clear _what_ that was, since RJ never tells us. Perhaps we'll find out in book 20 when we've already forgotten about the whole incident! Many things happen that are not really explained; perhaps RJ avoids explaining them, lest he get pinned down to details, at the hazard of losing his ability to slop 'em all over the place.Which brings up another problem: there are so many characters, and so many past events, and so many plotlines, that RJ could come up with whatever he wants at this point and I would be like, &quot;OK,&quot; simply because I can't remember all the things that have happened. For example, there is a character named Alivia who suddenly takes on great importance in book 9. I can't remember her at all from previous books. She simply wasn't memorable. He should stick to a handful of key characters and leave it at that. More precisely, he should concentrate on Rand, Mat, Perrin, Thom, Lan, some bad guys, and cut down the women's page time by half. They just fume and smooth skirts all the time, it's really tiresome. He tries to make the women so strong they make the men look wimpy, and in the process they become ridiculous. They still squabble like middle school girls. I'm all for gender equality, but these women are no longer interesting whatsoever. There is also some marital stuff that is simply weird/outlandish, unneeded, and dumb.That said, I liked the book. Perrin didn't get as much play as I would have liked (he needs to chill about Faile, too, and stop feeling sorry for himself), but Rand is more approachable. Mat had a decent share of chapters, although he could have seen more action. Some of the stuff is rather predictable, but there's excitement when he's around. All in all, a book worth reading. It's not quite the fulfillment of earlier books' promise, but at least it's moving in the right direction. Let's hope the next one's even better!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"...and that's what WoT consists of now. Yes, it's that old Jordan whine: &quot;Why can't he finish it already?&quot; I know others have said it, but I think it's really disappointing that such a promising series (up to Book 4) has been allowed to deteriorate in quality to this extent, in a money-making exercise.Some of the other reviewers here have stated that Jordan's incredible detail (read: lack of resolution) qualify him as one of the greatest fantasy writers, etc etc. I have to give him credit for his meticulous working through of plot, setting, etc. However, I believe that all of this is rather pointless because the bottom line is that his books are becoming boring. Boring, you don't read it. What's the point, then, of writing it if it bores the reader? There are few things more futile than an unread book.Another oft-repeated plea: please, please, PLEASE read George R. R. Martin rather than this crap. Seriously, his style is similar to Jordan's: multiple point-of-view, epic scale, relatively formal register. However his characters are real, he isn't afraid to break the rules (pivotal characters die!) and I don't want to murder EVERY SINGLE FREAKIN' ONE OF THE CHARACTERS!Plus, as a special introductory offer, you DON'T get incessant whinings about how men/women are emotionally/intellectually stupid/incomprehensible...the number-one cause of Jordan Rage in my household."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am down to the last 60 pages of this book and NOTHING has happened! Rand had one confrontation in some alley. That's it! There is a lot of women bickering with one another, we get to hear everyone's deepest thoughts and view the most mundane of actions in grueling detail. In my opinion, Jordan is drinking deeply of the one true power (MONEY). At this rate he is going to write 20 more books in this series and be only halfway to the end, but Blood and Bloody Ashes! I am probably going to buy them all! I'm hooked. Oh well the wheel weaves as the wheel wills...."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok, so I'll admit to being one of those who picked up this series after it had begun, yet not long after. When I first began reading, The Dragon Reborn had just been released in Hardcover. So it's been, what, 13 years? I'm looking for some closure. I'm not suggesting quick hits to wrap up the series, but some consistency in releases, without these tangential leaps to prequels or other supplementary information. Personally, while those stories are entertaining, they serve no functional purpose to driving the plotline(s) in the WoT series.Of course, come Valan Lucas' Menagerie, the story began to lose my interest. I'm at the point now that if the story doesn't demonstrate significant drive to completion, I may opt to buy the books when they hit the bargain racks and not worry about the first editions anymore, abandoning my 13 year pursuit of the first releases. I've waited this long, why not another few months (in perspective) to allow the less costly version to be available?My fandom began early on, as stated, when a college roommate left his Eye of the World out and I picked it up. I was enthralled by the prologue, and waited eagerly to get my hands on new books. I also served to spread the word and recruit my core group of colleagues and friends, and eventually about 25 new readers were as die hard as I was. Yet that number has dwindled to about 3, most of us opting to apostatize the series in favor of others who seem to have a more finite concept of a storyline. I won't go into detail about that as it is probably a more appropriate topic for another discussion.To conclude, I appreciate Robert Jordan's contributions to the world of Fantasy writing. However, I'm growing disappointed at the pace at which the story is advancing. Books one through four, amazing. Five and on? Less than amazing. Therefore book nine, Winter's Heart, receives from me a less than amazing rating: three stars."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Really, I don't see how anyone can read any of the last four or five books in the series and find them acceptable seeing as how they take an average of 2.5 years to produce. I mean, does it REALLY take Jordan that long to write this stuff?The explanation is simple. Jordan's job description isn't that of an author anymore, but more specifically it's author of the Wheel of Time.to touch on WH specifically... it's a case of been there done that. Pages of empty dialouge, braid tugging, fists on hips and the ever present sniffing with no movement in the plot. Yes, a rather important event takes place in the final pages of the book. And this scene is rushed. It seems to me that something this momentous should have been given a little more space and importance. Instead, Jordan just kind of throws it in our lap. Of course, Jordan will gleefully put in page after page after page of Egwene or Nynaeve thinking about how \\"woolheaded\\" men are.And don't hold out much hope for Crossroads of Twilight. Advanced word is that it's just more of the same... even worse than Winter's Heart."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan really has to break the mold he has created. The characters in his novels, which I loved so much, have become so predictable it is nauseating.I mean the whole battle of the sexes thing has taken repetitive to a whole new level. If you've read the novels, you know what I mean.I really believe the last novel was originally the first half of a book, then the author floundered and tried to make it into something it clearly was not. There is almost no advancement of the plot in this book; instead the read is mired in the same minutia that has plagued the series for several volumes.In anticipation of this novel, I read the entire series again. The degradation in overall quality became all the more apparent as I went on. The first 3-4 books really were something special, it's a shame about the last few.I can only hope Jordan finds his old form again. At this point I will buy the remaining books, I'm in too deep. However, I'm not thrilled with the direction the series has taken."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Frankly, I can't see what the fuss is all about with Winter's Heart. Everyone I've talked to has seemed to think this book saved the series. A Crown of Swords and The Path of Daggers, the two preceding books (don't even -think- about buying this book until you've read the rest of the series) were not good, by most people's standards. This book, the ninth in the enormous series, was said to be much better.All because, at the very end, the plot *gasp* is advanced!I'm giving this book two stars because it is, I'll admit, better than The Path of Daggers. The Path of Daggers had absolutely nothing important happen in it. The main plot was not advanced, merely the countless subplots Robert Jordan is weaving. Yet, The Path of Daggers and A Crown of Swords lack the action of the preceding books in the series. Subplot after subplot drives on, crowding out the main characters (Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, and Nynaeve). Nothing major happens, and nothing minor is wrapped up. All that happens is that new minor plots are introduced, and older ones are being continued.Winter's Heart starts off similarly. New plots pop up. Older ones are drawn out. All that really happens is that what is promised in the early reviews of this book is fulfilled. As you've read in the official review, the Daughter of the Nine Moons enters the scene. Taim is revealed to be a traitor. But little else important happens, and those plot threads are not really advanced at all. It's as if those things were -requirements- that Jordan had to fit to write this book, to satisfy his fans.A very dull read, really.Then, at the end, something happens. The plot is advanced significantly, for the first time in about 3 books. But this only happens in one chapter -- a long chapter, but only a small percentage of the book. 95% of the book could have been chopped off, really, as long as Jordan fixed it a bit so that the readers could understand where he was going, to get up to here.No more than 100 pages would have been necessary for the meat of this book to make sense. Instead, 625 were wasted.Not recommended at all, except for fantasy fans like me who simply -have- to read to the conclusion of the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'll assume if you're reading this that you have some idea what is going on in this mammoth series. If you've read the first eight books and are wondering if it is worth your while to go ahead and commit yourself to the next book, then the answer is yes. After six absolutely superb books, Mr. Jordan's story began to suffer but he appears to be coming back to form with a ninth book that is much better than the seventh or the eighth.Unfortunately, I cannot give the book more stars for two very important reasons:1 - the book is rushed, and by rushed I do not mean that there is too much action, but rather there exist a disturbingly large number of typos and grammatical errors (I know, I know, those who live in glass houses...). I cannot blame these on Mr. Jordan, but they refelct very poorly on the publisher.2 - the plot has begun to move again, but it remains far too slow for my tastes. While I am certainly not one of the many readers who has asked Mr. Jordan to speed things up in terms of pounding out books quicker (I do in fact wish he would take his time and write them very well) or to tell his tale in fewer books (and in fact I don't care if he takes fifteen or twenty books to tell his story if they're all as good as the first six books were), but rather that not much happens in the books anymore. Once upon a time, in any given book, a major enemy would be defeated, a major enemy (or two) introduced, and some major portion of the prophecies would be fulfilled. Now we are lucky to get any of three in any given book.In summary, Winter's Heart is a good book and a fair addition to an incredible series. Mr. Jordan appears to have decided to move the plot along at a more reasonable pace but I wish he and his publisher would take a little more time with each book to make sure they are the well polished products his readers deserve."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"OK I was really enjoying this series until around book 7 when all the male vs. female bickering started to take up too much of the storytelling. It feels like, as another reviewer put it, that Jordan is just streching this story apart in order to write more books.I have always enjoyed multiple series books but I have to say I am really bored with this series now and all the main characters are spending so much time bikering and belittling each other it is like some horrible MTV fanatasy themed reality show!If I wanted that kind of stuff I would hang out at the local High schools.What disapoints and upsets me the most is that Mr. Jordan is a truly wonderful writer. But his characters have gone from strong and interesting, to petty, childish and completly unsympathetic. I found myself wishing Rand would just kill everyone and start over. I haven't even finsihed this book because I couldn't stand the waspish nature most of the females have developed and the idiotic behaviour of most of the men.Sigh.....it started out so well....."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First of all, I would like to say congratulations to RJ on another astounding piece of work.

My advice would be to stop torturing yourselves.Anyway, the WoT series is miraculous and I recommend it to anyone who is a good reader and likes complex plots. Make sure you read the books in order! Otherwise the entire story makes very little sense. Hang in there if you hit some slow parts...They are just building up a great scene in the end.

Unfortunately, to get to anything that is interesting, you have to wade through page after page of useless descriptions and dialogue that seem to be there only to take up space.

Like them I have dedicated countless hours reading the 6000+ pages already written. Unlike them though I'm not so impatient for something big to happen that I miss all the wonders that take place in the middle.Sure this book could have used better editing to catch the 100's of gramatical errors in the book, but so what.It seems that the last couple of books have been setting things up for something BIG to happen. As in a game of chess you have to make sure you have all your pieces just right, so is the case with this series.

I don't know that I can handle another.The stories were fantastic but have since declined into repetitive and monotonous filler. I hate to see such an amazing and grand franchise fall so low.The books themselves are fantastic. The epic story is tremendous and offers the reader access to a dramatic world with realistic approaches to myth and magic. The main characters introduced in the first two volumes have become overburdened with plot twists and literary short cuts, but still reverberate strongly. Mat Cauthon is as real to me as some of my friends (and all of my co-workers).Do I recommend the series?

The book is amazing though."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The prologue of Winter's Heart was very good, it's always interesting to read more about the goings-on at the Black Tower, and the purging of the Black Ajah. But the Perrin-Faile-Berelain triangle is just becoming insipid and boring, whilst the Elayne chapters are an absolute chore to read.When Rand turns up, about 250 pages in, things get rolling along again, and the book reveals itself as markedly entertaining, especially in comparison to the Perrin &amp; Elayne POV's. Mat is back at his cheeky best, and at least with his thread there is at least some perceived danger, and thus excitement.The ending to this book is far superior to the anti-climactic nature of the ending to tPoD, and for that reason alone is worth the purchase."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"If you haven't begun reading the Wheel of Time series yet. My advice, like others, is to wait. I started reading the series in the early 90's when book four had come out, and really liked it. I have too much time wrapped up in it to not complete it, but it's lost a lot of the charm it once had.I'd say the series is great through book six, but after the Wells of Dumai, something's changed. I think Jordan may either a) be tired of writing about these same characters or b) letting pressure from the publisher to put the books out before they're complete screw up the series.My biggest complaint is that in the beginning, major plot lines in the books were wrapped up in the same novel. Now, unless it's Rand, we're having to wait five to six years for plot line resolvation (is that a word?), which means that while there may be an overall outline, the individual books aren't outlined anymore.Wait for the movie, kids."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Okay. It might not have been one of his best, but it certainly wasn't his worst! The book had some critical turning points in it (the ending, the bonding at the beginnng, etc.) and even if it was boring in some places, at least the plot is picking up again. I have to disagree with all those people who said that there were too many plot lines and it became confusing. Many different threads in a story are what make it so interesting. (My opinion at least). Oh, and a set of diverse characters with their own strengths and weaknesses, whatever they might be, make the book interesting, not annoying! Who would want to read a book where everyone was so remarkably courageous and strong (or whatever) that it becomes unremarkable. Anyway. I'm a very loyal fan, and I will continue reading the books. Afterall, in order to be better, it must be worse."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Like most people I have enjoyed this series since the beginning. However with each new volume coming out, I remember less and less of the previous characters. When you read the first few chapters and don't remember half of them, that's a problem. I guess I'm gonna have to go a re-read all of them before volume 10 arrives or I'm gonna be totally lost.However, even if I didn't remember the characters, I did remember the overall plot, so I was very happy when the big, hairy, epic moments began happening. The cleansing of the male half of the magic was a loooooong time in coming. I was going to give this 3 stars, if it weren't for the last few chapters. The battle-royale between tons of characters was one of the best battle-sequences I have EVER read! I hope the next one has that same level of excitement!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I love WoT, and this book for the most part was a good addition to the series. However, like many others I have found rambling to be the main detriment since probably book 6 or so. While having so many interesting plots sure makes for a very fleshed out world, they are tolling on the reader who wants to hear about the main story, who wants to see what hooked them to the story in the first place. Jordan's vision in the beginning was simple, the Dragon champions the Light, and will battle the Dark One in the Last Battle. The first books were dramatic and had a good pace, and were FOCUSED on this vision. Now the vision is dimmed, and we are left with a lot of political intrigue, slow story lines, and almost no action at all in the main plot. What we need from Jordan is a return to the vision, kill off all the subplots except Rand and Mat, (Perrin is boring, and shouldn't be a main feature IMO)with Rand bringing mankind together, and Mat bringing the Seanchan into the fold. The Dark One's presense needs to be made strong again. Has anyone seen a Trolloc lately? Myrddraal? Anything? Nope, and that needs to be addressed. The Forsaken have been so inept as well that the Last Battle seems a forgone conclusion. ... while the series has experienced stagnation, it is still among the best written, and Jordan still can make it one the best ever, he just needs to make the right decisions and cut the fat off the books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm giving 5 stars not necessarily to this particular book, but to the series as a whole, of which the past few books everyone hated are an important part.I'll admit that the one big problem I have with this series is that there seems to be an ever-increasing amount of characters to keep track of, and I think it must be in the upper hundreds by now.That being said, Ii can't believe all these so called 'fans' are giving up on such an amazing series. For the first books, the reviews were all calling for the series to end; and now they are getting their wish, they're complaining. I'm wondering how many of these reviews are from little kids who just want to see big explosions and battles a-la Arnold or Sylvester.But this world he has created is so rich and powerful that it goes deeper than superficial things like battles. God forbid RJ takes this world into the dreaded realm of character development, betrayal, politics, religion, madness, love, racism, and power, just to name a few. Think of how much these characters have changed. Rand is 150% different, and now I find myself hating him at times as a character, and I love that! I like the hero who has flaws and becomes more like his enemy, than the one who can do everything and come out clean like Superman. It's more realistic. The same can be said for all the main characters, as well as the intricate sub-plots and twisty turns everyone is whining about. It just goes to show that those in power, and their adventures, never happen like people, least of all they, expect.Bottom line: Read the series, and enjoy it, even the slow parts, as a whole; with the past few books being just parts of that whole. And if you can't keep up with all these intricate plot-lines and character development/disintegration, go watch Rambo."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After the unmitigated disaster that was A Path Of Daggers (negative stars in my book), I am glad to say that Winter's Heart was a satisfying read for me. From APoD Jordan retains his plodding and deliberate pace, I am afraid that readers of the series will have to be get used to it. On the other hand, I felt that the charcters became of flesh and blood again. Perhaps because Perrin, who used to be interesting but has become a royal bore, is only present in the first few chapters. Mat return with a vengeance and I can see why he was missed so much in APoD. He is simply the most unpredictable guy out there. While we witnessed the growth of these kids we were constantly surprised by their actions. Once they became legends, they stagnated and became a sum of their mannerisms. It is nice to see that Mat is as interesting as ever. As usual, there are too many plotlines out there to be satifactorily advanced in a single book, but the developments with the Seanchan deliver some serious punch. And at long last, the book ends with a real bang: not a cliffhanger this time, but a climax we have not seen yet from Jordan."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm afraid Robert Jordan's good writing stopped at Book 6. It hasn't started up again. The plot-line has become glacially slow and RJ only seems interested in: (a) drawing out the nuances of the tiniest of inter-personal relationships between his main good characters that NO-ONE cares about (braid-tug, sniff etc); (b) creating new characters no-one will ever remember; (c) forgetting about those existing characters that one does recall (hello, RJ, there's one called Mat); (d) laughing up his sleeve at fans puzzling to work out the Adeleas/Asmodean/Demandred threads that have been happening for, oh, 3-4 books now &amp; badly need to be cleared up. And only spiced up at the end after the publishers realised that nothing had happened in the book. I'm waiting for someone to write a 100 page summary of books 7-9. Shouldn't take long."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Enough Mr. Jordon! You've made your money, quit milking this to death and end it! The later books in this series read like some of your horrible Conan books. Stop!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The content in this book is great. I hate waiting another two years for #10 and be able to continue the reading, but even that does not lead me into berating the book or the author at all. For anyone who has paid attention throughout the series, the events in the past few books have been almost necessary to keep up the realism of the world Jordan has created. What is happening in the latest installments was hinted to in the first books of the series. To make the story as close to life as possible, we cannot expect things to go right all the time. A forsaken dying in each book would only make each new addition predictable. So much happened in this book that was important, I feel bad for the reviewers who deprived themselves by skipping through the book looking for 'something important'. This series is still great, and continues to inspire with each new addition to the tale!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Reading Robert Jordan is like being addicted to drugs. Before you read it, you know that you shouldn't do it. It won't be good for you. But you can't help yourself. You have to get that Rand Fix. Once you start, you can't stop. But when its over, you are left feeling a little worse than before. You realize that the reality does not match with the expectation.Robert Jordan needs to have something happen in his books. There are a number of storylines that are started and dropped. Why even start the book with Perrin and Faile? Their story disappears.What is the need to introduce &quot;Seekers of Truth&quot;? We all know that Terry Goodkind has taken liberties in the &quot;Sword or Truth&quot; series, but why does Jordan recipricate.Robert Jordan needs to get the story moving. We need to finish some stories and create new, and more interesting, plots surrounding Rand."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book is just more of the same, a story that goesnowhere. It's to bad, the first 5 books were great. Maybe he forgothow he was going to end the story, now he just writes aboutnothing. That's it for me, I won't waste [money] on Jordan again.

But enough of the past and back to the present!Winters heart brings back the person most missed in PoD, MAT!! BUT, as you can see it's a big but, and there always is a downside, this being that some characters like Perrin are under used, Elaida is nowhere in sight, neither are many Aes Sedai, Egwene is baisicaly given a walk on part and the two rivers is only mentioned once or twice.The book ties a lot of plots and sub plots from the last eight together, but starts just as many again! If you thought that this would be the second last book of the series, i'm afrai you'll be wrong, because by the looks of things, Robert Jordan will strech this out over another two books roughly and maybe even a third, of course i could be wrong but i would'ent put it past him.You may have noticed i have'nt said anything much about the plot? thats because i don't want to spoil the book for you and all the new twists and turns in it.Trust me you will love it.

Oh the thrill, the joy of reading that first treasure. And finally finding a writer who could, in my eyes, compare to Tolkien. (I read the Lord of the Rings eleven times) Next day I went back to the library and tried to find books two and three. I devoured them and by the end of \`The Dragon Reborn', I knew that here was a master at work. Tolkien couldn't compare to Robert Jordan. I went to the bookshop to buy all three books and hopefully the fourth. And now here I have book number nine. \`Winters Heart.' I am so sad to say that I have finished it already. Imagine, years of work and we read it in no time at all. Because we, the readers, can't put it down. Winters Heart confirmed yet again that here is a master at work. How does he do it? The different worlds and society's, the colours, the people, the shere scope of it. In detail and with knowledge. I am a writer myself and not without imagination. But this whole other world just blows my mind, I have tremendous respect for Mr. Jordan. For me 'The Wheel of Time' isn't about books any more, it is not important that some people find that book seven or eight are not as good as book one or two. It is the whole that counts. I have the feeling that I have the privilige of looking behind a curtain that separates the reality of our world from the reality of \`The Wheel of Time'. Two worlds that exist next to eachother in different dimensions. Each book is focussing on a particular part of that other dimension and revealing it to us. Each book is different. But the constant in these books are the heroes and heroins. They grow and mature. They show us their weak and their strong sides. The struggle that goes on. And we get to share their experiences. I love Winters Heart, because somehow for me, it goes back to that very first book. Like a grown up person that can't grow further without drawing from his/her youth. In Winters Heart we get glimpses of the persons (Rand, Matt and all the others) they once were so long ago, when everything started. Psychologically everything fits. And trust Robert Jordan to end \`Winters Heart' with a cliffhanger. But how long do we have to keep hanging? I know the work that goes with writing a book. It takes so much time, patience, frustration and elation. But how I wish that somehow book ten would already be here. Mr. Jordan, can't you make a gateway for us all? So that we can travel to the next (last?) one in record time?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As much of a fan of the first 6 books as I am I keep reading even after the less-than-average book 7 and absolutely horrible Path of Boredom (book 8). I will agree that this installment is better than the last, then again it was impossible to write anything worse. The pattern emerges - RJ closes one or two plot lines and introduces 5 new ones. It seems that this way his retirement can be guaranteed by the bunch of totally gullible fools (like me) who keep shelling out the money. At least this time the local bookstore knocked off 40% right from November 7th, based on the sales of book 8. RJ has become a descriptive writer to boot - he can spend 30 pages describing a simple walk through Caemlyn when nothing happens (mind you, after that you will have a good picture of the place; then again, so you should for the 5% of your investment). Best advice, unless you already spent your money, borrow it from the library, they will have plenty of copies soon."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After so long, long-time readers of Jordan's WOT series all have images of how the series should go, end, etc. I'm no different, but I'm making my comments with the belief that Jordan knows what he's doing and that he can write 600+ pg. books a lot better than I can! So, that said, here go my comments on Winter's Heart. If you haven't read the book and you want to remain completely spoiler-free, read no further. I won't spoil everything, but....I agree that all of the original main characters should be in every book and that all of the secondary characters (most Aes Sedai, all Shaido, all but two Wise Ones, you get the picture) should die quick deaths, including all of the Forsaken who died once before! On the other hand, just about every noteworthy character is at least seen in Winter's Heart (only Loial, Gawyn, Galad, and Siuan, that I remember, are missing).And some stories are seen in the 1st 100 pgs. only to disappear (Logain, White Tower). But important things happen to most of the main characters. We also learn who Osan'gar is, who probably killed Asmodean, we finally see Mat's prophecied love, and the final chapter is a long-awaited event, too!That's one problem I think people have -- everything's been prophecied! Rand going nuts, Mat meeting Moons, Rand loving 3 women. But it's gratifying to me to see them come true.Some scenes are done very well -- the final chapter and most of Mat's saga. I would have included more of Rand/Elayne, Robert Jordan seems to have an aversion to their romance (refer to them in Tear), as opposed to his with Aviendha and Min. They are my favorite couple, however, since I've accepted that Rand &amp; Egwene will never hook up. &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; again. That's the one thing that grates.All in all, pretty darn good. I read somewhere that RJ has everything noted out, so he's got a plan. I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Like one reviewer said and I concur, the hardback books are no longer worth it anymore.

Winter's Heart is yet another great book written by him... Although it is by far not his greatest book. It is a must buy!! My only regret is having to wait 2years for the next one!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart continues the tradition of the Wheel Of Time series. Whilst Jordan has been critised for his writing style, to each his own and especialy his readers! Jordan has stayed faithful to his characters and whilst introducing some new ones he has again reintroduced characters that we thought were past. Jordan's style is not for everyone, but those who enjoy his work would I'm sure apreciate the magnitude of the universe and his attempts to create a world which appears to have a tangible history and exsistance. I applaude Jordan for his effort to keep the characters rolling along at a steady pace, but have reviewed this installment lower than the preecding books because whilst I like his style, I feel that perhaps with the end of the series assuredly just over the rise, Jordan should perhaps increase the pace slightly and included at least one more confrontation. But more importantly Book 9 should have been released sooner than this! To wait too long between chapters is dangerous and can be alienating to some for the perceived idea that the author is trying to 'cash in' too much so to speak by releasing ancillary titles. I belive and hope that Jordan will release book 10 sooner rather than later!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, at least something significant happened. I enjoyed book 9 but Jordan does seem to have created a story too large to handle. Every time things seems to be moving forward, they go off course. Isn't Perrin's mission to deal with the Prophet enough of a subplot without taking a detour into a bizarre kidnapping of Faile? Just one of countless ways in which Jordan seems to be meandering. A recent quote from the author reveals the problem. He was asked about readers being upset with the absence of Mat from book 8. His response was something along the lines of &quot;Well, a house fell on him. A HOUSE! How can one recover quickly from such an accident. Better to leave him out of the book than attempt some boring depiction of convalescence.&quot; Uh, excuse me Mr. Jordan, but WHY did a house fall on him? Did a deranged fan put a gun to your head and say &quot;Have Mat suffer a horrible accident or you're a goner.&quot; YOU'RE the author for crying out loud. YOU put the house on top of him. Next time you find yourself considering whether the main characters of the series should suffer some calamity that may put them out of commission for an entire book, think again and have them stub their toe instead."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I think that becouse of constant pressure and breack neck pace of writing , jordan run out of steam. It happens to the best of them, stephen king and anne rice are the best examples. What he needs is to kick back take a few deep breaths and lay the series off for 5 years or so. Let the ideas tricle back. While RJ does tie up major plot lines and has some progress, most of the book (99.9%) is still cannon fodder. HE needs to focus and have a story line for a chance. The only reason why i m still reading is becouse of my reading style. I have read his book in three days by skipping all the irrelevant plot details. Skimming until i got to the juicy parts. I reconmend any other reader to to the same and if RJ is reading this, take a breack man youve done enouth."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have to agree with some of the reviewers in that this installment was somewhat lacking. Perrin dissapeared from the storyline far too quickly, for one thing. For another, the first half of the book was way too slow, it could have been condensed without losing anything. However, the second half of the book more than made up for it. Although I do write fiction myself and enjoy that aspect of it tremendously, I know that I am not nearly half the writer Robert Jordan is. I applaud Mr. Jordan for a brilliant story, character's I feel I know personally, and the best series to come along since The Lord of the Rings. I am able to enter RJ's world while I'm reading and am reluctant at leaving it when the book ends.My only regret is that I wish I'd waited until the series was finished before reading it. The books aren't too long (in fact, they're not long enough), but it's torture waiting for the next installment. Hopefully it won't be another two years. In the meantime, keep 'em coming Mr. Jordan. If you write it, I will read."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"With all due respect to all those who praise this series so much, I must interject this: the story SHOULD be done. I don't remember which jacket cover it was, but the publisher said that this series was a &quot;probable&quot; 8 books. Book 9 is done, and I cannot see how this story will be finished in less than 2 to 3 more books. That makes it 12 books(at least). This story that Mr. Jordan is writing(has already written) is extremely addictive. So is your average soap opera. The truth as I see it is that books 7,8,&amp;9 should have been one volumn(as they probably were, before it became evident that this series was going to become so financially lucrative). That would have been book 7. Very long book, you say? Not if you take out some of the inane and totally irrelavent detail that was added in to those 3 books. Why is there so much complaint about this series bogging down? Details are being added in to make the story longer, thus providing more books. And at $30 a pop, the more books sold, the better for both writer and publisher. The Alliance(writer&amp;publisher) wants all the money you will give them. This story IS complete. And finished. The question is, how many books are The Alliance going to make us buy in order to find out the ending. I, for one, did not buy this book. I got this book from the library(as I suggest others should do). This book was, BY FAR, the best of the last three of this series(as should be expected, since it was the climax of what should have been book 7, the combo of the 3 books.) All this being said, I feel greatly that anyone who hasn't experienced this story should do so. Soon. Just use your library. Don't give these greedy bastards anything. Use the library."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ten years ago, when I was a young stud in high school, A friend gave me his copy of the first book in what we laughably thought would be a trilogy. Now, ten years later, even the critics have stopped predicting. And it's becoming clearer that I'll have grandchildren before this series ends, or the main characters turn eighteen. But if I stop reading, it'll mean I really have wasted a whole decade of my life.Jordan's adolescent heroes continue to wade through a murky sewer of plotting, whining incessantly about how unfair life is--as if anyone reading this series needed a reminder! What was, in the beginning, a refreshing intricacy and attention to detail, has become a bewildering labyrinth of names, places, reincarnations, intrigues, betrayals, love, lust, livestock... you get the picture. It seems even Jordan has FINALLY realized that his everything-and-the-kitchen sink writing has become off-putting to his fans, as this novel is trimmed down compared to its immediate predecessors (much like the Q.E. II is trim if compared to the Titanic). And the rich characterization we all loved in the beginning has become little more that worn out catch phrases (wool-head) and strong-arm hyperbole (everyone, it seems, could now give an Aes Sedai lessons in tranquility, unflappability, stone-facedness, etc.).But this book is better than the last few. He has mostly stopped skipping about willy-nilly between the main characters, instead following each for a while, and then leaving them there. This approach, unfortunately, makes it even more clear that there will be at least another five books before they finish what they're already doing, much less reach a conclusion. Still, it's an improvement. And relatively little time is spent dwelling on the plottings of the Baddies.But the greatest improvement over the last book is the return of Mat Cauthon! The coolest character in all the Multi-verse! Woefully absent for the last book-and-a-half, he shows back up mid-way through book nine. Unfortunately, even he is whining and moody, but he's there (you all knew he would be, right?).And steps do get taken. Slow, plodding, tortuous steps, but steps. It's just enough to ensure I'll be waiting in line when I'm forty, trying to get the new release of book twenty-two, \\"Sidewalk of the Forsaken\\", in which they all celebrate their seventeenth birthdays. If you're lacking funds, spend your money on George R. R. Martin, and borrow this one from a friend. It's not going anywhere soon.P.S. I've just recently begun to see in the book stores that where we would look for, perhaps, the next installment, Jordan has begun to ***RE-RELEASE*** \\"Eye of the World\\" (the first title in the series, for those who don't keep up)--split into two over-priced, trade-edition paperbacks.

I raced through books 1-8, eagerly anticipating the further adventures of Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Elayne, Nyeaeve, Lan, Loial, etc. I'm stuggling even to finish this one. Jordan has brought in too many new or barely mentioned characters this time around. Yes, there are continuing stories of the old characters, but there sandwiched between chapter after chapter of characters that I don't really care about. What I really wanted to read, was that Moiraine really wasn't dead, that she had somehow been caught up in some thing, and would reappear or the others would come upon her (maybe as a slave without her memory?) I only started reading this series a year ago under protest, but was immediately hooked. If this new book is a sign of what's to come, I'll quit now, while my opinion of books 1-8 still stands as outstanding!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"For all of those readers out there who have put this book and any of the previous titles in this series down, it would seem that the point of a story is only to finnish or be finnished and not the actual telling of it. I, too, as a fan of the series hunger to see the outcome of this masterful tale... yet my enjoyment stems more from the actual development of the characters and subplots therein. To be quite honest, I would wish that this story could go on indefinitely and I know many other fans that share this feeling. However, as any and all stories must have an end, all we have is but the journey to this long awaited finale. If you are a patient reader and can enjoy a massive tale unparalleled by any other series in existence, do yourself a favor and pick up all the books that are currently available for The Wheel of Time.

However, it lost some critical momentum in books 5 (Fires of Heaven) and 6 (Lord of Chaos). I stuck with it though, and feel like I've been richly rewarded in Books 7, 8, and 9. The plotting and political twists are, for me, becoming more and more interesting and, I feel, its fun to observe the characters as they become more worldly and experienced. In the middle of the series, character observations seemed a bit clunky, but its like Jordan moved beyond that and is back in form with less of the pedantic 'gosh I'll never understand him/her because I'm a member of the opposite sex'. I'm not too worried about all the plot lines coming together in a wonderful conclusion, I just like the way the guy writes and the world he's created. He could do another 4 or 5 books and that's okay with me. The series has become something of a companion and I'm going to be sorry when it ends. That said, I have a penchant for writers like William Gaddis, David Foster Wallace, and some of Thomas Pynchon where plot lines don't neccessarily intersect or come to resolution. So, I guess I'd have to say that if you're the kind of person who is looking for resolution and a climax to each book some of them may disappoint you, so you might want to steer clear of this series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The majority of people who have read Jordan's Wheel Of Time series agree that his work is finely crafted with complex stories weaved into one. Even though, I cannot do anyhting but recommend starting the series at book 1, The Eye of the World, I must say that book 9 is unquestionnably my personnal favorite. Jordan is full of surprises, leading the reader to new events affecting every character in the book. The ending itself is a breathtaking finale in its suspense and happenings, and leaves eagerly awaiting the tenth book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"&quot;Winter's Heart&quot; is somewhat slower-paced than the other books, if only to provide a bit of breathing room while the storm gathers. Patience is required with this series, because it spans the whole of their world, and therefore many people and many subplots will be involved. In Book Eight, Mat disappeared, but he makes a reappearance in this book. Perhaps this should give the reader a better view of the timeline: with as much detail packed in as there is, it seems like months have gone by between events when it's really no more than a few days in their world. As I said, the pace is much slower. I am still wondering what Elaida's reaction to finding the army that she thought was hundreds of miles away, now on her doorstep overnight (literally). With some of the newer characters, it is difficult to see where they fit in: Moridin, Shaidar Haran, Cadsuane, and the multitudes of Aiel (all introduced in the earlier eight books)... I wonder where Mr. Jordan is going with the character of Padan Fain: is he going to play a major role, distracting Rand at the Last Battle, or will he just pop up now and again to harass him? I did enjoy the ending, though it perhaps raised more questions than it solved. There are no plot holes (and I've been over all nine books with a fine-tooth comb looking for problems) and I'm waiting impatiently for the next book in the series. There's a lot yet for Rand to do, and not much time to do it in. It could be a little better, so I'll only rate it four stars. But I can't wait for Book Ten!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I don't agree with those wishing this series would end. I thoroughly enjoy the depth and detail these books have gone into, and right now I'm trying to savor every word I can. It'll be almost sad to see the end of such an epic tale. I remember never wanting to reach the last page of The Lord of the Rings series. Stories like this become a part of you, especially when they have spanned so many years.I agree, though, that the last few books haven't paced themselves the way the first ones did. I believe this book set the stage for a lot more action in the follow up book, where as book 8 really didn't acomplish as much. I still enjoyed this book, and anxiously await book 10."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book is just as good as any of the others. Anyone who liked Robert Jordan's other books will like/love this one as well. Everyone seems to be giving Jordan bad reviews, don't listen to a single one, there are a couple of reasons, first, this is a 7,000 page book serius. I would like to see anyone who wrote a review try to do that in say less then 15 years especially if you are going to create your own universe along with which this warrants some explanation. Second, this is a fantasy book, a person may see real elements of people in this book but, the reality of the situation is that the characters are all made up and have things about them which are imaginary whether that be in spirit or in power. If someone would truly like to enjoy a book or in this case nine books that will leave you thinking about the plot and pondering up at night then read this serius its incredibly imaginative. I will not give away any of the plot for those of you who have not read it yet but, Mat is back in the book which is great for us all. Just remember 7,000 pages, you cannot get a good thick story line reading in just 30 minutes a book is much deeper then, say a half an hour TV show.

Well, I would like to join in. This sucks. I am nine books into a series that should've been over by now. I've been limping along (like so many) since book eight and clearly Jordan has lost his ability, his nerve and his voice. I'm only hoping there are enough die hards out there to buy my collection on Ebay.Mr. Jordan: You should feel like Al Gore, you are done, you just have no idea."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"No matter what you critical reviewers may think, Winter's Heart is another amazingly crafted book. The Wheel of Time is quite possibly the BEST series written. Tolken can't even come CLOSE to Jordan. As a sci-fi author myself, I can recognize the hard work Jordan puts into all his novels. If you haven't read Jordan's books, do yourself a favor and get at those books! &quot;The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose above the Aryth Ocean. The wind is no the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time.

The constant threat of the Forsaken and Shadowspawn lurks around ever corner and even within the ranks of Rand's followers. The forces of good continue to battle to unite the world before the Last Battle between good and evil comes.It is simply amazing how Robert Jordan's creative mind can not only continue his works but can surpass his past work. For fans of the series this book is one that they will definately want to read, but for those not familiar with Jordan's past work, they will be thrown into the plot with almost no comprehension of the storyline or vocabulary. Jordan does include a glossary of terms, people, and places in the rear of the book but the glossary only includes the most central characters plus information that has only been presented in this book. I strongly suggest that if you have not yet read the Wheel of Time series in its entirety up to Winter's Heart, don't read the book. Instead, pick up The Eye of the World; the first book in the series. Winter's Heart is full of plot twists and unexpected happenings and is sure to delight readers. Only Jordan could continue to add detail to this seemingly real world. With thousands and thousands of pages already complete, Jordan is continuing his writing in what is one of the most fantastic fantasy series ever created."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan keeps the series very much alive with another amzing book in The Wheel of Time Series. If you have not read any of the series so far, i suggest you begin. The very first book, The Eye of the World is great, and each book after is better than the last."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I may have written a review for this book already but I'm writing another one. I think it got a higher rating than it should have. Book eight kind of lagged and nine was much worse. I don't even want to read ten. Jordan better make his books better. I was dissapointed with this book and I will be quite angry if the rest of the series is like this."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Early books were probably the best science fantasy ever. As every later book seems to leave more and more plot lines left open, Jordan's in danger of ending up with a mediocre series instead of a classic. I'd suggest he take some tips from L.E. Modesitt's style with every book standing on its on."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is better than the 7th and 8th book. I think the publishers are making him milk this thing till there is no money left in the series. He keeps adding more and more characters until I have to go back and reread books just to keep up with everything.While I do like the details and the development of sidecharacters &lt;are there any main characters??&gt; I think Tad Williams does a better job of it and in fewer pages.Mr.Williams managed to wrap up the Dragonbone Chair series and The Otherland series in the time Mr Jordan has taken to definitely NOT finish this one.But I admit I am so hooked on this I have to keep reading it to find out what happens to my *favorite* characters. &lt;ie the ones introduced in the first two books.&gt;"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"UNlike some of the previous works in this series, this one contains very little filler. Major plot turns happen regularly, and no characters are utterly forgotten. However, it's simply not as strong as the early books in the series were, though it's a considerable improvement over those immediately before it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I started reading this series more than 10 years ago. It was great! For a while. Then it started to become less than expected. Still I looked forward to the next book in the series. Now, after one less thrilling book after another, and the lack of anything from Mr. Jordan in a very long time, I have decided that if there ever is a 10th book, I will probably not buy it. For those readers who have not given up yet, I salute you."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Both interesting and descriptive The Wheel of Time is an enjoyable read for anyone of any age. Main characters Rand al'Thor, Mat Carthonon, and Perrin Araya show the struggle of men and woman, younger people and elders, and people with athority's anoyance with their subjects.Winters heart is one of the most important books in the series. In it Rand al'Thor tries to cleans Sadin or the male half of the True sorce. The Seachan from across the ocean send a landing party with a ruler and the Arylim Seat, the most powerful position in the world, is filled with a girl.In this strange world of fiction, where men and woman can control the forces which drive time, this story is believable and fun to read. The epic battles of the main characters fight the true sorce of evil. Can they stop it from breaking free of its ever weakening prision?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan is finally getting around to all of the connections that he alluded to. It's getting good."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As a fan of the whole Wheel of Time series, I can't help but like this book. Although not quite as good as the first 3 in the series (Eye of the World, Hunt for the Horn, Dragon Reborn), it is a definite improvement over the prior one (Path of Daggers). The prologue to the book is very good and so is the ending. The chapters about Rand are also very good, but the chapters about Mat are a bit drawn out.I am guessing here, but I think the main story is moving along and we're all getting closer to the &quot;Last Battle&quot;. However, I can't help wondering how many books it's going to take to get there gracefully with all of the unresolved threads to the story. With every sub-plot and dangling thread from the previous books that get resolved, there seems to be two or three new ones that replace it.Oh wells, I guess I can't complain about more books to the series since I've liked them all (this one more than some of the others). I just hope he's able to get them all written and published before I am too old and senile to enjoy them :)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I enjoyed the book but feel to much time is given to insignificant characters. Similiar to the two previous novels a lot of descriptions upon descriptions and not enough action. The last hundred pages or so is outstanding. And the last couple of pages dealing with Mat were good but that was it for the action. On inner cover talks about Mazraim Taim but he is barely mentioned. It was a good read but it looks like I'll have to wait for book 10, 11, 12 ...... to get answers and action."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"OK, we know Robert Jordan is arguably the best fantasy writer since Tolkien (or was till George RR Martin started his series), but he's now lost the plot. Literally. From a gripping first three books, to a mediocre second three through to a far too slow and intricate third three that add almost nothing to the overall plot and don't take it very much further. And Winter's Heart is no real exception -- still far too much braid pulling and blushing by the female characters and not enough dialogue or action or historical reference points. I'm very pleased Mr Jordan is now making lots more money than if he had kept this the tighter 5-6 book series he clearly originally planned, but he has now completely wasted his historic opportunity to create something of lasting merit and now is merely doing something good. Still a clear cut above the rest of the field, but well below what we know he is himself capable of. A great pity."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After the thoroughly disappointing Path of Daggers, expectations for Winter's Heart were mixed. Maybe Robert Jordan had written the weak book that all series seem obligated to have and he could ramp things up again as the series drew towards its conclusion? At the same time, other, hungrier authors in the epic fantasy field were now clawing at Jordan's heels. Whilst he spent most of the 1990s as the unchallenged master of the subgenre, towards the end of the decade writers such as George RR Martin, JV Jones, Robin Hobb and Paul Kearney had started producing works that matched or exceeded the quality of the later Wheel of Time books, and Winter's Heart in particular suffered from coming out just two months after GRRM's A Storm of Swords and three months ahead of Steven Erikson's Memories of Ice, probably the two most critically-lauded epic fantasy volumes of the last decade. With his position no longer unchallenged and his critics mounting, Jordan had a lot to prove with this book.Winter's Heart has a lot of storylines to follow and Robert Jordan's skills at juggling multiple, complex plots simultaneously and covering a lot of ground are sorely lacking at this point in the narrative. The book actually rewinds to a point some weeks before the end of Path of Daggers, meaning that Egwene is hardly in the book and the rebel Aes Sedai's storyline does not proceed at all (in a precedent-setting move, completely invalidating the cover blurb). Perrin's wife and several of her companions have been kidnapped by the Shaido Aiel, forcing Perrin into a desperate alliance with the insane Prophet of the Dragon to find her...but this storyline barely crawls forward from where it had been at the end of Path of Daggers, and Jordan's characterisation suffers a loss of credibility when Perrin, having accepted Masema's explanation why he won't use Travelling to move around the continent at speed, seems to forget it instantly at the start of this book.The book succeeds more in its depiction of life under Seanchan occupation, and Jordan showing the more positive aspects of their society without letting the reader ever forget these are people who still hold slaves and base their power on military force. Tuon is something of a disappointment, however. The Daughter of the Nine Moons has had a bit of a build-up in the books leading up to this one and she is distant and uninvolved in the story. However, Mat's plan to escape from the city makes for fun reading, mainly because he comes up with the plan, overcomes obstacles and executes it within this one novel, a story with a beginning, middle and end contained in one volume, which is something of a rarity this late in the series.Jordan tries for something similar with Rand, but in Rand's case his story is nonsensical. Far Madding is an interesting city, well-described, but it is simply far too late in the day for the series to be romping off to as-yet unvisited spots on the map simply because they might be cool. Rand wanting to track down the rebel Asha'man is logical, but to do it in this city and to spend weeks on it whilst everything he's spent eight previous books building up is in danger of being toppled and destroyed really doesn't make sense. There is definitely the feeling here that Rand is more or less ready for the Last Battle, but Jordan keeps having to give him stuff to do because he hasn't maneuvered Mat, Perrin, Elayne and the other characters into the positions they need to be in before the Last Battle starts. Why he then doesn't decide to simply keep Rand off-stage as he's done before and even in this book (Egwene barely appears, and only has a few lines of dialogue) in favour of resolving the other characters' storylines is a bit of a mystery.As usual, Jordan gives us a humongous climax and this one should have been a doozy: a massive, full-on battle between Rand's assembled Asha'man, Sea Folk, Aes Sedai and ex-Seanchan damane allies versus almost all of the surviving Forsaken outside Shadar Logoth, whilst Rand and Nynaeve attempt to undo an act of pure evil that the Dark One itself carried out. However, all we get of this massive conflagration are a few confused scenes and an anticlimactic finale. Disappointing, to say the least.Winter's Heart (***) is a flawed book, although Mat's storyline is enjoyable and Rand's reveals some new and interesting worldbuilding. Elsewhere, it does appear that Jordan's immense story has gotten out of his control and he is having significant problems wrestling it back into submission. However, Winter's Heart immediately wins half a star purely for having some decent scenes of men and women working effectively together, whilst past books in the series have been rather juvenile in their depictions of male-female relations. Here, there are indications that he may be moving past that. Jordan's writing remains interesting and readable, but there is definitely the feeling that the series is now way past its best."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Many critics have called Robert Jordan the &quot;King of Modern Fantasy&quot; (Modern Fantasy of course does not include Tolkien.) I would like to know the criteria for achieving this title. Are they 1) the number of pages the author has written, 2) the amount of books the author has in a series, 3) the amount of time the author takes to write each book, 4) The number of annoyingly obsessed fans of the series, 5) the number of plotlines in the series, 6) the number of characters in the series as a whole, or 7) the amount of plot covered in each 700 (on an average) page book?In the first five books of the Wheel of Time, the plot per book took up about 3 Wheel of Time months. Steadily, this amount of time has shortened. The plot of Winter's Heart takes up about 3 weeks of the character's time. While this is a new record low, the book is actually a step up from the Path of Daggers (i.e.-things actually happen).Elayne ponders what to do now that she has finally gotten to Andor. Perrin travels and chats with Masema. No sign of Egwene or the rebel Aes Sedai. We finally meet the daughter of the Nine Moons. Rand runs around with Min and Cadsuane and a whole bunch of really talented channeling women. Oh yeah, he cleanses the taint too.Overall, it's one more draught of the bitter medicine the Wheel of Time has become. Supposedly Robert Jordan is finishing the series in ten books. (Snicker, snicker). I seriously doubt it. One more criterion for the throne of Modern Fantasy: A never ending series. Unlike the multitude of Jordan fans, I do not want the series to go on forever. What happens if Jordan dies before the thing is finished (looking at the next 20 years of WOT books, I think it's possible, even probable. So let's kick the pretender off the throne."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Stay away from this book and the series. The first four books were entertaining enough to make many loyal readers stick with the series through five volumes of gradually worsening dialogue, annoying descriptions and a convoluted plot. By now, we are numb to the characters and don't care if they live or die. I am hoping we start seeing some useless background characters die sometime soon.The lack of personality or intelligence on behalf of the main characters and villains is annoying. These people are very powerful, but they are not very interesting or smart. If you do start reading, don't expect well executed characterization, but do be prepared for stock characters.The characters don't do anything but complain. The females are overindulgent and whining, the men are spineless and argumentative. Through it all, the differences between genders are repeatedly hammered into our heads in every other word. For a series that is supposed to play off gender differences, the latter books fall flat on their face.Mr. Jordan should take a writing and editing workshop. Some books he might want to read to get a better idea on how to be write without being boring are:The Mists of AvalonThe Fionavar TapestryTiganaShogunThe series has taken so long to get nowhere that reading through it is more like slow torture than an enjoyable experience. If his characters would actually do something besides sit on their respective thrones and wallow in arrogance, the plot might actually get somewhere.I would give it no stars, but one star is the lowest I can go."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have read the first five books of the wheel of time series twice. The ones that came after have put me to sleep. The plot gets increasingly complicated, increasingly difficult to follow and story has become boring. The only charachter/subplot I have recently enjoyed is the story of Mat. And now he no longer remains the theiving rascal who is a good guy and pretty hardcore fighter/gambler/leader. He too has found some woman to lead his life for him. Rand is turned into an invalid and Perrin is led around by the nose by Faile. At least in the first few books they railed against/ protested Morriane's control. If any of this has changed in the last 100 pages of the last book in the series I would not know because I could not go on. I have decided never to buy a book in this series ever again. It is like the disappointment I felt when I watched God father part 3 for the first time. They had taken what was probably the finest two movies ever made (Godfather Parts 1&2) and turned them into the ...that was part 3. This is very similar.

More importantly i am disciple of good literature, fantasy or otherwise. I was quite suprised when i read the other reviews posted here, mainly by the negative ones. Admittingly the world Jordan has created is large and complex but this is the beauty of his work. Jordan has attempted what no other Author i know of has, He is creating not just a glimpse of another world, another reality but he is actually crafting in detail this new world. For those of you who think the books are too slow i suggest you pick up some faster paced inferior work like Terry Goodkinds' &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; series. Jordans writing is original and authentic with an artistic flair that is truly impressive. I admit that sometimes the story becomes slightly static but even at these slow stages there is an energy and a depth that most authors lack. Jordans characters are real and they sweat, they get confused and they misinterpret the people around them in fact they remind me of myself at times. For all those haters out there stop reading the books! For all of you that enjoy the murky and plot driven reality Jordan crafts you and i can eagerly await the next installment as the world we have come to inhabit is torn apart by Tarmon Gaidan."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I don't know what has caused so many people to leave poor reviews for Winter's Heart, but I finished this book last night and thought it was the most satisfying Wheel of Time book that RJ has put out in a while. Everybody wants to see this series wrapped up as soon as possible -- but why? It's obious that Jordan doesn't want to go on forever with the story, but he's happy to take his time with it, creating a story that with a depth of detail that is almost never found in works of this size. And Book 9 contains some material that is among the most satisfying in the series.I'll give you all this much -- if you don't love the characters, you can't love the Wheel. It's true that this series does not move fast enough to be loved on plot alone. And Jordan wouldn't want you to. Maybe it's because I'm not as big a fan of fantasy as I am simply of good literature, but every book in this series gets deeper and more beautifully written. And on top of all that, the plot of this one is good! Winter's Heart is an A+ in my book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I completely enjoyed &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; by Robert Jordan. My opinion is of no consequence though because basically I am brainwashed. Six years ago I was looking for a new fantasy series to read. After reading the entire Dragonlance series (you must think I have no life, it was around 40 books!), the Deathgate, Belgariad, Mallorean, all the Pern books, etc. I was looking for a new series to tackle. The size of &quot;Eye of the World&quot; was the first thing that drew me to it. I was looking for something long, and while the cover art wasn't really outstanding (an inside joke among RJ fans), I decided to read it. I think it was the best decision I have ever made concerning books. I immediately zipped through all 5 paperbacks, bought the 6th hardback, and then waited for the next book with eager anticipation. I introduced many people to this series including my father, sister, brother, and three friends. I feel it was one of my favorite &quot;gifts&quot; I could give someone. My personal set of books have been read around 15 times by various people, I myself have read the series around 6 times, and loved it each time. Jordan is on top for a reason, and I don't understand why anyone can say more negative things about his writing then positive. The books are in greater detail and depth then any other fantasy novel I have read (I consider myself well read in the field). I have never been closer to characters and I have never experienced a more complex plot. The books have caused havoc on my emotions at times (like the testing in the tower, and all that sad stuff that just wrenches your heart *sniff*). &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; is another great addition to a long tradition of the best books. Many of my, and other RJ fans I have met on various BBS's questions were finally answered. I finally know almost everyones secret identities. No more guessing or speculating. Also the scene of the cleansing was just brilliant. My adrenaline was running high as the various enemies and forsaken approached the hill while circles of men and women linked protected Rand and Nynaeve. I was stunned to say the least.

You did it for all the other chareters except Perrin.They could have gotten attacked by trollocs or Perrin got wounded taking another arrow so his wife wouldn\`t get hurt.That would have made the book longer and better.I like romance,action,and fantasy all rolled into one book.I just want longer better more romantic books.I think that they should all get traped in a world sort of like the portal stones and there The Dark One makes the world like a paridise so they\`ll foget about the last battle until its over so he can pull them out and kill them but they escape.Basically I like the books but they could be better with more effort."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The Winters Heart Is Better Than I Dared To Dream Of.My Compliments To Robert Jordan On This Magnificent Sequel.The best part Is That Rand Al Thor Cleans Saidin The Male Half Of The One Power.Thats The Most Fantastik Idea For the Ongoing Story.Because Rand Coudnt have Handeld The Taint Much Longer Without Goig Mad.And Also The Danger Was To Great That The Ashaman Turned On Him.Three Allready Did.Now rand Has A Strong Support From The Ashaman.He Don\`t Need To Worry So Much About Them Anymore.And Its About Time Cadsuane Teached Rand How To Laugh And Cry Again.Before He Turns To Stone.That The Three Woman Agreed To Marry Him All I Think Is Great.Rand Coudn\`t Ask For better Wifes Than This Incredible Three Woman(Elayne,Aviendha,And Min).And Mat Found The Daughter Of The Nine Moons At A Time He Would Never Believed Possible.And He Had Even To Kidnapp Here When He Escaped.Fantastik Story telling From Robert Jordan.To Read How The Fought Eachother And mat Always Thinking Why She Was Interested In Him And Even Wanted To Buy Him.Its Deliciously Funny To Read That.And Also When The Three Girls Bonded Rand And Elayne Made Love With Rand.And Aviendha And Min And Brigitte Saw And Feeling Everything In There Head Was Great And Very Funny To Read.If You Never Read Any Book Of This Serieal.Than Don,t Start With This Book.Start From Number One(The Eye Of The World)Believe Me You Want To Read All The Books Once You Started Its The Best Fantasy Books I Ever Read Thogeter With The Lord Of The Rings.But If You Start In The middle Like With Number 5 Book Or Wathever It Is Difficult To Get In To It.It Is Written As One Story So It Usless To Start In The Middle Read Them All I Have And I Am Waiting Very Hard For The Next Book Number Then.I Hope It Comes Soon.I Want To Know How Rand Is Feeling Now With The Taint Gone.And The Other Ashaman Also.Also Perrin And Mat And Faille And Nynaeve And Egwene And All The Rest Of Course."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I just finished book nine, and I enjoyed it. I am new at reading Jordan's books. I bought all nine books started with the first one and in just under five months read all nine. I am now like everyone else waiting for book ten. I wish in book nine Jordan would have brought all the main plots and sub plots a little further along. I was disappointed that Perrin did not take his wife back, now that has to drag out I hope in book ten. Of course Jordan always leaves one main character out so Perrin might have to wait until book what twelve or thirteen to get his wife back. In book eight he left Mat out. In the Dragon Reborn book, which should have been called the history of the White Tower, Rand was mentioned in about five lines, the book states it's the Dragon Reborn, yea on the last page Rand says I am the Dragon Reborn woopie. In this book Jordan left out the rebel Asedi taking the white tower, in the next book he might leave Ran out because he just cleaned the male half and what better way to drag this out than to make another White Tower book. Why is Jordan so in love with the White Tower how boring, Rand and Mat are what make me read on. I would wish book ten would include everything all plots and sub plots complete updates and some resolutions. Mat finds his wife finally and that ends, Rand cleans the male half then that part of the book ends, Perrin is searching for his wife, that part ends. It was nice to see allot of Rand in this book. I hope book ten is at least 1500 pages and not a lot of the dribble, Jordan can describe a room alone and take up ten pages, who cares what's hanging on the walls just get to the story, in book ten I want to see some action and the main plots to get advanced way more than they did in book nine. I know I am like every one else that I am tired of this dragging on I hope he writes 20 books in this series there is enough plots to do it, still each book should advance a little more of the main story a little faster. If Jordan drags this out to 100 books I will read them all just get on with it. Also have book ten out next year this every two years gets old. King with his stupid Dark Tower series has lost me for ever because he wont finish it up, he's the worst."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I started reading the series about a year ago--Not realizing it wasn't yet finished! I've also read the first 1 1/2 books of Martin's &quot;Song of Ice and Fire&quot;. You cannot compare the two--Martin's series is all about sex and violence. The characters don't become half as developed as Jordan's. RJ has taken his characters and given them life, not made them 1 dimensional characters.Yes, he is taking the long way around -- but then, he knows where it is heading and what needs to happen along the way. Several things are predictable, but then he'll throw in a surprise or two as well. Sure it would nice to have an end --just for &quot;closure&quot;--but it's been a fun journey for me so far, I'm &quot;content&quot; to sit back and enjoy my ride. If you can't enjoy the trip, maybe you'd better get off and quit telling those of us who enjoy it how miserable you are."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Instead of this story coming to any resolutions the author add move plots and sub-plots and characters until you cannot even keep up. I will not continue reading this series. After the last book which went absolutely nowhere I was hoping this one would."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I Have to agree with North Olmstead, Ohio, the series has gone down hill since book 7, i am really tired of reading about all the pretty dresses the ladies are wearing. Get on with story of Rand and finish it off, it's time to start something new. BTW, George RR Martin has passed you by Mr Jordan, he is a great storyteller. Bring it on George, i'll have plenty of cash now that i'm not buying WOT anymore."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have some very mixed feelings about this book. The first 600 pages or so was utter drivel and should not have existed at all; NOTHING happened. Literally NOTHING. Not a single mentionable thing occured during them. Mat was discovered in Ebou Dar. He tried to get out. Perrin prepared to go after the Shaido. Elayne prepared to take the crown of Andor. Egwene prepared to attack the White Tower. The Forsaken weren't mentioned. The Seanchan stayed put. It took 600 pages to move everybody to Far Madding. Nothing happened there. The first 600 pages could have been removed in its entirety and it wouldn't affect the plot at all. It was the worst 600 pages I have ever read.That said, the last 50 pages were unbelievably good. Something happened, something momentous. The last 50 pages contained some of the best writing RJ has ever produced. It was stunning. Buy this book, if only for the last 50 pages."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The wheel of time series. Loved the first few books - but really, I started getting bored after book 4. There all more or less the same after that. How many plot twists can I endure before I finally stop caring. And what the heck is the deal with Robert Jordans female characters ? Is it just me or are they schitzophranic wenches or what ?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan gives us all our favorite characters this time around. This is a much better continuation than the last book. Some conclusions to long anticipated events take place, but not enough to finish the story. It is evident that Jordan is wrapping the story up at long last and is leading us to the last battle.Clearly from the bad reviews there have been a number of readers with a sitcom length attention span, expecting a quick wrap up. Robert Jordan skillfully uses classical hero legends and weaves a complex story containing many pieces of our real world. The plots and sub plots are beginning to gel and lead into the end. If you can stretch your brain to encompass his complex macro cosmos and appreciate attention to detail then you will like the Wheel of Time series. Jordan leaves no stone unturned. He sees the value of the stories within the story. His only downfalls are he uses far too many characters, who become difficult to track in the time between books, and he uses travel as a means of moving a story along too heavily."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Like all Jordan fans, I was disappointed with Path of Daggers. Heck, even Jordan himself wasn't ready to release it. But, Winter's Heart is his redemption. He returns to the rich weavings that tied us all to this series in the beginning.If you considered giving his world up after book 8, you need to read book 9 first. Events occuring in the prologue alone are potent, and each subsequent chapter led me right into the next into the wee hours.Perrin and Egwene are a bit empty in this book. Rand is far more involved here, though the Far Madding scenes seem out of place. Perhaps the next book will clarify it. (If anyone got more out of it than I did, please e-mail me.) Matrim, as always, left me grinning, especially his final scene.I give it 4 stars. Not the best in the series, but a definite return to style. I'm going to read it again."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I finished reading Winter's Heart about two weeks ago, and decided to write a review after letting the story sink in for awhile rather than just giving my immediate reaction. On the whole, I believe this book to be better than books 7 and 8, but not on par with the first 6 of the series. I agree with many readers that the women characters follow the same mold, but I personally believe that the main downturn to this series is due to the change in Jordan's writing style (beginning around book 6). What I mean by this is the following: In the first books of the series, Jordan would switch character POV's more frequently and devote one or two chapters to a character/group and then alternate through the next character/group so as to provide the reader with more variety of situations/characters (ala George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire, which only allocates one chapter per character and then switches). Now with the later books in the series, Jordan focuses on one situation for a large portion of the book before switching to another character/group (Perrin/Faile's situation in the beginning of WH, Elayne's politics, . . . etc.). What this means is that the reader becomes &quot;bored&quot; with the situation and wants a change of setting and characters after 2 or 3 chapters. Another fault with the latest work is the editing; a very poor rush job. In addition to the decision to increase text size so as to make the book &quot;appear&quot; larger, I felt a little cheated after purchasing this expensive hardback. On the positive side, I believe that book 9 may be interpreted as &quot;the beginning of the end&quot; to this series. Jordan made it an obvious point to start clearing up more plot threads and mysteries (Forsaken) than in any previous work. Expect about four more books in the series. Oh well, just some comments . . ."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have spent much time reading this series. I started late and read the first 8 books in succession. Now, waiting for the next book and wishing for something more, I am left wanting. This book is too much. Needless detail on needless people and things. I wish that the story would start anew, as in the first few books of this series, when I cared about what was going on and who the characters actually were. But, if you are like me and have invested so much time in reading this block of books, it is hard to walk away. My shoes are on."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I would like to start out by informing that I love and hate this author. &quot;Why?&quot; you say? Because he torments us time and time again. I'm not really qualified to judge the quality of his writing from an experts point of view, but from reading my share of books I have come to this conclusion: This is a unique author!In contrast to some of the other reviewers who has followed this series for (seemingly) decades I was given my first book three months ago. This has been my LEAST productive three months of my life. But it also gave me an interesting perspective of the books and the way they are writen.1) The main plot is epic. And the Author has been able to give the readers (that's me...and hopefully you) the impression of a alive world populated by dynamic characters. Even though the portraying of the characters (especially the female ones) seems at times to be lacking. He is still is able to pull through and ends up with a world that is belivable.2) Subplots are plentyfull and diversed. What I like about them is the way they make every one of the characters seem more alive by giving them goals and history.3) There has been a few critical coments of his &quot;cut&amp;paste&quot; writing style. The way it is done leaves no doubt that the author chose that style for effect. Even though it can seem longwinded at times it enhaces the ritualistic and symbolic value of the &quot;moments&quot;.4) There is a definatly slow pace in the last couple of books in the serie. The level of detail is HUGE! The glossary is handy but you still strugle to remember details and names from a couple of books ago. The most frustrating thing is not the amount of plot details, but the 5-page description of braclets a 15-sec character is wearing. (I know, I know...builds character...but it's a bit excessive at times)As conclusion I would like to warn you. Don't by this book unless you are willing to &quot;retire&quot; from the real world for a copule of. If you are then I would suggest that you buy the book, close the drapes, call your boss and claim to have a higly contagious disease...then enter one of the most compelling universes ever created and ejoy."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan continues a tradition of excellence in this book. Aes Sedai, Seanchan, Asha'man, Darkfriends, and the Forsaken all mix together to form a dozen different storylines at once, and, typical of Robert Jordan, the good guys don't automatically win. This book, like all the others in the series, is just another volume in one long, excellent series. I personally await book 10, and all that it will entail. Readers, do not start in the middle. Start with book one, The Eye of the World! Then, continue through the rest of the series until reaching this book. You will NOT be disappointed. I've read the series about 7 times since I first got it, and I have not been disappointed."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordon goes on and on about useless and boring details which does not adhere to the standards he set earlier in the series. Very few things really happen in the book. If you want you could skip 75% of the book very easily.. I'm still a big fan of the series... but not sure how long I can keep up after last two books...Jordon, wake up...."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Almost all the main characters (only Egwene is missing) share the limelight in this important addition to the saga. There are numerous twists and turns in the tale which advance several character issues and plot directions. Rand and Nynaeve work together (actually, they've become a real action team) to bring about a fundamental change in the nature of the world. Good stuff. But then, any book that features the post-Aelfinn Mat Cauthon is good. Mat - supernaturally gifted, sardonic, witty, and yet in some ways still a naive boy from the outback - is one of the most engaging characters I have ever encountered in literature. I cannot help but laugh with gusto whenever I read about his antics, and yet admire his bravery and fortitude. Jordan has given us distinctive characters that hold together and ring true after thousands of pages. Start at the beginning, read 'em all, and reread them often. Only &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; wears as well or better. Bon voyage."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I enjoy reading the Wheel of Time, over and over. The latest installment is no exception. While many feel the books have been slowing down I disagree. I like the way Mr. Jordan is taking the time to tell the whole story. While I am tired of waiting for the next book, I find that when I re-read the first nine that I find something new each time. Most excellent reading! Mr. Jordan is to be commended for doing what only one other author has been able to do, create a world that is as real as the one we are in! J.R.R.T. was the first, there has finally been a second.Good reading."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'd just like to point out that many WOT readers are saying ridicilous things. Many start out saying things such as &quot;If I could talk to Jordan...&quot; or, &quot; If I were him..&quot; This is obviousy foolish. If you were Robert Jordan, there would be no best sellers. And if you disagree, go try it, and if you succeed, I will buy YOUR book. Personally, I think that books 6-8 in this series were less liked because they did not have non-stop action and a clear, simple plotline. But, if you really pay attention, they are merely doing very deep, involving you with the characters and their emotions. After all, what effect would a chaotic scene of violence and havoc have on you as a reader if you did not know the characters, or could relate them to yourself. Stop criticizing, or write your own books. Though I do think more saidin induced head-exploding (Dumai's Wells) would be pretty neat."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"durn that robert j. fer wratin so meny buks! this'n will be 10, an then ol Billie M. is gonna hafta get hisself somethin else to count on! this buk has them SORDs innit, which y'all yankees use to chop one tother up. boy oh, not ah shotgun, but it does the trick if'n y'all know what i mean! see, this robby j. wrat's 'bout folks a riled up over Scratch comin' back, jes laek the Rev does on Sun. but y'all yankees doan prey laek us folks, stead y'all get them SORDS outta yer closit an start yellin an hollerin somthin FIERCE. an somma y'all's weminfolk start usin that there majik tu. an scratch, He's not to keen on alla that so he starts blastin an cursin' uppa storm on y'all.

I've bought each of the volumes in HB as they were released, and I don't want to add up the total I've spent. I loved the first few volumes, but they've gone downhill from there. &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; is better than &quot;Path of Daggers,&quot; but not by much."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've been reading the Wheel of Time series since the summer of 1990 when I was introduced to it by a close friend. Having read most of the &quot;Names&quot; in fantasy up till then and disliked many of them due to simplistic plots and characterization, I found Robert Jordan to be refreshing. Each year and then every other year I have awaited the release of the next volume of the series. I agree that Path of daggers was not the best book in the series, though not as poorly written as many make it out once the epectation of a two year wait has subsided. But overall these books have been fantastic as far as characterization, realism of politics, and general mythic quality, much more so than the ridiculous and often pathetic offerings from others in this genre. And to those of you who continue to say the series is running too long I must say - Get an attention span! So what if the series take 20 years from start to finish.Just because you are used to instant gratification from television doesn't mean RJ should wrap this up in some fashion so you can forget about it. I am perfectly happy to allow him the time to finish the story as intended.I only gave the book a 3 star review because I have only read the first 80 pages or so and am reserving judgement until I have finshed. But I wanted to tell the fans reading the review that Mat is definitely in this book and the review that states otherwise must have been written by someone on crack. I know this because I flipped through the book looking for his symbol at the chapter headings. There seems to be numerous chapters with his symbol or where he was mentioned. Yes, I peeked so sue me."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Like a lot of other reviewers, I find this series more irritating as it goes along. It gets really confusing - you read pages not having a clue who you're reading about until suddenly you remember, or you read something that rings a bell, and you have to go back and reread it. A full list of characters at the back of the book would help, and also maybe a synopsis...."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"My wife got me hooked on \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series - I thought for years they were just more of her romantic novels. Then I started reading them. I was astonished by the first several books, finding a world to rival Tolkien's! Characters to care about and root for! Descriptions of places and events to surpass others I had read.But now I have become concerned that I am reading \\"the never ending story\\"! Particularly after \\"Winter's Heart\\", I am concerned I shall loss patience and never know what became of our heroes as I've lost track of the subplots - actually resorting to a synopsis I found on the web to try to figure out what was going on!The last 50 pages were tremendous but it took perseverence to get there.Other authors that I enjoy, such as McCaffery, Modesitt and Goodkind, want to tell a story while Jordan seems more intent on confusing me with a myriad of subplots, similar names, and repetion."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I did not find Jordan's latest offering as tedious as many reviewers seemed to, but I must say that there is now simply too much (and too little)going on: We have Perin wondering about, hunting the Shaido; Rand on a quest to cleanse the Source; Mat is sitting in Ebou Dar, planning his escape; and Elaine is flapping about in Caemlyn trying to secure her throne. These main plot strands, the huge number of sub-plots (sundry scheming Aes Sedai, the Black Tower, the Forsaken, Padan Fain, Isam, and so on), as well as the multiple changes of perspective, leave one a little frustrated. Perin is simply abandoned in the first third of the book, and Elaine is no closer to securing her hold on Andor when she leaves the stage(Jordan could really have cut down this particular portion). Jordan also leaves hanging the multiple sub-plots that are simply dropped in at the outset, and fails to pick up strands left hanging in the previous books (Egwene and her war with Elaida for instance). Generaly, the individual tales told book 9 are intersting, but the overall plot movement is glacial. I really wish that Jordan would churn out his books faster, or that he would write a monstrous 5000 page book that gets things back on track again! Also, I am (like many others, I'm sure) loosing track of many minor characters (especially the multitude of Aes Sedai who seem to be popping up everywhere): a detailed &quot;Who's Who&quot; in the glossary at the back would be incredibly useful!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"In WOT book 9 Jordan seems to have a new found interest in the intricate, minor,infintesimal workings of politics. This book is loaded with details on how Elayne is supposed to get the lion throne. The first half of the book was about as boring as anything, including textbooks, that I have read. It gets somewhat more interesting in the middle and catches a glimpse of some of the earlier books' action scenes at the end. A total of about three weeks passes in this book. It needs to go faster if any of the characters have a hope of getting to the end of the story, or any of us. At this rate we will all be old and grey before this series ends. Bottom line is that I think Jordan was rushed into writing this book by Tor and his writing has suffered. If that is not the case then I shudder at the other possibility that Jordan has run out of wick to burn with his writing flame. If Jordan wants to keep as large a fan base as he currently has then he needs to step it up and feed us more."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I must say that after reading all of the books in the series up until now, I am very disappointed. Even though the ending of this book is OK, there are still to many unanswered questions, too many sub stories to follow. In his first few books of the series, I enjoyed the plots because they were relatively few and easy to follow. Now though, there are too many plots and questions; when is the series going to actually approach some sort of ending? The way things are going, it will take another 9 books, especially if Jordan continues to answer half the questions posed by previous books and introduces more than were answered. I really wish I could give the book more stars but in good conscience, I can't."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Nearly 800 pages and only one major event took place in this book. Ever since the dragon reborn, this series has begun to drag....and drag!. It took 300 pages in Winters Heart for anything significant to occur. The book kept my interest....but just barely. Robert Jordan spends entirely too much time setting the scene and describing the battles of will between the HUNDREDS of characters is these books. It is nearly impossible to keep every character straight. I very nearly did not purchase this book because of the same long windedness in the previous 6 books. If this series extends beyond 10 books, I will give up on Robert Jordan and the Wheel of Time series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The Bad:I refuse to reread the whole series just to read the next installment. With that said, I picked up book 9 and started reading. The major characters, I remembered. The minor ones, I had no clue until something obvious was mentioned. There are so many characters with simialar names - I must admit I was confused. RJ must have a huge map, with little models of tons of people with little name tags - just to keep straight who he is writing about and where they are. I do feel the story has spun out of control. There seems to be a gazillion characters and plots going on. I do not see how he can wrap this up anytime soon. And with a book coming out every two years - it drives me nuts. What if he gets hit by a bus? I guess I just want him to finish the blasted series.The Good:We did get almost 800 pages of story. We finally got back to Mat. I think Mat is my favorite character. Rand's story was furthered. I enjoy the writing style, I think the world is interesting, the major characters are interesting. The book did leave me wanting to read more. The most frustrating thing is that the work is not yet complete. I agree with most of the reviewers, books 1-4 were great, books 5-8 expanded the universe, and now book 9. It held it's own, only introducing a few more characters.For me, I will wait for paperback and for the series to finish before re-reading all from start to finish."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It has to be said that volumes 7 and 8 where quite poor. Poor in the sense that little happened. Jordan is a master in expanding a paragraph into a chapter (a crime that occurs in Book 9. The foreward falls into this category. How many pages does it take for Perrin to walk up one hill?).However book 9 is a breath of fresh air after the previous 2 stagnant installments. The plot picks up, characters actually do things. The ending is gripping. However the book overall does not match the intensity that Jordan managed in the first 6 books.Taim finally shows his colours (as if we did not know them but at least he is not Demandred, that would have been to much for some).Is this series out of the doldrums or was book 9 just a faint breeze that managed to toss briefly the large ship that Jordans series has become?Jordan has to recapture the old intensity of his earlier volumes, increase the size of the next installment and make sure the plot picks up speed both in plot lines and time span. If not this ship might sink without a trace!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I must have read the ending at least 20 times!

I haven't had a chance to re-read the series like many of my fellow fans but I've developed an insight into this through the speed at which I've read the book.1) the quality of the books has been diminishing 2) jordan should attempt to have more plot movement in each book 3) much of the time jordan seems have &quot;add-ons&quot;...things that were never introduced originally but as afterthoughts...of course after which they come to drive the plot 4) Is it really necessary to raise the Forsaken back from the dead? I mean, c'mon there was a point at which I decided to tally the progression of the series through their deaths but after Crown of Swords it became ludicrous. 5) Mr. Jordan, please please, please do not leave loose ends over the course of three or four books...i forgot that some of those loose ends even existed. So for the love of god try to end most loose ends within the 1000 odd pages each book containsI'm still reading the series, although I hope the quality will improve back to the level of books 4 &amp; 5, because I just need to find out what happens next.

The tip off that this book was going to be more of the same nonsense is the title - Winters Heart. Very exciting, huh? In the future, if there is no verb in the title, I'm going to think twice about buying any book.Jordan seems to get some perverse pleasure by creating endless new characters who are virtually undistinguishable from other characters - there must be 1,000 by now. Who cares about them?Imagine the excitement and power of a final book that resolved all of the major prophecies. If Jordan had decided to make a 5-book series, we would be happily into the sequels 5-book series now. There is absolutely no point to a 10,11,12. . .part series, other than to be greedy and an egomaniac.Jordan could have been *THE* Fantasy writer of the century - but he continues to diminish himself by dragging this out and spoonfeeding us bits and pieces."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I agree with Rich from Canada. Not again..., November 18, 2000 I was disappointed with Crown of Swords and Winter's Heart is even further evidence that Mr Jordan has run out of ideas or is trying to milk the series for all the money he can get. This series has become a soap opera with no action, no plot, and no momentum; &quot;just endless scenes of pointless bickering, traveling, and whining, with a tiny bit of action thrown in at the end of each book&quot;. I will wait until the next one is in the library before reading it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I didn't feel too good after reading this book. It seemed like this book was leading to nothing until the last 3 chapters. If Fain's letters can cause that much action, he needs to start a chain letter. What was Jordan thinking with this book, he could've easily added another 400 pages and gotten something done. I have also noticed the size of the type is ALOT larger than that of Lord of Chaos. Is Tor forcing him to meet deadlines? Or is he just getting greedy? I thought the Path of Daggers was a good book because of the fighting with the Seanchan throughout the book and then the attack at the end. But this book is something different. There was no action until the Choedan Kal and the only thing that was accomplished was the cleansing of saidin (possibly). Faile was taken in the Path of Daggers and Jordan wastes almost 10 chapters on the subject and nothing came from it. Elayne got a little closer to getting Andor but Jordan needs to remember that the main topic is Tarmon Gaidin, not Andor. Mat's case was somewhat interesting but it lacked any action besides a half page with the gholam. Finally, the inside jacket says the White Tower would be shaken to the core when the rebels appear outside. Umm... Where was that, did I miss a chapter or something? Mr. Jordan needs to actually accomplish something when he writes. Otherwise, it is all senseless gibberish that I could write."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I felt the same way most people did about the last two books, but then I re-read them in preparation for Winter's Heart and now I love them as much as the rest of the series. Winter's Heart continues the many complex stories started in the previous books. You finally get to see whatever happened to Mat, you learn more about Cyndane, the Daughter of the Nine Moons and you get to see how each character has really changed since the first book.The series does seem to be moving towards some conclusion but there could be several more books. I'm running out of space on my shelves. Back to waiting and re-reading for a few more years."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is yet another in what's become a looooong line of:1) Jordan's introduction of dozens and dozens of irrelevant characters2) Eyeball-glazing descriptions of irrelevant places & items3) Fights with the forsaken that end in either escape or are reincarnated by the dark one4) Expounding upon a dizzying array of barely relevant subplots5) RJ expecting author-worship for every tree-killing page he spews forthI humbly propose a boycott on this series until the story is moved substantially closer to it's finish."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok, i have read books 1 through 10. everyone of them is great. i say this because i read alot and, i have never read a series that keeps me up later than this. Many people say that the books ater about book six or so are boring i say to them, (clears throat) \\"READ THE BOOKS\\". Am i the only person here who actually likes a story to go on awhile so im not left wondering what ever happened to timmy and lassie at this part, or why did Anakin really become Darth Vader. A good book is more than blowing the world to smithereans a few time with the Power. I think Jordan does this great he understands what an intelligent reader wants to know about. Its called fullfilment and you cant get that through nonstop sword fights and blowing crap up with your mind. my advice if you are wanting to get into a really good fantasy series with alot and i do mwan ALOT of detail pick up the first book read it pick up the nest read it etc. by the time you are at book 10 trust me you wont be sorry. That is if you like to read. its no Drzzt smacking around dark elves and orcs 24-7-365. But it is and intellgint story that will have you hooked every page of the way. Of course you might say, \\"well Bobby Joe (names have been changed just to add humor or something like it) if it is so gosh darn golly jeepers swello than why did you give it 4 out of 5 stars\\". well let me tell you in case you havnt gotten itby already reading a few reviews Jordan is a bit long winded i dont really think it detracts from the story but i dont really need a detailed analysis of every thread in every pice of cloth that exist in every room or what that nancy is enjoys embroidery and knitting she is a single woman of the age of thirty-five who likes long walk in the parks and participates in the semi-anual curling for dis advantaged female teens event and smooths her dress and yanks her braid when she is mad. If you can just take a little time (or do what i do when he starts one of these discrptions find the end of the paragraph see if in the last sentance is still explaining what Phyllis had for breakfast that morning and what she normally has and how this is making her nervous. If he still is just move on. It helps alot). Ok i know alot of you are like :GASP: he skips things how awfull!!!. but hey it doesnt hurt no one and it helps you go to bed by like 3:00am instead of 6:00am. Bottom line is sit down enjoy the narrative it really is genius the way everything conncects in some way. and yes even Nynaeves braid tuggin has a bit of a barring on the story so dont skip to much. the series is long enjoy the fact that you dont have to spend endless hours trying to find some else to read because you already have a book that will last awhile. But really read the books you wont be disapointed. If you are try reading R.A. Salvatores Drzzt Series. Its very exciting. but as i mentioned before Jordan tells a story whereas others explain sword fights."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have to say that while reading the first few books in this series I was already aware that some of later books were not being held in as high regard as the first five or so books. I saw some of the reviews here on Amazon for COS, POD, WH, etc.. It had me worried, but at the same time I wasn't going to let it stop me from reading on. Well, I just finished Winter's Heart and once again, I finished as a more than satisfied reader. The last chapter in this book \\"With the Choedan Kal\\" is one of the best I have ever encountered in the fantasy genre! After nine books, I really care about all these characters and I am anxious for R. Jordan to lead me even further in this incredible series. And unlike some others, I'm patient enough to just let it take it's course. Maybe I'm at an advantage because I've been able to read the books one after another. For me, the Wheel of Time has never ground to a halt, it's been rolling right along and I have been thoroughly enjoying the ride!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I quickly became a fan of Jordan at the onset of the WoT series. I had read some of his other stuff, jumped headlong into this particular series, and quickly became miffed around book six.While I enjoy the plot, the neverending line of new characters, subplots, minor drivel between inconsequential characters and a diluted diatribe have turned me off.Jordan doesn't keep the reader enthralled at this junction in the series. It is quite beyond time to wrap this series up and move on. DO NOT begin this lump of work unless you enjoy the aforementioned.With the amount of time I've invested, I'll continue the series, but I don't recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The 'action' and 'movement' in this book were just to set up book 10 so RJ could sell a few more copies ala &quot;When we last left our intrepid hero.&quot; (Something he's been in the habit of doing since Dumai Wells at least). Knowing what we know now, the story isn't a decology, and faced with the crisis of being caught extending this series ad naseaum and not being able to sell book 11 he rolls out a prequel to prove to us he can still advance a plot. The problem is he won't do too much in book 11 or the series will be done before he dies/book 30 (whichever comes first). Jordan is playing us for suckers. This series is a train wreck and the engineer is still asleep."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"A welcome return to the series after a long wait for number 9. It was VERY good to see Mat again, as he's brought some life back into the story line. I was a little disappointed that Jordan stranded Perrin and never looked in on him again, but I expect he knows where he's going. I am still waiting for Moirane, as it is so obvious she will turn up one day. As for all the Forsaken being part of a huge transmigration program, can we please have some information on this? I can't be the only person completely swamped. One thing that must be a sure-fire sign of a good writer is that I was nearly at the end and hadn't noticed how much I had read. As an aspiring writer, I demand to know how he does that. I must agree with another reviewer, there are too many characters, and I can't remember Teslyn from Tylin, or Merilille from Myrelle, but all the important people are still there.I'm hoping book 10 will be getting towards wrapping the whole thing up, as I am beginning to feel he just wants to string it out as long as possible. Yes books take as long as they need to tell a story and not a letter less, but that doesn't mean the plot can walk in circles for ages. I would like to know what happened to Egwene at the White Tower, and what's happened to Perrin, and there is a strange lack of Trollocs....I have recently started a new series called Swords of Life and Death. The first book The Price of Immortality was like nothing I have read before but again I find myself waiting for the sequel. huh, oh well. hopefully C.M. Whitlock will churn them out faster than Jordan."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok here is the deal about Jordan...Ever since book 4 he has gradually started to slow down the overall plot of his story. perhaps he thought he could become famous, or rich (or both) by stretching the books out. Really all he has done is earned some criticism from readers. Books 1-4 were perfect, the ultimate combination of danger, action, twists and character development. But after reading book nine, you really don't see as much of that. Here is what you see. Matt has turned from adventurous to dull in the past two books, currently he was with a small portion of his band fighting constantly, now he is sleeping in the palace every night with Tylin. It has literally turned in to a romance novel the 10 chapters that matt appears. On the other hand Perrin hasn't been seen since chapter 1 or 2 or 3. I believe the book would have turn out great if it would have gone into the chasing and rescuing of Faile. Instead it drops the characters for the rest of book. Rand Is the only person who makes any sort of change what so ever. Even if it is only little tad bits of things. The editorial and reviews get you all built up about how Rand running away with Min is all great and exciting really...in till the last few pages it doesn't go anywhere, and he stops at Elyane's palace to be wed to the three girls, who after word they sleep together. So it seems to me that the story has turned from a sweet and fun fantasy. To a dull and unmoving Romance story! I hope this review helped you in terms of buying or renting Book 9 in the series. I am 12 years old and this is my review"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I can understand readers being frustrated at Jordan over books 7 &amp; 8 which were terrible (I didn't care for #4 either), but Winter's Heart is a definite improvement and probably ranks in the top 3 or 4 for the series. Throughout the book, you get the distinct impression that Jordan is finally pulling together all the loose threads and subplots. The ending in particular is a real rush, reminiscent of the ending in _Lord of Chaos_, plus it's one of the most significant plot advancement to occur in the series. I could see the series coming to a satisfactory conclusion in 2 to 3 books. That said, I have two complaints about this book. First, Jordan continues his usual pattern of filling 80% of the book with drawn out descriptions of uninteresting events. When significant events occur, they are usually glossed over in a few pages. Secondly, Jordan introduces several characters who are stronger in the Power than Nynaeve/Egwene/Elayne. This was totally unnecessary. Nynaeve in particular seems to have become almost completely irrelevent over the last few books - I would take the old annoying Nynaeve over the new impotent Nynaeve anyday. Anyway, if you are reading this review, you probably haven't totally abandoned Jordan, so give Winter's Heart a try."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book is a breath of fresh air compared to the last two. Jordan finally begins to make the plot move again, though not as well as in some of the earlier books. I wish the book could have been a little bit longer, and wrapped up some more plotlines, but it really was excellent."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The title says it all. For everyone who wanted Rand to meet up Elayne and Aviendha, to see what would happen when Elayne tries to make him her Warder, to find out what happened to Mat after the wall fell on him in the Crown of Swords, who the Daughter of the Nine Moons is, you HAVE TO GET THIS BOOK. My previous favorite book was Lord of Chaos, mostly because of the shocking ending. That was nothing. The final chapter of this 650ish page book, 'With the Choedan Kal', is simply AMAZING. Downside to the book you may ask? Well, for those of you who are diehard Perrin fans, you are going to be disappointed with his brief appearance in this book, despite the cover. Also, Egwene is in the book even less. However, as I said, Mat gets more of the spotlight after being noticably absent for the last book. While only being 100 or so pages longer than Path of Daggers, this book has many major events. Oh yeah...that ending is quite a doozie. In case you can't tell, I finished the book minutes ago, and that ending was just...I can't give anything away, but it makes apparently fundamental changes in the structure of Jordan's Wheel of Time world."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I can't believe the people who say that nothing happened in this book. After two very slow, uncentered-around-the-main-character installments,(which were also very necessary in mine opinion)Mr. Jordan starts off with a promise in the prologue: &quot;I am going to ....&quot; and Rand fulfills that promise. Basically, he said this is my target, and I WILL take it down. And then he does take it down. The time in between the prologue and the last chapter is generally well-spent, particularly the chapters involving Mat. The couple chapters about Perrin weren't bad either, and this is the first book since The Shadow Rising where all three of the main characters are advanced in one volume. Yes, Perrin is not taking as many or as big of steps as Rand or Mat, but he is still advancing. Plus Rand and Lan work together again toward the end of this book. Plus there is the last chapter With The Choedan Kal where Rand services the target selected in the prologue......No, Robert Jordan is not writing a soap opera, and no he is not writing/riding a cash cow. He is creating a universe so that he may tell a story and somehow I doubt that those who give these books bad ratings have done much writing. As a would be author I have tried to write a universe to tell my story, and it is not an easy feat. If I wrote a story half as complicated as Mr.Jordan's and wrote it half as well I would not be ashamed. Two-thirds as well and I would be pleased. To those who give this series less than three stars, please, be patient. This is not a martial arts movie or an action film. He is trying to tell a story and that is not very easy to do. If he does not put enough detail in it, he may as well have left it at the good-guys win/the bad guys lose."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I must say that Robert Jordan has such a vivid idea of his world that it really does come to life on the pages. People who complain about too many characters and the complicated plot can go and read picture books and fairy tales. My only concern now is that Mr. Jordan may well die before the conclusion of this story (especially if he writes other books in the meantime) and that would be a tradgedy.All I can say is hurry up!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This series is easily one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. I would rate the author on a par with Tolkien. Having read some of the other reviews of book nine, and the asides about the previous 3 or 4 books in the series, it would appear that rich characterizations, which make the people in the book come to life, pall on some of the readers. The same with the intricate and realistic plotting, with multiple threads. Personally, I find this much more 'true-to-life' than most novels. I have read the entire series back-to-back-to-back 4 times and find more in it each and every time I go through it. This, notwithstanding, having read some of the earlier titles as many as 10 or more times.The series does require an investment of time and energy. The biggest problem is getting caught up in the plots and personalities. But that is the way life is. You get what you pay for, and pay for what you get."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have read all 9 volumes of the Wheel of Time saga. The fantasy world that has been described in these books by Robert Jordan is unique and wonderful. Too bad that the same cannot be said for the story line. These is essentially no plot movement in this book. There is no resolution to any of the dilemmas set up in the previous book. The writing is getting repetitive. Characters no longer develop, but go through the same motions over and over. While there is an interesting climax to this book, all of the action that occurs could have been described in 50 or 60 pages. The rest is just fluff. I wonder if the number of subplots has gotten so out of hand that the author can no longer keep track of them. Or perhaps he has no further ideas for the story, so keeps all of the subplots going without resolution. To keep our interest, Mr. Jordan needs to move things along. How many books will there be in the series? At the rate the action moves in volume 9, no end is in sight."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Like most people, I thought that this book had continued a bad trend started in the last few books of the series, namely that 700 pages or so have been used to forward the story only a few months at best. The problem, I think, lies not so much in that Jordan has become weak, but in that he has been too successful in the earlier books. At this point we know the characters as well as we do some of our friends in the real world. By this point we almost know what they will do before they get to it themselves. So now, more character development doesn't work to keep our interest...they are already about as developed as you can get, barring actually producing them in real life. So now, only raw events will serve to keep the series going, and these are markedly lacking until the end. Fortunately, Jordan finally delivers, even if it takes him almost the whole book to finally stop the characters' endless self-discovery. By the time I was done with the last few chapters, I was once again hooked, as I had been in the first books. Finally something happens that will firmly steer the series back to the path.The next book promises to be action packed, as Rand is moved firmly along his way with his three women now resolutely with him, the intermixing of the fates of Rand, Mat, and Perrin is finally hinting at closure (with the strange &quot;colors&quot; that all are sensing), the Chosen come out of hiding, Egwene (though not active in this installment) is finally shifted to the White Tower, Mat has encountered the Daughter of the Nine Moons, Elayne is about to be crowned, Perrin is about to deal with the Shaido thereat, Masema seems to be very close to being dealt with, and all of the other characters are moved to their proper supporting places in the fight to get to the Last Battle. Though it takes a long, drawn-out series of pages to do it, this book sets us up for what will be an absolutely thrilling last couple of books.It may seem pointless to read a book in which so little of the plot actually gets resolved, but after such a lengthy story to get to this point, it HAS to take a whole book in order to set us up for the end. I'd rather Jordan get all of this material out of the way now so that it isn't there to clutter up what bodes to be a fantastic end. So stick in there, folks, buy this book to keep you up to date on the relevent details, and try to withstand the wait for the next installation of one of the finest fantasy epics yet written."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I started this series many moons ago when the first book came out. Since years pass between the release of each book, I'm losing track of the characters, plots, and which book I'm on. I don't think it's a lack of intelligence or reading ability on my part--I have a bachelor's degree in English and an MBA.Meanwhile, I can't help but notice that Mim gets glimpses of the future, but it's a future that shows no sign of coming about."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I hope that our Mr.Jordan has made enough money off of books 8 and 9 of The Wheel of Time series. And can now settle down and actually write a 10th. book that has someone doing something or going some where that has somthing to do with all the many plots and subplots that has had us all captivated, for the first 7 of his books.but still i think that i will check the 10th. book out of the library, when it comes out. And not put anymore money in Mr. Jordans pocket until he proves that he deserves it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Oh you whiners out there! I have read so many reviews that talk about how &quot;the series started getting slow at book 5&quot;. Well WHY ARE YOU STILL READING?! Yeesh! As for me, I'm still a die hard fan. I loved the book. And the subplots? I think they're great. If you can't handle a more complicated story like &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; that requires more than just minimal attention, then go read something else. Jordan's truly creating a world here. He goes on to describe things in such in depth detail because WoT is set in a thousand places that are completely different from where we live. Personally, I rather like it. It lets you feel like you're truly submerged into the story and really get to know about certain cultures and certain types of people. When he says a woman's a domani, you know exactly what he's talking about. It's much more interesting than just having him describe each individual the same old boring way. Not everything has to be just fast paced action all the time..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"In all my years of reading, I have come to the conclusion that no writter is capable of keeping a story going longer than 3 books. I don't know if I will be able to finish this one. It has so many meaningless plots and characters that its impossible to keep up with what's going on. And in a lot of parts there is a lot of dialog or whatever and nothing happens. Parts of the book seem to exist that should have been removed by an editor. What I would love to know is, where was Jordan going early on. Did he loose the original idea? Anyway, I'm sorry to say. Don't buy this book. If you have to read it. Go to a library or borrow it from some poor fool who bought it like me..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm not going to tell you anything different from the other million reviewers on here. In a nutshell, very little happens in this book to further the story that Jordan began so promisingly... NINE books and more than three THOUSAND pages ago. He hops around in the story like a child that's eaten too many sweets, and manages to move his plot lines along not a whit. If you've read this far in the series you'll probably finish this novel and read the next when it comes out. You won't really enjoy it though. Even Rand, who I thought was the most exciting character to follow in the first seven books, is flat and one dimensional. So, I will await the next book, without bated breath, and will purchase it despite the queasy feeling in my stomach brought on by the thirty dollar price tag. Oy!And apparently those fellows at Tor were awful rushed trying to get this masterpiece out for Christmas judging by all those typos."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After 9 books, I can understand the concern of readers complaining that the series doesnt seem to come to an end and also that Robert Jordan is trying to make money by giving us such a a large picture of the whole story arounr Rand that we are getting nowhere... We do not really know the real intentions of Robert Jordan.But i am going to tell you now why after 9 books I still like to read his saga... First of all, he is really talented in developing all the different main characters of the series. And the fact that there are so many gives him of course also the possibility to develop sub-plots that my not be really linked too closely to the story arc, but which allow us to learn more about that person throughout the books.I guess we need to have a different approach for these series. You cannot really compare it to the Lord of the Rings, a bit more than 1000 pages for the whole Journey of the Ring. The perspective of Jordan's series is much larger.So I advise readers of the Wheel of Time series to consider this series not really like a long novel, but more like a typical TV soap opera... The story arch is on a very long time horizon with many charactes showing up and disappearing again, with different places where the action happens etc... If you take that approach, you dont really mind that there are already 9 books and that the end is not clear yet. As for myself, I rarely read Jordan's books from the first to the last page without interruption. Its more a lecture over several weeks and months, now and then 20 to 50 pages, a bit like I would watch different episodes of that series.And under that perspective, it is a pleasure to know that there will be more books coming, like you hope that there will be a new season of your favorite TV show.I guess it is a matter of taste. And I certainly dont blame anyone who tells Jordan to finally get to the point. As a consolation there are many high level fantasy novels with more action and a shorter story line available..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well finally, is all I can say!Well maybe I can say a little more than that....it feels as thought Mr Jordan has finally done something to take us a few steps closer to the original goal, set out way back in the first novels!! I think the last two or three books have spent far too much time getting involved with characters who do not seem to play that much of an important part of the goal, and he did spend sometime in this latest book doing the same, but at least we had a few good pages towards the end of it all!I felt that his writing seemed less intense in this book, and no I don't believe someone else wrote the book, because he still has the same writing style, it just seemed as thought he spent less time with it than with the previous ones, which I can almost say is a relief, as there is less to follow!Don't get me wrong I love the story, he is an amazing writer and to be able to keep the plot going for so long without totally losing sight of the end is amazing, but I just wish that he could squish the contents down, with less characterisation and a little more action.From a females point of view I can't say that I really approve of Rand's character having three female lovers, for some reason this produces a strange instinct to yell and scream at him for being a masogonistic dinosaur! And I find the females to be very irritating, and sometimes stop and wonder if this book is written by a female, a very dominating female at that! But then I stop and think about how he seems to perceive the woman as being bossy and highly irritating and I realise that it could only have been written by a man! I mean what happened to Lan he seems to spend most of the book hiding behind Nynaeves skirts, come on really, he surely has a better role to play in this than that!Ok I'm sorry but I had to get that off my chest, I hope the next book with follow as with this one, if only to take another step in the write direction with less characters and more plot!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Another disappointment. What Jordan does in 100 words, most authors do in 10. This series started out great but in the last few books, it's just dragged on. I have about 10 years into this series and I'm just about at the point of saying enough is enough. There has been so many characters and subplots introduced it's difficult to figure out what's happened between books. It's almost as if Jordan does not know where he's going with it and hoping he will think up something. In the meantime, he is getting rich writting crap. Get with it Jordan and move this series along."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This series started out fantastically, but having read Terry Goodkind(now that's a man that knows how to save a series!) and others, Jordan is a waste of my time. This is the first book I will have ever only partially read. I've read 200 pages or so and have agonized over those. See ya 'round Jordan."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I was one of the many disgusted with the lack of plot in books seven and eight of The Wheel of Time. With this book, the march toward the end of the world is at last back on track. Furthermore, as some of the arcs begin to get wrapped up, what seemed like &quot;dragging&quot; in the earlier books bothers me less.Having re-read the entire series, I'm now convinced that the slow pacing of the books is a necessary evil. The action now spans almost the entire civilized world, with a huge cast, and there simply isn't room in one book to cover all the different elements that are in play. That makes each book feel like there should be more, but the overall story remains rich and compelling.As other reviewers have noted, we won't truly be able to enjoy the tale until we can read it all in one go rather than waiting for years between books. However, Winter's Heart gives me new hope that the final result won't be a letdown."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I just started reading this series a few months ago and have loved all the books so far. I have to agree with a lot of my fellow readers that Mr. Jordan has wandered too much. I just want at least one plot to end. What in the world do Mat and Perrin mean to Rand? Who were they in their former lives? I haven't read Winter's Heart yet, and for that matter, I haven't even read the eighth book yet. The Aiel women around Rand change too much. And I could go on and on. I think this is a fantastic series, but could use a lot of answers to a lot of questions. I will continue to read the series, and I do love all the characters. I even dream about them. I recommend the series to all fantasy lovers. Just hang in there. I know it will come around to an ending somewhere."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have been a huge fan of the WOT until the last two books. The sub plots and lack of motion is getting on my nerves. Jordan spends the first 2/3 droning on about Elayne and her becoming the Queen of Andor. And stops! She doesn't even become queen in this book. I read early info on this book and expected Perrin and Mat to do some significant things, NOPE! The only significant chapter in the book is the last one. Got to the book store and read the last 20 or so pages and you'll be caught up on the WOT world."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I think most people who are expecting an end to this series are missing Jordan's stated intentions here. He repeats at the beginning of every book that, to paraphrase, The Wheel Of Time never ends, it just revolves back around again. Jordan has no intention of writing a final book in teh series. And why should he, you keep buying each book as it comes out, don't you? Talk about your job security! The man is a genius!But who cares? Think of it as a soap opera - they never end, either, and that's one of the things that keeps viewers coming back for more. So what? This series is written better than anything else out there. It is safe to say he has surpassed Tolkien. There is no one out there writing stuff this rich, this engaging, this enthralling, this compelling.So sit back and enjoy! Where's the rush! How many times have you read a book so lovely you never wanted it to end? The Wheel Of Time is just that never-ending story!My only complaint is that it is very hard to keep track of everyone and everything in the year or two between the release of volumes. I think he should include a brief \\"What Has Gone Before\\" type of foreword to each book to at least help us ramp up each time.At any rate, [...]! This is the best thing to come along in literature probably ever, and I for one consider myself lucky to have lived contemporary to such a great writer."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan still captivates with his writing and imagery. However, whereas the past two books have been slower, and more flowery, this was definitely more action-filled, revealing and overall much faster paced. It presented an anxiously awaited conclusion that leaves one a little more satiated compared to the open-ended resolutions the previous two books had."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book is good, but sometimes it is a little hard to fallow and i love it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The beginning was quite slow, but the end of this book was one of the best parts in the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book was very good.

I would say that there will be at least two more books in the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I can't say that this was the best WoT book there's been thus far. It's not. But it's far from the worse. I, personally, considered it a bit of a page-turner, but not until the second time I read it through. The same phenomenon of hating it until reading through a second time occured with book 8, Path of Daggers, too, which I really have come to enjoy. This series has nicely matured from one of those typical fantasy books into one of the most well-loved contemporary series. I await the next volume with baited breath."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"&quot;Winter's Heart&quot; is mediocre filler for the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series. The plot is sluggish, at times almost coming to a complete standstill, but it's not made up with character development at all! Instead the complete opposite happens. Rand, Elayne, Mat, the Seanchan, the Forsaken, etc. devolve to childish one-dimensional characters. Lots of sex and talk about sex, giggling and needless chatter. Felt more like a cheesy cartoon than a serious fantasy epic. The few plot-twists are amateurish and can be seen from a mile away. With the finale so rushed and hastily arranged it's downright comical. But to be fair I think these rough edges will probably smooth out once the epic is completed and able to be read uninterrupted. It's just not a great book solely by itself, a momentary blip in the great &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Just before this book came out, I decided to re-read the first 8. Books 1-4 were excellent, exciting, and impossible to put down, and I noticed a lot that I didn't see the first time. Books 5-8 slow down significantly, and I found my self frustrated by reading an entire book without hearing about one or two of the major characters. Finally book 9 moves things along!! Once again the book is surprising, eventful, and leaves on an up note. I disagree with the poor reviews I read prior to reading this book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As much as I enjoyed the first 5 books in Mr. Jordan's saga, I hve been very disappointed with his latest additions. Winter's Heart continues his passion for long winded, over done descriptions, with enough characters to make your head spin, and a story line that goes nowhere until the final 50 pages. It's time for the author to step back and look at what made his first books so enjoyable, an engaging and fast moving plot with a group of characters you actually cared about."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Though it is true that there arnt many battles in book 9, i believe most of the previous reviewers are not grasping the concept that Jordan is trying to get to. If you look at the whole series as one giant book, there is falling and rising action spread out throughout the series. Book 9 is full of rising action. Though not many battles take place, we do see sadin cleansed and more characters introduced. The book follows the rest perfectly and i cant wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Out of the last three books this is definitely the best. I hate to see the series in this postion though considering I burned through the first 8 books in about as many weeks. At the end of book eight what I was looking forward too was the Tower war the to have Egwene be non existant was a let down. But hes been doing this sort of thing with Perrin and Matt for ages so I guess its par for the course. Rand, for me, finally got interesting as a character with this book I finally got to see him go back to working with Lan.For me this book is the fulcrum Ill buy the next one but if its more the same Ill probably give up on the series all together untill its finished."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Although this has been the best series I have ever read (and I think I have read each book at least 4 times) I think it's starting to slow down a bit. I would love to say each one gets better, but the first book (which I would rate about 6 stars) is still the best. I liked Winter's Heart very much though."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"RJ writes about the same old thing AGAIN.. This book is not that bad , it ties up all lot of loose plot ends and mysteries. Like whether saidin could be cleansed or not. Or the identtites of the 'reborn' Forsaken. However his writings leaves much to be desired. Unlike the first 6 books , where the plot was fast moving, this is rather slow. And where is MOIRAINE?? With all clues pointing to her return, where is she?? (Maybe she might still come back later in the series, but that's alittle late, isn't it)However , I give praise to its FANTASTIC ending. That practically saves the book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have read and re-read this book three times now. Robert Jordon's style is so easy to read, with absolutely beautiful imagery. It is exciting and fun.I am also releved that so many loose ends are being brought together. The puzzle is fitting better.I just want the next book to come out already! ;)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Rand begins to put into place the necessary allies and situations he needs to face The Dark One. This book is full of wonderful happenings - Mat's meeting with the Daughter of the Nine Moons (which we knew was coming soon), Rand taking the warder bond with the women he loves, the Seanchan groundswell of invasion (or return) and the supposed success in cleansing the male side of the One Power. I could not put this book down. The last quarter of the book, especially, held me spellbound. Thank you Mr. Jordan for not disappointing me again."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I was introduced to Robert Jordan by an article in a newspaper which said that fantasy literature was FINALLY coming to the polar regions of Norway. I went on, and bought &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;... It was a revelation to me. I devoured the book, and the next six, too. The world-building is, indeed, comparable to Tolkien's work. You get the feeling that this is one of the very few fantasy worlds that could have been real. The first and the fourth book are the best because they both introduce the reader to different parts of Jordan's world (even though the Aiel are suspiciously similar to the Fremen from the Dune Trilogy). It started to draw out a bit in book five, but &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;, when Rand's madness started to manifest itself was great... Seven and Eight were nearly downright BORING,(and I almost stopped reading, thinking that Terry Goodkind was better at describing humans. Well, he is, actually...) and Winter's Heart seemed to follow in the same tracks, and until the last 50 pages, it looked like it was going to end, without the storyline advancing at all towards Tarmon Gai'Don... bad. But then, with one of most spectacular endings in my reading life I was once again hooked on The Wheel of Time. And the end is in sight, finally. I guess it will be about two or three books in the end. And by the way, I'll be VERY disappointed if Rand survives the Last Battle. Mat is the best character in the books. Moiraine will return. If she doesn't, I will read only Salvatore from now on...P.S Anyone got an idea of how Rand gets so many girls??? Is anybody willing to help me? HELP!!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan&iexcl;s Mammoth series is intriguing, infuriating, and totally amazing. He creates this world that is so alive and real that you can see it, but he gets caught up in too many everyday things. I enjoy the series so much, but I want more to happen. It took Nynaeve 7 books to break her block. Still, he has continued quality in his writing style and his vision is consistent.Path of Daggers was slow and not enough action happened. We basically learn the battle that was fought, the high point of the last book, was fruitless. Winter&iexcl;s Heart does introduce Mat and the long awaited Daughter of the Nine Moons. It looks like the action concerning her will occur relatively quickly. Robert Jordan seemed to be fulfilling many long awaited events in this book, kind of as an apology for the last book. The ending as usual was a smash and a bang, AND leaving us wondering what will happen.The most disappointing part of the book is Egwene&iexcl;s White Tower conflict not being addressed. She appears and he ends with them opening the gateway to Tar Valon.Over all a Better book than Path of Daggers; it is as engaging as the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, I had been awaiting the (hopefully) last book to this series, but am excited to see that it is not. Very well written, and I must say, it is VERY FRUSTRATING not being able to know what is going to happen right away!!!! Robert Jordan keeps you in suspense all the way up to the end, and I love it. I recommend reading the whole series (all 9 books), an then going back, and reading them again. Can't wait for book 10, 11, 12??? to be released!!!!!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"What a great ending. I can't wait to dive into book ten. The books seem to be getting better after a disappointing 5-7."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winters Heart has some truely memorable events that occur within its pages. Now that the Wheel of Time has ended, it makes it that much more precious. Honestly I always dread re-reading Winters Heart. It's a bit slow paced."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"For the most part, I think I liked WINTER'S HEART, even though this book, more than any so far in the series, seemed to embody the strengths and weaknesses of THE WHEEL OF TIME.By the time this book came out, people had already begun to turn on the series a bit, criticizing Jordan for making a money grab and stretching out the series as long as he could and filling his books with more and more characters, more and more world-building, and less plot advancement. In WINTER'S HEART, Jordan moves the plot forward in a few places, but does so in as bizarre a way as any author I've seen.I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't read this book yet, so if you don't want any spoilers at all, please stop reading this review. If you don't mind vague spoilers, I'll do my best to be non-specific -One of the series' main female characters learns she is pregnant during the time period depicted in the book. \\"During the time period depicted in the book?\\" you might say. What a strange way to phrase that!I word it that way because Jordan doesn't actually include that part in the book. In fact, we spend probably eight to 10 pages in that character's POV chapter before she mentions that she's pregnant in passing, and that's why Character A gets this, this, this and this for breakfast, Character B gets this, this, this and this for breakfast and she gets this, this and this to eat because she's pregnant. I've honestly never seen anything like it. By the end of WINTER'S HEART, Jordan is nearing 240,000 words in this series. He has been roundly criticized for packing too much into the story, detailing every minute detail of his character's lives, putting 100,000 words or more between major plot developments, and somehow we know everything the characters eat for breakfast on a daily basis but we aren't there when one of the main characters learns they're pregnant.It's totally bizarre.For the most part in this series, even in the books I didn't especially like, I've liked the way Jordan ends the book with a rip-roaring fight, usually between Rand and one of the big bads. This time, Jordan does an excellent job of setting up the big fight. Rand is busy using so much magic that he can't defend himself, and he must rely on those around him to defend him from the Forsaken descending upon him. It's great.Jordan speeds up the pace, jumping from POV character to POV character, and we see the battle beginning from probably eight different characters' points of view. But then we jump to another character on the outskirts of the fray who wants nothing to do with the dangers of battle. They can't see anything, but they guess that the Forsaken are probably losing.Of course, we can't trust this because one of Jordan's favorite games is to have a POV character express an opinion that's wildly inaccurate, but in the next scene the battle is over and we're told who lived and died. Somehow, Jordan spends all this time building up to this fight, and as good guys and bad guys run into each other, he cuts away just as the fighting begins. It's as though Jordan hates the reader, and is now just taunting them. You want something to happen? Fine, but I'm not going to show it to you. I'll just tell you everything that happens before and then skip over the exciting parts.Mat Cauthon is back for this book, and seems to get the bulk of Jordan's attention. I have to say, Mat has really grown on me again. I struggled with him in some of the early books, but Jordan has certainly found his grasp of this character, and I was happy to spend more time with Mat as he makes his way in Seanchan-controlled Ebou Dar. I just wish his plot had moved forward more.Perrin's determination to find his wife, who was kidnapped in one of the earlier books, is gripping early on and I expected to see him try to chase down her kidnappers, but Jordan soon drops this plotline and never returns to it.Having Rand spend the bulk of his time with Min is a good choice, as Min has been one of the few female characters Jordan hasn't made off-putting. I also liked seeing Rand working with Lan, even though they follow a red herring plotline where they walk into a trap set by a big-time bad guy, but then the big-time bad guy runs away almost immediately, making the whole thing kind of pointless.Jordan is still creating more mysteries for the readers to try to figure out, and while he does answer others, they're questions that were set up in the third or fourth book of the series. Sometimes he pulled out the big reveal, and instead of saying, \`Wow, that's amazing!' my response was, \`Oh yeah. I'd forgotten about that.'So here I am, nine books into the series. Jordan seems to have a better grasp of his main characters than he did earlier and he has found ways to make some of them more interesting, but his pacing still isn't quite right and some of the storytelling decisions he made in this book were downright strange."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Good solid work on a great series. Now that it is finished I'm rereading to refresh my memory. I'm looking for good stuff form Brandon."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"If anything, less happens in Winter's Heart than in either of the previous two novels in the series, which is somewhat infuriating and frustrating. Perrin begins to go after the men who captured his wife...and then disappears from the novel. Egwene, who was on the verge of laying siege to Tar Valon...isn't in the book. Elayne begins to establish her claim on the throne...and then her time in the book comes to an end. Mat reappears in the series after being absent in the previous book...and, shock of shocks, manages to make some progress, including finally becoming aware of something that will change his life forever. But, apart from the ending of the novel, that's about it for the events of Winter's Heart. And yet, that ending goes a long way to redeeming the novel and helping the reader feel like the series is legitimately coming to an end. Jordan gives the book a spectacular finale, one that kills off numerous characters, brings dozens of threads together, and most importantly, changes the very dynamic of the series in a permanent and incredible way. Winter's Heart is a lot more slowly paced than I remembered, and if it weren't for that finale, it would be a fairly vexing moment in the series. But that final chapter gives hope that Jordan hasn't lost all handle on the series, and was legitimately beginning to close things up (a hope which got dashed pretty hard with the next book, but which returned for Jordan's final book before his death)."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"got it for Husband.

The scale of the world and the characters is astonishing. Robert Jordan once more proves a master of his craft."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Still an engaging story but drags a little. Found myself wishing for the Tolkien like camaraderie of the first few books. Almost too much complexity to keep track of different characters and story lines."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I read this and liked it. The camera was held pretty tightly on the action. It let Mr. Jordan write in his active style, and when he does that I find that I like his books in this series somewhat better. The trade-off is that we don't get a lot of sweeping action sequences, but that's a good thing here. The claustrophobic view is held on individual characters and so we get to see more intimately the actions they undertake in the story. In other words, what we do get is less \\"watered down\\" than the stuff we read in, say, The Fires of Heaven."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Here we have the ninth book in the series. I have read this book at least twice before. We diverged with Perrin in a extraneous quest but he needed something to balance all the fun Mat seems to be having.Thus we run square into the problem that Jordan has created, too many streams. The entire discussion during this reread is where can this series end, for it was a trilogy.After the series achieved success others will show how Jordan purports to have thousands of pages on the history of the world. That is all well and good, but back when the story was only going to be a trilogy, you wouldn't need to create so much unless you were sure you were going to be paid for it. Before WoT, Jordan was not all that well published. Conan books, and not as memorable as the items published much earlier by those who expanded on Howard's iconic barbarian hero.But now as a writer making money. Probably very good money, why not take the time to step back and create a mega opus. Bigger then Tolkien who is regard as the God of Fantasy.Why not write so many character sketches that you can fill rooms with them. That may make the world richer, but it sets up problems. Winter's Heart fails though not as badly as the previous transition book. The failure is having so many story lines that justice is not done to any of them.Further the time scale is again destroyed, where earlier books almost a year will pass in the telling, now it is weeks, and our heroes can accomplish what used to take them months. One has to remember that they are novices at there jobs of magic casters, or rulers, or battle leaders despite what memories may be inside their head.Those of you who aren't twenty, how many really know that it does take years to have the wisdom to read people. To analyze the interactions of your environment quickly and correctly. If every twenty year old could do it (And there are several in Jordan's world who can.) Then what need of older people. Surely everyone over twenty-five are idiots...In the Music Man, \\"The older-but wiser girl for me...\\" (It was on last night) and that is highlighted everytime a Wise One or Aes Sedai of years of experience is bossed around by one of the children. Sure they need to be heroic, but elders need to help them manage, not jump to every order.So again do you read this book. Well it is better than the previous for stories, though shortened, do complete. But once again Jordan is stretching out his trilogy beyond all reason."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is book nine in a series of books by Robert Jordan called \\"The Wheel of Time.\\" It is a well-written sprawling science fiction fantasy saga about a young man who is born to end up battling with the evil force in the world. He and his friends travel all over the world trying to get everyone on his side, getting ready for the big battle which will decide whether the end of the world will go to the evil one or the good people. But not everyone will believe in him. There is magic, and unseen forces, monsters, strange peoples from far away, all kinds of different unexplainable things happening that can only happen when magic is used. It's a fun read, there are many small plots and twists to follow along the way. I love the story line, and the writer is wonderful. It's very colorful, and it is easy to visualize in your head, based on his descriptions, what is going on. The characters are very real and their personalities are very distinct and some are quite unusual. I have looked forward to each book as I have gone along through the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Sadly, the pedantic prose of Book 8 creeps into this book frequently and early on in Winter's Heart. It takes quite some time for anything of consequence to take place. The return of Mat's plotline definitely helps, but the Faile/Perrin chapters are stuck in the mud and a waste of pages. It's not until the final scene (which is foreshadowed at the beginning) do we get a return to Jordan's great writing in the first four books of the series. The shifting viewpoints from all of the main players in that scene really build up the suspense and deliver an ending that put the series back after seriously slipping in Book 8."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Don't care any more after two dull books in a row.

No more, I thought. Never again. Well, I tried to get away, but they pulled me back in.Actually, I was just too curious.All of the faults of this over-bloated epic are here in force--the repetition, the non-stop skirt-tugging and sniffing and glaring and eyebrow-scrunching and endless bickering between characters who really, by this point, should have more important things to worry about. Minor cast members come tumbling in, only to be introduced at length so that they can utter one or two lines of dubious importance and move aside for the next one. It's enough to make you tug on your braid, isn't it?However, the plot DOES move forward, if only in baby steps. I skimmed sometimes, but I kept reading.

I will admit that the few books before this have been a little long, with nothing much happening in them, but that doesnt take away from their value, they are all great. As i read this book, i will pulled into Jordan's mind, and i could see everything that was happening, many times i forgot that i was even reading, that is how deep this book pulled me in.

Once I started I couldn't put it down as I had been waiting for a long time to get the newest installment in The Wheel of Time series. While I rate the book a 5, and continue to believe this is the best series ever written in Fantasy type novels. My one complaint is and always will be that it takes too long for Robert Jordan to finish each book. As always I bought this one the day it was available, and finished it that day, but now I will likely have to wait 2 or 3 years for the next book. I would recommend this book and series to anyone who reads this type of book and maybe even a few people who do not, however my suggestion is pace yourself if your starting at the beginning, else you will be waiting in limbo like me for the next book to be finished."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book starts the wraping up proses of the wheel of time.

The next book should be the last battle and It will be sweet. Robert Jordan is my favorite author and his books make you see into it. After reading the book I wouldn't recomend listening to the audio book on tape. All the words that you guessed at how they were pronounced were wrong. the aiel is the weirdest sounding word ever. You should definatly buy this book if you have read the last 8 books!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've read the other reviews and all I hear is people complaining. I personally feel this book is every bit as good as all the others. His character interactions are as good as ever. And of course he doesn't solve every problem in the series in this book. That would make any sequal meaningless. By leaving several problems from previous books still unaddressed he just builds suspense which I think is neccessary for a good book series. And there is still more than enough happening in the book to keep you from wanting to put the book down. I spent almost every waking moment reading it for the 2 days it took me to finish because I just could not put it down."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The 8th book failed to deal with the cliffhanger of the 7th book, and pretty much failed to be much more than hundreds of pages with about 30 pages of action. The 9th book improves on that, being less tortuous as there were fewer pages spent on people arguing pointlessly. And the ending was spectacular.All in all, though, Jordan seems to not understand that less is more, and that if he chopped a couple hundred pages out of each book, they'd be much improved. In fact, I spent a decent amount of time thinking, &quot;Hmm... Yeah, except for that one minor point, he could have chopped that chapter, and it wouldn't have made a bit of a difference.&quot;Now, I tend to get a bit wordy myself, and it gets a bit difficult to cut things down. However, I kept on finding things that I would have had an easy time cutting. Reading the book, had those passages been ripped out, I wouldn't have minded. At all.All in all, it's still a fun series to read, now that I know and care about the characters. I still would not suggest a non-reader of the series to pick it up. There are so many better books and series out there."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"HEY! Winter's Heart was worth the read. The number of characters is getting a bit much, can't spend enough time in one place. But the boy is getting better with age, style wise. I bought this for my oldest boy because I have trouble keeping enough good fiction around for him. Let's face it, kindly old proffesor Tolkien is dead. Creating an epic is a task of epic proportion, and I for one appreciate the effort that is going into this tale.Bob, if you read these, you ARE at some point going to have to run into something ultimate. Right now everybody thinks they are it, and then along comes &quot;the bigger fish&quot; (as they liked to say in that last Star Wars flick). But all together I think this series gets better as it goes on.Just to irritate those who want to not like it, I am going to go read it again. So there. :)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, overall I don't particularly love the characters, most of em anyway. I can't stand the women most of the time, they're stupid and pigheaded. What I like is the plot, it isn't full of holes, and it is gigantic, providing for long in-depth discussions. RJ isn't the best writer of them all, in fact I like Salvatore, Tolkien, Card, and Niven better, but he has a great story in a fantastic world. Plus he describes everything extremely well."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Once again Robert Jordan has picked up the pace in his WOT series, and a lot of threads are tied up. Mat almost is in reach of fullfilling his prophecies, and Rand heals the wounds of madness Moiraine asked about in TDR. The Daughter of the Nine Moons is in the hunt for Mat, and the most important thing to happen to Mat since Rhuidien is around the corner. The forsaken have come out of the Shawdows more, and you just might be surprised who Slayer is hunting. I promise you this, once you start it you won't want to put it down until the very end as new threads are woven. All in all Winter Heart promises to land a sequal that matches TSR and TFoH somewhere down the line. One of the upcoming books is going to be huge, just from the mere details that need to be sewn up."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I would just like to say that this book is one of the greatest that I have read, I am sorry to say that The Lord of the Rings is still the best but this is a close second. I have read all of his books and wait, while rereading the first 9, for the 10 to come out. He sets the scene, so you are there in the book with Rand, Mat and Perrin. I read alot of books each year and this is the only series that makes me keep coming back for more. These books are a must read for any person who loves JR Tolkein. Just read any of these books and you will understand. Please excuse any spelling mistakes within this review. I am an avid reader, not speller. I am a math major, I have never been good at writing. But Reading and entering a book is something that can never be replaced. This book takes me away. READ THIS BOOK AND THE 1ST 8.Live is an open book, all you need to do is find the right page."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Lots of people has been complaining over Jordan's tendency to never stop writing The Wheel of Time. I say, that if the next books are half as good as this one, let him write 20 or why not 40 books. These books are _GREAT_. No other fantasy author that I've read (and I've read more than a few) is as skilled as Jordan.Latly he has been adding a little bit of 'soap opera' style to the series, true, but never to much and the intrigues are always credible and make sense. Personally I think that the series has gotten even better with the last few books of plotting and intriguing.This is the best book in the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is book number 9 in the wheel of time series. I've enjoyed this series but am beginning to wonder if the story will ever end. This book was not as good as the other books in the series and seemed to neglect some of the previous plot lines. I would have liked to see more conclusions in this book since at this point there are probably at least 2 more books left to be written. If you havn't already started the series, I do recommend the series and it is good but long. Jordan's books will eat up a lot of time and there are lots of characters and plots to keep track of but it is well worth the effort. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I read a lot, but even so, they are taking forever! I started the series in January, and I just finished the 9th one. Foe me, 5 months is a little much to finish 9 books. Though there are so many books already, it doesn't seem like Jordan will get anywhere near Tarmon Gaidon ( The Last Battle ) for at least a couple more books. There are cliffhangers at the end, if not so much so as in other series. In a crown of Swords, Jordan ended the book right after Rand captures Tear. Somewhat frusterating, though it could be worse. As another reader has said, Jordan does seem not to want the series to ever end. I mean, one way to do it would be for Rand and Nynaeve yo have lost control of the ter'angreal that control the giant sa'angreal. Though I must say, and most readers would agree, that the ending would be rather dissapointing if the whole world just shrivled to a cinder. What a great way to end such a great series! I wonder how many centuries Jordan would have to live to actually finish the series to his liking."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have read all of the Wheel of Time series and have become dismayed at the change in style with the last three books. Mr. Jordan is belaboring old issues and is not at all clear how new ones relate to the plot. He does nothing to assist the reader's memory in recalling characters and their importance. A prologue would help or, at least, a more elaborate glossary which includes the dozens of minor repeated characters, locations, and events. Certainly one motivation for this stretching out of the story would be to continue his revenue; his editor would gain by that tactic also. For number 10 and beyond I will wait for others to read and review his production and not automatically get the book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As he closed book nine of the series, Kyle thought he had gone mad. There was a flash of blinding light that ripped the air around him as the dull thud of closing the book echoed distantly. -Light, where am I?- As it donned on him that he was actually in the Ways, that once majestic means of travel created by the Aes Sedai and grown by Ogier, his heart began to pound in his chest as if it were trying to break free. Darkness closed in around him. Heart racing ever faster. &quot;Hello? Help,&quot; he gasped. He took a step back by instinct, like stepping away from an attacking badger, but the edge didn't hold. He slipped over the edge of the island and began a fall that would last for eternity.-----------------------Will this story every freaking end? Light help me. Light help us all!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I thought that this book was better than 5, 6, 7, and 8 but not as good as the first four. There are so many minor characters that I can't remember them all and It gets confusing. Also some parts get a little boring and the book didn't extend the plot as much as I would have liked, but it was a definate improvment. I think that after the first few books, the main plot slows down and the subplots start taking over. It seems like your just following people around hoping something will happen as opposed to the first 4 where you were actually engaged and wondering what would happen next, instead of hoping something would. I have to say, though, that I do love this series. It is the best series I have ever read and the only books I have read in the last 6 months were by Robert Jordan. I can't wait for the next book, i just hope a little more happens. One more thing I have to mention is that the last chapter was the BEST ending in any book I have ever read. I think that all the RJ fans will love it, and be glad that men can now channel in peace, or more than before anyways."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The last three books have been frustrating. The trend continues, if Jordan is developing a style it is that of a shclock-pumping serial pulp writer.

I hope the he gets with the program or we'll be better off watching Sienfeld reruns (same level of content, but at least its humorous)."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The last three books have been frustrating.

Not much actual progress is made until the very last few pages of the book, which seem like theycould have come a couple hundred pages earlier. It has its good parts, though. Mat reappears, Rand confesses his love to the feminine trio, and something actually happens with the One Power.

Thanks for spoiling it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Rand is supposed to be doing illogical things; don't you remember the end to the last book? You probably didn't finish Path of Daggers though; since it was so &quot;horrible&quot;. If a book is too confusing because it has too many plot threads; how do you manage your own life? That has to have more plot threads!Anyway; this book is great. If you left the wheel of time for the recycling heaps because of POD, you can buy this one, and bring yourself back to the fold. Stuff happens. It's interesting stuff. Major rollicking stuff. You won't be disapointed; well save by the first few chapters; just plow through them. I do wish Padan Fain would have been killed long ago; he's just annoying; and, seemingly a plot device that comes out of nowhere. Oh well; one weakness amongst a huge pile of greatness. If you want to read about Mat, Rand, naked chicks and sex; and who doesn't? Get this book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Unlike other critics -- who in my opinion are naggy idealistic ignorant wolheads-- I believe that this book is a major improvement. There is a decent amount of action and a lot of mysteries are resolved. I liked the book and am impatiently waiting for the next one to come out. If I have to mention a flaw in this book; Id have to say that the editing could be better. :( What happened guys? Did your kids edit it?. There are plenty of misspellings, mising commas and just plain bad grammar. It looks like the first draft was published. Either way Good job on this one RJ!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have been reading the series for nine years. I was hoping that RJ would get back on the plot development bus, but instead he has chosen to write mind-numbingly boring descriptions of Elayne's political dillemas, and a completely pointless section on Perrin. Bottom line, if you haven't started the series yet, wait another four years to start. If you have, go and read; it's too late for us to stop now."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The Wheel of Time series is \\"New Age\\" fantasy. Channeling, a new age technique, is the only form of magic in this series. The series GARBAGE! I've read much better fantasy than Robert Jordan. For example, Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series is 100 times BETTER than the Wheel of Time! I wasted my time reading the 1st 6 books, and I am glad I had the sense to stop there! Don't waste your money buying JUNK! Don't waste your time reading this JUNK!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Firstly let me get it straight why I gave it a 2 star review. To me the only books deserving of 5 star are Harry Potter. That puts everything else on the 4.5 star scale. As for WOT only the first and third deserve 4.5 stars with GH and FOH deserving 4. SR deserves 3 and CoS and PoD deserve 1.5 while LoC gets 1. Now onto the review.Alright winters heart was easily the best book since fires of Heavan. I say that for a couple reasons.1. Welcome back Matrim Cauthon. He is the only character who hasnt been changed into an annoyance from Eye of the World. Him missing hurt PoD a lot.2. Rand sets out on a clear path to do two things. Cleanse saidin and kill the Ashaman who killed him. Usually what he does has no real plan to it that the reader can see but you can in this one.3. Finally Nynyeve and Elayne do not take up half the book with their bickering, complainging, and men hating. Instead Elayne actually has a good storyline in trying to claim the lion thrown.However it was hurt by two things.1. Starting with 5 chapters on Perrin and then not mentioning what happens with his rescue attempt.2. Not enough about Egwene and the Salidar Aes Sedai. Thats one of the intersting story lines.Overall I have found that Robert Jordan has a problem with his writing. It is, he keeps adding ingredients but not cooking what he already has added. Since book 6 it has become clearer that he has just added too much for the final dish to be as good as the the sum of its ingredients. For examoleExplain furthor all the different forsaken's plots and relations.What is Slayer exactly? how did he become. Luke/Isam combo has been mentioned several times and never fully revearled.Mazam Tains own intentions. Give Taim a few ch from his perspective so we can get what hes brewing.What happened to AsmodeanWhat happened to Moraine.Galad hasnt been talked about despite being rands half brother and the fact he was rising up in the ranks of whitecloacks. Speaking of whitecloasks what are they doing?What are the borderland countries plotting? Are they against Rand, with Rand, or impartial.Have a couple of Mins vieiwings be exllained.When is Egewene going to reach her full potential as a dreamer?All of these things he throws in there to sweeten particular scenes but then never has them pan out into anything. There is no way he will be able to pan them all out in the final three books.Case Closed"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"My wife insists on reading brand-new hard-cover books.

It was in the same condition as listed: good condition. I am very happy with this book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"OK so they finally release book nine in The Wheel Of Time series and does it answer all our questions ... no. Is it action packed full of blood and gory details ... no. Does it continue the saga and leave you wondering and wanting more ... YES!If you've followed the first eight books then you have probably already bought this book but if you're new to this series then you can quite easily pick up Winter's Heart, or any of the previous books, and enjoy it as a stand-alone novel.I picked up book two, The Great Hunt, whilst waiting for a bus. After the first couple of pages I became enthralled by the complexities of the characters and the ever-changing relationship that existed between each and everyone of them. I then bought book 1, The Eye of the World, so that I might have some info on what went on before.As with any continous book series you might notice that he introduces his main characters and gives you some background info on them in each of the books. So even if you feel some trepidation in picking up the ninth book in this series it isn't really essential to have read the previous eight books, although you will be able to appreciate some of the more oblique references that are made throughout this book.If you compare each and every book in the series against one another then most assuredly you will find that some of the books were more satisfying, for whatever reason, than others. It's only when you step back and look at the series as a whole you can then appreciate that it's not just nine separate stories/books with the same characters but actually one story with nine chapters (so far).Thought provoking ... yes. A fine &amp; complex interweaving of many plots ... yes. Does the good guys always wear white ... no but then again who would want a story so transparent?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"...I must admit the \\"The Path of Daggers\\" was a bit dark and dreary, \\"Winters Heart\\" has opened the series up once again. It left me with a feeling of hope for the series. Of course the first 5 flowed along, because it all was just starting. Now everybody is into it. The books are very exciting if you just let it flow. I personally like that it is not ending. The only thing that I dislike, is the wait...\\"The Wheel of Time\\" is a great epic and should be read by all who love fantasy."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I really was hoping Jordan would start to tie up loose ends in this book. Each new book gives us a brand new set of people in a brand new culture with a new set of Mythos and Ethos and we are supposed to keep it together? It feels like more than 1/2 of this book is recap. Soon there will be a book that is all recap.I mean!! I don't know this many people that well in real life! I think we are up to about 108 main, or at least, important characters. The worst part is that most of them have become archtypes and pretty rigid in their ways...The last 8 books have given me enough insight into most of the characters' minds where I do not need thoughts described anymore. I KNOW that Elayne is in love with Rand and that she is a self-conscious twit. And how many more 'as Lini used to say...' lines do we need?I really liked the first 4 or 5 books. I now feel the need to read the new ones just to see what happens (as if). I'm afraid that book 26 will be only two lines long: 'And they all died. The end.'"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Yet another installment of do nothing for 700 pages, then wisk through an ending that leaves almost everyone puzzled as to what really happened in the end.

I would love to hear some more...whining...I keep shaking my head trying to figure our what happened to the series I fell in love with. The first four/five books have kept the momentum for the last four, but that momentum has fizzled out and is dead. I will not read another book in the series until it is done. I might change my mind and read the last 50 pages of the next book. I would not miss much and would save myself the headache of having to try and remember who everone is again. In book three Matt, was promised to see the princess of the nine moons. Hello, Mr Jordan quit toying with us. I feel like I am listening to a record played at half speed for the first 750 pages and then have the record played at twice normal for the end; both leaving me frustrated. Jordan should combine the substance of his next 5 books into one, and get on with it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I picked up this series about 18 months ago and tore through it. The first three or four books were excellent. Their stories were gripping and emotional. But something happened around books five or six where the first half of the book was spent painstakingly refamiliairizing the reader with the characters and their current surroundings, and the second half was spent building up \\"something big\\" that either never happened, or was not much different than the conclusion of the last book. As the series progressed, I found that more and more of the books were devoted to summarizing the last book, and less was actually happening to develop the story. Winter's Heart was just that. The only real action came within the first 150 pages, and then resurfaced after a long snooze in last 30 pages. The rest of the book's 700+ pages seemed nothing more than filler.While reading the first half of this book (the paperback edition) I was ALMOST grateful for Jordan's re-introduction to all the characters, because it's been about a year since I read book 8 - and there are A LOT of characters. You've got the entire Emonds Field crew (who all have their own followers and are scattered all over the world), about 4 separate factions of Aes Sedai, The Forsaken, The Asha'man, The Seanchan, The Sea Folk, renegade Aiel... and Jordan keeps introducing new characters on top of that. Its no wonder he has to devote half the book to our re-acquaintence with them.Aside from that, after reading through the entire book, I feel like nothing was accomplished until the final 30 pages or so. It's almost like this entire book was just a reminder to the reader that \\"the bad guys are still out there and they are about to attack on all fronts.\\" There was little-to-no new character development, and the story itself seemed to go nowhere. Finally, at the end of the book (and I'm amazed I made it that far) Rand manages to accomplish one of his major goals as Dragon Reborn. But by the time the action finally picks up at the conclusion, it's over so fast that it seemed like Jordan simply rushed through the finale because he was going to miss a deadline.Next, Jordan's portrayal of all of the women in this book are really starting to annoy me. All the women in this book are either nagging, whiny, irritating creatures, OR bossy, self-centered control-freaks. At one time, I used to like Elayne and Faile, but now I find them more annoying than I could have ever imagined. I used to like the Aes Sedai, but now I can empathize with all of Jordan's characters as to why they dislike them so much. (After careful consideration, I decided that Jordan might be a really talented writer and this may be his intent, hence the two stars, rather than one). But the point I'm trying to make is a majority of the characters I used to like are now so annoying that I find myself not caring what happens to any of them. This is not the best way to keep a reader's interest.In a nutshell, the 700+ pages of this book could have easily been about 200. No one appeared to make any progress in their individual missions. None of the characters developed any further, or accomplised anything of much use. New characters trickle into Jordan's world but seem flat and useless to the overall story. This was yet another book that seemed like no more than a build-up to the next book. Ironically enough, this was my description of the last book, and the one before that. Yet, despite my opinion that nothing is happening in this story, I find myself buying volume after volume nonetheless. Sooner or later I will stop falling for it. (Sigh... bring on Book 10)."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am rereading the whole series from start to &quot;finish,&quot; while waiting for the next installment. By Book 7, I was getting bored. By Winter's Heart, I am not sure I want to invest the time again. I just want the whole series to come to some kind of conclusion. Everything is STILL hanging up in the air, and I am also getting tired of all the sniffing and cool stares. Unlike an earlier reviewer, however, I don't find all the power issues unrealistic; anyone who's spent any time in the work world can see that the book reflects the jostling for position that can go on in real life. I do feel that Book 9 seems to be setting us up for some real forward motion; I was getting sick of waiting for the Daughter of the Nine Moons to show up finally and snare Mat but good. He used to be my least favorite character. Now he's my favorite. He adds some MUCH needed humor to the series. But, overall, I find myself just twiddling my thumbs while hoping that this series wraps up soon. Jordan has real talent that seems to be spreading thin of late. You can only defer the answers to important questions for so long before people get disgusted and turned off. Tarmon Gai'don--Bring it on! Bust a move, already!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book is about 90% mush and 10% plot advancement. &quot;The Eye of The World&quot; entranced me from the first chapter and kept me going straight through the next 8 books. Then I had to stop and wait, and wait, and wait, and finally &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; arrived. The worst part is I bought it in hardback, oh! the money! I love this series, I greatly enjoy this author, but he is falling into the trap so many epic authors succumb to. Where do we go from here? So many fights, so much heroism, so many twists, is Jordan beginning to lose the threads? I hope not because even now, so many months and years after beginning this series, I still occasionally wonder, what's going to happen to Rand? Mr. Jordan, are we there yet?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"And the storie goes on and on and on. This series is turning into the soap of fantasy novels. And I used to be a big fan. The first books in the The wheel of time series were great. I wont go so far as to say they are as good as Lord of the rings but they were very good. But now that book 9 in the series has arrived I get a bit bored with it. Don't get me wrong Winter's Heart is still better than your average fantasy book but for me it has lost the sparkle that made the first books so great. The story is unfolding too slow now. There are so many storylines that it takes too long to tell them. That's probably also the reason why the book has so many pages. At the end of the book I didn't really have the feeling that there was any progress in the story. At this pace the book could continue until they nail shut Jordan's coffin. The curse of it all is that because I have read 9 books now, that's about 5,000 pages(!), I have no choice but keep buying and reading. That doesn't mean I have to like it though!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have begun reading the series 8 years ago and for me every book has been like a pile of rock building to a mountain. I read the first 5 books in the series 3-4 times each, and after each time I begin to catch small details that only a person who has read the whole series could understand.I agree that in the last two books the pace of the story was slow, almost crawling. Winter' s Heart is no different . But I think this is what makes Jordan so special. In Jordan 's world there are no easy victories; there is not only one hero, nothing is black or white completely, everything does not solve itself in just one book. To me Jordan just breaks all the traditional laws of the genre. It is slow and sometimes too datailed, but I still believe that this is maybe one of the best fantasy series ever written (I surely liked it more than Tolkien's work)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"OK. It's not as &quot;good&quot; as books one through 5. Somewhere, in the past few years, Jordan has undergone a transition in his writing style: the subplots have become more integral, and at the same time has diffused resolution of the plot to great effect. HOWEVER. I think Robert Jordan is going somewhere with this new technique. True, the plot is definitely moving at a fraction of the pace it once pursued in earlier works. This can be both a good and a bad thing: I think it is GOOD, in that with the way this epic is written it is likely there WILL BE NO SEQUELS. Anything that draws the experience, the story line, out a little, or a lot, further cannot but be beneficial to avid readers who have come to enjoy Jordan's skill at world-building. Besides, look at how well the end of book nine comes together after the chaos of oh, 700 pages. There is certainly an atmosphere of chaos perpetrated by style, resolved neatly as he returns to something of the normalcy 4 books prior. Maybe the end is something of a shift back to the old. Anyway, I for one greatly enjoy the simple experience of reading and glutting my imagination on Jordan's Wheel of Time, and care not so much for the destination as for the journey itself. Judge the final product of the series, then decide if you like it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"When I picked up the first book of this series I was pleasantly surprised. Good characters, nice story line, good action. Unfortunately, book two wasn't quite up to par. Book three a little worse, book four even worse...you get the picture. Way to much time spent on needless details and insignificant characters. Books 6,7,8,9 were a major struggle. Save yourself the time, read books 1 and 2, and create the rest of the story on your own."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As others have said, it's basically still lacking when compared to the first five books, but it's better than the last few. The last 200 or so pages are excellent, and give me hope that Jordan has not completely lost it. This was pretty much his \\"last chance\\" book for me, and he's partially redeemed himself.So what saves it? Well, more emphasis on action and main characters, and less on introducing yet more forgettable secondary and tertiary characters, and fewer new distracting subplots when we already have plenty. There's a lot of Mat in this book, and that's a good thing, because I find his adventures consistently more interesting than anyone else's. I really *want* to be interested in what happens to Perrin, but I just can't stay interested, and Faile is an unlikable and, to me, unnecessary character. Thankfully, only a few chapters of that couple are in this book. Also BORING and UNNECESSARY: the Prophet. Who cares about him?I'm taking off a few points because the first two-thirds tends to meander, as the previous few books did, and we really don't get to see anything of the Egwene perspective, which really should have more a presence at this point. There's a good deal about Elayne, but those chapters are mildly interesting so that's ok. Also, I wish there was some more of the Forsakens in the book. They do make a few appearances, but not enough, and they're so consistently inept it makes me wonder how they got to be so powerful or why anyone would fear them anymore. They need to win sometimes, kill some important people, do damage, wreak general havok, etc. Have I been reading too much George R. R. Martin? Yes I have :)There are spots where Jordan also reverts to his foot-stomping, ear-boxing, braid-pulling, glaring, whining, haughty-spoiled-ice-queen drivel, but fortunately he snaps out of it before I threw down the book in frustration. I wish someone would install an exlaimation point detector on his computer! To check for too many on a page! Because he tends to use a lot sometimes when writing from a female perspective! To show how emotional and disrespected they are! As if Rand could understand! How dare he!Anyway, I feel that if Jordan sticks with his six main characters, and the already-established plotlines, with some Forsaken, Ashaman, Aes Sedai, -angreal, and -Finn tossed into the mix, and continues to DRIVE THE PLOT FORWARD towards Tarmon-Gaidon, things will be just fine."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have found the best uses for Winter's Heart to be as a door stop, to kill spiders, or to level a table whose leg has broken off unexpectedly. If you must read this boring, pointless book that serves only to increase Mr. Jordan's bank account at the expense of readers who expect a great deal more at this point in the series, you may rely on the fact that at least it has the guaranteed effect of putting you right to sleep in case you are suffering from insomnia. My advice to you is get it from the library rather than buying it, so you don't feel robbed after reading it. If you cared for Rand and the others before, this book will certainly end any compassion you had for them. I think Mr. Jordan could entertain his continuing fascination with female submission and &quot;spanking&quot; of various types by logging on to the internet and joining some chat rooms rather than wasting readers' time and money beating this subject to death (pun intended). **Yes, I got my copy from the library, I am glad to say. I would recommend reading Harry Potter instead.

Aside from the momentous conclusion, however, nothing truly earth-shattering occurs, and there is no disippation of the influx of random new characters that appeared in the last book. I truly wonder how Jordan expects to wrap everything in up in only one new book after this! Nevertheless, I still highly recommend this book, and it is a definite improvement over PoD.Fellow Mat-lovers should be forewarned, however; once again, his chapters end in a cliff-hanger. (Though nothing compared to a building falling on him!)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Hey stuff finally happened. Nowhere near as good as the first four or five but infinitely better than the recent books, especially Path of Daggers.I started reading these books when I was in high school and I'm starting to think I'll be close to retiring when Jordan finally finishes this series up. The first half of this book was dreadfully slow with people wondering around the wilderness or sitting in palaces doing paperwork. It did start to pick up about midway through and unlike recent books there actually was a coherent climax that seemed to resolve some outstanding issues.I guess my greatest problem is that it didn't resolve much and it even brought some new elements of conflict into the story. Now I don't know about the rest of you but it's nearly impossible for me to remember what's going on from book to book. Fortunately this time I reread Path of Daggers right before reading Winter's Heart which proved to be an immense help. Of course it would have helped to reread Crown of Swords before Path of Daggers and so on but at least I had some memory of what had been going on when I started this book.Anyways I don't know if this review helps much. Overall I'm happier than I've been recently but not thrilled. The book was only about 600 pages long and it makes me sick that I'll have to wait another 2 years for the next volume. People have said they're four more to go which means 8 more years which means I'll be about 35 when this all finishes. Ack.So in a nutshell better than recent stuff. Things are resolved and the plot finally moves forward. I guess the good thing that comes out of this is that with only four more volumes to go that means those will have to be a positive whirlwind of action to finish things off. Either that or that's just another rumor and this series will never end.Got it?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As I shift through the reviews of this, and other Wheel Of Time books it strikes me that many readers are slightly missing the point. Robert Jordan has gone beyond the simple sword and sorcery novel into a relm of pseudo history. He has taken the time to weave the characters into a believable world, full of individual nations and peoples that come alive with detail of dress, custom, and ideologies that become more imortant as the series progresses. You come to feel the history of a world only slightly removed from our own and drawn in to the possibilities it offers. It is the different cultures he creates being forced together in the course of the story that creates the tension on a realistic level and keeps the fantastic from being too cliche. Winters Heart progresses the plot further along not only by grand strokes of the brush, but also in the small dots that connect the grand scheme and make it more satisfying in the process. The action of the novel is balanced, as always, with the seemingly minor problems of relationships between lovers and friends; and the everyday situations of finding food, clothing, and shelter that somehow lead the characters towards their destinies, and the great events that move armies and level cities. Each character is finding thier path at different paces, Nynaeve and Lan's marrige, Perrin's battle of self, and of course Rand's battle to stay sane and whole until the Last Battle, and what some perceive as padding or slow plot developement, is actually character building and definition. Those times of inactivity or reflection say as much about the characters as throwing spells or waving a sword. The events in Winters Heart delights on both levels and has on of the most beutiful concepts I have ever considered happening between two people in the first 60 pages, and a battle of epic perportions while the fate of the world is decided by the end, and both are given equal weight by Jordan in this masterful tale. If you have yet to begin the journey that is the Wheel of Time, and enjoy an intelligent and truly mythical tale, begin now, start at the beginning and travel the path that will lead you to this most enjoyable book, and join the rest of us in wondering where the Wheel will take us next."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok, if you're reading this review, you're probably wanting a validation of your own opinion of this book. You started like everybody else following Rand and his merry troupe across the mythical continent. Things got exciting when he met new people, learned of new powers he had, made friends and enemies.Then after Book 4 it all went to hell. What are we doing here? We're addicts trying to avoid detox. We're desperately seeking a resolution to something, and then Jordan throws in another race, problem, character, whatever to drag this out a little longer.Sure, it had promise as a good series, but Tolkien managed to put the world aright again after a trilogy and a prequel. Frank Herbert finished almost as quickly, and Dan Simmons, in the Hyperion series, cut it down to four, and managed to do a lot of real research into philosophy, theology, and literature while he was at it. Jordan is like a Colombian drug lord, hooking us on his product, and then steadily lowering the quality, because he knows we'll buy the next one, probably in hardcover, just to get the fix we need. I'm giving the next book a chance to start picking up the pace again, but after that, I may see you all in Wheel-of-Time rehab. 1. Admit that you have a problem........."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It is unfortunate that there are so many comparisons of this drivel to LOR (Lord of the Rings). I recently re-read LOR and found much of Tolkien's work to be heartbreakingly sublime.Many of Mr. Jordan's characters remind one of adolescents having a bad day. The plot moves at such a glacial pace that one begins to wonder if Mr. Jordan is writing for an annuity and could care less about his &quot;legions&quot; of fans.One has to wonder if Mr. Jordan's editors at TOR are fully aware of how many fans they are alienating by allowing Mr. Jordan to ramble on as he does. It has taken nine extremely long novels to tell a story that could have been a knock-out trilogy. A reader of fantasy would think that the characters would have evolved sufficiently in nine novels to have changed them completely. Unfortunately, they have not. Rand al'Thor has gone from being a sheepherd to being a man who cannot make a decision. Matrim Cauthon (who did not even appear in the last book), who is by far the most interesting character, often gets short shrift and does not appear to have a real purpose in the story. Finally, Perin Aybara has become a lord of his homeland but has no stomach for it. Mr. Jordan tells his readers the stories of many other characters, none of whom are central to the plot. He sacrifices telling us the story that really matters, the story of these three young men, and instead tells his readers about events and characters that are either secondary or tertiary in their importance to his plot.His depiction of women is nothing short of insulting. They are collectively treated as conniving, backstabbing wretches who merely need to be put in their place in order to be useful to men. His fascination with the female body is also blatantly apparent. His many references to revealing female clothing and female body parts would not be noticeable if they were balanced with an equal amount of references to the male form.One hopes the editors at TOR will put their collective feet down and make the man finish this overdone bore of a tale before all his fans abandon him."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I could not finish, and barely started, Winters Heart. It is true what I have been reading in the reviews. The first four or five books were entrancing, exilerating, a whole new fantasy world, where characters were stripped away from the normal stereotypical fantasy characters.However, after book 5, things started to go down hill. Mr. Jordan spent countless pages describing what a person wore, and how it fit in with the current fashion trends, countless juvenile moaning by the opposite sex about men or women, endless pages of in depth information on small characters.I read the book when I was back in Minnesota staying at a friends house. I couldnt finish it and had to ask my friend to give me the highlights, took him less then a minute. I told him, probably could have been around 200 pages, instead of 10,000. He whole-heartly agreed.I saw the book again in the International Book Store here in Munich. Picked it up, and started to read it, to see if I should really should buy and try reading it again, however, the first few pages I read was about a juvenile Nyvanie ready to pull her braid out. I quickly placed the book back on the shelf, and, decided I would do myself a favor if I just waited for someone else to waster their time reading this book, and informing me on the highlights of the book.For me, I will not waste my money, or, time. Which is sad, I remember about 4 or 5 years ago, when, me and my friends were all big fans of Jordan. Now, the only time we discuss his books, is, when a new one comes out, and we talk about how painful it was to read."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The good news on Robert Jordan's ninth book, &quot;Winter's Heart,&quot; is that it was not his first, otherwise we would not have had the enjoyable reading experience provided by his first four books. Sadly, the bad news is this book was poorly written, very poorly edited, and should never have been published in its current form. As Mr. Jordan is reported to have stated, he is making the story up as he goes and does not feel restricted by accepted writing standards of plot and character development. Unfortunately this is the undoing of this book as it is chock-full of confusing, disconnected subplots and poorly developed, irrelevant characters. Some characters central to the previous storylines are notably absent and are others that are present are given a short shrift. What happened to Loial and the Whitecloaks, and why are the Foresaken all turned into whimpering, frightened weaklings? I did not find the big, heralded battle with the Foresaken that ends the book to be very fulfilling or exciting, particularly compared to the battles in previous books. There are a few good moments where Jordan returns to his excellent story telling ways, in particular the kidnaping of Faile and Mat's struggles to escape Ebou Dar. However, these disconnected moments provide only short respite from the incessant parade of new Aes Sedai, Warders, Cairhienins, Saldaeans, Andorans, Kin, Sea Folk, Seanchan, damanes, sul'dams, and many others too boring and irrelevant to mention. In my opinion while Mr. Jordan's first four books were excellent reading, books five and six were only average, books seven and eight were poor, and book nine was very, very poor. Even great writers can occasionally create bad books. However, there is an obvious trend here, which indicates a slow and defined decline into mediocrity. Hopefully, Mr. Jordan has a change of heart, decides to pay attention to the opinions of his readers, and returns to his previous brilliant storytelling form before putting out another volume in this series. After all, anything can happen in the world of Fantasy. If you have not already tried them, I recommend all books by Guy Gavriel Kay, Stephen Donaldson's &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever,&quot; and Paul J. McAuley's, Books of Confluence 1-3."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan fans must endure this only because we want to see how it finally ends. Readers new to this series, please, don't start it until Jordan proves that he can wrap it up in the next decade or so. Jordan's latest provides about 100 pages of real enjoyment, layered in 500 pages of filler. Jordan introduces/retains characters and sub-plots that provide little value-added to a once great story. He should take a lesson from George R.R. Martin and start killing off a few hundred main characters or so!With his latest installment, I found myself skipping/skimming entire chapters without missing a whiff of the real story.Let the buyer beware!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The latest installment in The Wheel of Time, Winter's Heart, at least shows us Jordan worth the money. Though the books, from The Fires of Heaven and forward, has slowed their pace and gotten into a sly and tidy pace, Jordan has his moments.Mat Cauthon is back and is still in the place we left him two books away. The Daughter of the Nine Moons arrives and Mat is getting itchy. Perrin is hunting for the Shaido and Faile, Elayne is waiting in Caemlyn for her crown, the Aes Sedai is still fighting and Rand is on the run.

Don't give up on the series now! Besides, everyone complains that series are too long, then, when the see the end, they wish there was more. Many more things happen in this book--Mat finds his Daughter of the Nine Moons, and there is a HUGE development with Saidar / Saidin. Also, the end of this is REALLY GREAT!Read this book!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I started reading the WoT series back in the beginning of June. I'm a fast reader and unfortunately, I didn't pay close attention to who was who. In the first books of the series, Jordan went over characters in each book, but in the last 3 or 4 books, he stopped. By the time I read Winter's Heart, my memory had gone fuzzy on some of the characters. I would recommend the University of Chicago's website because it has a WOT section that has an extensive list of characters and descriptions (if you have trouble, any search engine should find it). Overall, I think the first 5 books were the best because Jordan covered all the main characters about equally, but now each book seems to cover 1 or 2 extensively and basically leave everyone else out. I hope that Jordan gets the next book out soon because I'm anxious to see how the series ends, but not so fast that the book fails to live up to the previous books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"There is a good deal to complain about in this book, but nearly as much as with the last few books.The complaint I have is not necessarily in the exquisite detail which is what sold many of us long ago, but in the rehashing of said exquisite detail over and over. Some things seem to be described a coulpe times each book... that's 18 times by now...The secret is to just skip the fluff, which is now boring, and to get on to the actual events that transpire in the novel. Fortunately, unlike the last couple, this one has a lot going on and was, once again, a rather good read. I would have given it only a '3' though... but the ending is tremendous and actually has me pumped up and ready for the next book. I hope he continues the torrid pace now that threads seem to be weaving back together, and finds a way to end it with book ten."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Although some of the last books were slow and very little of the overall plot has moved, this book ties up some very loose ends for us all. Yes, I agree that too much descriptive phrasing detracts from the overall storyline. I don't care if someone &quot;smoothes&quot; a hole in her skirt or if someone yanks her hair, but I remember that these books are published about 2 years apart and those phrases may be RJ's way of helping us to remember the main characters' bad habits. I won't review the book based on impatience to get to the end of the story but read every book for the pure enjoyment of the writing. RJ is an accomplished author and, unlike some other fantasy series, helps us to believe that the line between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;evil&quot; is purely subjective and one must learn to use the skills we are born with or learn new skills in order to find where that line is for us. Remember, all new skills are not always the easiest or the quickest to learn and I would rather read about the character's learning the skill before he/she just shoots from the hip to win the battle.That's just my opinion, I could be wrong."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Dang, not really, but you might be so ready to see her killed off that you start scribbling your own alternate version of the story in the margins.But before the criticism, the praise. (Or is it better the other way around? I forget.) I know I'm not alone in thinking that the last few books in the series were getting in that dangerous zone of being interesting to people who have fallen in love with Randland, but utterly slow and boring to anyone who hasn't. You might ask why anyone who wasn't in love with the Wheel of Time books would have read as far as the latest books anyway, but my point is that even though the storylines in those books shouldn't have to stand on their own, the pacing and action should. I, being a fan, have enjoyed each and every book in the series, but have to admit I was getting tired of waiting through moves on the chessboard just to get things in place for future books.Winter's Heart is our reward for sticking it through. I don't want to give away spoilers, although the official review on this site already does a pretty good job - grrr. WH moves several storylines with a big shove, provides the filling out of several characters (Cadsuane and Verin come to mind), and offers a masterpiece ending battle in a form we've not seen so far. The final result is that the reader has been as positioned as carefully as the characters, and we too are now in thick of and poised for even greater things.Oh, let's face it, the return of Mat Cauthon is enough of a reason to read. Finally a little sense and humour is knocked back into life on this side of the Spine of the World. So what if Rand has become a machine and Perrin a consort, we have Matrim.A little sense, that is, but not enough. (Here comes the criticism.) I seem to be one of the few people who never really minded Elayne. She was a bit of a naive priss sometimes, but her heart was in the right place. But by the end of WH, I would have been just fine with her brutal death, preferably by a torch-bearing Two Rivers mob, as she smooths her dress, sniffs, and upon her last moments of consciousness gains a look of understanding in her eyes which says, &quot;Oh, perhaps the lines on that map of Andor *are* a little outdated...&quot;And take down Aviendha too. She was once my favourite female character, but I'm afraid she now bears the taint. The bosom-huffing, conveniently misunderstanding, foot-stamping taint of Elayne, that is. A near-ditto for the whipped Birgitte. Sigh.As for the other girly-girls, Nynaeve is still besotted with new husband Lan, which has not improved her obsessive-compulsive braid tugging whatsoever, and Egwene is away for most of the book apparently turning into a rather boring corporate Amyrlin, as opposed to bringing her own spunky personality to the position.Do I have any other complaints about a book I only wish I had the skill to write? Well, although several characters were developed further and got off their collective behinds, few loose ends from previous books were tied up.Which was fine with me. With Winter's Heart things are rolling again, and I'll happily look forward to more of the same. Maybe not another nine books, but that's negotiable if we can seal Elayne in the bore."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It's interesting to read that so many people think that major plotlines have advanced... and I'm willing to concede that. However, it doesn't seem unreasonable to say that the writing has deteriorated significantly over the last 2-3 books.I think it's also interesting to note that the length of the WoT books has been dropping steadily. Perhaps Mr. Jordan is trying to meet publishing deadlines and so is sacrificing the quality of writing to meet those goals?The writing is still good. I would invite anyone who hasn't read the series to read it and judge for yourself. You shouldn't miss out on some wonderfully written books (bks 1-6) just because people are upset about the last few. Besides, they're all in paperback and by the time you get to book 9, the last one will be in paperback as well.Personally, I'm hoping that the writing returns to the pace of the first 5-6 books and I'm willing to wait an additional 6 months or 1 year for each book if that's what it takes. I'm betting that everyone who has complained about the series is doing so because they're hopelessly engrossed by the storyline and are going to see it through to the end -- even if it's pretty slow going right now.See you in 2 years."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I enjoyed this book and found it a very fun read.

It wasnt that boring. Some things were necesary.

Nontheless I think finally there is, as the end says: &quot;A message of hope&quot; that Jordan will finish this series soon enough. I love it as much as I hate it because now that I ve finished Winter s Heart I need to keep on reading more and more. I did not give the book five stars just because of this eternity.

He was painfully absent in POD (book 8). Rand Al Thor shows that no one...no one can stand up to him anymore. Moridin/Ishmael once again has failed badly for the Dark One. At least this time he had the common sense to send the other forsaken after Rand. Don't want to spoil it for those haven't read this, lets just say not many made it out alive. Al Thor Rules, nice to see the series alive. For those who keep complaining. Suggest you try George R.R. Martin's &quot;song of ice&quot; series. Which is admittedly far superior. I think what the Dark One needs to compete with Rand is the &quot;Tyrion&quot; character from Martin's series. You know someone &quot;smart&quot;. enough rambling.

Well OK the story progressed a little tiny bit but for the most part everyone is in the same place they were when the story started.To me it seems like Jorden is milking a cash cow. He keeps writing books thinking we will keep buying them because we are hooked on the series. If the characters continued to make progress the series would eventually end. I don't think Jorden wants it to end so he has started to write books where very little progress is made!The reviews on book 10 are dreadful. I am done with the series.

But I suspect Mr. Jordan is now building a grand house, or buying a boat, or breeding racehorses or something that requires an awful lot of cash. Your cash and my cash. Cash that only the pointless extension of the series can provide. (In this 700 pages we learn what Rand had for breakfast and how bad Aiel are very bad indeed. And yeah, some other stuff, but not much.)I also suppose that I keep expecting the characters to mature. Maybe this is a function of the years and years of real world time that have passed in the writing of the series, while the average 800 pages covers about 6 weeks or so, book time.And yes, I can hear that whiny &quot;Just stop reading it if you don't like it! Just put it down, man, don't rain on my triteness parade.&quot; But, hey, I've invested several days of my life reading this thing, so I still want to see how it comes out, even if it has turned to an apalling waste of innocent wood pulp."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"i was just flipping through some of the other reader's reviews and realized something....all those who complain just seem to want a quick Tom Clancy-like, shoot-em up story. i am rereading winter's heart right now and realized something. robert jordan is creating a whole world of characters. he is creating a whole world of events. remember, he is creating the Last Battle. do you think that only three or four main characters would be involved in something that grand? remember that the Dragon Reborn is to break the world again. what world is he breaking if we cannot see it? how do we know he is breaking it? what is being changed? robert jordan is showing all the events related to the Dragon Reborn's change. and that is asking a lot. be thankful that Jordan knows how to weave the storylines so well and intricate that it is a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The last pages of Winter's Heart leave a good final impression, but it's easy to run from that to \\"The Book is AMAZING!!!\\" and forget that during the other 700 pages of the book, essentially nothing happens. A bonding and a kidnapping? That's what I read all night to find out? When I started reading the series, Min and Nynaeve were two of my favorite characters. Now, they have been reduced to overexaggerated caricatures of women -- petty, spiteful, and incapable of an honest and straightforward relationship with anyone. Perrin and Egwene are more like minor characters now, and even Mat has lost some of his charm. The plot twists have made a mockery of the saying \\"truth is stranger than fiction.\\" Not when Robert Jordan's fiction is stringing us along!Also, when I saw the cover of the book I was convinced that this would be the book where Moiraine returns. It certainly looks like her on the cover, and it even looks like Thom might be beside her, which would satisfy the prophecies from previous books. Yet.... nothing. Some hints of Lanfear, but nothing more than hints. I was very disappointed.There are many reviews listed here that itemize every complaint about the book, most of which I completely agree with. Jordan may have written a better book compared to the two before Winter's Heart, but it is a far cry from the first few books, and it is certainly not a good stand-alone novel. Until I read more action (and I'm not talking about side-plot action here) and less babble, I'll continue borrowing the book from friends as I have been doing for the last two books. Jordan can string me along until he dies if he chooses, but I'm certainly not going to pay him for it anymore."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is a great fantasy series. But the problem is that RJ seems to get payed by how many pages he writes and that makes the quality dicrease alot.

Keep it by your bedside when you need something to lull you to sleep."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The point was that Jordan has gone on for so long and likely to continue doing so for some time (I strongly doubt Book 10 will be the conclusion) that he can't POSSIBLY devise an ending worthy of all that verbiage. It's been built up and built up, etc. (for better or worse) and it's come to a point where you wonder how it possibly can end. Seriously, how does he end it? If it takes 600+ pages to simply get a bunch of characters from point A to point B I wonder how long it will take just to end the damn thing. The battle between Rand Al'Thor and the Dark One, assuming it'll ever happen, is sure to eat up at least 1200 pages.I think, at this point, Jordan may as well continue writing this and just completely forget about the intent to finish the series (if he ever had such an intent). I know lots of WOT fans would be happy and I'm SURE Jordan's pockets would be happy.I myself gave up WOT after book 7 and will not take it up again unless it finishes, and then only if I somehow get a lenthy prison sentence, a stay in a sanitarium or retirement home, or get stuck on a deserted island with nothing else to read or do. Since none of these events are likely to occur, at least not anytime soon, I'll look elsewhere for reading enjoyment."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"OK, I thought fantasy was supposed to be fun, supposed to take you away. This series has gotten harder to read than a John LeCarre novel. Granted Winter's Heart is better than the past few books, but I am beginning to believe I deserve at least a dinner and a movie for what Jordan is doing to me. Like everyone else, I just want to see the end. And if you are like me and remember when fantasy was fun, do what I did and go back and read Edding's Belgariad or The Lord of the Rings and see if you still have patience left for this series. At the end of the Belgariad I still cared about those characters and was disappointed to see their story end (until the Mallorean) but with the WOT I hope they all die in Book 10 and we wrap this up. Who truly cares anymore? Lucas will make 5 more Star Wars movies before this thing is done."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I hate to say it, but I've spent too much time with these characters, and it's becoming hard to care what happens to them. I especially have a hard time with the way women are portrayed in this series. At first, I found it refreshing to see such a large number of strong and influential female characters. However, after spending thousands of pages reading about them, it's becoming clear that, first of all, almost every woman in the series is a carbon copy of every other woman, and second of all, that Robert Jordan has a tough time writing from a woman's point-of-view.Nearly every woman in this series has a horrible temper. She manages to get her way by either &quot;the temper tantrum&quot;, &quot;the frosty glare&quot;, &quot;the sniff&quot;, or some combination of the three. She believes it is her solemn duty to keep a man from getting &quot;a swollen head&quot; or &quot;too big for his hat.&quot; She calls every man a &quot;big-headed fool.&quot; When there is a group of women, they spend a great deal of time discussing men and men's shortcomings, punctuating every sentence with an exasperated &quot;Men!&quot; The problem here is that women don't really act that way. I haven't seen that kind of behavior since I was in jr. high school, but the women here act that way all the time. Even the Ogier women control the men. It's silly and repetitious. The male characters are much better, because each one has separate and identifiable personality.Since the Aes Sedi play such a large role in the series, let's look at them at little more closely. First of all, every member of the Red Ajah is exactly the same as every other member. They're all just cold, unfeeling, rabid man-haters. Jordan tells us that the Red Ajah has always been the largest Ajah. Their purpose is to find men who can channel. OK, but prior to the start of this series, men who can channel were very rare. So why does the Red Ajah have so many members, and what did they do with themselves in the years between finding that rare man who did channel? Members are the Brown Ajah are always dreamy and distracted and usually have an ink stain somewhere on their faces. Do members of the Yellow Ajah, the healers, ever heal anything besides battle injuries, and where did they get their bedside manner? All Aes Sedai seem arrogant and distrustful. No wonder the general populace fears and dislikes them. They have so much power, but they don't use it with any compassion. The only time an Aes Sedai shows much real human emotion is when her warder is killed.The repetition of the descriptions in the series is also starting to be monotonous and annoying. Every dress is &quot;slashed with cream&quot;, every meal consists of &quot;turnips and peas&quot;, items are always &quot;thumb-thick&quot;, braids are always &quot;wrist-thick&quot;, and wool clothing is always &quot;stout&quot;. Every woman in the series &quot;crosses her arms beneath her breasts&quot; at least twice a day. It's time to describe things in a new and fresh way. Please!The final problem I have with the series is that there are way too many foretellings, dreams, and visions. Are there any suprises left to come? We know what will happen to Rand, we know what will happen to Mat, we know what will happen to Thom and Moiraine. Even if one of the characters frequently wishes for something to happen, it does. (i.e. Nynaeve thinking that &quot;stilling&quot; could be healed, and the way everyone kept telling Egwene she'd be the Amyrlin Seat if she worked hard enough.)In conclusion, there's just too much repetition here too hold my interest. If the series had been shorter, it would have been a classic. Instead, the same things are repeated over &amp; over &amp; over. They were good the first time, but now it's time to move on."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The problem with this book is not so much the book itself but the fact that publisher has allowed the series (which started spectacularly) to drag with the inclusion of excessive filler. There are several themes that are okay in small doses. In large repetitive doses they reduce the credibility of the basic story line.For example, there is continual misdirection among the players; factions jump to unwarranted conclusions and act upon them, \\"ritual conflict\\" among factions and continued failure of groups with like interests to unify on the basis of those interests (i.e., petty stuff would be set aside in the face of a recognized common danger and their larger common interests), etc., etc.As the series is lengthened, the wearing nature of these minor flaws increases. Further, there are a number of personal and relational quirks that are also fine in small doses but become equally wearing as the series goes on, e.g., the preoccupation with dress, cleavage and bosoms, the ritual patterns of dominance-submission (\\"... jump when Renaile issued a command), Nynaeve's prickly stridency, Mat's persistent adolescent approach to everything, etc., etc.Some of the above is pretty childish but the reader can get through them even a few times. The more they persist, however, the more they are magnified and the overall series sinks."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"When the word 'epic' is used, we modern day readers think of 'The Iliad' or 'The Odysey'. Unfortunately, it is becoming fashionable to consider a long book series worthy of the term. Thus, the word 'epic' becomes shortened to mean 'a long series of books'. Dictionary.com defines 'epic' as '(A story), Narrated in a grand style; pertaining to or designating a kind of narrative poem, usually called an heroic poem, in which real or fictitious events, usually the achievements of some hero, are narrated in an elevated style. 'Unfortunately, Robert Jordan's series the Wheel of Time has become an overdrawn and rather mundane collection of books, detailing a group of characters that have ceased to be interesting a few books ago. A long story this may be, but somewhere along the way, the potential for readers to feel that each book and each book matters has faded.A funny thing happened last year. 'Winter's Heart' came out. I bought it in hardcover, and proceeded to read through it over a period of three months. I was surprised to realize that after five years of being a fan of the series, I just didn't care anymore. Maybe it was the plodding sense of the last few entries into the series, but between the hordes of minor characters, annoying descriptions of every dress every women wears, and the frequent absences of one or more major characters in certain books, I began to wonder why everything seemed so trite.My review for this book is rather low. I am puzzled as to how other readers can defend Robert Jordan's choice to draw the series out by saying that the series demands patience and maturity. In my opinion, a key benchmark of a good writer is to express themselves in a way that is both entertaining and meaningful to those that read their books. The Wheel of Time has become an unpleasant pass time for me and I empathize with those readers that feel cheated after years of buying these books.Let's get things straight here. Something very important does happen in this book. But by the time you get to it, there is no attention given to this achievement. Instead, you must sufffer through almost 700+ pages of the usual repetitive descriptions and childish characterizations. A number of inconsistencies can pop up (which is par for the course in WoT these days). For one, if there is a city that is enclosed in a stedding, how is it possible to use the Power at all? Oh, Jordan doesn't really care about that. He circumvents that by introduces yet another new ter'angreal that makes it very convenient for our heroes to succeed in landing themselves in another hackneed scenario. And his characters? He doesn't care about that either, apparently. Cadsuane seems written into the story for the express purpose of knowing everything and having a number of advantages to move the plot along. As for Perrin and Faile? Oh, she was kidnapped in the last book, and while she is gone, he is still worrying about Berelaine.These characters don't have priorities. It is as simple as that. Forsaken escape, and Egwene doesn't care. After all, she is still consolidating her power. Nynaeve is almost killed by another Forsaken. She doesn't care. She is worried about looking good in front of Lan. Rand is surrounded by enemies? His friends don't care. As they remind us again and again, he is always getting into trouble somehow or another.At this point, I miss the simplicity the quest had when it was Egwene, Nynaeve, Mat, Perrin, Rand, Lan and Moiraine. Between the shabbily written court intrigue and half-baked machinations of the enemies, the series has become a continuos soap opera that more resembles a romance novel in fantasy clothing than a Tolkien-level work of strong writing. Robert Jordan, to put it bluntly, just doesn't care about turning out quality work, having compromised that for quantity of pages and characters. And it shows.This books deserves no stars, though as a reader and a writer, I wish another writer would take the reins after book three and redo the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As always, Robert Jordan's latest is chock full of divergent plotlines and situations. While this new book lives up to its predecessors, the fact is that Jordan's writing has a few bothersome flaws that turn up yet again in Winter's Heart. All the women characters, be they Forsaken, Aes Sedai, Wise Ones, Daughter-Heirs, or vilage housewives, have essentially the same characterization, which includes being able to stare down practically anyone. (If they all can do it, what's so special about, say, Siuan?). The main problem is that Jordan's latest book, far from drawing closer to an ending, opens scores of new plotlines that must be resolved in future volumes. Yes, Slayer and Daughter of the Nine Moons seem to be reaching some sort of resolution, but what about Taim? On the brighjt side, Winter's Heart was engaging, as always. Perrin makes his reappearance, and Rand (of course) shows signs of impending madness. The Aes Sedai vs. the Wise Ones is always enjoyable, as is Nynaeve (ubnblocked!) pulling on her braid. All in all, worthy of four stars."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Upon finishing the ninth book of this lengthy saga, I can see right now what Robert Jordan is up to.He's going to make it LAST as long as he can. With all these millions of little threads underlying the main plot, there's no way he can cinch this skein in one more book. Impossible. He will not finish it in the tenth book, nor I suspect even in the twelth, unless he goes with a quick &quot;And then the world got its act together, beat the dark side, and lived happily ever after&quot; ending. And who on earth would accuse Jordan of being trite like that? Not I. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the stress of writing causes him to have a heart attack before he is finished (and woe to TOR who will have to deal with thousands of frenzied, unsatisfied fans.)Book nine finally shows that some of the prophecies given in the first 4 books can and will come true. However, they are not yet done - some of the characters and civilizations built up in the past have yet to show up, or prove anything beyond useless in the fullfillment of world-altering prophecies.Rand is the central character, but dull as dirt. Perrin seems to have all but been written off in books 8 and 9, though as always, he'll return. Matt's finally back, but I can't say I'm excited. Nynaneve is suddenly very important to Rand, and Rand's harlem of females have all been struck dumb. Even the plot line with Egwene seems to be thinning - with so many sources of headstrong annoying women, who really cares WHAT happens to the White Tower any more? Though on that note, Moiraine is being mentioned again, hmmmm. And the Forsaken.... does Jordan even know what he's doing with all of them? I have my doubts.With all of this said, I will not stop reading this series. It's good. It's entertaining. It's still in my top ten of series I'd recommend to a friend. The writing style is enjoyable despite the longwindedness (or perhaps because of his acute use of detail?)But it's also frustrating. It's not so much as the reader being kept on his toes by twists and turns so much as the reader having to deal with constant (yet sometimes inconsitant) changes from minor to major. The &quot;Time of Change&quot; excuse can't cover everything; I think maybe Robert needs to start rereading his own books to recover his spot in writing and give us a pleasant surprise in the tenth book - a faster tempo."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, the main complaint people seem to have is that the pace of the latest Jordan books has been to slow and not enough plots have been resolved. Well, I think part of this is just complacence, much more happened even in the relatively duff Path of Daggers in terms of intruige, the Forsaken, our understanding of the world of the wheel of time etc... than did in the first books. I can accept the criticisms that Jordan's writing has become a little formulaic at times, but his formula for writing is what has grabbed all of our attention. As another reviewer has said, Jordan has created a huge world, with its own history and I for one am happy that his style of descriptive writing has bought it to life inside my head. Winter's Heart does move the plot towards its conclusion and resolves some of the annoying threads which have been hanging around for several books, if not longer. I for one find the political intruige compelling, and as a historian, very realistic. I felt that in this book there was development of the female characters beyond the usual blushing, cat-fighting and so on that plagued the previous two. Elayne is no longer the haughty noblewoman, Nynaeve is no longer a bully, the annoying problem of the Kin vs Windfinders vs Aes Sedai is shaking itself out. One of my major problems with the previous two books, my increasing dislike of Rand, has been lessened considerably. I think your choice of your favourite character will influence whether you merely like this book or if you love it. The return of Mat is welcome, I'm glad there has been a shift away from Cairhien and Caemlyn as the centres of action, but what has happened to Loial? Given the way Jordan was able to so successfully intergrate so many viewpoints of momentous events in the Great Hunt and the Dragon Reborn so successfully (ie Battle at Falme) I cannot see why he cannot deal with many plotlines at once again when they intersect (ie. Elayne's succession and the Borderlanders). There seems a great deal of potential for overlap between the various sub-plots, part of what Jordan does best. Having spent so much time learning to care for these characters, I would be disappointed to see them be dealt with in an implausible and off-hand fashion, like a bad TV show can do, and whilst the delay between books drives me up the wall, I won't be put-off reading and re-reading the series even after it finally concludes. Any true fantasy fan or one who is interested in historical-type novels can't really get away without reading this series, again, and again, and again!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The first 250 pages of this book are some of the most boring fiction I have ever read. I kept wondering to myself why he chose the storylines he did (Elayne &amp; Faile). Does anyone really enjoy reading about Elayne's anguish over the decision to giver her warder a cloak or not. Pick any other storyline (Tinkers and the Song, The Two Rivers, Portal Stones, The Ways ...........) I don't care. Did it really take him 2 years to write this crap ?? That is less than 1 page a day my friends. Really, I started to skim over the chapters that had to do with Elayne and her power moves. I did not miss a thing.The book did pick up when he moved the story to Matt. I kept thinking that this must have been about the time that all of the negative reviews for book 8 started to come out.Really, I just have a hard time believing this is the same guy that wrote the first 5 books. Seems like I'm progressing through the 5 levels of Jordan fandom: (Fanatic (first 5 books), disappointment, denial, anger and finally acceptance) that a once great series has turned into what it is now."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I must say that after the disappointment of the past three installments (Lord of Chaos, Crown of Swords, and Path of Daggers), I was truly hoping that something would actually _happen_ this time, as opposed to the merely continuing plotlines of previous books. Well, I wasn't disappointed. The prologue begins right away by addressing several key issues and this sets the pace for the book. We catch up with Perrin, Rand and Min, Elayne in Caemlyn, Mat in Ebou Dar, Nynaeve and Lan, and we get some new info on the remaining Forsaken. We see some new, long-awaited characters such as the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and lots of Seanchan plotline, in addition to the single largest event to happen thus far in the series, which leads me to believe that Robert Jordan may be nearing the beginning of the end. The only disappointing thing was the inclusion of some ambiguous information regarding Taim (because personally, I'd like to know what his game is already) and the Black Tower, but there were indications again that point towards the nearing of completion for the series.All in all, if you've read the other Robert Jordan books, you can't help but like this one, but to disagree with the mixed reviews thus far put forward, you're not merely going to like it but seriously enjoy it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I got a late start on this series, picking up the first eight volumes at a local book store, within the last year. I read through them, one after the other and found the story gripping and addictive through the first five books. Then The Wheel got out of round and we have been clumping along for the last several books. While still interesting enough to keep me reading, the majority of this book went nowhere. We start with Perrin beginning to look for Faile and that's the last of that. Then we jump hither and yon until we get to the end, which is the redeeming part of the book. Mat spends a lot of time planning on getting out of Ebou Dar and we get the addition of several new subplots.I have to agree with several reviewers, this book could have been shorter and lost nothing. Better yet the last 4 books could have been made into 1 or two volumes with a better pace.I bought the hardcover as soon as it came out, in hope of getting some resolution to the multitude of plot-lines. Only one got resolved at all, and that was the best part of the book. Next time I will wait for the paperback, if I live that long."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Unlike some of the other negative reviewers, I thoroughly enjoyed books 1-hmm... about 5 or so. I enjoyed parts of 6,7,8,9, but I agree with Jordan's detractors wholeheartedly: the books could benefit from tighter plot lines and less childish characters. I consider myself an intelligent person, but I have an unbelievably difficult time keeping straight the myriad of names and plot lines. That's probably why I'll always love books 1-3, because as the series continued so many plot lines were introduced and so many new characters, that my mind just started swimming. I've been reduced to enjoying the few parcels that Jordan doles out from time to time, like Rand's rescue in book 6... I can't even remember one from book 8. Path of Daggers was unbelievably frustrating and inconclusive. Winter's Heart does tie up a few things, but almost unbelievably at book 9 starts introducing a couple of new twists that remain untied. Another complaint about this and other books in the series is that the big conclusions at the end always seem to be rushed, and lacking (a big switch) in detail. It's as if he runs out of steam and is hurrying to meet a deadline or something. If he wants to put great detail in things, I wouldn't mind if more was put into the truly engrossing parts of the story. I wouldn't mind learning more about how Rand figured out anything about saidin being cleansed, and I would certainly like to know more about Lews Therin in his mind than some cackles of mad laughter. I hate how there are so many untied ends, how I feel like I'll never learn anything at all about some of the interesting things (like the world beyond the doorway ter'angreal, the Age of Legends, etc...) oh well. I'll continue to read, but the magic just seems gone for me. If you want a great series, try George Martin. To me the characters aren't as compelling or interesting as Rand, Mat, Perrin and company were in the first novels, but at least I feel like I have a handle on what's going on and that things are continually moving."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan took on a massive undertaking with Wheel of Time series, and he was masterful in the first three books. The significant time he spent developing the Aiel culture, for example, was a work of art. Character development was a little thin in comparison, and the over-indulgence in female arrogance, political ramblings and other oddities were tiresome and detracted from the overall quality. But the series through book three was strong and held great promise for the future.The literary craftsmanship through book three did not carry into books four through eight. An explosion of story elements received very little development, making it difficult not to conclude them as gimmickry to lengthen the series. Books six through eight in particular afforded no perceptible movement toward the series climax. By book eight's end, Jordan had saddled himself with such a vast array of story elements that he has little chance to tie them back together to reach an elegant and rewarding finale.Book nine attempts to move forward, but fails embarrassingly. Like a novice chess player unwilling to sacrifice any pieces, Jordan inexplicably keeps his entire host of story elements in play, toying with each without strategically moving any. Still, Jordan knows he needs story development in book nine, and he does deliver. With no page space left to work through the wonderful complexities in his story, he uses a butcher knife to cut through them. Book nine contains a number of these discontinuations, and they cost dearly in the integrity of both plot and character. The result is a product that becomes the new benchmark for poor performance in the Jordan's series.Jordan set the standards high in the first three novels. He appears to give in to commercialization and the profit motive in books four through eight by increasing the number of story elements to lengthen the series. Book nine responds to the dissatisfaction of the readership and tries to get the story moving, but sacrifices the story integrity in doing so.Jordan has shown he has real talent. This reviewer hopes he sheds the excess baggage of unneccessary story elements and focuses with redoubled effort on the development of key characters and plot lines."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Wow, nine books through this series already. If it wasn't for Lumley's \\"Necroscope\\", the Wheel of Time would be the longest series of novels I've ever read. Jordan must be doing something right, and I've broken out three things I liked about \\"Winter's Heart\\". My list of complaints is a bit long too, so I've listed the top three problems with this novel as well.The Wheel of Time is a well-done fantasy written with the complexities of Tolkien yet combined with a more contemporary, character-driven writing style. Since this is the ninth book in a series which will continue for several more books, I'm not going to give a lot of plot synopsis since new readers have no reason to begin reading these books at this point. If you attempt it, good luck... complicated, ain't it?OK, positives about \\"Winter's Heart\\"1. My favorite of the original cast of characters, Mat Cauthon, returns after a hiatus. I don't think he appeared at all in \\"The Path of Daggers\\". In any case, Mat is one of the most unique of Jordan's male characters and his mischievous nature makes for a fun time reading, regardless of the situation he's in. The chapters focusing on him are great.2. A MAJOR plotline gets resolved. I'm not going to say which, but resolving this particular plotline points to an actual ending in sight (!) to the Wheel of Time saga. Of course Jordan weaves several other plotlines into the mix, and for the most part does a great job. It seems to me that Jordan has given all the background information necessary on the assorted nations, characters, and cultures within the plots of The Wheel of Time, and that this series is getting ready for the home stretch. I'm still interested to see how it all ends.3. Jordan's writing style is very fluid and he makes it easy to sit back and spend an hour or two reading his books. I plowed through \\"Winter's Heart\\", reading 200 pages at a time which is unusual for me. I can always kill an evening being drawn into this series, and I'm happy to say this book held my attention in a stranglehold.I do have some complaints though...1. Too many characters! There are 50-60+ major characters in this series, and Jordan has a nasty habit of introducing, by name, each and every new face we come across. He tends to give long-winded descriptions of innkeepers, guards, merchants, assorted servants, and anyone and everyone who shows up for no more than a page or two. I'm having a hard enough time with the volume of major players, let alone being introduced to SO MANY new characters. 25% of the cast could be killed off and the plot wouldn't suffer one bit.2. Too complicated! Now, let me say that I DO enjoy an intricate plot, and I like to read stories with a complicated plot. But there comes a time where it gets to be too much, particularly when dealing with Jordan's diarrhea of the word processor. He's capable of weaving so many plots that major characters like Mat can be cast aside for a book and a half (nearly 1500 pages). In the meantime I found myself forgetting a LOT of the characters and their motivations. Several times reading this novel I got lost. I read about a book a week, and with stories this complicated I have a hard time getting back into the swing of it after 2 years without a new W.O.T. story. I'm going to read book 10 and 11 consecutively after they are released, since re-reading the previous books in the series doesn't fit into my schedule. Streamline some of these plots, please.3. Here's where I take some heat. Be ready to click that \\"not helpful\\" button. Jordan has been praised, rightly, for his thoughtful and well-presented female characters, and he takes it a step further by having a great deal of matriarchal societies within the Wheel of Time books. I think his female characters breathe with a life of their own, something quite different from the norm. Some characters' actions and reactions have gotten monotonous, but overall they grow very well in Jordan's hands. These days, it seems to me that EVERY description of hierarchy, ceremony, societal interaction, and everyday conversations MUST involve the fact that in Jordan's world, women run the show. Early in W.O.T., one of the charms was that the balance of power between men and women was spelled out in such a way as to amuse and entertain the reader, and Jordan's gifts in wryly bringing out the political and personal interactions between equally powerful men and women were masterful. Now, throw it all out the window because the women are \\"wearing the pants\\" in every society in this world. That sly balance Jordan used to employ has swung the other way entirely... this is quite a change from the original books, and I can't help but wonder if Jordan is playing to his female readership demographic. Cynical or not, I suspect this is what's happened.\\"Winter's Heart\\" is better than \\"The Path of Daggers\\" and finds this series on the upswing again. I'm rating it 3 stars, but am rounding UP because of the wrapping up of important plotlines and the return of Mat. A good continuation of this series, I recommend you start at the beginning though."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Volume eight and volume nine have moved the story along at a snails pace. One gets the feeling that the author and publisher are taking advantage of early volume success by stringing along the loyal readers who have been with them since volume one. It's discouraging to see Mr. Jordan going for quantity over quality and going the way of Tom Clanc and Stephen King."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I wonder how much Jordan has been manipulated by his Editor and Publisher. Milk it baby! He has probably described \\"wool dress\\" close on 1,000 times. I remember reading about a proposed 8 volumes about five years ago. This garbage is no better than a soap opera and is probably worse since formulaic suspense has at least a rhythm and flow that is predictable and comforting. This stuff is like a car that's missing on one cylinder. So much incredible promise having degenerated into such pathos - its a crying shame."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Hello fellow fans, and all the critics as well...Well, Mr. Jordan finally did something in his plot that really meant something again. I am so glad that some of the people are getting killed off, if just to relieve the pressure on my cerebral cortex from attempting to keep everyone straight.One thing I, and this might say something about me but that's O.K., is that there is a bit more of the Forsaken activity in this one, meaning that more than one is actually involved in parts of what's going on. I wish for more of their character generation, so as to get a look into their persona, as they develop out. I would gather that they are going to be involved in the major action at the end of the series, which is only 13 or 14 books away now. Allright!Seriously, I did enjoy this title much more than Path of Daggers, if only because things actually happened that were important to the plot. I mean important in the sense that I am able to discern what is going on, before reading the next three books, and looking back and saying, &quot;OH! I see why that happened.... Rand needed to have the men who could channel because of the deal with....&quot; Stuff like this make my toes curl when another in the WOT series comes out. I really enjoy them, but at times it seems so slow, but not slow in a boring sense, because it is enjoyable to read, regardless.I must confess though, that I am sick and tired of how Nynaeave pulls her braid, which is the only descriptive thing that I have really pulled out of the. reading.I like the passing characters, but some are so interesting that I would like to reinforce their role in the book, like Lan, but hey, it ain't my book. If it was, it wouldn't probably be as good. I notice that all kinds of people who have reviewed the book are cutting up the whole series. Why? If you don't like the series, then don't read it anymore. I happen to love it, I am just impatient to get some of my big questions answered. Another fellow said that's interesting that you guys all bought the NINTH book, just so you could ream on it. Again, why? Don't you have better things to do than read it if you don't like it?If you like Graduate School reading level fantasy, of which there isn't much out there, you need to read this series. BUt be prepared, It's fun to read, but can quickly get confusing if you don't fix the characters in your head by name."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Before I launch into a harangue on Jordan's detiorating plot writing, I'd like to acknowledge that he is a great writer - and the wheel of time is a great series. 1-6 are tremendous. With that said, there just a few things I want to say. Beginning with book five, and especially in 7-9, Jodan has given us these terribly boring and annoying accounts of immature women, and their minor adventures. I'm beginning to think that Jordan has some distorted or unhealthy perception of women. Maybe all the women he knows are bullies, brats, or snobs? Regardless, the dialogue and plot concerning Nynaeve, Faile, Elayne, and most Aes Sedai accomplish nothing except frustration at all the pettines. The genius of the WOT was Jordan's characterization of the main characters (ta'veren)and many minor (Lan/Moraine, Loial, Isam, Elyas,Thom, the Forsaken, and especially Fain). Also genius, was the sense of history conveyed, the good vs evil drama, and the plot movement. Well the plot movement is coming to a standstill, and all the character development is coming from the annoying and boring wives or girlfriends of the main characters. To top it off, the book length appears to shrink as the spaces between the lines increase. Please Mr Jordan, do your fans a favor - devote 1 chapter to the stupid wives instead of the main characters, and build some plot development with the characters your readers care more about than most of their friends."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Mr. Jordan has finally gone too far by not going far enough. I've been faithful from the beginning, but this one reads like a bad soap opera and his fixation with manipulative women borders on boring. Too many characters, too many subplots and not enough happening to the main characters, at least I assume Rand is a main character. The menage-a-trois plus one is too much. I enjoyed the series up until Path of Daggers, held out hope for a conclusion with that one and now there will be yet another book, which patterns woven tell me will also not end it. At this point I don't care if it never ends, I'm finished. Read it at your own risk, but be prepared to skim pages just to find out IF anything is happening. A real disappointment for what was a potentially good story - in the distant beginning."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've been an avid reader of the series, enjoying each successive Jordan missive as they've been releases. For books 4-8, I re-read the entire series before reading the latest release, just for the continuity and because the books are, well, re-readable.But now...ugh!See, to me, it's all about &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot;...or, in other words, the ability to be immersed in a story line so convincing that your right-brain takes over and mundane things, such as time, cease to be.Just didn't happen in this book. I actually found myself forcing my hands to pick up and continue where I had lost dropped the tome in distracted disgust. I think this is the last Jordan issue I will buy. Part of my problem with the story line is that the characters lose their &quot;other ordinariness&quot; because they take so damn long to *make* things happen. Rand as a re-active (as opposed to proactive) character just isn't a convincing sell.Sorry...on to other novels..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I can only hope that Robert Jordan is still having fun writing this tripe because it stopped being fun to read about 4 or 5 books ago. Say what you will about it being set in a complex world that requires time to develop and &quot;adults&quot; to understand it as much as you want, but, in the end, it is a world and a series that has become bloated beyond both belief and necessity. My biggest gripe, however, is the total abruptness with which we are re-immersed into the story line, after a two year wait since the last book. With no preamble or synopsis, we are practically dropped into the middle of conversations. Since many of the names are similar, since events take thousands of pages across several books to come to a resolution, and since there are myriads of varied suplots, Mr. Jordan could at least make life easier on his readers by dropping reminders, at least in the earlier pages of the book, like &quot;Perrin, who was raised by wolves, set out after the Aiel who kidnapped his wife, Faile at gunpoint and spirited her to the lost city of St. Louis in the borderlands.&quot; As it is, we are expected to remember the details of the kidnapping, who all was with Faile, who among those are pretending to be someone else, and why we should care. And we are expected to divine all this from converstions that began in a book we read two years ago.And the cast of characters grows only more despicable and unlikable with each book. They show absolutely no development, only more regression into the spoiled children they started as. Unfortunately, far more words are invested in what they are wearing instead of how they are growing. Maybe it would be more palatable if they at least developed new habits instead of constantly yanking at their braids and smoothing their clothing.I realize that many genre writes don't like to read in their own genre for fear of &quot;stealing&quot; other writers' ideas. But Mr. Jordan would well be served by taking some hints from some ot the current masters of fantasy. David and Leigh Eddings tend to be a tad wordy at times, but their characters are about the finest in contemporary fantasy. They don't get in a snit if someone has the audacity of trying to save their bacon like all of the arrogant Aes Sedai and stout Two Rivers folk on the Wheel of Time. As for plot development, Raymond Feist and Janny Wurts, in the various Riftwar and Empire series', have more action and plot twists in one chapter than the most of the Wheel of Time books have in 700 pages. And the characters actually learn from their previous actions, to boot!In summary, I can only surmise that the Wheel of Time series is meant for those readers who are willing to invest all of their reading time to one writer, and are willing to restart from book one each time a new one appears. As far as I can tell, that's the only way to keep everything staight in your mind. James Joyce felt that his readers should be willing to invest as much time in reading his books as he did writing them. Well, I always thought that was an incredible presumption, and Robert Jordan is no James Joyce. The sad thing is that I have invested too much time in this series to stop reading it now, but I regard it as a chore, not a pleasure. If anyone reading this review has not yeat started reading the series, DON'T!! Trust me, you'll thank me some day."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"So we come to book nine. And like the series or hate it you're still reading it. I am too. There are parts I like and naturally with EVERY book I ever read there are some things I (especially as a writer)don't and would do differently. I've read many reviews for this series, and agree a little with almost everyone's thoughts both good and bad.I see a lot of the same arguements coming up time and time again.Here's a little of what I have to say:Rand- His philosophy against killing evil women is silly. The way he treats his friends like [junk](Perrin, Mat, Egwene, and Nynaeve) while Min, Elayne, and Aviendha are worshiped as goddesses confuses me to no end. I guess its all part of going insane. Now that Rand is cleansed of the taint I would like to see him become warmer to those who stuck by him.Mat- In all honestly, and I know I might get a lot of heat for this. I think of the three main males, I think Mat is the least interesting. Grow Up and accept who and what you are, Mat. This is taking far to long for him, which in a way is a good thing considering how quickly the rest of the Two Rivers clan accepted theirs, but I'm tired of going gambling & bar hopping with him. Now that he has met the Daughter of the Nine Moons he might finally become important and fun to read about.Perrin- Of the three, Perrin has the most interesting plotlines. His ordeal with wolves is still a mystery that I hope doesn't slip Jordan's mind to resolve. He was the first to \\"Settle Down\\" and the first to acually do something with his leadership skills. (aka the Two Rivers/Whitecloaks/ Trollocs) Way to go Perrin I hope you save Faile in the next installment.Egwene- At first I thought she seemed pointless. Then when she went into the waste she became less of a brat and more of a woman. Now as Amyrlin she's as tough as nails and ready to take on the Reds in the Tower. I missed her in Winter's Heart.Nynaeve- Why so many people find her annoying I don't see it. Okay the braid pulling has to go yes but give the woman some credit. Look at what she has accomplished in this series. She protects her Two Rivers people first and foremost, she captures a forsaken on her own, She heals stilled women, helps make the weather right again, and she helped cleansed the male half of the True Source. All the while holding in her passions for Lan intact. Nynaeve deserves a rest. Jordan has a habit of giving all the main characters a book break. I would not be surpised if she doesn't even appear in book ten.Elayne- Every book (not just one's written by Jordan) comes with a regular character that the reader can't stand, and Elayne is that character. I think she is the reason why so many readers don't like Nynaeve. The pairing of these two on adventures must stop. Put Morgase back on the thrown, have her marry Gareth Bryne, let them conceive another daughter-heir, kill the annoying Elayne, take Aviendha with her. Then Min can have Rand all to herself this solves many of the plots.Aviendha- I liked her until she learned she could channel.Min- As far as the woman characters go. She is one of two that don't have a negative thought about the opposite gender.Faile- I think the only regular \\"normal\\" female character in the series who can't channel or see other people's future. She is also not willing to share her man unlike Elayne and Aviendha. So for that I like Faile the most.The Forsaken- Many readers feel the Forsaken are keeping silient far too long. Well, except for Moghedien (and the resurrected ones) all the Forsaken who have confronted our heroes found themselves dead. I'm sure Semirhage has something cooking in that twisted mind of hers not to mention the remaining survivors.The Sub-plots- My last opinion is based on the large number of complaints on this one. I have read many fantasy stories. All great reads but one of the biggest questions I asked the book is \\"Where is the rest of the World\\" Many writers seemed to neglect how a evil wizard (for example) bent on world domination had an impact on not just a small group of people, but the whole world. Some books I have read make that world totally disappear. The world I see in the end is run by one to ten heroes and one evil bad dude. The Prophecies of the Dragon IS going to affect more than just our five main characters. I like the fact that Robert Jordan adds a point of view here or there. Whatever anyone says these minor sub-plots do not take away the heart of these books, but rather make them more interesting and more intriguing. Again like them or hate them you are still reading them and most likely will continue to do so.I hate the waiting too, (every 2 years??) ugh, but I'll pick up the next installment right when I see it.NOTE: What is stated above is stictly my opinion. I'm not saying my feelings are right or wrong. Whether you agree with them or not it is up to you to read them (starting with The Eye of the World) and find out."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"In the previous books in the series, Jordan seems able to keep the exitement at a fairly constant level while still managing to pay attention to all the characters and myriad plotlines. Unfortunatly Winter's Heart has about two or three chapters devoted the the 'lesser' plotlines and spends the rest of the book on the main storyline. While it is somewhat interesting, you keep wondering what happens to the other characters. The only thing that redeems this book is the ending, which I will not disclose here. When you finish, I am almost certain that the first thing on you mind will be when is the next book coming out. This book just seems to be setting the stage for the next book, and though it does it quite well there are gaps left that keep you wondering. I guess that this is a good thing because it means that Jordan has to keep writing, and people will keep buying. The one thing that all of the WOT books need is a brief synopsis of the previous books, or just a list of who is who and who died, just so that everytime a new one comes out you don't need to reread the whole series to figure out what is going on."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am a Wheel of Time fan, but the last two books were mediocre in my opinion. Book 9 is a big improvement. There is still too much talking about women pulling braids, adjusting their skirts, minor political intrigue, etc. However, these minor frivolities are easily overlooked with the exciting plots and mysteries revealed in this new volume. The first part of the book was pretty slow, but it was worth it when you read the awesome ending."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am a long-time reader of Mr. Jordan's (aren't we all?) and I waited anxiously for this book to arrive. While I completely undertand the ebb and flow of the plot, and I certainly comprehend what Mr. Jordan was trying to accomplish with this book, I must still say I am a bit disappointed. Not with the story, but with the editing.I feel that this book needed to stew a bit more, and get a more thorough edit. I know, I know, we all feel that Mr. Jordan is the best around, but his work generally has a bit more polish than this one did. The Perrin story arc was just dropped, there were numerous grammatical errors, and, at the end, people started showing up from out of the woodwork. This is not the quality I have come to expect from Mr. Jordan.Will I continue to read the series? Of course I will. Do I still feel this book is worth reading? Of course I do. A lot of things do get accomplished, a lot of plots are resolved and his capture of the characters is as thrilling as always. It just seems that this book was rushed -- it shows in the flow of the book, the segues from scene to scene and character to character, and the sentence structure, grammar, and spelling. While this book is good, it is not great. I would have preferred to have waited another three or four months and had a full book, than to get a half finished one early.I still rank Mr. Jordan as one of the top writers of the epic fantasy genre. And, while he has stiff competition from George Martin and Tad Williams, he is still, in my opinion, the best guy around. I fully look forward to the remaining novels, and, unlike many, I do not feel that this is &quot;dragging on&quot; unnecessarily. It takes a lot of time, effort, and attention to detail to take over the world and save it. Poor Rand and his friends have a long tale to tell and Mr. Jordan is doing a fine job telling it. I just wish his editors had more time, talent, and guts in the future than they did this time around."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I just started rereading the series again recently, and just hit book 5. I have had the suspicion since the beginning, but now I am becoming more sure. I think that this series is not being written by the same person. Either this series is soooo long that the author (Robert Jordan if he exists) changes his writing style in each book and forgets what he wrote in the last one, or we have different writers working on the series. For example, many people have noticed how the series gets REALLY bad in book 5. I think this may mean that the original author's final book is book 4 and the new author(s) take over. There are also the noticable inconsistencies (which could be easily attributable to the length of the series if they weren't just so blatantly obvious!). For example, many of Min's viewing from book 1 never show up. Another big one that made me cringe: at the end of book 4, the Avendesora tree in Rhuidean only has one limb broken, but in the beginning of book 5 Avendesora is completely burnt. Also, Fain/Ordeith says he is going to go to Caemlyn to work his evil at the end of book 4, but at the beginning of book 5 he is in Tar Valon. As to the so-called &quot;Robert Jordan&quot;, this is the main character of Hemingway's &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;!; either a great pen-name or a cover for the many authors writing the series. Maybe I am wrong, and &quot;Jordan&quot; just went through one of the Mark Twain-Huck Finn type mid-work changes, or..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan is just too long winded for me. I enjoyed the first six books, but lately, especially with this last book, it is just not fun anymore. Unless you are obsessed with the Wheel of Time series, go spend your money on something better and more tightly written books. All the characters continue to whine and nothing ever really happens (...). Read the first six books and skip the rest until he decides to finally end this long winded series that rambles on and on and on and on. LIGHT, what a bore!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The series does recover somewhat from previous books due to this book, but not completely. Less slumber parties, but nevertheless more of the same old, same old. Characters are unidimensional, dialog is often infantile, overly verbose, repetetive descriptions, etc. Did anyone expect otherwise?I'll finish reading the series. Not because it's great, but because I'm one of those people who has to finish a story once started. I did experience some hesitation, however, because of the last book and after reading Jordan's claim (here on Amazon) that he's a better writer than Tolkien. Talk about cheek!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Okay first of all this book gets 2 stars instead of one is mainly because it was slightly better than POD. I had so much hopes for this book that Jordan will get back to the days of the first 5 books, considering the criticism he received for POD and rightly so in my opinion, but alas it was too much to hope for. The dollar signs are embebded just too firmly in his eyes now, as he realises people who have actually bought nine books will definenetly buy the last 4 or 5. The experiment with the E-prologue is proof to that greed and milking of dedicated faithful fans.Okay then the book wasnt all bad there were some enjoybable stuff there Mat's POV for one tho the whole thing with Tylin is so belaboured it makes me cringe. Rand was mostly ignored till the ending and besides sitting there with eyes glazed, in a trance, didnt contribute much else. The flipping of POV's from forsaken to forsaken was beyond shoddy. Some of the most powerful channlers turn up... and retreat, within two pages per forsaken. He could have done so much more with that scene. A whole 300 pages were wasted with Perrin and Faile POV's which could have been written in 10 pages, if you took out the filler. Apart from that there was the usual 400 pages of filler which we are now coming to expect from Jordan. Travelling, bickering, whining, sniffing, tugging etc.. There was all that still in there. An attempt to tie up a few lose ends from book 2/3 was made halfheartedly and failed miserably as no particular reasons were given and it didnt contribute to anything of the plot. I am sure that passage in the book was introduced mainly to actually tie up an end.I am sorry to say Jordan has lost it. All the hardcore fans of Jordan who keep harping on about how good WH is , open your eyes and compare the last 3 books with the first 3. All transitions should be complete by now, all character developments done by book five, he should have started getting on with it from book 6 IMO. Noone can deny , how the last three books have slowed down to a crawl with nothing happening in them and how his writting has gotten wporse and worse. What for?? $$$$$$$$. that is the main motivation behind Jordan's writting now, to milk as much as possible from this never ending soap opra of a series..

I cannot take this dress off by myself.&quot;Isn't that sweet? Like, &quot;Fair is fair! Rock and roll, baby!&quot;As ridiculous as reincarnating the Forsaken was, I must say, the newest twist in the Rand-and-his-women plotline is worse. Really, by book twenty-four, Rand will have half the women in the story bonded to him. As well as ten unhealable wounds and about a million tattoos. I'm starting to think that Jordan includes his &quot;I taught myself to read before I was born, then traveled back in time to inspire Jules Verne!&quot; biography in the back of his books in a (vain) attempt to convince his readers that he knows what he's doing. We jus' don't see where this is goin' 'cause for we done ain't dat smart!To be fair, I do think that the first five books were excellent. I had the major advantage of starting to read the series after publication of the first eight books, so I never had a chance to forget previous plot elements or characters while waiting for the next installment. The series has degenerated markedly, however...Recent books have been most unsatisfying for me because I love Mat and Perrin dearly, and get sad when I don't see them for a long time. I hate all the women (except for Min, even with her &quot;new look&quot;) and wish they would at least not talk so much, not to mention smoothing skirts or tugging braids.Final note, on that same topic. Clearly, Jordan simply forgot to mention the part in the book where Lan was hit on the head with a heavy, blunt object.

I feel personally betrayed, as at this point I have invested god knows how many hours in pouring over this story, and I think jordan has actually gone and stopped telling it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I remember getting &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; the day it came out and reading on the net soon after that Robert Jordan was breaking his tradition of one WOT book per year and moving to one every other year. Suffice to say, there was a good deal of disappointment amongst the Robert Jordan fandom.This disappointment bred resentment when the first follow-up in this extended wait period, &quot;Path of Daggers&quot;, proved to be one of the shortest novels in the series and advanced the timeline not at all. It was at that point that &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; fans, especially those who had followed the series from the beginning, began to wonder if their author had either lost control of the series or was milking them for all they were worth.The debate continued with &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;, released in November of 2000. Many decried the slow pace, comparing it to &quot;Path of Daggers&quot;. However, where the two books differ is in advancement of plot. Whereas &quot;Path of Daggers&quot; was more of the same thematically with &quot;Crown of Swords&quot; (really they should have been one book!), &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; addresses some long-standing character issues and plot hooks. In this case, Jordan's methodical pacing (present from CoS onward) serves him well as he is able to set up where the characters are at mentally and storywise for a number of major events that (presumably) will follow in the next book. Most of all, especially in the last couple of chapters, Jordan shows that he still has the ability to rivet the reader and amaze them. For any Jordan fan, the ending alone is worth the purchase of the book. I believe that Jordan is back in form with &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;, but I guess we'll have to wait 'til the next &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; entry to see whether I'm right or not. Not withstanding, &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; is a superior entry to the series, coming off the heels of a disappointment, and should help ease the minds of worried readers out there.Besides, IMHO, I'd like to say that our overall concern and disappointment is driven less by the length/pacing of the series and more by our fear that Robert Jordan is going to die before finishing!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It is unfortunate, but true; Jordan has slowed down in the last half of his WoT series. While perhaps it is understandable, as in each 600+ page book he is dealing with the same characters, but I am sure there is some way that the pace could be picked up, and the reader could end a book feeling that he got somwehere. Unfortunately, that doesn't happen here. I had hopes that in the last few books of the series, a chain of events would occur that Jordan had set up in the previous books, but I have yet to see it. While Winter's Heart is still a well written book in my opinion, with plenty of descriptors, it was missing some pieces I would have liked to see. Hardly ANY mention was made of Egwene, and her war against the White Tower is one of the most interesting parts in my opinion! Mat was brought back into the thick of things, but I had forgotten what had caused him to be stuck in Ebou Dar, so had to go researching for that in a previous book, as well as to re-familiarize myself with what occured at Dumai's Wells, since that also is metioned several times. While Perrin does make an appearance, it is not a substantial one. I realize that Rand is the main character, but there is only so much one can take of a madman ranting in the head of another madman. However, WoT still remains my favorite fantasy epic, and Jordan still remains an excellent writer, able to pull his readers directly into the fantasy world he has created. I will eagerly await the 10th book, again hoping for a little more than what I recieved in Winter's Heart."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"How do these guys think they can get away with writing these volumes of :xxxx&quot;.

He could've dealt with a lot more stuff with a couple more hundred pages. Mat's one of my favorite characters and the part when he realizes that Tuon's the one was hilarious.I have no problems with the length of the series. With such complex and intertwining plots, RJ should not be stingy about the number of books. It is the very complexity of the story, with its numerous factions that makes the series so great. Most other fantasy series have only one set of good guys vs one set of bad. In this one, there are so many different groups working towards their ultimate goal of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; in their own ways. That's what makes it special and so real. The only other one that comes close is the Song of Ice and Fire by George R R Martin but I suspect he got some inspiration from RJ.I still love the series. I hope RJ writes faster. The waiting just kills me."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After thousands of pages of character development where we know them better than they know one another, we become interested in how their lives change and grow. This is not a typical good vs. evil epic, these heroes are flawed and struggle with not only saving the world, but everyday problems that distract them. Evil characters have their points of light dimmed beyond where they believe they can change, yet are propelled to action out of fear of the consequences of inaction. In each character's struggle while interacting with other characters, patterns form that leave you feeling that you are missing the trees by looking at the forest. It is often difficult to sense the timeline of what is happening to the other groups of characters yet you know the actions of one create reactions for all. If I were to fault the construction of the epic, it would not be for the major characters and their actions but for the confusion created by the minor characters and feeling the need for a handbook of &quot;who is who in Randland&quot;. The best part of the book is the contrast and comparison of the Seanchan attempt to consolidate an extention to their empire and crushing individuality as it attempts to assume and maintain order. Returning to a world of diversification and nations with petty dislikes and distrusts of one another, is their way perhaps the best one to consolidate a united effort in war? Is nationality and individuality a luxury that can only be afforded in a time of peace? In this installment, Rand learns that he cannot save the world on his own. He needs to trust others and by becoming open, sharing his joy and pain, the world stand a chance to overcome the forces of darkness that threaten all. Each time a mystery is solved, there are others that will fill the priority list and keep us enchanted and wanting to know more. We who read this epic have known repeatedly from the beginning of this cycle that there were ages before and ages yet to come with more history and more potential futures than we will ever have time to read, so let those who grumble about milking the storyline fall by the wayside and stop reading...there are enough of us enmeshed in the development of this world of Jordan's creation to go on reading his books without them.

Whilst the first 4 or 5 in the series were very good, ever since then the books have just been more padding and less story. The characters have become continuingly 1 dimensional, the female characters especially. (While they appear to be strong willed, all they ever seem to do is complain about the men, and compare how low cut their dresses are.) As you progress through to the end of this book you realize that while the book is close to 1000 pages long, the whole books' story line could have been compressed down to about 30. We are continuingly waiting for something to happen.Based on the reading of the 7th and 8th books I was unsure whether to buy this book, but I did more to continue on with a series I initially enjoyed. I am now telling my friends not to bother buying it, just go to a bookstore, pick it off the shelf and read the last 50 pages.

The pacing of the plot is so slow, and the books appear so infrequently that neither Mr. Jordan or myself are likely to be around to write/read about the final battle of good and evil.

The man has developed the most complete, complex, and all encompassing work of our time. This story is not about easy reading, or even high-impact constant edge-of-your seat drama. Jordan has not created a story to help us escape reality for a while, but he has created an entirely new reality, one that is full, rich, and complete. Jordan's style of writing is definately unique. He has a flare for the dramatic that cannot be beat. In my opinion, he is a brilliant author, and he deserves more respect than he is getting around here.I will grant that at times the story does not move along as quickly as it does at other times. And the complexity of the story makes it somewhat difficult to follow many of the minor characters. But it must be understood that this is all part of Jordan's magic. If he did not take the time to slow the story down for some character development, and to add all of the political complexities and twists, then this story would just be another simple fantasy novel. The complexities that Jordan adds, all of the minor characters, the wonderfully amazing attention to detail, and his ability to incorporate so much prophecy into the story is what really brings out the magic.I know that this is where we all present our opinions of the book, and the author. So present your opinions, but stop telling Jordan how to write his books. He is doing just fine by himself. I doubt that the works would be as successful if his critics were writing the story.This book was truly amazing, another bestseller for Jordan. The only dissapointing thing in my opinion is that now I must wait once again for the next installment. Such is life, eh?I for one will be ready to follow Jordan as he continues the journey toward the Last Battle, and I don't care how many books it takes for him to get there. We are witnessing the birth of a classic fantasy story. This story will be one that all others in the future will be compared to, such as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Let me start off by saying that this entire book could have been accomplished by a 5 page chapter at the end of book 4 or 5. Rand al Thor cleanses the taint from the Source (oh, did I ruin it for you? Don't worry, I'm actually saving you from reading 550 pages to find this out. Go out and play with your kids or something!)and that's it! The first 300 pages actually caused me an intense physical pain which I initially attributed to a fledgling brain tumor but later turned out to be extreme boredom. Come on Bobby (can I call him Bobby?) end the series and save us all a large sum of money and time. Maybe we'll even buy a few more of your books some day as long as no one in them has &quot;al&quot; in their name! That said, this series as a whole started strong and eventually withered up (altough we couldn't tell because we were busy trying to climb out of 10,000 pages of text).

The answer is while this book is definately better than the previous two, Mr. Jordan is still milking his fan base. I have come to hold Mr. Jordan in the highest regard because I feel he understands that the reading public are not stupid, and are not afraid of a complex story with many subplots. He is as adept at creating and developing characters as any author I have read. Be that as it may, &quot;ENOUGH ALREADY&quot;, 9 books and counting, please Robert take a cue from Eddings, you can complete a brilliant story line, and still bring the same characters back, and place them in new situations, and we will love them just as much as we did in the previous story line. Well, back to the book. As I said this is a much better story than the previous two, although, he still wastes almost two thirds of the book before anything of import happens. The 4 stars were earned for the final 200 pages or so. The end of the book moved along at a great pace, making the setup of the previous 400 pages well worth it. Mr. Jordan shows he is still one of the best at this genre. I must say, however, George RR Martin is right up his you what these days. Anyway, the book is worrth buying, I just hope Jordan takes heed of the outcry from his faithful readers and ties up this series soon."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"For all of those who say that too little happened in A Path of Dagger and A Crown Of Swords I agree with you. Jordan could have not written those two books and nothing would have changed. Yet in this book he does not give the reader a whole lot (certainly less than in the first five books), but there are some monumental changes that make this book worth reading if you wish to read the rest of the series. For those who truley loved the first five give this one a try and read it all the way to the end and you will find that the series is starting to pick up again."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've been reading Robert Jordan since i was in Jr. high, and soon i will be a senior in college. this new book ran much of the way like the last few, which isnt all that good, and somwhat depressing, but the last 100 pages made up for the last 3 books alltogether. The last pages are much like the style Jordan had for books 1, 3, 4, and in parts of 5. (book 2 was good but was much like books 7 and 8) and that kept me reading the last 100 pages straight through."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"With the last book used as a setup, this one showed more of the excitement that Lord Of Chaos and Fires of Heaven showed. It rekindled the Mat storyline which i was glad to see and it had that action packed ending i always love.

Slow plot lines and too much detail is how I would describe it. As a fan of the series you keep reading through the chapters, not because the story grabs you, but because you're waiting for something to happen. Nothing really does. RJ should have added the &quot;major event&quot; in this book to his last and saved us all the trouble of book nine.With the last few books, it's beginning to feel as if he's milking($) his fans instead of making sure his storyline continues to be exiting and imaginary and move towards it's natural conclusion.Just my opinion......."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm sitting here reading reviews of this book, trying to determine whether I should go ahead and purchase books 6 through 9. You see, I haven't read them yet. I made it part way through 6 and then lost interest. My wife bought me number 7 for Christmas a while back, and I haven't even opened it.What startles me is that I've read about 50 reviews so far, many of which contained &quot;spoilers.&quot; None of the spoilers surprised me, and I was familiar with all the plot lines referred to by the reviews.Scary, huh?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Gentlemen, log on.Thanks to modern technology, the internet now hosts countless webpages with character lists and reminders of the 100-odd plots still weaving in this latest installment of the Wheel of Time Series.You're gonna need it.Fans are still coming down hard on the author for the incredibly slow pace and exponentially increasing character list -- falling all over themselves to point out exactly the difference between the early novels and this one.No, it's not an instant classic like Eye of the World. No, it doesn't have a plot like The Great Hunt. And no, it doesn't even answer ANY of the lingering plot lines. Rand cleanses saidin, that's about it.If anything needs to go, it's the traveling ability. Instead of adventures and hero journeys, everyone goes wherever they wish to accomplish nothing. The interweaving plotlines format is do-able, but they have to be tied up at the conclusion of each book. Cliffhangers aren't necessary...if we bought this one after the insulting Path of Daggers we'll probably buy the next one too."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I don't think I was ever so frustrated with a book as I was with Path of Daggers. That is Mr. Jordan's gift...the ability to turn a normally rational fantasy fan into a raving maniac pulling out his or her hair because they want to know when Moiraine's coming back or how Mat and the Daughter of the Nine Moons are going to get along. It's amazing.After Path of Daggers, I went around telling people I wasn't reading any more Robert Jordan books. Of course, that didn't hold true. I'm glad it didn't. Winter's Heart still doesn't quite live up to the wonderful pacing, action and development as the first three books in the series, but it's a good start. Mat came back to pester the Seanchan. Finally. Elayne skipped around the Lion Throne, deciding whether or not to take a seat and made a fool of herself over Rand, as usual. As did Min and Aviendha. Rand was accumulating a sizable harem, although he did manage to bestir himself in the end. And those Ashaman are great characters.The ending...What a scene! Perhaps a few too many Forsaken with alternate names scurrying about, but absolutely great. I smiled the whole time. Finally, something happened! There were flashes of the engaging characters that reached out and grabbed me and I hope book 10(does anybody have a date?) delivers even more. The parts from Mat's perspective are hilarious. Best line in the book is in his last scene. I laughed a lot!My complaints - Mr. Jordan's previously interestingly detailed descriptions are unnecessarily long, especially in the case of Elayne and that Sea Folk woman. Almost as if someone were getting paid by the page... Where was Egwene? Is the disappearance of major, important characters for an entire book going to become a habit? I hope not. Why are there women stronger in the Power that Nynaeve? I mean, she does have a great role in the last scene, but she's not quite as fiery as she was before. I guess it would take Lan to tame her. She's a great character, though, and I hope she doesn't get pushed to the background. And, for heaven's sake, I know Moiraine's got to be around there somewhere..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I agree with all of you when you say you enjoyed the first book throught the sixth, and after that it went dry for a little while... but I think the ninth book was wonderful! At least, the second half of it was. I started out reading it, and wondering if the long awaited Winter's Heart would be just as pointless as Path of Daggers, and then found that after Rand was bonded, the plot quikened amazingly. In fact, I couldn't put the book down after that. Also, The seventh book was no great masterpiece, but I still found it entertaining. In my opinion, the only failure in this series was Path of Daggers. I think most of the complaints come from people who are tired of waiting for the end, and though I fell the same way, I think this book deserved a LOT more than the 1.5's and 2's you people are giving it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I personally have loved all of the WOT books up until now. Although this book is still decent, I found it lacking in many ways. For one the plot barely moves. Most of what was unresolved in the last novel remains that way. The only surprising turn of events was the ending. I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it. Two, I find myself not liking many of the main characters(Min, Faile, and Elayne to name a few). These lukewarm personalities seem to control many of the scenes. Three, the introduction of the blight border lords in the previous novel is barely even mentioned in this novel. In any case, I hope that Mr. Jordan will be good to his word and not let the obvious and inevitable rule the future of these intriguing and irascible characters."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"What are you people talking about? This is the best Wheel of Time yet! I couldn't put it down! I read this one faster that any of the other eight. I am already anxiously awaiting the next novel. You have to leave the reader hanging to make them want to keep reading and Jordan has this down to an art. I have to agree that the last two or three weren't as good; however, Winter's Heart makes up for it without question."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"With the exception of the last 100 pages of this book, Winter's Heart is just as over-inflated and boring as the previous two. I am tired of reading about women's dresses! I am tired of infinite sub-plots that are never revealed. What about the land beyond the waste? What about the athan mere and their Coramoor? Lets resolve the sub-plot with Matt, Rand and the Seanchan already! And how about an end to Elaida!Anyway, like all WOT fans, I am frustrated with this series. But the ending of this book is momentus and offers a promise of more to come. If you don't read the book and unless someone clues you in, you will be a little lost in the next book. This is more than I can say for the last two."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I want to start off by saying that I can understand that Mr Jordan has spent many years writing this series, and after so many books it may be boring or even difficult for him to continue at this point. I want to make sure we all understand that no matter how this reads, I'm sure most of us appreciate the amount of work involved in producing works like these. However, now it comes down to opinion time. When I borrowed a copy of Winter's Heart from a friend, I went in somewhat closed minded, since I have been unhappy with the series since Fires of Heaven, and outright disappointed in Path of Daggers. I was surprised to find that this book was better than the last, but then again after Path of Daggers the series really had no where to go but up. This book has some useful information about the characters, and Matt's return was handled fairly well, especially the part when he discovers the Daughter of the nine moons. His actions there would be typical of the type of gambler he is.However, there was absolutely no need for me to know that Birgitte and Elayne had the same cycle now. I thought it was bad when every chapter about Nynaeve had her changing her underwear. While that can be a pleasant thought, there's only so many times you can dip into that well. As always, there is at least one fairly well rendered nude scene, and amazingly it doesn't involve any of the three major characters. Also, I'm only slightly surprised that Elayne didn't [attack] Rand at their meeting, or Alanna for that matter. It seems that she is smitten with Rand as well. Now, we come to the least defined main character in any book I've ever read: Perrin. Now, we do have some information about Perrin, but compared to the others he is sketchy at best. Perrin is in a couple of chapters about nothing, as usual. Personally, if they left him out of this book like they left Matt out of one, nothing would have been lost with regards to him. I like Perrin, but he is just too undefined for me. If you read the rest of the series, you need to read this one since it ties up some loose ends, but it also leaves just as many. I'm hoping to reach the Last Battle soon, because if not the Last Battle might be to read the rest of the series or not."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I was so glad to FINALLY pick up and read the new book in the Wheel of Time. It's still a great series and I loved it! So why the three stars? Let me tell ya...First off, the beginning had Faile getting kidnapped by the Shaido, and Perrin started the search for her... but then this plot line was dropped. Huh? We never go back to it and this is only about 100-150 pages into the book. It's like he forgot about it. There are a few minor plot lines that this happens to as well. In the teaser text inside the jacket, it mentions something about Mazrim Taim being a liar... but nothing is ever really done about this. Perrin's (short) storyline reveals someone by the name of Slayer stalking Tel'aran'rhiod and the Wolfdream, but then the storyline disappears.Secondly, Mr. Jordan needs to start putting a comprehensive glossary in the back that contains all definitions and people. Too many people have come and gone, and by the next book we've forgotten who they are. The only people mentioned in the back are ones you don't need to look up. This is a big minus.Thirdly, it seems like the copy editor was asleep. There were an inordinate number of typos, misspelled words and garbled sentences. The other books were a very high standard. It seems as if the publisher rushed this one to the presses.Aside from those flaws, the story was good. Jordan wrote in a seemingly new abbreviated style. In previous books it was common to read 100 pages of uneventful journey from one city to the next or waiting in camp for someone to arrive, but now he will actually jump forward in time to be where the story needs to be. I suppose this is also helped by the in story convention of Travelling, but it is refreshing. There are times when characters seemingly show up in places and you don't know why though.The characters seem to have new life breathed into them. Especially Rand. Rand of late has been a heavy handed mad-man. He was toned down a bit in this book, but still being his hard self as he hunts down the Ashaman who tried to kill him in the previous book.Mat shows up again in an interesting situation I have no recollection of from the last book. Although if I were to go back and read it I'd probably refresh my memory. He's stuck in Ebou Dar and is trying to get out... and the Daughter of the Nine Moons finally shows up to complicate his life...All-in-all, a flawed but enjoyable book. I wait (im)patiently for the next one. Don;t keep us waiting Mr. Jordan."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It was interesting to read reviews of WOT and find that others shared my opinions - both good and bad. I have enjoyed all of the books in this series. However after reading Winter's Heart, I found that it had been so long between books, and the story had advanced so slowly in the last several books, I couldn't remember who was doing what and why. Mr. Jordan did not refresh our memories with little reminders to bring us back up to speed, as he did in earlier books. So, I decided to go back and reread all of the books. I am on book 4 and am enjoying the story even more the second time. I recommend this to anyone who has been reading WOT from the beginning (I couldn't believe it has been 11 years since the first book!). I am not complaining about how many books there are, just that it is too long in between books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well here we are Book 9 of the Wheel of Time series and I still scratch my head wondering why I continue to bother. True, as others have mentioned, after investing so much time in this, it's almost mandatory reading now, as if I was still in school. Winter's Heart is an improvement over the preceding 3 books, but it in no way captures the spirit of the early volumes. Jordan is obviously in it only for the money now and suckers like me will continue to line his pockets. The ending by the way, had the potential to be terrific, but Jordan drops the ball by failing to complete the narrative action on many of the point of view set pieces. He becomes lazy by setting up the individual conflicts then abandons them. You only discover threads of what transpired when it's all over. Very sloppy, and not considerate to the reader who had to endure much minutia before reaching the climax."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Once again, Robert Jordan has come through with a very enjoyable installment in his epic saga, The Wheel of Time. Each of the 650 plus pages holds on to you and leaves you breathless for the next installment. I'm not holding my breath though...but I would if it would make Jordan write faster!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Crown of Swords marked the begining of a comeback for Jordan. It's so hard to keep track of all the characters and I(a big Robert Jordan fan) think it's quite annoying. But this Winters Heart does a great job for Jordan, making this one of my favorites. The plot doesn't change to much and there's more characters to keep in track with, but he's writing the script a lot tighter in stead of long wordy thoughts.The ending of this book is awesome. It's the best ending so far in the series and Robert Jordan does a pretty good job it most of his endings."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Yes, Its long and drones on quite a bit, but look at all he accomplished. I lie awake hours on end reading these books, and once I must fall asleep, I can't because I'm trying to predict what is going to happen next, and then I can't sleep. I must pick up the book and continue reading. He makes you want everything, I constantly yell at my book; No, Rand! Just a few more steps... Perrin! What were you thinking! Mat, you little devil... I personally love how indepth every character is, you feel as if they're your best of friends. So my Review is a full 5 stars"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am presently rereading this series, as so much happens in each book; that I need a refresher before tackling the next one. And, I admit, the long wait for the next installment drove me to rereading. This is my favorite fantasy series, of all time; above J.R.R. Tolkien, Piers Anthony, David Eddings, and even Terry Goodkind.There have been a lot of complaints about the length and complexity of this series, but that is what constantly delights me. And in rereading I have been putting together a lot of references, that I missed the first time. Robert Jordan constantly enriches the series, and provides driving forces that put events in motion. There is a purpose for each character.The constant coincidences would have long turned me off of this series, except for the way Jordan &quot;weaves&quot;them in. The &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; provides the reason that coincidence must exist.The characters are so real, and each is distinct from another. There are no cardboard characters. And their personalities and experiences shape events.Events do seem to be going a little slower, than in the first books. For instance, look how much happens in Eye of the World. But, the quickpace serves a purpose in the first book. It is a lifechanging series of events, that rips Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, and Nynaeve from their village.Now, my one complaint would be how little has changed in Faile and her parties situation. They were prisoners at the end of Book 8, and Perrin has not managed to save them in &quot;Winter's Heart.&quot;The very last pages with Mat getting ready to leave, and finding out the identity of the Daughter of the Nine Moons is so exciting. There they are, with more companions than they expected, in a stable, about to set out on a new adventure. Does that remind you of &quot;Eye of the World?&quot; Would it be as exciting, if Mat hadn't been so long in Ebou Dar?Take a close look at these books, and you will find a lot beneath the surface. Would Egwene have attained her position, in &quot;Lord of Chaos,&quot; without the rivalry between Lelaine and Romanda? And would she have gained any influence without the added rivalry between those two, and Sheriam?I think the regret will be, that this series does draw to a close. I would not mind if he continued beyond the one or two more books expected."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Okay. I have read, waited, forgotten, read again, waited, forgotten. I started this series years ago, when it had promise, and like everyone else, I am sick of this drawn out drivel Mr. Jordan is passing for a fantasy novel. It all boils down to this: He is padding his retirement portfolio! What was originally going to be an eight to ten book series, has ballooned into the 'teens! Or more, from what I've heard!It's all about the Benjamins now. Too bad, as this series was one of the best, if not the best, since Tolkein. Then came Book Seven...then Eight...then Nine.

What a ringing endorsement, huh?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan has struck a balance of satisfaction and interest in the next installment. I was completely enthralled in this book. Anyone who has read the first 8 books that found this one lacking should re-read the whole series for what they may have missed. It was satisfying to see some of my suspicians play out (I was right - some of the time) and other times pleasantly suprizing to learn what Jordan has planned all along. The layering of the stories really exercise the brain.I am not only a fan of Robert Jordan, I also have great respect for Michael Kramer and Kate Reading who narrate the Un-Abridged audio books. I hope these two will continue to lend their talents for the rest of the series (unlike the constant switching of narrators with each Sword of Truth novel)."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The only thing bad about Winter's Heart is that it leaves you yearning for the next book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"He lee&iacute;do la colecci&oacute;n completa de la serie &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; escrita por Robert Jordan. Al igual que muchos de los lectores de ficci&oacute;n &eacute;pica que inicialmente nos enviciamos con los primeros libros de esta serie, tengo que reconocer que los &uacute;ltimos cuatro libros dejan mucho que desear y pueden catalogarse como engorrosos y aburridos. Para el pr&oacute;ximo a salir esperar&eacute; por la revisi&oacute;n de otros lectores y/o la versi&oacute;n en carpeta blanda que resulta m&aacute;s barata y menos dolorosa la decepci&oacute;n de resultar tan mala como los &uacute;ltimos tres libros (The Wheel of Time Books 7, 8 y 9). Es una pena por que la serie promet&iacute;a mucho en los primeros libros, pero parece que Jordan quiere estirar demasiado la trama."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Great books that I loved! The one thing I didn't like about this incredibly detailed book is that the point it stopped at makes you want the next book NOW! Not a read for younger kids because of the specatular web of charactors and it won't be as interesting if you can't connect some things to figure it out."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I will not go as far to say that &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; was anywhere near as good as any of the first five books. However, I will say that I thought that it was a very good book. Although some of the imformation and thoughts may sound trivial, it does make for a better book. For those of you out there who think that my review of this book may be shallow and my level of reading that low that I don't know what I'm talking about, I would beg to differ. After reading &quot;Les Miserables&quot; (unabridged version, mind you), no book can compare. But Jordan's Wheel of Time does prove to facinate me because of the compexity of the world as well as the characterization. As in &quot;Les Miserables&quot;, as well as the classic &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, there is rich characterization. I would have to say that the Wheel of Time, including &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; have come to a level of such complex charicterization that is near to that of the classics. The ending of &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;, as well as the other books in the series, has a cliff hanger of an ending. The ending is still satisfying to any Wheel of Time fan. Don't give up on Robert Jordan just yet, he still has a few tricks up his sleeve. I haven't been disapointed yet, and the next book will not disapoint either."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart had the best ending since Lord of Chaos and Dumai's Wells, but was slow the first 200 pages but picked up greatly and didn't stop. Then you add Mat and his shenanigan's, the girls bonding Rand, and a bunch of answers to questions everybody has been asking (who's Cyndane? Is Dashiva Osan'gar? Is Taim Demandred?) What you have is a book that pleases the nitpickers and the casual readers alike, and I imagin Jordan will be relieved to discover that the majority of readers enjoyed it immensely.Also Recamended: The Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, The Saga of Darren Shan series by Darren Shan, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkin, The Shannara series by Terry Brooks, The Left Behind series by Tim LaHayn and Jerry B. Jenkins, and the Remnants series by K.A. Applegate"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'd like to say that i enjoy action in stories, and the first of the Wheel of Time were certainly that. But here RJ certainly shows that there can be more to his story than simply the main charactor getting into fights and always winning. RJ has, in my opinion, created a world complex enough to live on its own. Astonishing. He continues to reslove various points, while keeping many of the plot lines open. Its a book i quite recommend, a good addition to the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I cannot say enough. You will not find a more engrosing read than a WoT book and Winter's Heart continues this brilliant epic. The Lord of the Rings may have claim to the Greatest Book of the Twentieth Century, but the Wheel of Time will surely have the benefit of being called the greatest story of the last two centuries and should be called the greatest fiction of all time. Not just because of its story, but it's detail, complexity and his brilliant use of language (which, might I add, is the only thing that does not quite match up to The Lord of the Rings but it is still pretty darn good). You will not find more enthrawling characters, characters that you will actually feel for and understand what they are experiencing. Some of them will be your next door neighbors. Someone that I know in my church is a watered-down version of Nynaeve and someone else I know is very much like Elayne.On the other hand some people even women believe that RJ presents his females as bossy and hostile. There are a few, but for the most part he doesn't. You may know bossy, hostile people, but no one necessarily believes that everyone is the same whether they are men or women, so this is a very unfair complaint.I told one of my friends that, when you read the novels, it seems like he understands women. She refused to believe me. Then she read the books and she actually told me I was right. If that is not good enough, I heard a story once about two who went to one of his books signings believing Robert Jordan was a woman's pen name."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've been reading Robert Jordan for too long. This series shouldn't have gotten to a ninth book; it's incredibly wordy, and too long. However, THE END IS IN SIGHT! Important stuff happens in this book, and major plot points are ended. This is something that didn't seem to be true of books seven and eight..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Everyone knows that the Wheel of TIme series is excellent through The Fires of Heaven. Lord of Chaos, although it did have its moments (coughcoughDUMAI'S WELLScoughcough), was overburdened with too much politics. Its name shoulda been \\"How to [Anger] Aes Sedai in Three Easy Steps.\\" A Crown of Swords and The Path of Daggers started to pick up the pace a little, but some events got dragged out way too much. Although this fault keeps up in Winter's Heart, it is much better and puts some adventure back into this epic.Although Egwene ought to have deposed Elaida, Elayne should be queen be now (and why doesn't RJ just go ahead and kill Faile already???), there are some truly great parts, such as Mat's return to the series in Seanchan-occupied Eby Dar, and Rand's quest to cleanse the Dark One's tain from Saidin. Although Winter's Heart isn't the return of WoT in full force, it does promise an amazing (The Shadow Rising-Quality) sequel."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I wonder how much Jordan has been manipulated by his Editor and Publisher. Milk it baby! He has probably described \\"wool dress\\" close on 1,000 times. About [.....] for the latest in the series too. I remember reading about a proposed 8 volumes about five years ago. This garbage is no better than a soap opera and is probably worse since formulaic suspense has at least a rhythm and flow that is predictable and comforting. This stuff is like a car that's missing on one cylinder. So much incredible promise having degenerated into such pathos - its a crying shame."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"One thing you have to remember in a good book is detail. You have to remember that Jordan has 8 or 9 subplots going (Rand, Perrin, Mat, Egwene, Nyneave, Elayne, the White Tower, and the forsaken) and probably others I left out. All of these subplots can't experience massive growth in the same book. While everyone is complaining that only a few subplots were addressed in this book, you must remember that some of these experienced massive changes, and if Jordan attempted to address all the plots, very little could happen. (Unless, of course, this one book was the size of the first 9 volumes of the Encyclopedia Brittanica.) I think that Jordan has done a tremendous job of painting the picture of his story, and give the reader the feeling that he or she is actually there. This love of detail started in book 1 and continues in this new addition."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The last two books in the series left me unsatisfied. I felt like nothing really happened, and that I had read 1500 pages of people walking around. _Winter's Heart_ didn't have those faults. Jordan ties up many loose ends that have been hanging around forever, and even throws in a handful of surprises. This is the best one from him in a while. I look forward to number 10."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"he's back after two so and so books. Enough said"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have already stated why I liked this book in the other reviews I have written so I will not waste the time of my co-reveiwers on that. What I would like to point out is that while Mr. Jordan seems to be taking a very long time to finish the series, it has in fact been less time than it took Pr. Tolkien to write the Lord of the Rings. I think when all is said and done, many if not most of us, that have come to the opinion that the series is too long will be grateful for its length. After all, the only flaw that every one agreed upon in the Lord of the Rings was that it was too short. Mr. Jordan originally intended this to be a six book series. I would not be surprised if it reached twelve and I am expecting thirteen. After all, that number is signifigant through out the series. Does this mean that he is riding a cash cow? No. Mr. Martin had the same thing happen while he was writing A Song of Ice and Fire. Originally that was intended to be a trilogy, and now he is aiming for a six book series.I understand everyones frustration. I am impatient for the next installments myself and even I have to admit that the Tanchio sequence grated on my nerves for a bit, and that some of the detail involving the heroines is long winded. Please remember, Mr.Jordan is as male as half the rest of humanity. I have often found that authors of one gender have difficulty portraying characters of the other, and in my attempts at writing I have trouble with it myself. Mr. Jordan's female characters are no where near as bad as others I have read (or attempted to write, I must admit).The other complaint, that of the series length, comes from the fact that this is the first fantasy series I have ever heard of that has depth of this magnitude. Simply put, we as readers are impatient because we are used to less-in-depth and therefore almost always, less quality ficton. Nothing I have read before is of this quality and depth: not Misters Donaldson, Herbert, and Salvatore and certainly not Mr. Forstchen or Mr. Saberhagen's berserker or book of swords series. Only the Silmarillion was as complicated as the Wheel of Time and that book was a single volume simply because it was an overview and not, strictly speaking, telling a story. I still would recommend this series unto any reader, along with The Lord of the Rings and A Song of Ice and Fire. One thing all of us agree upon: at least Mr. Jordan kept this series from being too short."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'd just like to point out the fact that Robert Jordan knows what he's doing. I'm getting sick of the people bombing this book; everything he ever does in every book, he does for a reason. Some parts are slow, sure, but they're necessary for the plotline to develop. I've even seen some bombers say that they got bored after the first 70 pages...look, if you get bored that fast, don't bother reading decent fantasy at all. You obviously have no patience whatsoever. This book is one of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, well. Mr Jordan is back. Personally, I disagree with those who think the books are getting worse as they develop. Indeed, book eight seemed to be &quot;weak&quot; considering the rest, but it is unfair to judje him only by this book. Anyway, book nine is very good and it ties off more plots than most think. Yes, it opens some, too, but would anyone prefer whole books to be nothing more than plot-tiers? Many have not understood that he IS going to write many books, and not for profit. I write a little myself(mostly poetry, though) and if I ever undertook a work of Mr Jordan's scale, I'd never consider twelve books enough. RJ is not without flaws, though, the biggest being the continual strife between male and female. I understand this is a world view(you can observe the excellent work he has done depicting this view in the saidin - saidar mechanism) but he is more often than not lowering it from a philosophical level to... I can't describe it. One last thing. Please try to read the poetry behind RJ's books. Not the poems, the One Poem this novel consists of. Try hard, and the Wheel of Time will find a special place in your heart."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok ok lets start with what everyone knows... Books 1 thru 6 are excellent reads; character growth, action, and richly detailed. bah bah bah Ok yes maybe books 7 and 8 moved a little slower but were they really that bad?? What are those who have been giving this series bad reviews looking for? Sure we like action but are our lives always run by constant action?? Are we always fighting the forsaken of our world?? Isn't there a time where we ourselves are not going anywhere; where we learn and grow, discover ourselves and those around us. Jordan's rich details are what draws me the most about this series. Granted sometimes the information is too much and irreverent to the story, but without his use of dialogue and the very detailed world I would probably care a lot less for characters such as Perrin, Nynaeve, Lan, and of course Rand(who are all my personal favorites). Jordan still has a lot of story he wants to tell, (I mean the forsaken, Semirhage still has barely made an appearance, although I do THINK you come across her under a different name in book 9) and if you at all are a REAL fantasy fan you'll be patient and loyal and maybe Jordan will reward you in the end.So for those of you who have been disappointed with his last few books,go ahead pick up book 9 WINTERS HEART, I think you will be satisfied. You may even become a fan again. Unless you are one of those people who insist on finding something wrong with everything. Then I ask you, Why do YOU continue to read Jordan? Maybe you don't think it is so bad after all. I read Winter's Heart in just a few days. I'm still drawn to this world, and will be in the future."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I strongly suggest not buying any of these &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; series books until the final conclusion book is out in paperback. It just isn't worth hardback dollars.Sadly, I would not be suprised if Roberts Jordan's creative talents ever again rise to anywhere near the level that he had before starting &quot;The Wheel of Time series.&quot; Mr. Jordan's creative ability has been so misused by this publisher, who seeks to get so many volumes out of a good story that the story begins to die of boredom, that it may have been deeply harmed. He has spent about 10 years doing this series and probably has lost his creative desire and is left with a talent that is covered with mold and dust.This story is one that has been page stuffed well beyond the 3 volumes it could easily be condensed into. Mostly, when the series is finally (if ever) concluded, it need to be sent to the Reader's Digest staff to be condensed into it's proper size."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I think the main problem many people have when reading this series as they look at each book as independent entities that should be telling their own story.Well they don't! They aren't independent but rather small portions of a HUGE story. Readers have become accustomed to authors turning the world on its ear and saving it in three books of 500 pages each or less.Jordan doesn't. He has written 9 (of 12) books now each at least 500 pages. He is telling a tale that involves at multiple nations and empires all being rattled to the core of their foundation and belief systems. He is going deeper into the way the world is changed by the actions of our heroes than any author before him. He can't possibly jam it all into one book.I've heard people complaining that he is overly-descriptive. Oh well. I personally do care that Rabbits are flitting around through the field. It makes the field more believable and gives me a good feeling for what isn't around since a rabbit wouldn't be flitting if wolves were nearby and ,if you've read the series, you know wolves are fairly important.I've heard complaints that all the female characters are carbon copies of one another. And while I don't fully agree with this statement the female characters are my one complaint with the series. In general it is hard to like the women of the books. Though I do like Min and Aviendha. Most of the women are extremely headstrong, rude, temperamental, perma-pms women. It is a shame. Moiraine was cool while she was around and Egwene was great at first. But Egwene has slowly fallen into the unfriendly Aes Sedai mold toward men. It would be nice to see some women who actually liked anyone that wasn't a women. Most galling is the way Siuan is portrayed. She was the most powerful woman in the world yet she is described as almost childlike in her affections toward Gareth Bryne. While she may not have much experience in romance it seems she should be a bit more mature about it. Really, do all the women have to be so peevish.If you read the series remembering that all the nations of the world, as well as a few empires (something that seems even bigger than a nation to me) are involved instead of just one kingdom the length makes much more sense.The only book I haven't fully enjoyed was book 8 but even it served its purpose of bringing us a few weeks closer to the final battle.It is unfair to rate the book independently so my rating is for the series. However, this book when compared to the others in the series would garner a 3star rating. (book 8 would get a 1 star, books 1,3,6,7 would get a 4 star and book 2,4,5 would get five stars.)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is another tedious entry in this seemingly endless series. Jordan needs to start wrapping it up. He's losing his audience."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As always Mr. jordan writes a good book, what this lacks from the previous books is the character interaction. He describes the scenes in vivid detail, but he leaves out how this affects the characters themselves. In this book he resolved a lot of issuses that readers speculated about for along time but he started a lot more with no end in sight. I like how he describes Rand's struggle with stress, Mat's problems with women, and Perrin's despreration to find his wife. I hope we see in the next volume the consequences of Rand's enemies and allies continually pushing their own good ahead of everyone elses. Other than that this book was insightful into the world Mr. Jordan has made famous. Can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter&#8217;s Heart is the ninth installment of Robert Jordan&#8217;s Wheel of Time series. The series itself is massive and each volume is an endeavor. Winter&#8217;s Heart is no exception. Coming in at 766 pages, the book does not lack for story, and unlike several earlier volumes in the series where there&#8217;s lots of walking and meetings, most of this book&#8217;s story is exciting and engaging. Death, rebirth, fighting, and magic abound.The book follows a Rand al&#8217;Thor, Elayne Trakand, Perrin Aybara, Mat Cauthon, and several others. Rand al&#8217;Thor is the prophesized Dragon Reborn&#8212;a man of legend who can channel (use magic) who is reincarnated throughout time. Each time, he is The Dark One&#8217;s advisory. In this volume, he is tracking down rogue Asha&#8217;men (men who can channel magic) who had betrayed him, and he becomes obsessed with cleansing the male-half of the One power, and seeks to do so with the help of Nynaeve. Elayne is now settled in the royal city of Caemlyn, where she is basically heir-apparent. However, succession will be neither easy nor without conflict. After his wife gets taken by the Shaido, Perrin breaks from his quest to bring the Prophet of the Dragon to Rand in order to find her. Unfortunately, this story line gets cut short and leaves the reader unfulfilled. Mat, who was missing from the last book, returns with a vengeance and with one of the most engaging story lines. He is trapped in Seanchan-controlled Ebou Dar and must plot his escape. As in previous books (and as I&#8217;ve mentioned in other reviews), there are also places where the story is told from a minor character&#8217;s point of view, which does get annoying at times as it seems unnecessary. Usually, the part of the story that they&#8217;re introducing or uncovering is very minor and could have been done so in a much simpler and less jarring manner.Winter&#8217;s Heart is not perfect, but it is an appealing and entertaining addition to the series and it also moves the whole epic story along nicely. There is a plethora of story lines and all are attention-grabbing. Overall the book was a good way to pass time and escape from the realities of this world."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Yet another amazing chapter in the lives of Jordan\`s creations - of my friends.

I read this book a few months after it first came out (over 10 years ago). After trudging through book 8 I just kept hoping for things to get better. This book was a painful read for me. By the the end of this book the Robert Jordan rose colored glasses cracked, the spark went out, and my enjoyment of the series turned to disdain. I swore off the series because of this book. Although, after 10 years I decided to pick up book 10 to see if Jordan redeemed himself (book 10 is probably even worse).The creative reviews of this book, far, far exceed the actual book itself! A sore disappointment."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart is a continuation of the plot inertia begun in Path of Daggers and much of the novel finds our main cast grinding their gears. Perrin opens and closes the book not quite far from where he begins. Elayne's arc is absolutely pointless (and incredibly boring). The only bright spots are Mat's maneuverings in Seanchan-occupied Ebou Dar and a particularly big event at the end involving Rand and Nynaeve. Those two storylines earn the book 3 stars (as opposed to 2 for the rest of the material), but getting there means slogging through some pretty dull chapters."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Just saying that i was glad this book featured more of Mat. Definitely my favorite character. This book also managed to pick up the pace a bit. There were some interesting events, such as Rand hunting a few Asha men in Far Madding, for example. Cadsuane's purpose becomes more clear in this book as well. All in all, one of the better installments in the series. It's been reviewed to death already, but i think the key element here, for me at least, is that the plot continued to progress without getting bogged down by what people were drinking at the moment, or in what way they were currently pulling their braids, lol.I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This feels more ambitious, with quite a few significant things going on. \\"Path of Daggers\\" feels pretty small in comparison. I may actually see this series through to the end."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The first five books of the Wheel of Time series were excellent, but these last five have been decidedly less so, despite Jordan's skill as a writer. There are still plots and storylines that are resolved and brought forward . . . eventually. There are still great characters, if you can spot them in the sea of minor and secondary characters who are swallowing the series. Now more than ever, I realize that the Wheel of Time series would have been far stronger if Jordan had written everything after \\"The Fires of Heaven\\" in half as many books with the same amount of total story but a lower amount of total words and descriptions and POVs from utterly important characters that we'll never see again, except for a tiny resolution several books later that we probably won't remember enough to notice. And thrown that bitch Cadsuane out of the story entirely while he was at it, or at least have her die a gruesome and pointless death right after she appeared. However, I've read this far, and with the series actually looking close to completion with Brandon Sanderson at the helm, I'm going to finish it, one way or another.\\"Winter's Heart\\" gets off to the usual slow start, taking around 80 pages before we're out of the prologue and 250 pages before it starts to get good. However, we do see at least a few important resolutions in this book, and the final 30 pages actually manages to turn up the action and provide an excellent ending. However, for the first time in the Wheel of Time series, I find myself wishing that RJ had written more, namely an epilogue to show the fallout of what happened afterwards. I don't really have much else to say about this. Still good writing, still choked by sub-plots and secondary characters, still too little story and too much filler, still too many boring sections.The romantic sub-plots, puerile though they are, come to a head in this book. Rand's harem gathers in Caemlyn, sort matters out amongst themselves, determine that the three of them are going to share Rand, and then Elayne dispenses some weaves that end with Rand bonded to all of them as a Warder.It was nice to finally get some conclusion here, even though each of Rand's relationships with his girlfriends has had something lacking to me. His relationship with Elayne seemed to fit and felt sincere, but the two spent almost no time together and interacted maybe four times total throughout all nine books. In contrast, Min and Aviendha actually spent quite a bit more time with him, but never of them really worked for me. Aviendha's relationship with him had much too rough a start and seemed more like a love-hate thing in books 4 and 5, though she's improved since then, and her affection for Rand at least seems to not be in question. Min also spent more time with Rand, but that subplot was developed so abruptly that it made the other two looked long and planned out in comparison. Seriously, Rand meets her in passing and thinks she's creepy in the first book, five books later they meet again and are like best friends, and then a book later they're in bed?As I mentioned, I did enjoy the final chapter, \\"With the Choedan Kal\\" as it was exciting, wrapped up essential storyline threads, and drove everything along. However, as is often the case with fat filler fantasy novels, it was too little, too late.3.5 stars. A really good novel bogged down with more filler than a whole series should have./sighs/ Nine books finished. Bring on the infamous Book 10, and we'll see if \\"Twilight\\" in the title really makes for as bad a novel as it always seems to, these days."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This review is based on the Kindle version but I can't imagine the editing is different in the hardcopy. This is not so much a review of the book as a complaint about the editing. I am/was addicted to this series. I have noticed however that the editing from books seven to nine has been horrible!! I have just started book ten, and usually I am totally sucked in. But the plethora of editing mistakes even in the first few pages has made it difficult for me to continue. This sort of thing totally detracts form the pleasure of getting lost in the characters and storylines. It has become so distracting at this point that I'm afraid that as much as I want to, I won't be able to complete the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This installment of the series borders on unnecessary. While Mat and Rand have plot lines that are actually resolved in the end, despite hundreds of pages with no development, Perrin's quest to get Faile back continues to go unfulfilled.I loved the atmosphere of the novel. It's a shame that such a striking change in the aesthetics wasn't accompanied by a big change in the story itself. We have gone through eight books of the Wheel of Time series with no winter. Finally the natural order has been restored and we have snow-covered lands and a world of white. This changes the dynamic of the world we've come to know in interesting ways. It's not until end of the book we have great sweeping changes in the story to accompany the snow."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"While I really wanted to get the whole series done by year's end, that just wasn't going to happen. Not without a null-time envelope or something that I could outfit as an extradimensional reading nook....In any case, we're continuing on with the series, and once again there's a lot going on in the Westlands (which is the much better alternative name to \\"Randland.\\"). In Caemlyn, Elayne Trakand is busy preparing to become the Queen of Andor, as the world still believes that her mother, Morgase, is dead. She's not, of course. She became a refugee after the Seanchan attack on Amador, became a Lady's maid to Faile and Perrin, and subsequently became a captive of the Shaido Aiel, along with Faile and Alliandre, the Queen of Ghealdan. Not a good day for them, seeing as how the Shaido have become the worst that everyone expects of Aiel - murderous, thieving and vicious. Perrin is trying to rescue his wife, of course, but that rescue is not certain. Faile and Morgase will have to figure it out for themselves.But getting back to Elayne - in Andor, she undergoes the ceremony to become first-sister to Aviendha, the Aiel woman with whom she must eventually share Rand al'Thor's affections. It's a great scene, that - a very simple procedure, but deep and meaningful as well. And it suggests a custom that I appreciate very much, having had friends that I consider on par with family. Under the direction of the Wise Ones of the Aiel, you become bonded with your friend and re-born, in a way. Forever after that, you are considered siblings, just as if you had come from the same mother.Having a new sister isn't going to make things all work out, though - Elayne has to cement her claim to the throne, and deal with an army of Borderlanders who really want to know where Rand is. Why, we don't know yet. But from the looks of it, it can't be all that good.Meanwhile, in Ebou Dar, Mat has reappeared after the injuries he took during the Seanchan invasion. Still wrapped around Queen Tylin's finger, Mat is looking for a way to get himself out of the city without getting himself or anyone else killed. What this ends up meaning is that he has to escape the city with three Aes Sedai who have been leashed and collared to serve as living weapons for the Seanchan - a crime punishable by death.The Seanchan are still an interesting player in this series, even if the battle scenes in the last book were kind of dull. They are the descendants of Artur Hawkwing's armies, vanished across the sea a thousand years ago. Through a millennium of fighting both men and monsters, they have become a formidable military force, held together by the damane - women who can channel, but who are considered less than human for all that. Controlled by other women, sul'dam, the damane are the heart of Seanchan power. No conventional army can stand up to them, and if it weren't for Rand and his Asha'man, they would have overrun the Westlands already.They control Ebou Dar, of course, but they do it in a manner similar to the Romans. They don't try to change the conquered people, or break them. All they require is an understanding that they are now living under Seanchan rule. Respect the new rulers, obey the laws, pay your taxes and life need not go on any differently. Cause trouble, though, and the hammer will come down on you. Hard.Even though their military advances are being slowed down, though, their cultural invasion is proceeding. This is not a mission of conquest for them - it's a homecoming. With the soldiers and damane are also coming farmers and weavers and blacksmiths - normal people who want to make a new life for themselves. With the Westlands practically empty as they are, the Seanchan will have no trouble finding places to live. Right in time for the Last Battle against the Dark One, of course, but they don't know about that yet. Regardless of how things turn out, the Westlands will never be the same after this.Rand al'Thor is on a mission of his own, one which involves a great deal of misdirection. After the attack on his person by renegade Asha'man - in which a chunk of the Sun Palace in Cairhien was destroyed and a lot of people died - Rand has decided that enough is enough. This whole \\"doomed to go mad\\" thing that comes part and parcel with being a male channeler of the Source has got to go. So yes, he's decided to cleanse saidin of the Dark One's taint, but not before taking a detour into the island city-state of Far Madding, to hunt down the men who nearly killed him.What can I say - the story advances. The plotlines being what they are, we do miss out a bit in this book. Perrin's hunt for his wife gets cut short, narrative-wise, and we hardly see anything at all of Egwene and the rebel Aes Sedai. This was, if I remember, really annoying when the book first came out. Reading them all at once, however, it's easier to deal with, knowing that the next book will refocus on people who've been out of the spotlight for a while. The parts that did get the most page-time, however, were interesting and, for the most part, exciting to read. So, a step up from Path of Daggers.---------------------------------------------------\\"You can never know everything, and part of what you know is always wrong.

There's hope!It's a good read, and worth buying if you liked the early books in the series but were disappointed with the last 2."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book was not good - in fact...the last 6 books were not good. Readers, critics, lovers and observers are now thrown into two distinct groups - which is not a good thing for Robert &quot;Moneybags&quot; Jordan or his bloated series. (Guess which group I will be in?).The first group has been burned by the man, his series, his cliches, his laboring writing style, his ability to get paid by the word, etc. This group has decided that they will not be used and abused anymore, and will not support this series anymore. Like a victim of domestic violence, there are only so many times you can convince yourself that Jordan will change, and will still produce what you fell in love with, but in the end, you muster up the courage to walk away forever. People from this group have resolved themselves to the fact that the series is &quot;spoiled&quot; (and not in a good way) and no matter what happens from here on out, the end does not justify the means. No matter how brilliant the rest of the 1-1,000 books in the series are, they have weighed the pain and abuse taken versus the chance that the series will right itself and return to being a good series - and have chosen to walk away.The second group feels the same way in a lot of respects, but they pride themselves on their loyalty and their devotion, and are either too embarrassed to get out, or all too happy to have their backs against the wall to make a last stand versus the ungodly (those who criticize the series). Remember, these are the people that recommended the series to you and me, who swore it was the best series since the Lord of the Rings - do you think they will then admit it is as spoiled as week old fish? Those in the second group are brainwashed to savor a morsel found in 500 pages - they would read each novel and ask for more, regardless of length, repetitiveness, blandness, or lack of story/character growth, pace or movement. These are the people that claim everyone else is too stupid or too impatient or too cursory to truly understand the depth of the writing and the world. They have pushed their way through the deserts of bad storytelling, and the farther they go, the more voices they hear trying to bring down their &quot;god&quot; and his world ... they can do nothing else, but close their ears and pretend it is not so...pretend the series is as great as it started out as, pretend Jordan is a literary genius that will make it all better. This group will die before they are convinced otherwise.Because there are these distinct groups, it is evidence that the world of WOT is having serious problems - we can all admit that, whether you threw up on the series or whether you love the series...no one can look themselves in the mirror and say there is nothing wrong with his writing, his development, or his storyline...it is all falling apart, and people are getting excited. It is one thing to go on and on developing new plotlines and new characters, exploring every aspect of your world, and quite another to write thousands of pages that could be summed up in 150 pages. Jordan has dropped the ball, going from a great series, to a good series, to a laughable series. There is no doubt he is milking the series for all its worth. The very fact that their was a special edition Winter's Heart on sale for hundreds of dollars before it was even out yet, the fact that he sold the prologue to this novel, even though most all authors release it to the public to peak interest and reward their audience for waiting so long, and that there is no end in site, points to the fact that Jordan is in it for the money first and foremost, and secondly, right now...he is probably interested in figuring out a way to try to salvage a bloated, scatterbrained series that went from epic to laughable...no matter how much money a man has, he is still judged on his work, and right now, Robert Jordan is earning very little in the way of respect, admiration and love...something his moneybags can't buy.For those of you who have left the series, left Jordan - do me a favor...I know you are burned and upset, but please give George R. R. Martin a try - A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords. Check out the reviews on Amazon if you like. In 25 years of reading fantasy, I have found none so good as George R. R. Martin - everywhere Jordan fails, Martin succeeds...I promise you. For those of you who love the WOT series, check our Martin and see what you think...you don't have to leave Jordan, and even if you like Martin it doesn't mean you are less of a Robert Jordan fan...just give the series a read and join our one group...the group that loves A Song of Ice and Fire."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Don't get me wrong. the Wheel of Time was and to some extent is- a great series for a fantasy readers. I was engrossed till book5- after that i began to lose some of my addiction. I still want to read, but I would BEG Jordan- and would've begged him for the past 5 books- for God's sake get a good editor and get rid of some of your obsessions. I can divide everything about the WOT into the Good, Bad, and Ugly.The Good:Excellent ideas- I love the basic plotline and the predicted ending.Excellent world- Jordan's world is crawling with life and quite realistic. Most people are selfish, just like in real life- in Tolkien's books everyone is dying to serve their heroes and country, and love their lord like a father.SOME good characters- I like some of his characters. Rand, Mat, and Perrin are all really good characters (perhaps because their men). Min also.the Bad:Some bad characters- Egwene, Aviendha, and Elayne all annoy me greatly. So do all the Aes Sedai, always thinking they're superior.Some bad decisions- Like having Alanna bond Rand. Too much Lews Therin. What the hell?Some stupid events- Rand refusing to kill any woman at all even Lanfear (!?)The UglySome HORRIBLE characters- Nynaeve. How can anyone stand her at all? If I lived near her I would strangle her first chance I got.Way Too many plotlines- at the moment, RJ has too many plots swirling around in his books, leaving the readers partially or wholely confused- for example: Morgase, Whitecloaks, Perrin and the Prophet, Faile and the Shaido, the Forsaken, Moridin and Moghedien, Aran'gar and Osan'gar, Shaidar Haran, Elayne and Nynaeve, Egwene and the Salidar bunch, the White Tower, Padan Fain, Mat, Rand and Min- to name just a few plotlines.Too much Filler- way too much time is spent on the crap and too little on the important stuff. Every book has way too many pages spent on side plots that do nothing AT ALL for the overall storyline. Instead of 300 pgs of Elayne moving for the Lion Throne, give us something worthwhile. It started back in book 5 with the circus.I'll keep going with the story if only for the plot. But PLEASE RJ wake up. Take care of even half of these problems (and resolve a plotline or two) and I'll be happier, and so will a lot of other people."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Unfortunately for me, I received the majority of these books as a holiday gift. The end result is that I've had the opportunity to read through much of the series (I'm an avid speed reader, and I enjoy going back and re-reading books in case I missed something.) in the span of a month.For the two books prior to \`Winter's Heart', I started to get the sense that Mr. Jordan was either bored with the characters in this series or was lost in all of his inane subplots. I had thought that those books were a slump, and a friend had advised me that important things happened in this book.I did not enjoy this book. One critique I have of Mr. Jordan, is that his writing has holes that indicate that he never fully developed the background materials. Unlike Mr. Tolkien, whom spent decades crafting his fantasy world and how it works, the \`Wheel of Time' introduces major concepts that are notably missing from the earlier entries into the series. This flaw is less of a problem in a series like \`Dune', which takes place over the course of centuries, in which it is possible such changes can occur.The \`Wheel of Time', however, introduces ideas and characters that the writer never worked into the larger whole nor fully understands. For example, the duality between male/female is handled far better by Frank Herbert or James Clavell, especially in terms of how members of each gender uses/maintains political power. In Mr. Jordan's hands (perhaps this is because of his past experience with the \`Conan' series), the issue of men and women become nothing more than one gender completely dismissing the other gender or personal quirks (it would be nice if the viewpoint of the determined whether we have to know details of the clothing...I doubt if Perrin would notice some details that Elayne would see).Other issues abound, especially concerning channeling (this series' system of magic), that makes me feel as if the writer has dropped the ball. In Mr. Jordan's hands, what started as a new way of viewing spell casting has deteriorated into an overdrawn system of whom is stronger than whom. Gender plays a role here, but rather than taking a more interesting view of channeling as a whole, Mr. Jordan simply reinforces the existing status quo in the real world. For example, I think it would be more interesting if women were stronger in the Power on average then men. Imagine how Rand would deal with being the Dragon Reborn in a world where he is not exceedingly powerful, yet was the most important individual to the Wheel of Time. Certainly not necessary, but it occurred more than once in my mind.I would say that the title is more descriptive than some readers (most likely the ones awarding this book more than three stars) would point out. The majority of the plot hibernates until the last two chapters. Unfortunately, the last chapter does not make up for the rest of the book.Counting four plot developments in total, this book shows the continuation of a pattern Mr. Jordan has fallen into, where the plot seems to stagnate in favor of including scenes and descriptions to the detriment of overall pacing, this book falls flat.I give it 1 out of 5 stars; some plot developments are certainly welcome, but my interest in the characters and setting has definitely waned as the storyline seems to have lost its steam. An editor is needed to tighten the wording and ensure that extraneous subplots don't start overtaking the larger story."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The wheels are in motion. At least that was the sense I got when I finished this book last night. The conclusion was pretty good but the conclusion is usually not the problem with Jordan's books. The meat of the book is what needs addressing. Jordan's repetitive nature needs to be reigned in. At least he got the &quot;boxing the ears&quot; reference under control but he still pushes the following pros too far:1. Whenever someone of the opposite sex speaks we must here a soliloquy on how inept that opposite sex is and how no one understands the opposite sex.2. We know saidar and saidin feel good to embrace. Hell! We've known that for the last 6,000 pages!3. Sometimes you have to buckle down and, yes, actually get to the point. As much as I enjoy descriptions about how the wall looks or how deep the servants are bowing and scurrying away, this information is not only irrelevant it is, and I hate to use this word but it is seemingly unavoidable when describing Jordan's pros, REDUNDANT.4. The characters are starting to slip. The Forsaken are especially thin. The only person that seems flushed out anymore is Matt.Ok now that I've complained enough, let me point out the good things in this novel. Despite what others have said, this novel leaps forward in the plot where it has only inched along in the last 4 books.The book left me satiated. (notice I did not say satisfied)Of course I will spend an eternity waiting for the next one, but I'm used to that by now.Jordan's writing seems different in this book...more mature; like he has accepted the fate of the plot. I think he sat down and forced himself to outline book 9 to the conclusion. He needed to, because this story could've kept going until Rand was fighting with a angreal walker and throwing his false teeth at one of the reborn forsaken while feeling the &quot;wounds that wont heal and we'll never hear the end of&quot; in his side.No Egwene in this book! Woohoo! Although Elayne is almost as bad, Egwene's ties to the central characters are weak at best. She no longer has an intimate connection with anyone, and I feel that Jordan writing her into the Amyrlin position has weakened her to the point of a minor character. Oh, wait, she's in one scene in this book...don't worry though, it doesn't last long.Two last side notes before I go(I promise only two more)1. The True Power(as opposed to the one power), the situation with the forsaken, the situation with the Seanchan/Shaido Clan, i.e. all the plot topics and new twists that were introduced in the last 3-4 books bear repeating. Unless the plot line has progressed from a major thread in the first 4-5 books, I forget about it. This may be something only a few readers have issues with but the last 4 books have been a blur and plot lines I remember most usually relate to the major characters.2. What's with the typos in this book? Do we not know the difference between &quot;through&quot; and &quot;though&quot;(I think this was a problem in another one of his books it may be a &quot;TOR&quot; issue. &quot;Become&quot; spelled &quot;Beome&quot;? A few times words were completely missing, leaving a sentence that made no sense. In a hardback I could understand some of this, but the book has been out for months with hundreds of thousands of copies being sold. A paperback with this many errors is puzzling."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Too bad, I loved the first 6, just like everyone else, and the 7th and 8th weren't bad, either. But this book went nowhere. Most of the time was spent in dense description of anything at all, just to fill space (pages about the thoughts of some minor Sea Folk character who will never appear again.) Scores of minor characters are introduced for the same purpose. A major mistake was to introduce all these new powerful characters, and new Talents (healing Stilling, for example, which Flinn can also do now). I mean the Forsaken were supposed to be the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends, and now they're just small potatoes. Many new ter-angreal popping up also serve to make the good guys more powerful, and the series more boring. In the finale, (without getting into details), the Forsaken are beaten off by a tiny amount of good guys. Of course, they don't trust each other enough to link, and crush Rand. With the good guys getting stronger, and the Forsaken getting stupider, they do not even seem like a menace anymore. Half the fun of the series was in speculating about the things left unsaid, (who killed Asmodean, all the new characters). The ninth book, answers almost all these questions directly, not leaving very much to discuss. Asha'man getting bonded is also another stupid 'addition' to the series. They can bond the Aes Sedai themselves, but they jump at everything the Aes Sedai say. Almost nothing happens in the book, which Jordan tries to make up with sex. It used to be this series was a refreshing change from most books on the market. Now it too has resorted to the same stale tactics to get excitement. Robert Jordan is clearly desperate to keep his series alive, and it shows."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I can't keep up. Typically, I love long, complex novels with hundreds of characters. I'm a smart guy. Whenever a new installment is published, I go back and re-read the previous book before reading the new one. At about book 5 I re-read the entire series from the beginning. I bought and read the big hardcover Wheel of Time glossary book. I still can't keep up.I don't have a big problem with the thirty or so major characters. But all of the pages devoted to the character development for the literally hundreds (maybe thousands) of secondary Aes Sadei, Wise Ones, Aiel, Seanchan, etc. is just wasted on me. I can't keep them all straight. There are so many minor character names, many very much alike, that it often requires exhaustive research just to remember something (anything) about that character. I can't keep up.Now I realize it is in the publisher's and Mr. Jordan's best interest to maintain the status quo. After all, fans (myself included) will continue to buy the books just to see how it all works out (or if it ever does). At least for a few more volumes. So here are my suggestions that will not only help fans keep up, but make more money for both the publisher and Mr. Jordan. That way, everyone wins:1. Include in each new volume a more thorough synopsis and an index with enough information on EVERY character mentioned in the volume to jog readers' memories and help them remember. If this means the book has to be bigger and more expensive, then that's fine. If this means that each volume contains fewer pages devoted to the story, that's fine too. The extra story is wasted anyway without this.2. Maintain a website with an exhaustive index of characters, updated with each new volume. Ideally, a PDF version would be made available that I can download and print myself. If you have to put ads on the website to pay for it, fine with me.3. Sell a companion book containing an updated synopsis and character index for each volume. I'd buy them.4. Bring the story to a close. It's time."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"From the \`Eye of the World - 1990' through his fifth book \\"Fires of Heaven - 1994' , Jordan completely had me spellbound. I must have read each of those books 5 times. Some of the most griping and entertaining writing that I have ever experienced. Do you remember the chapter when Rand saw the history of the Aile through his ancestors eyes - Wow. Whenever someone would ask me for advice on a fantasy series to start, The Wheel of Time was #1 on my list.How could a fantasy series, and my opinion of it, degrade from such a high to the point where I've lost interest. I would now sadly recommend that any new reader stay away from this series. The \\"Fires of Heaven\\" was written in 1994. I have not read a good WOT book in 6 years. The last few books have been just plain boring. Why does Jordan refuse to move the plot. I would have loved to read a chapter about how the Black Tower defeated the White sisters. Instead we get 300 pages of Elayne's political intrigue. Jordan could have expanded the last 50 pages of the book. Some good stuff was in there. Why would he instead write 150 pages about Faile doing nothing.I'm starting to wonder if Jordan has spent too much time in his world. Is he losing is skill as a writer ?? All I know is that I've lost interest in a once great series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book was painful. Honestly. It progressed at such a crawl that I often felt like we were moving backwards in time. I kept expecting Rand to ask what a Trolloc was and then go dance a jig with Egwene at BelTine. How bad did this book suck? Let's take a look at some of the finer points:While reading a book, ever find yourself wondering what that random street vendor in the corner, who has no relevance whatsoever to the plot, is planning on buying his third niece for her 14th birthday? Then this book is for you. Jordan has made an art form of absolutely useless information. And it fills 75% of this book. Wondering what that horse in the back stable had for lunch? Well then cowboy up my friends, you're in for a treat. Although if you're more like me, you'll probably just end up banging your head against the back of a chair as you read this crap.You know what's the sign of a great book? When every single member of the female sex becomes a whining shrew, to the point where you just want to skip over chapter involving them. Whenever a chapter started with something like, \\"Egwene wondered what color scarf she should wear to her completely pointless meeting with Siuan during which they would accomplish absolutely nothing because it will take at least 4 books for them to decide what to eat for supper...\\", I just want to destroy Jordan. OK, maybe no chapter really begins like that, but you get the point. Seriously, if the entire Aes Sedai camp just exploded, I would take back everything bad I ever said about Jordan. Or maybe imploded. Even better.I could go on, but at this point you may be wondering, if the book was so god awful, why did you rate it 2 stars? Well here it is. About 40 pages from the end, Jordan's editors came over, smacked him in the head with a tire iron, and reminded him a story must have a plot and action. So in his concussed state, Jordan actually managed to turn out a truly impressive ending, which is the only thing that saved this book from complete devastation. If you can stomach the first 90% of this book, the ending really is pretty good.But I still don't recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This series would have been one of the BEST fantasy series ever had Jordan kept it to 4 - or maybe 5 - books.

If Robert Jordan had stuck to the one storyline or joined them together in an obvious way it would have been more enjoyable. I didn't get interested in it till Rand and Cadsuane joined forces.What really burns my shorts though, is I didn't start reading these books till last year and of course I got to read the first eight one after another. The wait for this book seemed like forever and now I see after reading the other reviews that it's not unusual to have to wait two years.If I have to continue to wait that long only to have a mediocre storyline again I think I'll just stick with Kate Forsyth's books &quot;The Witches of Eileanan&quot; series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As with a lot of others, i fell in love with the series first few books.

The excitement and storytelling skill that was so evident in the first volumes is back!! We spend more time with the characters that we care about, see much more action and make real progress during this installment.Unlike the last two books, this one left me wanting more. This volume reaquaints us with Mat who is one of the more engaging characters in this story. He has a personality that we can relate to, cynical, irreverent and fun!!Winters Heart doesn't get bogged down in explaining what can happen, it lets it happen.

It's been said before, but Robert Jordan is like crack-coccain; you start out feeling great on a literary high, and slowly, over say a decade or so, you stop caring about the literary value and just need your fix. I gave it 5 stars, not because it deserves it, lord knows it doesn't--this volume barely deserves a 3--but because ya just have to respect the LIFE-THROTLING power of Tor books and Robert Jordan.Book 9: The Never Ending Story... Synopsis...Flash back to Book 8, and add 3 months. THERE your at the end of 9. I honestly can't think of any other author who has succeeded, and let's face it Jordan has succeeded, in dragging a series...epic...jugernaut...whatever, through 9 books and barely cover ugh? maybe 5 years, damned if I can even remember for sure.Eh, this series began in the late 80's and will probaly go to the 10's, lord have mercy on us all."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan took on a massive undertaking with Wheel of Time series, and he was masterful in the first three books. The significant time he spent developing the Aiel culture, for example, was a work of art. Character development was a little thin in comparison, and the over-indulgence in female arrogance, political ramblings and other oddities were tiresome and detracted from the overall quality. But the series through book three was strong and held great promise for the future.The literary craftsmanship through book three did not carry into books four through eight. An explosion of story elements received very little development, making it difficult not to conclude them as gimmickry to lengthen the series. Books six through eight in particular afforded no perceptible movement toward the series climax. By book eight's end, Jordan had saddled himself with such a vast array of story elements that he has little chance to tie them back together to reach an elegant and rewarding finale.Book nine attempts to move forward, but fails embarrassingly. Like a novice chess player unwilling to sacrifice any pieces, Jordan inexplicably keeps his entire host of story elements in play, toying with each without strategically moving any. Still, Jordan knows he needs story development in book nine, and he does deliver.

The significant time he spent developing the Aiel culture, for example, was a work of art. Character development was a little thin in comparison, and the over-indulgence in female arrogance, political ramblings and other oddities were tiresome and detracted from the overall quality. But the series through book three was strong and held great promise for the future.The literary craftsmanship through book three did not carry into books four through eight. An explosion of story elements received very little development, making it difficult not to conclude them as gimmickry to lengthen the series. Books six through eight in particular afforded no perceptible movement toward the series climax. By book eight's end, Jordan had saddled himself with such a vast array of story elements that he has little chance to tie them back together to reach an elegant and rewarding finale.Book nine attempts to move forward, but fails embarrassingly. Like a novice chess player unwilling to sacrifice any pieces, Jordan inexplicably keeps his entire host of story elements in play, toying with each without strategically moving any. Still, Jordan knows he needs story development in book nine, and he does deliver. With no page space left to work through the wonderful complexities in his story, he uses a butcher knife to cut through them. Book nine contains a number of these discontinuations, and they cost dearly in the integrity of both plot and character. The result is a product that becomes the new benchmark for poor performance in the Jordan's series.Jordan set the standards high in the first three novels.

I'm not sure. There are even less major events then in POD, plot development is really slow. Just as in previous book only about half of expected events really took place. On the other side there few new characters in WH with the including long awaited Daughter of Nine Moons and one former damane. By the first look they are different from other women characters but first look could be deceptive. There is no solution for any riddles from previous books (murders, who is who and others). While the book becomes richer from its many subplots at least some of them must be resolved. The only relieve that this time Jordan didn't add anything new. This gives us hope that story finally will come to conclusion. Still despite all of this book definitely worth time to read. It's weaker comparing to the first books in the serial but it doesn't mean it weak."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart is a nice read, with full three-dimensional detail and a complicated plot. This book is what it should be for a volume that is not the beginning or the ending of the story; a few plotlines are cleared up, but they mostly hint at more complicated layers underneath. For Jordan fans that are along for the ride and are collecting the hardbacks, get it and savor Jordan's rich descriptions and multi-leveled plots. But, if you're a casual reader, you probably should wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I loved this series early on -- the detail was great, the characters seemed very fleshed out. As I grew up, I began to have a little trouble with the way women are portrayed: tempers and &quot;snorting&quot; are not always the way to handle the situation. My problem now is that with the 2 year gap between books, and all the complicated past events, I'm losing the thread. I can't remember why Mat can't remember his life and had to go back and find it in other books. For the last 3 books I've had to do this: go back and re-read sections from other books. The glossary keeps getting shorter and shorter and I can't remember what everything and everyone is these days! I still enjoy the series, but I'm thinking maybe I'll wait till the very last book is published, then buy them all and read from start to finish. If there really ever is an end . . ."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The quality of the Wheel of Time has been going steadily downhill. I thought we had scraped the bottom with the last one and the series would pick up again as we neared a conclusion. However large parts of this book are completely unreadable. Characters become more and more superficial and their motivations quetionable. Half the chapters and characters have no relevance to the main story. Robert Jordan should have mercy on us all and bring the series to a quick end. What a shame after such an excellent start."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As with the last book in the series (Path of Daggers) I was very disappointed at the waste in failing to address the major plots and focussing on minor, boring plots. About half the book is wasted on Elayne and her political machinations to secure the throne of Andor. When Jordan finally does get around to the three main characters (the three men from Emond's Field) there finally is some action and resolution to some questions, but these interesting sections are less than half the book. The book also fails to advance chronologically. The events in Winter's Heart are contemporanius with the second half of Path of Daggers. Obviously these two books really should have been one book, but they were stretched into two books and a lot of boring filler added, making the series suffer tremendously."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Finally, Jordan starts resolving some issues. The book starts out a little slow and looks like it's going the route of The Path of Daggers, however plot lines of old slowly get resolved. Not all questions are answered, but it looks like Jordan is finally getting back on track. This one will leave you shocked and thirsting for book 10."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Okay, there are a couple of things that I would like to share my viewson. First of all, ....Secondly, I really liked the book. I justabout finished and I just bought at 8 this morning. Finally things arehappening in this book. Rand is going on the offensive, which is allthat I cared about. It has taken nine books for this to happen, and Iam finally glad that it did. I was never happy with the fact that hejust stumbled from one disaster to another.All the other majorplayers are represented in this book, which is defintely a goodthing. I seriously recommend that people reread a couple of the lastbooks before reading this one. There are people and events that needto be remembered before this book makes sense.There are so manysuggestions that I would like to make, the first being: Start killingoff some of the extra characters, or atleast resolve some of the sideplotlines. It's like reading several books at once and switching booksafter you are done with a chapter in each. I don't know about the restof you,..., I don't want to have deal with so much detail all thetimes.My last and final suggestion would be to hurry up and endthe series. I have been reading the books from the very beginning, Ilove the series but I never expected spend a decade reading it. Withthe plot developments of this book, I seriously don't see howMr. Jordan can end the series in less than 12 books. Not that I amgiving him any ideas, but at the rate of 2 years a book, we aretalking about another 6 years. That's more time than I have beenmarried."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I finished reading yesterday and I wanted to contemplate Winter's Heart before I decided to write this review. Before writing I decided to read some of the other reviews. I was shocked at so many reviews saying Winter's Heart was not worthy of being written. I am a fervent believer in reading a novel on its own merit. However, many of the negative reviews do not do that. They merely write that this was not a good book because they have convinced themselves that the previous two books were not up to their standard. I beg to differ. This book, along with the past few books have been excellent. Everyone wants to have action, action, action. What about the STORY? Have you forgotten about the story. At the beginning of the series of course there is going to be a high amount of action. I believe the reason that that is true because all of the main characters of the wheel of time are being hunted down by the evil minions of the world. They are in a struggle for thier lives. Thus ensues action trying to escape from the clutches of evil. However, as time passes, those main characters have obtained power they had never dreamed existed before they left Emond's Field. In the Eye of the World, Trollocs were horrifying to the Emond Fielders. Now almost nothing short of the Forsaken is a real struggle for the main characters. Rand, being the MAIN character has come to terms with his power and realizes what he must do to make it to the Last Battle. And of course, in Winter's Heart he accomplishes that feat(at least I hope he did) Winter's Heart is not filled with action sequences in every chapter like some of the previous books may have been. However, Jordan is defining the characters in ways that are impossible to do with action. That action that many people want would ruin the most important elements of the story of Winter's Heart. Moreover, when action that is in Winter's Heart is introduced I find my heart beating faster than in the previous books. The action is no longer the main purpose of the characters. Rand is merely trying to survive, not searching out ways to pick a fight with each forsaken as he did in previous books. He knows he MUST survive to the last battle or his world is doomed. I found myself smirking during the entire duration of Mat's involvement in Winter's Heart. He finally meets the Daughter of the Nine Moons. He does realize who she is until at the end, which makes me want to read the next book more than ever. I do not recall when the DotNM was introduced, but I know it has been quite a few books. Jordan is obviously not going to have Mat and her married as soon as he introduces her into the story, as the other reviewers seem to want. He did not even know that she was the Daughter of the Nine Moons until the last 60 pages of the book. Overall, the book was well worth the money. I would advise anyone who wants more action to go out and buy the Lord of the Rings. That should be short enough to keep the attention of all the people who lose interest with books unless they have action. I just want to know why the negative reviewers keep reading the series if they think Jordan does such a horrible job? If you think they are so bad and will not get better STOP reading the series. Anyway, if you enjoy the Wheel of Time in any way READ this book. It is a must."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Regardless of what everyone else says, this book shows that Jordan still has what it takes to be a good writer. I admit that I was getting a bit worried after book eight, but I think this book could be one of the best, if it were a little longer. Winter's Heart offers some major advances to the plot line, and gets the story moving again. The only thing it could have done is progress a bit more with Egwene's attack on the Tower. Still, this book moves the series along, bringing an ending into view. For this alone, I would buy the book, but I think this shows that Jordan is listening to what his fans have been saying. I think his editors want to milk these books for all they are worth, but he doesn't (I heard he did not get any of the proceeds from &quot;Snow&quot;). Thank you, Mr. Jordan, for restoring my faith in one of the best fantasy series since the Lord of the Rings."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I will not review the book's plot, as that has been covered plenty. I want to address the quality of the series as a whole, to which I give my 4 stars.In early 1998, I devoured the first 7 books and then had to wait 6 months for Book 8. I was disappointed, as were a lot of other readers. Two years later, Book 9 came out and I waited an additional year to purchase it because time had not been kind to my memories of the series. A couple of months ago, I decided I should re-read the series in its entirety. I'm glad I did.I have just finished book 9. In retrospect, I can see that my impatience caused me to demand too much from a single entry. I had become spoiled with the first 7; when I finished one, I simply bought the next one. I couldn't do that with book 8 or book 9.I would recommend to anyone who has grown impatient to re-read straight through from the first book. You might be surprised at how good the series is again when you don't have to wait 2+ years between entries.Of course, if Jordan could return to the prolific level of output he had at the beginning of the series -- the first 6 books came out over a 5-year period (1990-1994), while the next three have have come out over 6-year period (1995-2000)-- I would not complain."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I used to eagerly await new books in this series but now I've decided to walk away from it. This lastest installment is just boring. If your into political intrigue that has very little to do with plot then this is your cup of tea. However, I honestly believe that Mr. Jordan has gotten a sizable extension from his publisher and is now milking this series for as long as possible. Its a shame. It was a great series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I was fortunate enough to have only started this series about a year and a half ago. I can't imagine the pain of waiting two years between books. Would it be too much to ask to wrap up some of the dozens of subplots in each book. For example, Faile was captured in the eighth book. Perrin starts to look for her in the ninth book. This can only cover two or three days at most. At this pace we should get to the last battle in about eight to ten books.I would love to know if there is anyone who can keep track of the various characters in this series (no fair re-reading before each new volume). I feel the most confusing part is when a great many names are very similiar and characters &quot;disappear&quot; for a book or two before coming back with no introduction. I also feel that the review by The Feisty Curmudgeon hit the nail on the head. Every woman is basically the same. Every society is basically matriachial. Every single woman has a really annoying habit of &quot;planting their fists on their hips&quot; when they have to make a point at which time the man (who is always the target) tucks his tail and runs. I'm all for equality, but this lack of character developement simply gets old.This is the last book by Robert Jordan that I am going to read. Since you basically know what is going to happen, why hold your breathe for the next eight to ten years before Jordan tells you. I agree that the first five books were very good, but he could have compressed all nine into four or five books. It would be a lot more entertaining."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm not sure why I was disappointed by this book - I should have seen the pattern developing for a while now. Why should I have even hoped that Jordan would begin wrapping up the loose ends and trying to resolve this series? He's shown no signs of forward movement in any of the last 3 books, and this is no exception.I'm not going to go into too much detail, lest that spoil anyone's &quot;enjoyment&quot; (if such a thing is possible). I'll just say that Egwene and her war on the White Tower are completely ignored, Perrin makes only a token appearance that accomplishes nothing except to burn a couple of hundred pages, Mat still hasn't made it out of Ebou Dar, and Elayne and Aviendha go nowhere and don't do much in Caemlyn. At the end of the book (aside from one event in the last chapter that drops out of the blue and is never adequately explained [how did he work out a problem that had stumped the world's best minds for ages?]) we're no further along than we were when we began.Jordan's contempt for his &quot;fans&quot; is clear. He has no intention of wrapping this up in 10 or even 12 books. He's found a cash cow that he intends to milk for at least 15, if people are stupid enough to go along. Personally, I don't intend to be reading these books when he finally gives up and finishes 10 years from now. It's a pity, because there was a good six-book series buried in here somewhere."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"You can't see me, but I'm tugging on my waist-long braid and stomping my feet in frustration.I actually feel embarassed when I go into one of those mega book stores and see the WoT books hogging nearly an entire shelf. We &quot;loyal readers&quot; must look like the biggest chumps on Earth to keep buying this stuff. Is Robert Jordan's publisher putting nicotine in the paper or something? I'm desperate for any plausible excuse.Well, RJ's got his last 2 cents from me until further notice. At this point, I'm too invested in the series not to see how (IF?) it will all end... but I'm not subsidizing this guy anymore until he writes something worth paying to read. Yes, I'll read next one, but I'll wait and borrow it from the library. At this point, I think he owes us all a couple of GOOD freebies before we're even close to being even.And, as long as I'm ranting, can we please have more female characters get naked, spanked, or spanked while naked? You can never have enough of that sort of thing in a good schlock series, imo.Ok, I'm done. Now I'm starting to tug on my braid, changing my mind, and compulsively smoothing out my skirts instead. That proves my character has developed, see?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Honestly, I was wrapped into reading the wot series a year ago by my guy friends already infatuated with it. Being a young woman, I my initial impression was &quot;eh,&quot; just another guy book. Well, I immediately fell in love with the story...it was soooo new and different and intriguing...and I have to admit, I fell in love with the character of Rand in the first few books, sadly regretting that he was not real. The other male characters were okay, too, but I found myself dreading any chapter that did not have his name in the first paragraph. Then as the books progressed and the narration drifted from Rand--ahem, the &quot;main character&quot; as established in The Eye of the World--I grew disappointed.Well, besides that, I really miss Rand. He is the Dragon Reborn, after all, and I feel as if he has disappeared. He's mentioned here and there in the later books, but he no longer dominates the story like he did in the first few books. It is so depressing!Jordan's perspectives of women--in this book and in past books-- are all of the same. They either chase boys, or hate boys, or have flaming womanish looks and tempers...it is VERY ANNOYING! I personally connect halfway with the Maidens and even the forsaken to some extent because they are women with strong wills and strong guts (Egwene, Elayne, Min, Aviendha, Faile and Nynaeve have lost their fire, I am sad to say, compared to what it used to be before...)--not all women, especially in the circumstances presented in the books, are complete wimps! I resent their collective fear, hesitation, and annoying shawl-adjusting and prim skirts. I think if they all didn't seem to be after Rand or be trying to control things--not all women are that bad, I assure you--it would be a lot better.Robert Jordan, I urge you to return to the stark originality I was stirred by in The Eye of the World and the inventiveness I latched onto and couldn't get enough of those first few books. Winter's Heart began to show some of that again (though the wome are still jarring and annoying to read...) and I look forward to seeing a return to the tight controlled plot I enjoyed in the first books....Let's just say Winter's Heart was a step in the right direction after books 6, 7, and 8...and I hope it continues."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"... how SICK are you of these words? Or how about, &quot;...he felt the greasy stain of the male side of the Power...&quot; I started this book because I thought, &quot;I'm not going to let him beat me - I AM going to finish it.&quot; (Path of Daggers was indeed a prequel, you get an inkling of the yawns to come in this book is by reading it.) At page 350, he's STILL introducing characters like each one is desperately related to the plot - AND NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET. After this incredibly dull, pointlessly intricate, and occasional exercise in female psychobabble (as interpreted by a 13 year old boy) I gotta say it, you win. Stick a fork in me.The first few books were verying shades of very good: took the Tolkien model for fantasy, and threw it away, good. Many differing cultures who have radically different motivation, also good. Plenty of strong women who think, and uh, talk. Constantly. But, the idea was good, and as long as you granted him the format of an epic saga, you could see what he was trying to do and stayed interested. Unfortunately, Winter's Heart is all talk, no action, and all the phrases and action are the same words in a slightly different order.Here's another word: editor. Get one who is not related to you."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Those who started this journey with Jordan are now divided into two camps -- those who think he has gotten long-winded and lost focus, and those who think the long-windedness is great storytelling. The latter have won Mr. Jordan's heart.I read the last few WOT books lamenting its descent into the realm of a fantasy soap opera. I didn't care about the (as I saw them) juvenile romantic adventures and misdaventures of Mat, Perrin, Rand, Nynaeve, etc., etc. The worst author of bodice-ripping romance novels writes about romance and male/female relationships more credibly than does Mr. Jordan. But I always thought that the trend towards more of this dreck was something Mr. Jordan might reverse, and restore some flow and reasonable level of maturity to the series. Because this series certainly has some great ideas behind it.After staggering through a few hundred pages of this book I finally have accepted that we will never see a return to the style of the earlier books in the series. Mr. Jordan has not lost his focus -- he has found it. It is clear from many of the comments in these reviews that Jordan has a host of fans that are interested in this series precisely because of those romances and relationships. Those of us who are hoping to see a return to a more event-driven story have lost the battle. Jordan will continue to write books that contain exhaustive detail about dress and juvenile interpersonal relations, while interspersing just enough plot-focused action to keep the rest of us satisfied. I think he knows that he'll lose a few readers along the way, but he'll be able to write additional volumes for his other fans that will more than make up for the loss. As for me, I couldn't even finish this book despite knowing the blockbuster at the end, and will not finish the series. The negatives simply outweigh the positives.George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, starting with A Game of Thrones, is so superior to WOT that comparisons are almost impossible. Full of true surprises, characters with real depth, tremendous action and incredibly intricate plotlines. Mr. Martin writes female characters that actually are individuals and, best of all, the series moves like lightning. If you're tired of WOT, give it a read. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"If you're a big fan of this series, read no further. In my opinion, this is the last 7 books all over again! The review/summary at the top of this page could apply to any Jordan novel: &quot;Rand Al-Thor continues to travel the world seeking allies--as before, he finds himself disastrously caught up in the local politics of small city-states and has to sort them out at some cost to himself. His fellow villagers...deal with their own local problems; the agents of evil are abroad everywhere&quot;. While the series is very well written and Jordan's ideas are good, the series has gone almost nowhere over the course of the last several books, being sidetracked by subplots instead of bringing any actual resolution to the main themes. I recommend taking a rest from reading them until the Seanchan have finished invading, the Aes Sedai have actually done something about their problems, the agents of the Dark manage to bring their master back, or Rand Al-Thor finally masters his powers and saves the world."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is it. The book in which the pace is supposed to pick up, something BIG is going to happen. Right? Maybe? Almost? Kinda. The main plot of the book seems to be that Rand is going to cleanse the male half of the Source. Everything else in the book that happens is just plain filler. None of the other events mentioned (I don't want to go into specifics, as to to give any important spoilers--oh wait, not one single surprising or important thing happened...) So, our friend Rand cleanses the Source. WOW. Good job, Rand. You did it. And that is the book (about 18 billion words) summarized into one sentence (7 words). The really sad part is that I'm not exaggerating. Nothing else in the book even remotely critical to the plot happens with any of the characters. Now, on to my completely random complaints, other than there is waaaaaay too much filler... 1) The book has no suspense whatsoever. I meant it. You are told what will happen in the very beginning of the book (Rand mops up the Source), and the rest of the book just leads up to that. Now, that's very clear and easy to follow (unlike every other plot of Jordan's lately). But the problem I have with that, is that there is no big shock, no surprising ending. You know what is going to happen. And absolutely nothing of note occurs along the way. 2) The characters are really beginning to get the X-quality. What is the X-quality? It's my polite way of saying that I want to shoot the characters and make them go away. They say the same two phrases (for those of you not yet addicted to the crack that is the Wheel of Time, they are &quot;You woolhead!&quot; and &quot;(fill in with random name) smoothes her skirts&quot;. Imagine 630 pages of this. And there you have it. That is what the last three books of the series have consisted of. 3) The series is stretching on so long, I'm beginning not to care anymore. I no longer care whether or not (random character) smoothes her skirts. I don't care if they're smooth or not. If I cared, I would read some book on ironing. Or something. Just stop with the smoothing of skirts. Seriously, though... It's hard to care about the characters anymore. The only one who keeps me entertained is Mat.... 4) his later stories, Mr Jordan is starting to leave out at least 1 important plot per story. In this case, the siege of Tar Valon. Now, the siege of Tar Valon was the cliffhanger of the last story, so to speak. He gets you thinking you'll find out what happens, and then...you still don't know. 5) The series is never going to end. Mr Jordan will just go on and on and on... He even says on the back of the book, he'll write till they nail the coffin shut. Unless he knows when they nail the coffin shut, he ain't gonna know when to stop."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I started this series before i could shave:2 kids1 wifecollege3 jobs2 major movesand a bit of hair loss later, i'm still reading about Rand, Matt and Perrin (and 312,456 other characters that i've filed away under \\"i hate that i have to remember you and your blasted, nonsensical name. especially since you'll probably not pop up again in the story untill book 17, and by that time you will share the same syntax, syllable length and letter configuration as 457 other characters of similar importance introduced since. In addition to not remebering who you are and why you suddenly interrupted an Aes Sedai tea party complete with serenity, dignified reserve and calm surface chatter about ice peppers from Saldea, i have to read a 7 page description of your feelings about the said Aes Sedai's choice of tea.\\" And while that appears to be a long mental file to keep characters confined in, you should actually try reading these books and keep every freaking character straight!)I once watched a PBS special about cab drivers in London. Doctors had discovered that there is a part of our brain that stores the necessary details we need to travel about our little corner of the world. For London cabbies, who have to recall VAST amounts of detail in a city that seems to have been designed by drunken Lugarders, this part of their brain was COSIDERABLY larger than average. So much so that when compared side by side to that of a \\"normal\\" brain, i gasped at the difference. Then something occured to me that had me quickly regaining a sense of serenity; i realized that this portion of my brain must now fill up my entire skull due to the amount of detail necessary to keep up with the story. Jordan himself must have two seperate heads just to store all that detail in. Mensa here i come!Then another thought occured to me that shattered the icy calm of the void: The doctors said that this part of the brain grew because of NECESSARY detail. That leaves me with only one conclusion: If cab drivers in London NEED all the detail that causes their brains to swell, then the inverse must also be true; filling the brain with useless detail must in turn SHRINK it. If after reading Winters Heart i have even a raisen left in my skull, i'll consider it a victory.TOO MUCH DETAIL that does nothing for the story. It is NOT \\"rich\\" storytelling to embelish every single page with line upon line of fashion, food and mood descriptions while relegating important plot advancements to a paragraph or two. That is called fleecing the sheep. And like sheep, we're stupid enough to keep reading to find out, one day, what actually happens at the end.My advice to anyone who loves fantasy:If you must read this series, become a cabbie in London to fight off the effects of the brain shrinkage.

I think that it is hard to give one strong reason to show the (lack of) quality of Winter's Heart. It might suffice to say that this volume made progress on the last two and that I really liked the end, but that I have some concerns and doubts.My first point of concern is the building and development of the characters. Jordan gives his characters many many words to profile themselves and the situation they are in. But after reading nine volumes readers start to discover that the main characters have hardly changed, and that the author does not explain WHY the characters behave like they do. It is that lack of background that really bothers me. Jordan gives you all the information in ready-to-eat-proportions, without leaving some questions behind about the persons he created and knows all about. I would like to know if Nynaeve had a bad childhood or something; not that she pulls her braid, cause I already know that for some years.Another problem, that is not solved in this book, is the void of time most storylines are placed in. Example: I was delighted Mat was back (instead of Perrin, hehe). But after some chapters about him the alarm-bells in my head started ringing (no; no dices): Nothing happened since we left our gambler two novels ago. Still trapped in a golden cage, where he would remain for too many many pages...... It is not a problem to have many characters with there own storyline(, see George R.R. Martin) as long you stick to what is important, because most readers offer their nightrest for the novels and they have to keep their eyes open and their heart beating.Luckily there is a light on the horizon, right in the heart of the Winter. The last three chapters of Winter's Heart advance at a great speed. We are told a lot in these fifty pages, a lot of questions are answered and something is bound to happen in the next volume.Do not get me wrong; I want the series to be long. But writing a story like this is like building a house: you need a solid fundament (Volume 1,2,3), and a lot of bricks that build the house. The events in the book can be seen as the bricks, but Jordan uses to much cement to glue them together and this makes the structure weaker. Now he seems to be reaching the roof we will see if the overcemented walls will hold. I sincerely hope so."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I liked this book more than I expected to, particularly given my attitude going in. This series is way too long. Fully half of the thousands of words Jordan has written over nine volumes should have been cut, either by him or by an ethical editor. You'd think he was getting paid by the word. After volume 5 or so, I'd really had enough of this series, but I keep reading them because I have so much time into it now I'm determined to see how it ends. I'm not buying them anymore though; I'm getting them at the library. I'm not going to subsidize Jordan's addiction.If nothing else, the publisher owes the readers a little summary of the books so far at the start of each book. Jordan makes essentially no effort to work the background from prior books into the text of the current work (which is truly a breathtaking omission given how he loves to carry on), and I can only dimly remember a lot of what has gone before (this has been going on for years after all). It's hard just to keep track of the names of the dozens of characters that flit in and out. Jordan even introduced yet another &quot;minor&quot; character who obviously a significant role to play about half way through book nine. Some editor has to get a grip on this guy. Also, the prologue alone to this volume was 86 pages (hardcover). I almost threw in the towel right there.Anyway, after all that complaining, this was a stronger book than the last three or so. Mat has emerged as the most interesting of the three lead characters, and he gets significant attention in this volume. Still, for all that actually happened in book nine, if you cut out the meaningless minor characters and endless meanderings, this book could have been cut in half.There's clearly enough holding these books together to keep me reading to the end, but I certainly hope book 10 is the final volume. Jordan has beaten this horse to death long since."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"A funny thing happened when Crown of Swords was released a few years back: all the energy that Robert Jordan had built over the past six books dissipated in the space of one volume. CoS was an exercise in preparation--moving people into position, spending the momentum he had achieved to set the stage for what would supposedly be great things to come in the next book, Path of Daggers.What we got in PoD was the first real stinker of the Wheel of Time series. No plot development whatsoever, very little in the way of character development, and roughly half the book--with no cutaways or other exhibitions of the versatility that had previously allowed Jordan to maintain such a large cast and keep the story moving--was devoted to two secondary characters. It seemed as if Jordan (and his editor, who should have done a better job of interweaving the storylines) had simply burnt out.Winter's Heart, by contrast, is everything that PoD should have been, and more. The focus of the book is back on Rand, where it belongs; there are a number of major character developments that have been a long time in coming; and the climax of the book is easily the biggest plot point since The Dragon Reborn.WH is far from perfect. Mat and Perrin, while both present, did not play nearly as great a role as they needed to--Perrin, in particular, seemed like almost an afterthought--and the interweaving of the various storylines is still not as strong as one might reasonably expect. And Egwene has vanished altogether.But there is more than adequate reason to celebrate this book. WH is a drastic improvement over its two immediate predecessors, and all the signs seem to indicate that the Wheel of Time is finally beginning to move again.The end may well be in sight."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Mr. Jordan states that he &quot;has been writing since 1977 and intends to continue until they nail shut his coffin&quot;. OK. We have been forewarned.Winter's Heart is 656 pages of unending, purposeless chasing or &quot;Travelling&quot; all over their world. Subthemes like the kidnapping of Perrin's wife is left dangling after a few chapters of frantic racing about in blinding snow storms with no clue of resolution. Unfortunately the machinations of the Aes Sedai at Tar Valon are also left hanging with no further mention in the storyline after the first chapter or so. Then there is the paranoid harping of Egwene who sounds increasingly like an angry scold, followed by the jealous whining of Elaine who is dealing with trying to win both supporters and an army to gain her throne while trying to reconcile herself to the sexual competition of Min and Aviendha over Rand. Finally, she nails him in the bedroom. Despite the lunatic voices of Lews Therin in his head that boy should be one happy camper! Then there is the usual braid pulling and teeth grinding criticism by the irrascible Nynaeve, all of which adds little if anything to redeem this story. Apart from the final chapter when Rand cleanses the taint from saidin little of real significance happens in this 9th book of the series.Mat has the most action this time around, and yet he too seems rather colorless (apart from his peacock apparel provided by the queen). He, is constantly whining and complaining when called upon to be a hero, and like the rest of the characters is little more than one dimensional at this point. Where is his stylish flare and devil may care attitude that was so engagingly ornery?As much as I admire this southern gentleman's vast ability in story telling, the element of boredom appears to have encroached upon the original direction of his grand scheme and he seems to be stuck spinning his wheels in the sand and no one is going anywhere any time soon. Mr. Jordan states in his autobio that he was born in 1948 which leads the reader to believe that he has 30 or more years to write the rest of this story. This is a real strong hint that some of us may be old and toothless (smile!) by the time Rand finally breaks the world and this saga shudders to its end.Apart from my personal desire for closure on this story, I hope that the author will listen to the readers' pleas and bring the W.O.T. back to dynamic life and reanimate the characters with likeable qualities so we may engage ourselves with them and the story once more."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I thought the first 6 books were great, Crown of Swords slowed down, and Path of Daggers stalled. Here, I found the pace to be quicker, but finally, we get to learn about the Seanchan which I felt was a missing piece.I haven't finished this book yet, and I'm told the last 50 pages will make me mad whatever that means. I'm assuming I'll be left hanging, but after putting it down, I find myself wondering what's going to happen next which didn't happen in the previous two books. In those, I found myself thinking, when is this book going to end?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Is it just me, or is Robert Jordan losing his touch?The first few books were a lot of fun. They weren't incredibly great or breathtakingly original, but they had fast action, likeable characters, a dash of intrigue, and a wide panorama of cultures obviously worked out in great detail.The series has gone signifigantly downhill since then, however. The plots have grown increasingly wandering and diffuse while at the same time slowing down. The Dragon Reborn managed to pack a hefty chunk of action into its 600-sum pages. But less and less seems to be happening in each successive book, while RJ takes longer to tells us about it. The last three books can all be summarized in exactly the same manner:Rand goes on a guilt trip and then sleeps with one of his girlfriends, which doesn't cheer him up at all, so he goes back on the guilt trip. Mat says he hates all women, especially Tylin, and then sleeps with them all, especially Tylin. The characters chase one other around but never seem to catch up. The Aiel act tough and cryptic. The Forsaken have a few meetings and make some dastardly plans. The women are all sniff and say \\"Men!\\" and the men are all bewildered by the women. Finally, in the last hundred pages, there are a lot of special effects and the book ends.What is wrong with this picture?The books are just as well-written as ever. But they're less and less satisfying to read, because when they're over you find yourself wondering: Okay, what actually happened? Rand has averted another plot to his life and gained a smidgen more power. (Oh yes, and his lifestyle has gotten still more alternative.) The Seanchan have edged a wee bit closer to invading, and the two Aes Sedai factions have crawled a little closer to a confrontation. It's all very well-done, but at the deneument, there's no sense of having reached a climax--just that oops, it's time for the fireworks, so let's trot out another attempt on Randy-boy's life. And when the stories over, you're left with the frustrating feeling that you haven't actually gotten anywhere.One might argue that it's more realistic this way. Things tend to move slowly, and not separate themselves into neat, novel-sized chunks. But realism isn't the issue here. If it were, then I would be condemning this book for magic and imaginary countries--which I most certainly am not.The issue is whether or not a story is satisfying. And the answer here, unfortunately, is no."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"There are two side of the issue, and a stunning debate that I'm not really qualified to approach, so I'll just say this: Jordan doesn't have an evil strong enough to carry 13 novels. He started well (really, really well), but the whole thing is getting old. And the inactivity! It's like Shakespeare stretching Hamlet out for aproximately 8,000 pages, it just isn't happening.I agree with the other reviewer that action is not the most important ingredient of a fantasy novel, but it is an ingredient. If there was an evil strong enough, this would work (maybe), but there isn't the &quot;presence&quot; that drives good, and without it, it loses urgency, and falls flat. For heaven's sake, I practically fell asleep reading the TEASER!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"BRING ON TARMON GAI'DON!

I've read all of Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time series and this book has little or nothing to offer. It's filled with bitchy, foul-tempered women and weak, no-impact characters. It's time to end the Wheel of Time series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I, like most of you who have posted reviews, was at one time an avid fan of Robert Jordan. After the last few books, I like to compare my continued reading of the series to my cigarette addiction. At one time they gave me a heady high, now I just get an itchy feeling until I go ahead and consume them.I do give Jordan hats off for a complex world with complex characters, but I do not see where any of them have been significantly developed in the last 2-3 books. I like books for good plots, not good characters in a good setting that sit around and do nothing for 650 pages. If I wanted to pick up a wordy book, I could read War and Peace, the Encyclopedia, or the Dictionary.I ordered Winter's Heart along with the most recent intallments of George Martin's new series and Dave Duncan's King's Blades series and read them all back to back. I can honestly say that Winter's Heart did not rank anywhere near either of these, and Duncan's books are not even bestsellers.Alas, unless someone comes up with a &quot;Jordantrol&quot; patch or gum, I fear I will be stuck in a meaningless addiction until the bitter end."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is the last of this series to me. I feel ripped off. I just don't care what happens. I have stuck it out with Nine books. I cannot take it anymore...The story is still progressing too slowly, one or two significient events in each of the last few books and the rest filled with over emotional fluff. It's time to bring the group back together and march. As Corwin says &quot;Talk is cheap...Whiskey costs money&quot;A real sore point with me is that I estimate that the number of words describing the frequent changes in attire of the female characters is enough to fill at least 2 of the 9 books to date.I also have no sense of the amount of time that has past. Is it months or years? Do we have a new L. Ron Hubbard in the making here.This is supposed to be Sword &amp; Sorcery ??? No way would Tolkein write this way."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":". . . and close to $30. Only a Jordan fan in denial could see this as more than drivel. Absolutely nothing happens in this book, so readers should be grateful it's not nearly as long as some of the previous ones. No plot development, just more convoluted twists and turns that don't appear to go anywhere -- at least anywhere interesting. No character development, except for Mat and certain female characters' sexual appetites.Jordan and his story began to get dazed and confused several books ago, and this newest installment seems to continue down an increasingly pointless path, seemingly emphasizing that there are &quot;neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the wheel of time.&quot; Don't believe the hype. &quot;Rand, with Min, is on the run, and Cadsuane, in Carhien, is trying to figure out where he is headed.&quot; Well, you will be too, even after reading this book. A shame for a series that started out so well. Really awful. Skip it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"When I first discovered The Wheel of Time, I devoured the series - pounding down every book that was out at the time. And I have jumped on each new installment as it has become available.I have to agree with those many who feel that Jordan has become somewhat mired in the tale. The world he has built is AMAZING! However, he's spread across so much of it that it takes half of each book for him to work at getting us back up to speed.This and the fact that the last few books have been rightly criticized for nearly ignoring one or more characters underscores the feeling that each book now bites off too much. Not only is the world huge, but the many characters are scattered throughout it, pursuing so very many subplots that to treat the development of each would be work better suited to at least two separate books/series.I'll definitely keep buying the books as they come. Jordan's story is far too enticing for me not to want to see where it goes. But, for what little my opinion on it is worth, I'd like to see the threads of the characters' lives get back together so that the pattern can drive toward - if not eventually reach - the tremendous end so long hinted at."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As most agree, Jordan has taken a dip in quality in his series. I feel the first five books were great in character development and action, but subsequently his work has not been up to snuff. This book appears to be an upswing.Jordan's writing was near the level of C.S. Lewis, Tolkien, and George MacDonald, but the series *has* truly dragged on much longer than need be. Jordan also appears to have difficulty with character continuity errors- the descriptions of characters presented earlier on do not always line up with future descriptions. One could argue that this is merely character development, but often no development is presented- a character is one way, and then slightly another, without explanation.This is particularly true in respect to how much power a character has, and how much self-respect they have. Characters that are presented with initially strong character, such as Aes Sedai or Nynaeve, we later find with little self-respect, but with no explanation as to how this might have developed.It is sad too that a world is presented where there appears to be so little altruism and desire to help others. Oh, certainly, people help each other, and one could say that you can't get much more altruistic than Rand being willing to die at Tarmon Geddon to save the world, but you get little hint of his care or compassion in this act. Or from anyone else- everyone appears to be looking for power over others in some way, and pursuing that goal at all costs. While that is generally true of humanity, perhaps, it would be nice to have some foil within the text to show true goodness and love. Far too often the reader is left wondering what really is the difference between the good side and the bad side, other one fights to save humanity from the Dark One, and the other fights for the Dark One. But both sides, in a pinch, appear to be comfortable with many of the same methods.This style of writing continues through Winter's Heart, but the dragging ends to some extent, and we get some real action accomplished. Read through to the end of the work and you'll be pleasantly surprised at the forward motion. More of the questions regarding the two ethnicities to the East and the West of the main people group are answered, and Jordan appears to get closer to his more gripping style present in the first 5 novels."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"By the ninth book, robert jordan has started so many subplots, forshadowed so many things, that it will take atleast several more books to resolve them all. I had thought that this book would provide some resolution for atleast some of these, but in fact he only chooses to focus on one plot line and totally ignores many others. He also spends an inordinate amount of time reintroducing characters.. I know this is necessary for people who havne't read the series in two years, but we have heard the same things about characters so many times that it's nearly cliched.. Yes, we know Nynaeve is stubborn.. Yes, we know Lan is hard. The constant repetition is annoying. Back in the other books, there was much more happening, much more new and interesting creations and characters at every turn.. This book just sort of stagnated.. The world loses is losing it's sense of magic and mystery, since it seems like everything that could be introduced, has been introduced already and there is nothing left that is unexplained. It's also kind of disappointing knowing that not much has happened and we will have to wait another two years to get any kind of resolution from the series. We've been on the edge of our seats long enough! Still, I am not putting down Robert Jordan.. I still think he is a great writer and the Wheel of Time has proven to be a fantastic escape for me. My guess is that he is just trying to set things in motion for the next book, and wanted to &quot;save some things for later&quot;. If you are a fan of the series, definately buy this book.. I just hope that RJ reads over the first few books of the series and tries to bring back that sense of mystery that was there, and keeps things moving. I wouldn't care if this series took ten more books, as long as each keeps me interested."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"With all due respect to all those who praise this series so much, I must interject this: the story SHOULD be done. I don't remember which jacket cover it was, but the publisher said that this series was a &quot;probable&quot; 8 books. Book 9 is done, and I cannot see how this story will be finished in less than 2 to 3 more books. That makes it 12 books(at least). This story that Mr. Jordan is writing(has already written) is extremely addictive. So is your average soap opera. The truth as I see it is that books 7,8,&amp;9 should have been one volumn(as they probably were, before it became evident that this series was going to become so financially lucrative). That would have been book 7. Very long book, you say? Not if you take out some of the inane and totally irrelavent detail that was added in to those 3 books. Why is there so much complaint about this series bogging down? Details are being added in to make the story longer, thus providing more books. And at $30 a pop, the more books sold, the better for both writer and publisher. The Alliance(writer&amp;publisher) wants all the money you will give them. This story IS complete. And finished. The question is, how many books are The Alliance going to make us buy in order to find out the ending. I, for one, did not buy this book. I got this book from the library(as I suggest others should do). This book was, BY FAR, the best of the last three of this series(as should be expected, since it was the climax of what should have been book 7, the combo of the 3 books.) All this being said, I feel greatly that anyone who hasn't experienced this story should do so. Soon. Just use your library. Don't give these greedy bastards anything. Use the library."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After the irritatingly subpar Path of Daggers, I was looking for something with more &quot;meat and potatoes.&quot; I was not disappointed. Several theories and speculations have been put to rest, with less of those Jordanesqe subplots materializing from nowhere. These were fine in the development of the storyline, but have become more grating than tantalizing of late. We get plenty of Mat Cauthon and his Daughter of the Nine Moons plotline, which should make up for the short shrift it received in the previous book. And, the ending is almost on par with the stunning conclusion of Lord of Chaos. This will please those who found the ending of Path of Daggers to be like swallowing a tablespoon of castor oil. The pacing is better, more is accomplished, and altogether a much more satisfying read.Now for the minor problems. We have all noticed that Jordan's pacing has been less than stellar in that last several books. And, while he has definitely improved in Winter's Heart, he has sacrificed continuity. It almost seems somewhat disjointed at times and even a bit confused. Just a bit. As well, while there are resolutions to some mysteries, Jordan failed to flesh these out and add the backstory to make these resolutions more, well, resolute. This has previously been a strong point for him, and why this has changed is puzzling. Lastly, the first quarter of the book or so, where we are fed a plate full of Perrin, I was reminded of the dreadful time-wasting that plagued Path of Daggers. Fortunately it was much better from there on out.All in all, very good. If you are looking to purchase this volume, then you are probably a Wheel of Time addict anyway, and nothing I could say would pursuade or disuade your decision. Buy it, read it. It brings much of the sparkle back to a series many thought was floundering. Then seek therapy to get yourself through the long wait for volume X."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After a long wait, we get what a lot of people expected would be an explosive book; plot lines would be advanced, established characters would become more intriguing and overall it was expected to be a return to his former writing style. Unfortunately, what we get is mostly filler, albeit with a great ending. Winter's heart is better than Path of Daggers, but only just. We have pages of unending descriptive passages about styles of dress and character traits that have already been detailed in earlier books, for example, the way the Sea Folk dress and the Ebou Dari women, the Caemlyners, etc. In earlier books, Herid Fel was built up into a mystery with regard to his having a clue to remove the taint from saidin. In this book, Rand just goes ahead and does it. No insight into the thought process that led him to use the Choedan Kal. An example of filler:- a two minute walk by Mat around the palace is stretched into two pages, while Lan's fight with Toram Riatin is dismissed in two sentences. I used to enjoy the world Robert Jordan created, with its detailed and enjoyable descriptions, but now these seem repetitious. My experience with the Wheel of Time is at an end. I do not have the patience to wait 2 years between books for another 4-5 books that will be needed to finish this series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"for veryone who gave this book a 5 star rec: 1 quick assignment, please write a 1 paragraph bio of the 87 main characters, so the rest of us can appreciate it too..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"In reading the many many reviews of Robert Jordan books, and particularly those who complain, I am struck by the fact that most complainers seemed to like the first four books and have become restive since Jordan branched the formula out. What I mean is this: in the first books, there is a rigid structure in which the story begins with the major characters more or less gathered in one or two locations, then split out into three or four story lines, which all rigidly converge for an epic conclusion in which one of the legendary Forsaken attempt to kill Rand and are defeated - at which point Rand thinks he has won the battle and there is a lot of foreshadowing that IT ISN'T REALLY OVER YET. With all due respect to Mr. Jordan, that formula can grow weary rather quickly. I, for one, am glad that he has increased the complexity of the basic plot.So Mr. Jordan has branched out. The plots flow logically, but there is not this arbitrary \\"gathering\\" at the end of the novel. In my opinion, there has been more variety and ingeniousness in the last books than in the first four books.That being said, Winter's Heart does overcome some of the weaknesses in the last two books. First, the main female characters have become more human and less formulaic than in the last two books. Nynaeve, in particular, has redeemed herself from being a screaming harridan into a more complex and nuanced character. Second, the Dragon Reborn's struggle is taken out of a holding pattern and again propelled forward. Specifically, Rand (after spending three books gradually succumbing to increasing instability) appears to have a plan to address the central problem of male channeling - i.e. the Dark One's taint (and what an ingenious solution it is). Third, Mat is back and his adventures are both in character and believable. His introduction to the Daughter of the Nine Moons is handled particularly well.So. . . Winter's Heart is not perfect, but it is a wonderful addition to the series - whether considering the plots or the characters' development."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It's taken Robert Jordan only 7500+ pages to convey what some of us realized long ago: this is epic crap. There are so many references to hairbraid tugging, sulking, and pouting that RJ should concern himself solely with those. The great philosophy behind the books is inaction resembles action. The female characters (Nynaeve, Elayne, Egwene) exist to pout and look pretty; the male characters (Rand and Co.) complain about the women and are made into their gibbering slaves. I can feel I'm going to be accused of extreme simplification here, but what can one expect with paper-thin characters? Evil characters refuse to stay dead, and even though Rand has slaughtered one every other book, the list seems to grow and grow. This is the true Neverending Story. Many people ascribe to Jordan &quot;clear, vivid, detailed&quot; writing, but does it really need to take 700-1000 pages per book to tell so much detail? I think the sign of a good writer is the economy with which he writes. Forgive me. Thinking about this degenerate slush is depressing...."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book continues the saga of a story that has lost grip with the idea of itself. RJ has completely lost the ability to write a gripping story. While his early books were filled with adventure, history, and background that served to provide a gripping detailed account of a world-shaking story, his last few books have become bogged down in the myriad new characters attempting to influence the increasingly myopic worldview of the book. RJ has taken a magnifying glass to the story he started and used it to examine each and every subplot and minor character to an extent that slows the actual story down to a crawl. Where the first books covered months of time in an equivalent number of pages, the latest ones cover mere weeks or even days without even touching on each character.In the latest book, RJ has a prologue that lasts almost a quarter of the entire book. Too many plot ends are left dangling and virtually no action takes place, mental,physical, nor emotional. The few characters that are actually examined are barely touched before being set aside again for their next chapter in the next volume. Where did the tight storyline go? I haven't seen any evidence of progress towards completion of this story in the last two books. The sheer lack of change in the world due to each volume is frustrating and disappointing. Save your money, and buy a George R.R. Martin book instead."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I think what frustrates people the most in a book like this is that they do not see the purpose of it. In this light, shining steadily through several &quot;loud&quot; reviews seen here, the book is annoyingly repetitive, and there isn't a great deal of action. I can sympathize with this. I must agree, there were parts of this that made me want to scream - like just what happened to Perrin? After so much of his adventures protecting the Two Rivers in The Path of Daggers, he barely appears here; only one small segment where he learns his wife is missing (and then it cuts to her - and we learn even less. A setting is created, but never gone into). I think that he should have been either included in the jumps between Rand/Min, Elayne/Aviendha, and Mat, or just left out completely.However, I said it before: this book fufills its purpose. It is not the final battle - there will be a fight for Tar Valon, or the Last Battle, or whatever action scene you want, but it won't be until the last book! That's what normally happens in a good series; the conclusion packs the punch! I think that the anticipation of many has been rising because of the Path of Daggers, where there was a great deal of fighting. Looking at it from Robert Jordan's point of view, though, most of the powerful Forsaken are dead. Some have been reincarnated, but others were erased by balefire. Most of the ones left are the scheming ones, unwilling to come out into the open. Most of the powerful are licking their wounds. Rand is dealing with the real possibility of his insanity, and has to lie low for a while. The book covers him doing that, Mat trying to get out of Ebou Dar while recovering from his wounds, and Elayne dealing with trying to claim the Queenship of Andor. It is the calm before the storm.I wish that I could give this in half-star ratings; a score of three and a half would better suit my impression of it. But things like Perrin's lack of presense - at all - and the vaccum of other characters, like Egwene, forces a four to be impossible."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As a big fan of the WOT, I have watched the series slowly fade from the exciting, adventurous, and well written books(1 thru 5), to the &quot;see Jane run&quot; books(7 thru 8). Although better than the last book, Robert Jordan once again comes up a little short in advancing the plot line of his series with meaningful content. I felt this book had too much filler and not enough meat to account for over 2 years of writing. I don't mind the wait so long as it appears an effort was made to satisfy his loyal fans. Aside from the final chapter, which completes one of the major plot lines, this book....If you feel like I left you hanging, get used to it, Jordan has a knack for doing the same."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"&quot;The Eye of the World&quot; through &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot; (books 1-6) were, as the editor said: topnotch, where-have-you-been-all-my-life books filled action, suspense, and set in an immense world with laws and customs and powers that are mind blowing in depth. Although I liked both &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; and &quot;A Path of Daggers&quot; (books 7-8), I must say that neither were really up to Jordan's potential. They were slow, they had a lot of filler, and definitly too many sniffs. Winter's Heart (book 9) returns us to that action we were expecting. Many critics say that Mr. Jordan has gone over to the &quot;cash-cow&quot; and is milking the series dry, trying to spred it thin. Personally, I think he might have tried that at books 7 and 8, but soon realized that he would loose all fan base if he kept it up. Yes, Perrin doesn't do much in 9, but I believe it's more character developement between Perrin and Faile. I believe Robert Jordan is really finally coming out of his two book slump. I think that &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot; was so mind blowingly awesome (in my mind, LoC is THE best fantasy book ever with the exception of Lord of the Rings) that we expected so much from 7. But whatever the reasons, Robert Jordan has returned! The ending to Winter's Heart is second best only to &quot;Dumai's Wells&quot; in &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;. And Rand is really getting to be very cool. I loved the cycle of emotions that Robert gives us with Rand. First he's a farmboy; then a reluctant and fearful ruler; then an angry, hard, and cold king, and now, in Winter's Heart he beings to grow softer, realizing he must balance ice and fire, strength and mercy, love and hate. It is beautifully done, and I must say that Rand al'Thor is fast becoming one of the most well written characters in all fantasy. So all in all, the 2 book escapade in which very little happens is finally over, and it seems that Mr. Robert Jordan is coming around with some real meat. I think that Winter's Heart sets up book 10 to possibly be better than &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;, and that is quite a feat."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I just read the review of book 10, thinking that I might buy it because it would have to be better than this book. WRONG. I thought it was my own lack of concentration that had made it so hard for me to read books 8 and 9, so I'm glad to see some people agree with me. I would love to be able to read to the end of this series and see it resolved, but this is getting ridiculous! I decided that there would be no book 10 for me, and in fact, after thinking about it, I gave books 1 through 9 to a deserving thrift store and am done with the series for good. I'm sorry, Mr. Jordan - it started out very well, but there's only so much one can take...My main point in writing this review, however, is I want to take issue with the comments about Jordan writing to please his female readers, and the praise for his female characters. I am female, and I find the leading female characters (except possibly Birgitte) to be very stereotyped - basically, they are angry at and distrustful of the men they know (even the ones they are supposedly \\"in love\\" with), suspicious of most other women, over-concerned with clothing and appearance, and, worst of all, they never EVER seem to change, even after going through what should be life-changing experiences!Jordan obviously believes that the relationship between men and women is adversarial and that men and women are different species who cannot ever understand each other, even if they are married. I disagree. He apparently thinks the back-biting and hostile interplay between his male and female characters is witty or funny - I think it got really old even by the end of the first book! I have skipped or skimmed the male-female interactions in all these books because they are irritating and repetitive. And if I have to hear either Rand, Mat, or Perrin say yet again that the other two are the ones who \\"understand women\\" once more, I'll probably throw the book across the room! Grow UP, Mr. Jordan! Or at least let your characters grow up!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The only reason I gave this book even two stars was because I've had such love for this series. That said this was a laborious exercise in excess. I want to read these Wheel of Time books for Rand, Elayne, Matt, Perrin, Egwene &amp; Nyaneve. I'm so tired of pages devoted to characters like Galina, Ethenielle, &amp; Riselle (What's with the names ending in elle?) I found myself skimming in haze of confusion and by the time I had pushed through to the end I couldn't tell you who those incidental characters were, nor did I care. I'm beginning to wonder if Jordan really has an end in sight. It seems his motto is bigger is better. But frankly, I'd rather have a book half the size that involves the core story than an additional two hundred and fifty pages of people and places that require an extensive glossary to keep up with. The 10th book is out now, but I need a break. My suggestion is read this fairly soon after the 8th book so you at lest know who some of the smaller characters are. And read it as fast as you can. The nearly two weeks to finish this made me question if I was just really busy, or really bored with the book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Along with the previous reviewers, I enjoyed the first few books. Although even then their were irritating bits such as the endless repetition of how women don't understand men and vice versa. This seems to crop up in every other thought the main characers have. Also Mat, Perrin and Rand continualy wishing they knew as much about women as the other two.What carried this series initially was a well thought out world with lots of different societies and cultures. While this was being fleshed out along with the characters of the main protagonists it kept my interest.By the end though, new bits are being thrown in that serve no purpose. What is the True Power as opposed to the one power? What was the point of the Dark Lord causing the drought other than to squeeze another two books out of the series with the quest for the bowl of winds? What was the tall Myrddral for and why was he different to the others? Finally, the story limps to a conclusion that could have been achieved immediately after Rand reached Ruithean where the access keys were located.This series badly needed a good editor to cut it down to five books rather than nine."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan is unfortunately out of control of his series. As has been true for the last 3 books, I found myself skimming whole pages of descriptive text, searching for anything that appeared to be plot movement. The political and palace intrigues are better done on C-SPAN, and major plot threads are simply dropped. If you're a series fan (and you need to be to even read this review), save yourself a lot of time by checking this book out of the library and reading the last 3 chapters. You don't need to do anything more until the next book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have the WOT book nine on my wish list. However, I have to agree with those who are becoming slightly restless. The intricacies of the plots and the large cast of characters of the WOT are fine -- the pace is not. RJ needs to speed things up.If you want to experience truly great writing with plots and characters as rich as Jordan's, but at a pace that never slackens, try George R. R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice series. This is true genius."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Don't buy this book until Jordan finishes the series -- I have my suspicions that he never will.This series has degenerated into books, written a year or more apart, that detail a myriad of character plots, but do little to advance the major plot. Jordan has a cash cow here, and he's going to ride it as long as he can. I started reading this series many years ago, and by the time Winter's Heart came out, it took me several hundred pages before I was even close to up to speed again. And how much is really happening here. Not much. We keep meeting new people and being diverted by new character plots.Is Jordan stalling? Does he have no clue how to finish this series? At the rate he is going, he is going to die before book 47, the final in the series, can be written.Personally, if I was doing it over again, I'd wait until the series was done, then read them all back to back."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Now I find out his wife edits them. Dear god, if I have to read &quot;I better be good or [inset female char here *any female char] will give me the rough side of her tongue.&quot;The books were great in the beginning... but now... I can't stand it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"There are finally some movement this book!!! I understand the author may want to set up his plot lines and so on. However, I was so bored with the last 3 books that I groaned every time when the author introduce yet another side plot or clue. I think this book is the start of the ending. Although I hope the author to hurry up, I don't wish him to just cut the threads and let us hanging and unsatisfied. I agree with a previous customer reviewer that the author probably will need to write 2-3 books in order to complete all the threads and end this series well. I will be more disappointed if the author hurry through the ending and not doing a good job after he has dragged us through the last 3 books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I love the serries and I really dont like people saying its too long the story is un matched except by goodkind's SoT book 7 and 8 are slow but 9 brings back the joy of them you have to keep a open mind and not think geeze 500 more pages to go otherwise you dont deserve to read the books and see the light!.Over all I think the serries will go to at lest 12 or more books but i dont think it can be shorted other wise it will be too rushed and it would ruin the story"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have to admit that at first I was a little disheartened by the latter parts of the WOT series. Recently, though, I began re-reading the series from book one through book nine (I'm in eight right now) in anticipation for book 10 to come sometime, hopefully, in the near future.I've realized now that I really do like these latter books. I've come to enjoy the world, the characters and their changes as major and minor things happen to them. There is enough action sprinkled in to keep me going.I now wish the series would go to about 20 thousand page plus books...I just don't want it to end. I'm hoping that Robert Jordan will at least put out two to three more LARGE volumes before wrapping the series.Start again from volume one. Read them for relaxation and fun, for plot, small and large, and characters that are developing on a more intimate level than most authors allow. I think some people will be happier by the time they come back to volume nine (or ten, if it's ready!). I know, I am!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Interesting to read the highly critical reviews written by readers of this very long, and at times ,tedious series. I agree that books 7 and eight have been merely &quot;getting there&quot; in their structure,but I think book eight,&quot;Winters Heart&quot; has actually moved on quite alot. I noticed the stories about each of the main characters were longer,less changing the subject. Each had a suspenseful ending,and were much more complete. Good,Good. However,my complaint is the difficulty of remembering the characters names! Was this one good or bad ,were they a Darkfriend or Black Ajah ,or whatever. With the long downtime between books I wish the list of names in the index was more complete,so that very similar names could be recognised.Particularly the Aes Sedai,so many of them. All in all I feel Jordan is coming back on track,but however many books are their going to be!!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"With so many reviews I'm suprised that this book rated as high as it did. Jordan obviously gained many devoted fans with the first few books of the series, which were among the best I have ever read.The problem is that Jordan has introduced so many side characters, that 90% of recent books is taken up by useless dialog that does nothing to further the main plot. If it wasn't already taken, I would recommend that the series be renamed &quot;The Never Ending Story&quot;.If you haven't yet started the series, read the first 6 or so books and wait for the last one, if it ever comes out. There's nothing in the more recent books but filler dialog."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book went no where. It took me 4 months to finish because I kept putting it down in favor of more interesting books(like my dish washer manual). If its content were edited to half the number pages and a small climax and partial conclusion were added, the book would have been much more enjoyable. I don't consider the encounter at the end a climax. It seems like it was just pasted in. I won't buy book 10 unless it's the conclusion, and that's only because I've invested so much time already."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Many people are complaining about the pace of the storylines in the Wheel of Time series. I have a different opinion on this matter. It is not the pace of the storylines but rather the pace of Jordan's writing that is killing the series. Waiting well over a year and sometimes closer to two years between books kills the continuity of the story (or actually stories). I began reading the series when The Eye of the World first came out (I believe it was '89 or '90). I was a senior in high school then. But that was over ten years ago. I have had to re-read the series completely twice now (before book 6 and again before book 8) to try to remember all that has happened. It is impossible to keep up with characters that can disappear for whole books and come back two or three years later as the series continues, i.e Mat, Perrin, Egwene in the most recent book. The &quot;main&quot; characters can't even find space in each book because there are so many different story lines. I do enjoy all the stories though. Its like getting four or five books in one. You just can't keep up with them over such a long time between books. I hope Jordan makes the series last for another 9 or 10 books. He has the talent to keep the story going that long. Just don't make us wait so long between books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm a patient man. Honestly. I've read this series since it first came out. Now reading the series seems like a pennance. To all those people who've been saying 'I think the series could wrap up in 3-5 books'.. what, are you losing your minds!? Thats SIX TO TEN YEARS FROM NOW!! Sure the story is engaging, the world has some great detail and backstory; at 6,000 plus pages it had better be detailed. Has any one of you ever stacked all nine of these books on a table and measued them in feet? I'm all for nice long, detailed books. Normally I don't recommend that you develop a flowchart to follow the characters, but in this case, you need it.If you want to read an epic scale fantasy novel I reccomend Tad Williams DragonBone Chair. Three books, about a thousand pages each. Less than the 15 or 20 characters to follow, and an excellent read. (hint: It actually ends)In summation: All those that have come this far will continue to read the books. With this much time and energy put into reading them, not reading them would be like buying a house and not living in it.The epic part of the books should be the story, not the number of years it takes to finish that same story. I suppose I'll have something to look forward to when I retire."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Like almost everyone else, I've been frustrated that the pace of the last few books has slowed to a crawl. Although, as another reviewer has noted, I'm not ready for the series to end yet, but I don't see the point of having the last two books contain hundreds of pages of filler leading up to the last few chapters, where the only real action happens.Winter's Heart is at least better than the last two books. I don't want to post any spoilers, but in this book, we have some long running plotlines finally being resolved. The ending, in particular, was quite satisfying - perhaps moreso than any other book in the series.Overall, although the book could have been much better, I enjoyed reading it. Hopefully it marks a turning point in the series, and that the next book will return to the quality of the earlier books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok, I read all of the other reviews and unlike most I didn't think the ending was up to par. After all, hasn't this been building for 9 books, and thousands of pages. And there's going to be a 10th book!! I was very let down by how unexciting Rand's cleansing of the Source was. Very ho hum. It was about as exciting as if he had just finished his chores, not something that will change the world forever! After finishing the book I kept saying but what about this???what about that??? All of the story lines that I wanted to know about were either left unfinished or barely mentioned. Why do I keep reading these books? First of all, I DO want to see how all of the storylines end. Second of all, I've committed so much time to this already that I can't bear not to finish all of the story."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, I tried to quit but I found the book abandoned in an airport terminal... unread by all signs... so I read it. Overall, I liked it better than the previous books, which is not to say a lot since those books were a waste of good paper. I had to put a lot of effort in finishing the so-called introduction which is really a first chapter with all the usual femenine stereotyping (makes you wonder what kind of childhood RJ had). After the introduction I found better writing. It was still disjointed, mind you, and still had lapses into boring details totally superfluous to the story, but it was entertaining. The ending wasn't bad and almost made me forget the aggravation of the first couple hundred pages. Almost... My feeling after reading it? Blah... He still wants to prolong the series. There is no sign of closure anywhere. You see, I alternate between literature and entertainment in my reading. The WOT series is no Lord of the Rings or Dune but it started being entertaining an I loved it. Then RJ let go and the series went belly up. I gave it a chance reading book 8 and it still didn't work for me. Will I read the next book? Only if I find it abandoned in an airport terminal."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First things first. It needs to be said that this book is FAR better than the preceding two. That said, it still lacks whatever magic made the fist ones in the series so special. Perhaps it is because Mr. Jordan is writing two other series at the same time. I was confused as hell for about half the book trying to remember who was who and what was going on. After a while I stopped trying to remember all the insignificant people and concentrate strictly on the main characters. The book got better after that. The ending was something I had been waiting for since book 4. It's just too bad it was all bundled into one chapter. All that time wasted in Far Madding for basically nothing, and Padan Fain thrown in for the hell of it. I am interested in the ISAM/LUC storyline (what there is of it). It is obvious that this is Lan's uncle, the one that went into the waste and disappeared (at least I think that's what happened, it's been soooooooo long). To bad they only had a couple of pages to it. This book did not feel like the filler the last two did, but it still doesn't measure up to the others. My biggest wish is that Mr. Jordan would cease his other two projects (Fallon's Blood, and I forget the other one), and concentrate on completing this story in the same fashion he started it. Make each book stand on it's own. The first 5 books of the series, while tied to each other, were more or less stories on their own, leaving you feeling complete afterward, instead of cheated. The Wheel of Time is becoming like a soap opera, where just as something is about to happen........to be continued."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Apparently my powers of observation are in decline. All of the reviews for this book-at least, most of them-claim that ever since FoH, the series has been going downhill. Yes, Fires of Heaven is probably my favorite book in the series to date, but contrary to popular opinion, Winter's Heart has moved into the second-place slot.First off, a number of important events-all of which were mentioned in the first &quot;half&quot; of the series, giving rise to my respect for RJ's ability to tie earlier books with the later ones-have come to pass. We find something out about Masema the Prophet that still has been wondering. Mat Cauthon meets his long-awaited wife, and I must admit that she wasn't exactly what I expected. Rand and his crew deal out some more punishment against the Forsaken, which is always exciting (except for the wam-bam-done job Moiraine did on Be'lal). Rand and Elayne finally get down to business, which made me happy because Elayne was always my favorite out of Rand's Three. And there was, of course, the finale scene which, in argument against previous reviews, I thought was extremely well-done. My only complaint is that for all the first half of the book was about Perrin, Faile, and Shaido. . . nothing really happens.Overall, WH gets two enthusiastic thumbs up. It may have started off a tad slow, but I was so entralled that I felt compelled to read it one sitting, and I did just that in 20 hours."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm not certain that the complaints about the length of this series are entirely without merit. It's difficult to recall a time when books, at least of this genre, were ever actually &quot;SLAM, BAM, DONE!&quot; There aren't many books, on further examination, or series of books, in the history of Western Literature which approach the word-count of the post-WWII fantasy epic. The work of many a modern fiction writer may have been shorter than the average Jordan tome, but there is never really some before-time, some &quot;good old days&quot; when books were always at least 600 pages long and came in at least six installments. Only a few such works come to mind as being representative of a time when men (and the entire population of skirt-smoothing, braid-tugging, arms-folded-beneath-their-breasts, disapproving women, as well, one assumes)liked their books long and in extended serial format. Actually, I can't think of any. If, perhaps, you were to treat all of the works of St. Augustine as a sort of 5th century version of _The Wheel of Time_, then maybe, but they all sort of lack that serial tie-in thing. Even those well-respected doorstoppers, _War and Peace_, _The Brothers Karamazov_ and anything by Theodore Dreiser are a far cry from what Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, etc. have put out, in terms of sheer mass.The arguments concerning the declining degree of quality are valid as well-- there are times when Jordan's tedious descriptive passages make James Fenimore Cooper's seem terse, and Thomas Hardy's seem downright light and airy. In the instances when Jordan seems to care about what he is describing, when he has hold of a truly enthralling idea, the prose improves dramatically and his talent becomes quite evident. But in the times when Jordan seems uninspired, and there are lots of these times over the course of a nine-book series, the result is an all-too expected and pardonable apathy on the part of the reader.The thing is that, on balance, it turns out that this is the best fantasy out there. While Jordan's critics are often right on target, his legions of adoring fans who believe he can do no wrong have a point, as well. I admit to the guilty pleasure of having read this series quite avidly, but with a critical eye, delighted at times but terribly disappointed at others.So this is my hope. I want Jordan to finish this thing, and when he does, I want him to sit down and rewrite it. I'm not certain whether the &quot;dead spots&quot; in the series are the result of shameless exploitation of the market, or a simple earnest desire to meet the demands of fans. Maybe Jordan has simply churned this thing out as it has come to him, barely pausing to fully render all of his ideas (and hedging when the ideas don't come as easily). Whatever the case, I suspect that there really might be a magnum opus in here.Although I don't intend to give up (how could I after nine books?), this series (and this installment thereof) is unfortunately not as good as it seems it could be."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I loved the first few books of this series. There were so many things going on and the character development was great. As the main group of Rand, Mat, and Perrin split up, the various, intertwining plots were very well done. However, as the series went on, the focus seemed to shift from plot and great writing to put the reader in the events to detail so exhaustive that the plot seems to take a back seat.I'm not sure how much I am enjoying each subsequent installment anymore. I think that the amount of plot in this book was less than a week. But it took 750 pages to tell it. Jordan's take on male/female iteraction was somewhat interesting in the beginning (although it was my least favorite focus of the series), but the view tha women always think they are right and that men are just bull-headed, while men are always completely clueless about women has gotten very old and it unfortunate that this is now what takes up the bulk of each book.There is still hope though. The last 20-30 pages were magnificent. The ending of this book is the type of writing that got me hooked in the first place and is what will take me to the end of the series. Maybe the next installment will go back the the great writing the series started with. Instead of leaving more loose ends at the end of each book, it's time for the series to come to its climax."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I was happy to see that some things are progressing in this volume. However, some themes are dropped in the middle as has been the case in most of the recent books. A couple of the many plot lines are hardly even touched on. It certainly is difficult to wait two years for each new volume and then only get this much out of it.Again, more resolution happens in this book than the previous three or four books in my reckonning.Happy reading! I just wish it were all done so we could read it all as one story at once - such a great overall epoch with memorable characters and complex relationships and plot lines."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Trilogies work because humans can not hold interest for too long on a single plotline or story. That is a fact. Short stories are wonderful because one can finish an entire story in one sitting. Also a fact. There is honestly no end in sight for this series and Jordan is not getting any younger. So sit back and wait another two years for the next installment of this -at least- decology. Maybe if he has a son, HE can finish it in less than twenty more books.Some stuff happens in this book at least. But not enough for the amount of pages it contains.If you are one who seeks closure in life do not read this series.Personally I hope the bad guys win just so I can stop hearing the characters whine and moan. Go Dark one go!!!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan has once again managed to sell a book to me. The first book introduced the main characters to me and made a strangely strong bond causing me to care about their stories and their destiny. For several books the story line advanced srongly alternating between key initial characters. Then filler happened. Again in this book any portion dealing with any of the characters found in the first book is excellent. But between those sections dealing with our protagonists is page after agonizing page of pure filler. New characters are introduced for no particular reason other than to delay the story line. We strongly want Matt to meet his wife. But we have absolutely no interest in periferal characters dealt with more extensively than our key characters. Rereading this book if one reads only the sections in which a primary initial character appears and skips the rest one can miss nothing but increase the reading pleasure to 5 stars. Perhaps when the series finally ends or when Robert Jordan's heirs conclude it with a ghost writer there can be an abridged version which takes the 668 pages of this volume and makes it one BOOK of a book combining every 3 now published volumes - abridged based on the pricinciple mentioned. Best wishes - It is worth buying but perhaps not reading in its entirety."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This was definately better than P of D but still not anywhere near the the capability that Jordan showed in the first several books. It ranks right around with C of S. He has introduced too many characters with too many subplots. Even though I reread the series several months ago in preparation for the release, I constantly found myself forgetting who was who. P of D was even worse in that aspect. I have also grown tired of the same phrases used over and over again like, &quot;..considerable tanned cleavage..&quot; and &quot;...a generous bosom....&quot; - and they appear all the time!! There are several things that happen that could be setting up for an even better 10th book like Rand's actions in the last pages and the arrival of the Daughter of the Nine Moons. The absence of the battle of Tar Valon also made me angry because I was anticipating that almost more than anything. THis book takes a time period of only two or three weeks whereas the other books besides P of D took up much more time!! But my patience is waning and I want the series to be over. I dont see him finishing the series in less than two more books. At the most 4 but I am guessing 3 books to finish it off. I also suspect that the SHara will surface. It is mentioned that the Stone of Tear is beseiged and I dont think that it could be the Seanchan or rebels in Haddon Mirk. THe only group not yet involved that has been mentioned to have been turned upside down with Rand's coming is the Shara and he has something to do with their prophecies too (I think it was mentioned in previous book). It was still a captivating book because I feel attached to the characters but there is just not enough substance. I hope that Jordan is working on something brilliant right now but I am becoming disillusioned with where teh series is headed, and after the poor performance in P of D I was anticipating something spectacular from Jordan to show everybody that he still has it. Lets keep the hope alive!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"RJ spends 600 pages to get us to the last 50. Then we have some serious action. He spends so much wasted time giving us minute details of people that mean very little.Why doesn't he give us more of what whe want? Action! My guess is that he want's to drag out this money maker forever. At this rate Rand will never get to face the dark one at the last battle.Some spots in the book are just great,the three women linking with Rand,but their is too much gravy and not enough meat."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I don't understand what all the criticism is about. So your unhappy the books moving slowly, characters left out, questions not be answered immediately, right? Well it just has to happen. This is the ninth book in the series. Jordan has by this point spread out his plot and cast so thickly that he cannot maintain the rapid speed that his first couple books held. If he tried to it would be an injustice to his whole plot buildup. In the first couple books he had one plot line and one central group of characters which enabled Jordan to move quickly, but now he must keep track of all the characters, seperate conflicts and stories and still makes it enjoyable to read. And he does. The story loses momentum, yes. But it does not lose that magical feeling that has always made the series great. So to all the criticism I say you try to write nine novels of one plotline and still have many, much awaited, fantastical events yet to occur."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan is not a fantasy writer; he is a charlatan. If you have read the likes of JRR Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings or George Lucas's Star Wars, you know what I mean. First of all, this &quot;channeling of the power&quot; business is a direct, one to one copy from Star Wars's &quot;channeling the force,&quot; and probably some other fantasy/science fiction works. Secondly, the presentation and developments of characters, events, and creatures are also 90% taken from these books. Rand Al'Thor grows up to be 'The Dragon', and can never afford to be the child he was a few years ago (like Luke Skywalker in Episode VI). And then there were the creatures from LoTR; Padan Fain is Gollum, Trollocs are Goblins, etc.. The only thing that separates Jordan from the authors of the aforementioned books is that he writes in 2743958274572 pages what the others have written in a few hundred. And doing this, he makes lots of bucks that he does not deserve at all. If you haven't started reading Jordan yet but are thinking of starting soon, this is your chance to think again."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Greetings Jordanites! Book 9 is here and done and I am so eagerly awaiting book 10 that I am already surfing the net for any indication on its release. (smirk) As all followers of this series know, since book 7, Jordan has gone into a mode of storytelling that many authors can not handle. He is not quick to end the series, to rush to battle and certainly not getting bored with his work. He has successfully 'HOOKED' us to the series with the first 6 books, and now that he knows his audience is here to stay, he can sit back with pipe in hand and tell us a grand story! I'm on the floor by the fire listening to every word. Don't go fast, tell me everything you want, every detail. I love the fact that a point is touched on or finished 3 books later... its like drinking an aged wine, you don't rush it. The ending to this book was.. well... I read it 3 times."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After reading the ending of this book, I can basically predict how it will all end: Sometime in the far future, when this series finally stops making money, Rand will suddenly know how to seal up the Dark One's Prison! He will gather the Asha'men, Egwene's Aes Sedai, some Sea Folk Windfinders, and about 50 different ter'angreal. The Asha'men will send an oscillating weave of Spirit, Earth, and Fire into 25 of the ter'angreal, while the Aes Sedai will send a direct current of Spirit, Water, and Air into the others. The Windfinders will stand by and make sarcastic remarks (a necessary part of the secret formula). After 20 pages, this process will succeed in creating a new prison AROUND the Dark One's old prison, sealing Him in completely, bringing the series to a nice, happy conclusion! I apologize for the sarcasm, but this is the feeling I got from reading this book. I can't go into too many details without giving away the ending, but let me say this: the book's ending reminded me of the Technobabble solutions that are very prevalent on Star Trek (esp. Voyager). You have a huge, massive problem, and it can be solved by realigning the transporter coils and inverting the warp field. This book solves a certain large problem in Randland with a &quot;One-Power-babble&quot; solution that feels forced, contrived, and completely unsatisfying. And I have a gut-feeling that the central problem of tWoT will be &quot;patched up&quot; in a similar manner. As for the rest of the book, well, it is slightly better than Book #8, which is truly damning it with faint praise. However, since I basically know how things will probably end in the series, I have no interest in reading further. To quote Dennis Miller, &quot;I am outta here!&quot;"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"How very sad to observe a gifted writer like Robert Jordan become trapped upon his own wheel..The Wheel of Tedium. The plot meanders, the pace is like marching through molasses. Characters are named and seemingly never heard from again. Questions raised books ago are never resolved and new questions are raised with little hope of resolution. I skimmed entire chapters at a time. Worst of all, Jordan no longer loves his characters. He's probably becoming as bored with them as we are.Robert, please...from a devoted fan whose been along from the beginning: do us all a favor, take what remaining new ideas you have left, bundle them together in a final book and end the saga. And if it's about the money, not to worry: just start the wheel turning again with book one of the next epoch."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I loved the first six books in this series. Books seven and eight were the beginning of a slow decline. This book was the worst. It was about 600 pages too long.

The calm before the storm! How can any person, who understands high fantasy literature, criticise this book when it is enriched with characters and story telling, that have never been seen since Tolkien's Lord Of The Rings. The story is one that sets the scene for a major shift in the balance of light and dark. Finally we see the light take back its place in the true source. It is after this book that the forces of Light can make a major stand against the Dark. The final scene of this book is the best I have ever seen. Finally Rand will be able to smile again. There is now a chance of beating back the darkness the plagues the world. It's the calm before the Storm."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I know that it's impossible to change someone's perspective on this once great series: either you love it, or you quit reading it several books ago (I once was in the first group, but now am in the latter). I'm writing this view for one reason: while whatever her name is continues to pull on her braid due to the &quot;complexity&quot; of men, George R. R. Martin's latest book came out in the Fire and Ice saga and I can only hold my head low in shame at what a gifted author he is. Ironic that there's a review by Jordan on the sleeve! While Paul Atreides, oh, I mean Rand battles evil and the Bene Geserit (oops, sorry, again with the incorrect reference) et. al. continue to spin their wheels I have been thoroughly enjoying Martin's work. If you haven't read this other series, put down Jordan now and do so. You can thank me later...."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"There's a very good reason why this series is wandering all over the countryside doing nothing in particular.This is from the mouth of Robert Jordan at a book signing a few years ago (when I was still reading the series - I've since stopped)&quot;how many books there were going to be in the series?&quot; - 7 to 9 he says, not quite sure yet.&quot;about the plot - do you have it worked out?&quot; - Making it up as I go.To put it simply. HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE WANTS TO DO WITH THE PLOT - HE HAS NO PARTICULAR ENDING IN MIND.So, if you have any illusions about Robert Jordan being a great writer who will safetly bring you home to a brilliant conclusion to this series - put them at rest, BECAUSE HE WON'T.Still it's been interesting reading how frustrated all his readers are - the question I have is - why are you still reading this if it is so bad?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Another miserable 650 pages to slog through in Mr. Jordan's Wheel of Time series. The first several in the series were good, but this is ridiculous. Not even the L. Ron Hubbard's (hope the Church of Scientology doesn't mind me using his name in vain) Battlefield Earth series was this painful, or this long.Seriously, this has to be longest series ever written to not have a conclusion, and yet promise one. His minor characters, and small plot twists spanning multiple volumes add nothing to the story. which are issued out every two years.It takes this long to write a book that has no major plot events, adds nothing noteworthy, and manages to skip through the admittedly interesting conclusion to get to the end in a length readers might stand?Ask yourself this, when the ending that you've read ~7000 pages (and running) to get to happens, will you look back and say &quot;oh, yeah, that added to the story?&quot;Don't even bother with the first 32 chapters. Nothing happens."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I think that Winter's Heart is much better than Path of Daggers, but still it clearly lacks the quality of i.e. Eye of the World. All of you criticising the overwhelming mass of details are right. But come on, who was not completely enthralled by the escape of Mat and his companions and the rocking finale in Shadar Logoth, with Rand cleansing the Source? We shouldn't bother criticising the minor flaws of RJ's work and instead enjoy the epic fantasy he STILL provides."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Finally another good book by Robert Jordan. After the last two books I was starting two worry about this series. While not the best of the bunch I think it was still good. Plot lines start to wrap up and things actually happen! I swear the last 2 books could be condensed into one slightly larger than average book. While a little slow in places it's pretty engrossing for the most part. I really didn't enjoy reading about the details of Elayne running her soon to be kingdom. THough it was nice to see the love quadrangle(???) with her, aviendha, min, and Rand get some attention. It will be interesting to see what happens later if she really does have Rands children.Also I wanted more on perrin and egwene but I guess those will have to wait. If anything this book could have been longer and taken care of more plot, but it was refreshing to read what did happen. The ending is very climactic and left me wondering where Jordan is going to take this serires. I am most definately going to be looking forward to the next book!So overall this book was very invigorating, a little slow in spots but overall good, and it really moved the series along in my opinion. And he kept the addition of more plot lines to a minimum for once! So I would suggest you go out and but it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I love the series that's why I'm buying it. Those who hate it then don't buy it. I don't get the point of the people who criticize Mr. Jordan's WoT series. They are on a hard trail of campaigning to discredit and series and dissuade the fans from buying the book, when they themselves bought the 9th of the series. THE NINTH! Am I missing something here? I am a fan and I like to read what other fans think of the series and share some of my own. Constructive criticisms are healthy and very welcome. But please, this is THE NINTH of the series and you're still at it? If you hated it so much get off and forget about it. I, like the rest of my fellow fans continue to appreciate Mr. Jordan's WoT. Sure we have complains on some points that we wish to ventilate but it does not harm the talent of the author who is giving us our money's worth everytime we pick his book. Winter's Heart is another pleasurable read!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart, the ninth book in The Wheel Of Time Series, keeps with the tradition and exemplary writing of the first eight. I would recommend this book to people of all ages, I do actually. Winter's Heart is enthralling, exiting, sexy, and suspenseful. Robert Jordan manages to pull his readers into the story through excellent writing, captivating story, and indepth characters. Another great one by a great one."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"... Of course [the pace of the story is] slow, but that's the way R.J. writes. He's creating a world, you have never read in any fantasy book. It's almost as real as our world. It is even meant to be our world in a way!I think this part of the series is one of the best books R.J. has written. Finally something major happens. I can't wait for the next book, because I think the plot will go faster from now on. The only thing I didn't like was that nothing happens with Perrin. Some people said nothing happens with matt too, but no, that's not mine opinion. ...THe ending of the book was very good, although I find R.J. could have been more clear about what has happened too the forsaken who attacked Rand etc.I can imagine some people become bored of the pace of the series, but I don't care. As long as it doesn't finish there will be discussions on the Internet on many forums. ...OK 2 years for 1 book is a long time, I agree, but someone should no give up reading the series for that. Read it again. I myself read it 3 times now (1-8). Soon I will start reading WH for the second time, to look for thing I missed the first time."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"So far, so good. I have enjoyed all the books to date, even though recently they have been a bit long winded, and even repetitive (for new readers I suppose). It has been a long time coming, and this one does seem to &quot;wrap up&quot; some questions that had lingered in my mind for a while. I have read many reviews of this series, and some are downright nasty. I do not share that opinion, and have to say it has been an overall good experience. There is alot of info to digest, but that makes the story more interesting to me. I have read several, what I would call &quot;pulp fantasy&quot; that are quick quasi-enjoyable reads, but really don't get you caught up in the characters lives as this does. Having said that....I think the publisher is dragging this out too long. There are still several plot resolutions to be made, and this book only gets us part way there."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Much more satisfying than the last book.

Those books I could not put down until I was finished. This is less so in part because it is so difficult to keep all of the characters and subplots straight after leaving them behind for two years.If anything, I would ask Mr. Jordan to put a list of characters and where they fit into the plot in order to help out next time around. The glossary is not adequate.But, Rand is getting it together. Women are fighting less over stupid stuff and realizing that the world is in a precarious position.Tedious, yes, but truly, getting all of us to realize that the world is in a precarious position takes a lot of patience!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I could not put this book down.

After the muddy indecidedness of books 7 and 8 some stuff actually happened, but the lack of attention paid to Tar Valon was quite annoying. The new chapter icons, return of Bayle Domon etc. were really cool however, and the series has finally resumed progress towards its end, though even so it can only be hoped that the series ends before Robert Jordan dies."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Usually I don't kill off badguys every day and extra-huge massacers happen even more scarcely. Usually I spend my days chatting with my friends (or enemies) and sometimes pulling those lines that hang behind the scenes. Usually this is what you all do most of the time, especially if it is winter's heart and the weather is too cold to be outside your house for hours.But some of you don't seem to understand that Jordan has created a fantastically real fantasy world for us and that the characters that inhabit this realm are flesh-and-blood persons not just some words in black-and-white. And that's why Rand spends his time during this volume trying to act as small as he can (despite some chapters when this is impossible), and why Mat tryes to live his life as best as he can considering the fact that Tylin is a major pain in his buttocks - literally - (although Mr. Jordan manages to turn everything upside down as it always happens with young Mr. Cauthon), and why Elayne spends her time prepareing Caemlyn for her soon-to-come reign (and we don't know as of yet what kind of impact her plans have on al'Thor and the world at large.)The thing is that this book has everything we read in the previous ones, but this time it is made more complex and much harder to grasp wholly. That is simply the way of world(s) changing epics, but Jordan is the first one to put it down correctly and we should praise him for it instead of trying to trample his work lower than grass for it not being blunt enough. I enjoyed the book and when you look at it from the right angle then you surely will too.P.S. The book ends as grandiosly as every other in the series and as an addon Jordan has payed more attention to details and describing than in previous book, which is certainly a plus."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Is it just me or is the series stretching longer and longer? At the rate of Path of Daggers we'll all be long dead before Robert Jordan or anyone else choosen to write the rest of the series will finish. However, I might as well try to avoid a weave of Complusion as stop reading this addictive series. The characters seem to be lifelong friends of everyone that reads the book, and places and events and history are so rich that you would believe that Robert Jordan used to live there. I just hope he will finish before he is dead."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I admit that I bought this book with low expectations. It took me half a year to suffer through the last book, The Path of Daggers, and I almost considered giving up this series. I decided that I would endure to the end, however, so I picked up the paperback edition.I was pleasantly surprised with what I found. Jordan seems to have stood back and taken a long look at himself, and I got the feeling that he tried hard to make this book as good as it's predescessors. The final product turned out to be much better than the last two books(the fact that the last chapter of this book ties up more loose ends than the last two books combined should be proof enough).In this series we see the return of plot threads from as far back as The Shadow Rising and The Great Hunt. Egeanin and Bayle Domon, two characters you might remember from The Great Hunt, return. A much smaller part of the text was the reappearance of Slayer, the mysterious figure that Perrin chased to the Tower of Ghenjei in one of his wolf dreams during The Shadow Rising. We learn his name and a few of his intentions but beyond that he is an enigma that made me very curious.Mat's return also had much to offer to this book. His wanderings make up most of the latter half of the book and I was pleasantly surprised to see the beginning of the fulfillment of one of the Aelfinn's prophecies.I suggest that anybody who is having waning faith in this series should pick this one up. It is definitely worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"10 years and 8 books ago, Robert Jordan got me hooked with good, solid writing (please note the term &quot;solid&quot;), but may lose me with all the &quot;fluff&quot; and indirect writing that has appeared in books 4-9---wait I'm still reading them! It seems that I cannot stop reading this series due to all the time and energy I have invested in memorizing all the names and places, wondering when Nyneave will pull out all her hair, or if the Aes Sedia are actually Bene-Jeserits in disguise. I still see glimpses of the writing that got me hooked, but they are so few and far between, I find myself skipping paragraph after paragraph until I see something that cathces my eye. Word to the wise (that wouldn't be me)read the first three books and then wait until the last book in the series and then only read the last 100 pages of that book--it will give you more time to read the George Martin series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Though it seems so to many people, Robert Jordan is not trying to drag this series out. His intricate subplots and twists hark back to a time when books weren't: SLAM, BAM, DONE! He carefully invests time in each of his characters, even those seemingly minor to the story. But after reading (and re-reading for the fun of it) the entire series, I realized their were no minor characters. Everyone had a place and Jordan has filled every niche. I hope that he continues to write this series to at least a fifteenth book, simply because I believe it, too, will be as good as the first. Read it for its plot value, not because you're too impatient to wait for closure."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Yet another Wheel of Time book where nothing happens except one of the Forsaken getting killed in the end.How many more of these do we have to endure? Hey, Mr. Jordan, END IT!!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan should not bother to write any more books in this series, it simlply is not going anywhere! In over 700 pages, the only considerable event is Rand's cleansing the taint from saidin, and that is only in the last 50 pages of the book.Jordan throws in a lot of number of characters who readers struggle to remember and understand who is who! After almost a year from the last book, readers to tend to forget names in the previous books and that is really a nuisance. A stranger comes out of Jordan's pen and we are supposed to remember if this one is a character from the previous book or a new one? I say, why is the need for soooooo many number of people and why is the need to so much detail their characters when they will appear only for a number of pages in the book. Well, it serves a purpose of course: Fill up the pages without getting anywhere and there you have it: One more book to fill Jordan's coffers!I eagerly anticipate George R. R. Martin's next book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, but it does not matter to me anymore if Jordan writes a sentence more in the Wheel of Time series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart is not as terrible and boring as it is made out to be. First of all, criticising a a 600+ page book for its pace is absurd. One of Robert Jordan's main preoccupations involves creating a world as vivid, if not more so, than our own. That requires detail, and incorporating that into a complex set of plotlines is one reason the pace is less than allegro vivace. Some people revel in reiterating that the many plotlines are detrimental to the series as a whole. I like the extraneous storylines. Seriously, would you read the series if it was only about Rand and the guy in his head? Rand's storyline can be quite dark at times. The other stories serve to offset the main plot. The other characters and their plotlines have just as much depth as the main, and just as all roads lead to Tar Valon/Rome, all the subplots intertwine with the main good vs. evil struggle. I devoured the book in a week, and found that moving back and forth between plotlines made the book more enjoyable as a whole. Try to slog through Tolkien in a week, and Winter's heart will seem like a much more interesting read. In conclusion, all I have to say is, where do they keep the oosquai?!?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I agree with the reviewer who suggested that Mr. Jordan is riding this horse to death. Hundreds of pages of very minor story movement led to a final, choppy 50 pages that felt as if the author forgot where he wanted to go. After many references to Healing the male part of the Source, why is Nynaeve (who is supposed to be a miraculous healer) sitting passively while Rand (who supposedly has no talent for Healing) controls the flow? Combined with the nonsense of having all these Forsaken show up and then escape with nary a hangnail (with the possible exception of Moghedien and Osan'gar), I think Mr. Jordan needs to reread his first few books to remember what &quot;plotting&quot; and &quot;payoff&quot; mean. While it was nice to see some of the storylines cleared up (so that's what Verin was doing in POD), I was fairly bored through most of the book. I'm in too deep to say that I won't read at least the next book, but I wish Mr. Jordan would just wrap this up.For a better series with much better characterizations of women, I recommend Melanie Rawn's Dragon Prince et seq. Reading those books, I started to think that many of Mr. Jordan's ideas were just lifted from Ms. Rawn!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have been reading random samplings of reviews for Jordan's Wheel of Time books, and after reading the reviews for Winter's Heart, I could contain myself no longer. I feel it is my duty to insert some perspective here.For everyone who has given some of the latter books in the series low ratings because they are too &quot;slow,&quot; I feel I must say that you simply do not have the attention span to read a complicated story. Go back to &quot;See Spot Run,&quot; or maybe &quot;Dick and Jane,&quot; and try again.I grant you that not all of Jordan's books are filled with page after page of constant action and battle. But this is because Jordan knows that no *good* book CAN be written that way. The &quot;slow&quot; parts, as you so clumsily put it, are what flesh out the story. They are what make Jordan's world seem so real that you feel like it might be a non-fictional history book at times. The &quot;convoluted plot twists,&quot; as one reader put it, are what add complexity and depth to the story. This is what separates it from your cliched &quot;sword and sorcery&quot; type novels. This is about more than magic and war. It is about politics, diplomacy, culture, everything that makes a world REAL. In short, if you can't handle the &quot;slow&quot; parts, buy something else.I will agree with the readers who complain about the wait between books... it certainly is interminable, but you can't blame Jordan for that. Would you rather he spews out crap on a cracker every two months?Ok, now that my general rant is over... about &quot;Winter's Heart.&quot; This book is EXCELLENT! It wraps up many of the &quot;convoluted plot twists,&quot; it gives us the answers to a lot of the mysteries Jordan left us with. (Wanna know if Mazrim Taim was Demandred in disguise? Read Winter's Heart!) And finally, the last chapter of the book is AMAZING. One reader said it was the best chapter she had ever read, and I have to agree. This one chapter makes up for ALL the &quot;slow parts&quot; in my mind. Heart-pounding action, Forsaken popping up everywhere, Saidin and Saidar all over the place, and a stunning resolution that will leave you drooling for book 10.

I also enjoy those readers who give this book 5 stars for being better than the last one. In my opinion, in a series, just because a book is better than the last one, DOES NOT make it good. Besides, judging from the reviews of Path of Daggers, no book could possibly be worse.I have a question --- WHY are you still reading? ANY of you! Find good, worthwhile books to read.For those of you who think that the &quot;end will justify the means,&quot; don't hold your breath. The reason that Robert Jordan continues to write this blather is because HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO FINISH THE STORY. He hasn't known how to finish it since the 4th book. And I assure you that when he does finish, it will be so anticlimatic that those of you die hard fans will find nearest window from which to throw yourselves.At this point the end can't be THAT good. It's impossible.REMEMBER THE X-FILES!Lisa (who was smart enough to cut her losses in book 4)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It has taken 10 years for a writer to enthrall me like Jordan has. His characters don't just live on the page, they seem to be friends he has acquired over the years. He writes with such detail and obvious care for his &quot;friends&quot;, that if one were to walk up to you on the street, you would recognize them, immediately. He has taken his genre to another level. The bar has been set so high that it will probably take as long an interval between the &quot;Hobbit&quot; and the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; to find another author that snares the imagination as firmly as he does. Yes, book 8 was slow, but it was no less rich than the rest. It is good to take a breath every once in a while, and that is what a &quot;Crown of Sords&quot; lets you do. It rejuvenates your mind to be ready for the perfect storm that will end the series. Don't let your mind wander with this one. It has setup the action and characters, nicely: -what will Egwene do when she reaches the gates of Tar Valon -what happened to Olver -will Birgette find her lost love -When Faile is rescued will Bain and Chiad follow her or their toh And that is just the beginning. It is a long series, and it yet their is more to be said. The stories of those that came before the ones that we know, leaves the door open for a multitude of books by Jordan or someone else with the same vision. The best is yet to come, and I can't wait."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've noticed many of the reviews have critiqued Jordan's work for borrowing ideas from Tolkien, therefore lacking an original an original piece. I would say that is a pointless arguement against it. Every fantasy epic I've read has borrowed from Tolkien. Take for example, in R.A. Salvatore's &quot;Icewind Dale Trilogy&quot;, Bruenor, a dwarven king, is in search of his lost homeland in a mountain that was stolen by a dragon. Sound familiar to those of you who have read &quot;The Hobbit&quot;? Or even &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and any derivitive has completely stolen the idea of a hobbit/halfling right down to every detail. The approximate height, the furry feet, and the superior dexterity. And I could go on. (I would like to point out though that Tolkien's work is very dependant on Norse mythology and is not really that original) People have also complained that the series is too long. Why is that a bad thing? I, personally, hate it when a good book ends and wish that it wouldn't end. Many also think that Jordan's books have gotten more and more dry and boring. WAKE UP! Fantasy readers have become too addicted to the large amounts of fighting in the fantasy genre and don't seem to like it when an author has more character/plot development than action, which is Hollywood's downfall right now. Another thing that really bugs me is people complaining about the repetition of &quot;blood and bloody ashes&quot;, &quot;Light&quot;, and &quot;Burn you&quot;. They are quite obviously swears! If you think about, a large amount of people swear on a very frequent basis and Jordan is merely making the dialogue more realistic by adding in some archaic English swears. And for those of you who can't stand how much detail and repeating of himself Jordan does, try reading &quot;War and Peace&quot; and you'll stop complaining. Tolstoy lists everything to the dot that happens. To end this commentary, I think that Jordan has created a very immense and 3-D world with an intricate past and fully developed, evolving characters. He has a great mix of action, politics, setting, and characters. Probably my one gripe is that the I have to wait long periods of time in between books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok, so the first couple of books were really good. Everything else? A total waste of time. Me? I quit. This story will never end."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am quickly becoming disenchanted with &quot;MOMMAS BOY&quot; Jordan. I have had this book scince christmas and can't get through it. I feel like I'm being milked here...How many more Jordan??? Its getting old!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Tightening the ropes are we?It seems like the average reader falls into a trend where they must review a book based on how the 1 out of thier 10 friends who actually did read it feels. This book? Was just as great as it's predeccessors. Jordan is a visionary, he captures every last detail, you always know what is going on, this is not an author that assumes the reader is of his level of intellect, he knows better then that.The irony to all this is the author, a Physicist from the Citadel, is writing a fantasy novel, and he does it so well that a few people are getting impatient to find out what the ending is! Don't tkae the length as discouragement, no these people aren't bored, they are enjoying it so much they wish he'd get to the point and the action!Nothing HAPPENED? Four countries have fallen into the hands of Rand Al'thor, Kings and Queens have been toppeled, the One Power has been literally reformed! And that was all BEFORE this book. The stage is set in this book, if you wish to be prepared for what I believe is the end of a brillant Decology, read this book and prepare. (Hey, if it's even longer, all the better!)I've only skimmed the surface, and appropriately I do this review at the newest book. Robert Jordan's world is rich in detail, filled with excitement, and most importantly... unlike any other world I have read or seen. Please, give this book a chance, read the opening chapters, and if you like it, read on!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I was surprised when I saw soem of the other reviews and figured they needed a bit of a rebuttle. This book was an excellent work of literature. The plot did not appear &quot;disjointed&quot; at all, in fact it gave me a much mroe indepth view of the inner workings of his world. The final chapter literally had me on the edge of my very seat and kept me enthralled even after I had closed the cover. I recommend this book for anyoen interested in the Wheel of Time series and I'd recommend the series to anyone who enjoys reading in general."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is an incredible find. I have just bought this book two days ago and I couldn't even put it down. I was a little discouraged at first by some of the other review saying how bad it is. Robert Jordan did it once again for me, it is incredible how he could still keep the story together with all the sub plots he added. But without all the sub plot where would all the reality and the fun be. Cheers to Robert Jordan, you did it again."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan is secretly Bill Gates?Bloated story = Bloated software?Bloated software = Bloated story?you be the judge ;)maybe we just need to download the latest service pack ;) hehehe"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I must join the majority in saying much better than book 8 and it's great to see Mat again. I like the loose ends getting wrapped up and no new ends left dangling. Don't need more action, but would like to see more of what is going on with each of the main characters. Loriel is mentioned in passing, but like Mat in book 8 we don't have a clue as to what he's up to. Even though not much was given to Perrin going after Faile, we were kept abreast of their situation.I envy the person who just started the series this last spring. I started about 4 years ago and this waiting a year to get moved an inch closer is starting to wear with as slow as the series is moving. When (if??) Mr. Jordan gets done with WoT, it will be worth going through the series again.Read it, enjoy it, &amp; prepare to wait for the next book. Hopefully the series will be completed in our lifetime."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After the last 2 books, I was really hoping that Jordan could put together things like his first 5 books. I was pleasantly surprised that Winter's Heart did do that to a certain extent. The storytelling is a lot more sharper and it appears that the series might finally proceed to some conclusion soon (atleast there is a hint of it). After having dragged us out like the &quot;Lost Ones&quot;, Jordan finally comes up with a better book. Like many folks, I am hooked and will read the books as they come. But definitely, this book is something to look up to for anyone still interested in the series and were put off by the previous 2 books. He could still do better......."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok we can all agree that this was by far a better book than the last two. I still lacked that something that the first five had that left me slavating for the next one. I don't think that it is a matter of the author being not haveing fresh material. His cast are all as complete as ever I just wish that the character set wouldn't change so. The author has lost a little focus over the last three books, yet I feel that it will get better. It can only get better. I beleive that the book ten will be the last....in this story."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The first 6 books are my favourite books, but the series has gone rapidly down hill. 7 and 8 were ok just very slow paced. But this book takes the biscuit. Nothing happens until the last 30 pages (out of 650) I kid you not.I will probably give Jordan one last chance ( being hooked on the series) but this book sucks bad due to the entire lack of action or plot."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After the fifth title in this series came out, I figured it would take three more volumes to tie up all the loose ends. Now, after the ninth, it still looks like it will take three more volumes, at least. If you like complex intertwining plotlines, then this series is for you; if you like plots to be resolved, better look elsewhere. Don't by this one without reading the whole series in sequence.This volume nonetheless makes some significant advances towards a final resolution. Several events forshadowed since early volumes finally occur; so do some surprises that can't help but affect the final outcome. I won't spoil things by getting specific, but things move farther forward in this volume than in the previous three combined."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I enjoyed this book. It's not quite as good as the first few books, but it's definitely a step up from &quot;Path of Daggers&quot;, which was horrible. The last chapter was the best."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"For all the Jordan fans waiting for the series to finally get back on track...don't hold your breath. Jordan starts off with an utterly useless section about Perrin and continues with hundreds of pages about Elayne's political troubles. There is virtually no major advancement of the main plot until the very end of the novel. Remember what the main plot is? Don't feel bad if you forgot. It's been a long time since anything important has happened in Rand land. As for those who think this series is as good as Tolkien's 'Lord of the Ring', get real! On sheer imagination, Jordan's series is immense. However, it's too unfocused and divergent to be ever considered as good as Tolkien's."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Unless you've JUST started reading this series and have been kept abreast of all that's gone on, I'd honestly suggest doing what I'm going to do from now on: wait until the series is COMPLETELY finished. The book *is* better than the last couple (which, sadly, isn't saying too much), but I'd just suggest waiting until the series is over, then rereading the ones you've read and then the newest ones, so you won't have to wait the 2 years between each book! *sigh*"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Although Jordan does tend to spend too much time on the perpetually stagnant characters of Elayne and Perrin, there is a definate move towards the resolution of the series. Many things which had not been previously known are revealed in the book, and it also has new surprises. Definately worth reading if you have read the other books, and if you haven't, you should."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I discovered this series several books in and enjoyed becomming so involved in the intricate plot. But 8 and 9 have been major disappointments! I find myself skimming boring plot lines that could be summed up in a page. It's time to end. Please!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I joined the world of the light, little more than a year ago. From the moment that Moirane and Lan, absconded from Emonds Field with the youngsters,and the village Wisdom in pursuit, I have been, for the first time, a self-proclaimed, &quot;FAN&quot;. Yes, I agree that the earlier books were of more magical content. But give this true storyteller, and Veteran a break! Only He has lived in this world from the time of the Creator, and &quot;The Wheel Weaves As The Wheel Wills&quot; after all. O.K. So yes a little less retro. To truly immerse oneself in this epic one must start from book one. But as for me &quot;Winters Heart&quot; is a very good read.With the cleansing of Saidin I see a plethora of directions this saga can take. So I do hope we get to the end before that last nail is driven into Mr. Jordans Coffin."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I got this book for Christmas and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I picked it up, and started reading. Like some of the last few books, it was not very interesting for the first few hundred pages. Jordan seems to be losing his style that first interested me in the Wheel of Time series. A bunch of useless instances, and emphasis on what people are wearing and how they look. Seriously folks, WHO THE HELL CARES? It came across to me that it was just some filler. But if you think about it, these last few books have had endings where you know that something in the next, or later book(s) is going to happen. Putting the boredom aside for the half of the book, you reach the ending, which is undoubtly one of the best in the series. Robert Jordan couldn't have come up with a better one. Sure it's a little predictable, but once you read it, you can't stop until the end. Then you'll find yourself waiting for the next book. I just can't wait."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Finally another good book by Robert Jordan. After the last two books I was starting two worry about this series. While not the best of the bunch I think it was still good. Plot lines start to wrap up and things actually happen! I swear the last 2 books could be condensed into one slightly larger than average book. While a little slow in places it's pretty engrossing for the most part. I really didn't enjoy reading about the details of Elayne running her soon to be kingdom. THough it was nice to see the love quadrangle(???) with her, aviendha, min, and Rand get some attention. It will be interesting to see what happens later if she really does have Rands children.Also I wanted more on perrin and egwene but I guess those will have to wait. If anything this book could have been longer and taken care of more plot, but it was refreshing to read what did happen. The ending is very climactic and left me wondering where Jordan is going to take this serires. I am most definately going to be looking forward to the next book!So overall this book was very invigorating, a little slow in spots but overall good, and it really moved the series along in my opinion. And he kept the addition of more plot lines to a minimum for once! So I would suggest you go out and but it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"as an avid reader if the wheel of time series, i can't help but continue to be disappointed. where some questions were answered most were not. and can someone please tell me what is happening w/perrin and fail? this story line begins the book and then just disappears. also, did i miss something, or shouldn't winter be over? i could have sworn that was what the bowl of winds was for. as w/the last 3 books, i spent much of the time just skimming pages looking for something of real interest. it is no longer the series that enthralled me w/magic and monsters galore. now we are lucky to have rand channel to just to bring a pitcher of wine to himself or to see a grey man pop up. where has all the fun and action gone? i just want to get to the last battle and be done..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan definitely starting to pick the pace up a bit, and I was reminded why I loved the Wheel of Time series the first time I picked up The Eye of the World. Mat finally returns and have a relatively big part in Winter's Heart, he never fails to entertain, and personally I thought Mat's experience with Daughter of the Nine Moon was quite intersting. Although I was disappointed that very little was devoted to Faile's kidnapping and Egwene's siege to the White Tower, Jordan did a good job tying up a few ends left unsaid in the Crown of Swords, I do think that Jordan's way of resolving issues every other books is kind of confusing (since I have a very short term memory and often forgot what went on before when a new book comes out) but I don't find it too annoying. Anyways, there wasn't much action in this one, but I sure got goose bumps while reading the last chapter, and still do thinking about it. If you still like the Wheel of Time, pick it up now, and if you're new to it, try it and you might like it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart is a definite improvement over the last few books, none of which had anything happen until the very end. Jordan does a good job of restoring the pace which he had in the first five, and the story moves along at a good clip (by Jordan's standards anyway). Some crucial plotlines are resolved, but as usual, more are added. Jordan once again leaves out one of the major characters. In the last book it was Mat, in Winter's Heart, Egwene is hardly to be seen. There is one chapter in which she meets Elayne in Tel'aran'rhiod, but this is set just before she opens the gateway to besiege Tar Valon, which was at the end of TPOD. There is nary a mention of her siege in Winter's Heart. Sigh. Still, this book has its moments. The ending is terrific, and nearly makes up for everything. Rand travels considerably over the course of this book and sticks it to the forces of evil, Elayne rules in Caemlyn, and Mat wanders through Seanchan Ebou Dar, trying to walk the tightrope of Tylin and the Daughter of the Nine Moons. Perrin sets out to find Sevanna's sept and rescue Faile, but as you probably expected, not much happens there. Formerly important characters like the Wise Ones and the Aiel chieftains are nonentities again. Still, the very last sentence in the book, which mentions something about the time of illusions ending does promise excitement in the future. All in all, a solid entry in the series, and worthwhile read. Of course, this could be my addiction talking . . ."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Finally after many months of waiting the book is here, and finally after much nervousness after what happened in book VIII Jordan delivers again. Don't get me wrong, I have loved every book in the series, however Book VIII really did not seem to go anywhere or answer any questions. This book is definitely better and a good step in terms of the story. Though I would read and give a high rating to any of the books in this series, this definitely beat my expectations... and also my favorite character who was mysteriously left out of book VIII returns."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is the second time I have read the Wheel of Time series through to book 11. I am enjoying each book more the second time because the wait for the next book to be written has been eliminated. Book 9 continues where book 8 left us....Perrin is faced with a challenge deeper than anything he has overcome before. Elayne is fighting for her right to be the next queen, thinking her mother dead. The story unfolds in pure genius with Robert Jordan at the helm.With the death of Jordan last fall we are left to wait and hope that the new author who has been given the huge undertaking of finishing this amazing series will be up to the task. Up to now, the book is perfection"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I just finished reading Winter's Heart. I had put off reading it after seeing so many bad reviews on this site. I understand the frustration of some readers who wish the action would pick up. I would like to see the series end soon, too, but I didn't think this book was so bad. There is plot development. The charcters are growing (albiet slowly) and maturing. I'm glad Mat finally met his future wife; it was a long time coming. I wish Jordan would write more about Perrin; he's by far the best charcter. I don't think I'll wait so long to read Book 10, but, Mr. Jordan, have pity on us. I enjoy long stories, but can't you end it soon? I'd love to know how it ends."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I still don't know why this book has such a good rating...It was much worse than the 8th book yet people seem to like it more.

Started out great, the plot lines, sub plots, deep characters and just a great read.But enough is enough. I find myself hoping a plague or magic will wipe out 3 sub plots as it is getting too confusing.There is such a great story underneath all of this, but when 4 main characters turn into 6, then 8, then 10, now 27...Crimanry, I have to re-read it before I'm done to keep on top of things. One of my friends started a outline of characters just to follow along and another had abandoned it all together.Simplify and find the heart of this series, it had such promise."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I found this to be a very satisfying book. It gives the reader enough of each character to be sated for the next book. In this respect it shames Path of Daggers, because while it did tie up some ends and set the stage for the future, you got a good blend of characters as well as some action. Some stuff happens in it that makes you go &quot;finally!&quot;. The ending is really good, and is an all-around fun read."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"To start off, many people are making out this book to be a huge waste of time. Well Its not. It isnt the best, but its not the worst by far,and I really enjoyed reading it. To start off Im going to give my list of critisims of this book, and the last few.1. There are three characters that everybody wants to read about. Rand.Perrin.Mat. These are the three best characters and the most interesting to read about. But instead of focusing on them,RJ puts more inportance on minor characters and sub plots, often cutting on of the three from the book completly (Perrin in LoC, Mat in PoD.)Perrin now suffers in this book, he is over way to quickly.2. Subplots. These seem like mixed blessings. Its good that RJ is creating a realistic world, with many differant people and agendas, but when these subplots take over the book, kicking out major characters(PoD) they become extremlly annoying.3. Female characters. Just read all the other reviews. I agreee,except for Fail. And I hate Min.Now for the good aspects of the book.1. Mat is back! The parts with him are the best sections in this book, he is always an amusing character to read and provides some light relief from some of the heavier chapters.2. Things are happening(sort of).I felt that in PoD, nothing happend. Everybody just stopped! Now things are happening again, and the next book should be very interesting.3. Great climax! PoD had none! This book makes up for it, but I also felt the last chapter with Mat was very thrilling.Now even though there are more bad than good, the good outways the bad by far. I enjoyed this book a lot. Its the kind you look foward to reading and not to finishing. And the people who are giving it 1 star obviously dont understant it, and probally got lost after the first book. Thank You"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan's done it again, and that's not a compliment. I was 400 pages into the book before I realized nothing had happened yet. I finished it thinking it could have easily been about 4 chapters in a well-edited book (which could have included book 7 &amp; 8 as well). I've got a new rule about series, which is I don't read them unless they're completed. This rule is prompted by Jordan's Wheel of Time. I'm addicted to it, and I appreciate the rich fantasy world he's built (amazing political, racial, and cultural differences) along with the myths and magics he's populated it with. But it seems he's decided to make it an ongoing soap-opera, as opposed to finishing it off in proper form. I think he needs to hire himself a good editor and cut the crap. It wasn't so bad in the beginning, the books were more concise and seemed to come out every 12 months, but now it's 2+ years between fluff pieces. If you haven't started reading this series, don't. You will ultimately be disappointed, at least until it is completed (and maybe even then)."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I find it hard to believe that the last few books were written by the same author that wrote the first few. This series had more promise than any other fantasy series I have ever read. Robert Jordan got bogged down in his many plotlines and minor characters. Nothing happens. When you can skip whole chapters and pages of description, and pick up right where you left off, that's a bad thing.Some editor needs to slap the author and make him write again. Simply compare his writing style (descriptions, level of dialogue, advancement of plot, action) between the first 5 books and the last 4. He has begun writing simply for the act of writing, not for the reader. It shows, and it sucks.I would no longer reccommend even starting this series as it has become such a gigantic disappointment."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"RJ delivered on schedule, and many twists of the plot had been predicted at least 50% accurately by the diehard WOT fans on the web. But, Winter's Heart is a much more pleasant reading expirience than PoD. Also, something actually happenned in this book. Plus, there are several hundreds of pages featuring Mat, and some of the Aelfinn prophecies are cleared. I strongly recommend all fans of the series to read this book. Nyn tugs her braid only a couple of times, just to keep her fans pleased. For the rest of us, her absence from big portions of the book is a true Light's blessing.If you are new to the series, try Eye of the World first - the title which truly deserves a five star rating. Then read the following six books, have someone to retell you the plot of Path of Daggers, and then read Winter's Heart."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Unlike the mantra of the series, the Wheel seems to have stopped turning for the last three books. I don't know about other readers, but I'm getting pretty frustrated with plot lines that are dragged out over multiple books just to continue the series. I think the last three books could EASILY have been condensed into one book but...As for the threads of the Wheel that are twisted in this book...surprisingly, there ARE answers to some of the burning, unresolved questions from the last two books (who is that masked man? Who is that short woman with...'huge tracts of land', Osangar's Randland identity, etc.). And some of Min's visions do come true...as well as her spouting off more random gibberish (stop with the forshadowing all ready and just have things happen!).However, for all the threads that are finally tied together...some just come out in one big tangled knot (ie the end of the book....while very cool, was very frustrating: just WTF was Rand doing besides channelling??) And some are just plain sappy (you'll know which part).I've said it before and I'll say it again....it's time for some superfluous characters to die. Separate the wheat from the chaff before Tar'mon Gaidon! (If it hasn't already happened).=)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I read all of the Wheel of Time books over the course of seven months. I devoured the first few books in a week or less. But as the series went on, I found it took longer and longer to finish each page, up until 'Winter's Heart', when I had nearly lost interest in the story altogether.I read 'Eye of the World' in three days. I read 'Winter's Heart' in three months- and that included the parts I skipped because I just didn't care what the minor characters had to say.Personally, I think Robert Jordan figured out after about book four that people were still buying his books, and so he decided to drag them out as long as possible in order to stretch his fame and fortune.Between a myriad of annoying, minor characters, page after page of the main enemies thinking about how much they hated each other and the protagonists, endless descriptions of the women's clothes, and constant reminders of how the world of Tel'aran'rhiod works, the story got put into the background.It's a shame, really. Jordan started out strong, but he seems to have forgotten where he was going."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book brings the Wheel of Time Series to its lowest point since Lord of Chaos. The plot is stuck in a quagmire, the characters are still saying the same lines and using the same mannerisms (I swear, if Nyneave tugs on her braid one more time, or starts to and then stops, I'm going to tug a page right out of the book) they've been using since book one, and the novel is in terrible need of good editing. I don't say that just because it's long. Heck, I like long books. But the pacing and the arrangement of the chapters seems to have been done haphazard for this volume. In fact, after beginning the book with Perrin and Faile's problems, after about halfway through the book, Jordan never goes back to those problem. The reader is left wondering what is going on with them, and even worse, at least I had lost interest in them by the end of the book. The chapters are also arranged so that the reader gets large doses of one character's situation before moving to a long sequence on another character. This is very disconcerting, especially after reading the George R. R. Martin's tightly knit novels.Worse than all this, Jordan doesn't seem to know where the heart of his story lies. In my opinion, Rand is the most interesting character in the most interesting situations, yet the author devotes very little page time to him in comparison to other characters. One good thing did come out of this book, and that's the new aspect of Rand being too much like a stone (i.e. no longer really human) by the time Tarmon Gaidon comes around. I enjoyed that twist.To sum it up, I'm giving serious thought to not reading any more of this series. Problem is, I've invested so much time and so many pages that I can't help wondering how the whole thing will end."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I must say that my physical therapy bill will be higher this month. My neck kept streching after falling asleep after each paragraph. After falling asleep many times trying to finish the book, I finally gave up reading and tried memorizing the dictionary. Doing that put me just a bit worse off, so I went back to the lesser evil and made it to chapter two. Ok ok. I'm exaggerating a bit, but only a little.Let look a the players: Mat - back in the game. Egwene - out of the ballpark. If Lanfear is back, in disguise, where is Morraine...who?Zzzz... Sorry...I seemed to have dozed off again.I see that the book ended. Rand cleansed all evil from the male side of the power...in what seemed about fifteen minutes. I think it look longer for him to get from his home to the village in the first chapters of the first book. Has someone lost the will to write? Or, is someone spending a little too much time on the other series. Maybe he should sell the series to Mad Magazine and let those 'creative' writers have at it. There probably would have been more action in it. Wouldn't you love to see Spy-vs-Spy go up against the Chosen? Probably would have seen more action!Seriously, I was very disappointed by the results of this book. The few loose ends it ties up, the strange timeline, missing characters like Loial, etc. really turned me off. Then I thought...maybe this was originally part of the last book. Maybe there was no real good point to break it up. Maybe RJ needed the money and figured we weren't smart enough to figure it out. He got mine...never again.Did anyone see the Gore-Bush campaign? It was more interesting..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart is in the same vein as Crown of Swords and Lord of Chaos, a step up from Path of Daggers (a nearly unmitigated disaster), and a far cry from books 1-5. Once again, little actually happens to move the plot(s) and two major plotlines (both sides of the split Aes Sedai) are not given any significant space. The relatively uninteresting Perrin-Faile saga (including the basically worthless Sevanna-Shaido plotline) is stretched into 6 overly verbose chapters and the wanderings of Mat through Ebou Dar are similarly overextended.The largest weakness of the last 3-4 books is the lack of time devoted to Rand. This is alleviated somewhat in Winter's Heart, but the fact remains that he is THE messiah of Jordan's world, thus he should command around 40-50% of the book and much of the character development; the rest of the plotting and coordinating by other characters can be described more succinctly (do we really need to know about rabbits darting around while Egwene rides to a confrontation in Path of Daggers, same type of stuff happens in WH). Another weakness is the lack of interaction between Perrin and Rand -- arguably the two most important characters in the series considering the prophetic pronouncements regarding how important it was for Rand to keep Perrin nearby (this is only one misuse of Perrin by Jordan, the author could do MUCH more with that character).Jordan has a definite ability to produce great action in short, direct passages and does so in the final chapter. He also displays good subtlety of language and description. The contrast between these talents and the obvious padding within the recent books is what makes this series so frustrating to the legions of non-apostolic (yet loyal) fans. Jordan has much to do in this series, I just hope it's not eight more years (two more years for each of the four books predicted by one reviewer) before this all gets done."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"OK, it wasn't quite as good as Lord of Chaos, but it comes pretty close. After last two books where numerous plot lines were opened and none closed, we have a book where more have been closed than opened. After glancing at the other reviews, there seem to be some common criticisms to the book.Did the book have sections that seemed to drag on and on? Sure. But then again so has EVERY OTHER book in the series so far.Does the sniping with Elayne and Nynaeve get old? Yep. Once again, go back to every other book starting with book 3.Many of the critics hold up the first 5 books as exceptional while the 6th starts a downward trend. While I agree that books 7 and 8 could've easily been combined into one hard-hitting book, book 6 was definitely the best and book 3 ranks only above book 8 in terms of excitement.Are there a plethora of plot lines and characters still out there? Sure. But if you want everything tied up at once, read George R. R. Martin's series and watch as any character you care about (and there aren't many) get tortured, murdered, etc. leaving only characters with no redeeming qualities.Bottom line: Jordan is back on track with where he left off after Lord of Chaos. It's not worth a two year wait, but I'll take it. I can't wait for book 10."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The last few books, I have to admit were not as great as the first five, with the exception of some really great parts, the last 2 were just good, not great. With this book though, you get back to great, this book has everything you could ask for, it resolves many questions that were still up in the air before. Now, thankfully many are coming around to a nice close for what I expect to be a 12 book series. This book has a killer, awesome, amazing last chapter, probably the best since Dumais Well. I thought before that that was the best, most monumental chapter in any of the books, but this one took the cake by far. It answers just about every question that you have, and it also brings up some new ones. All in all it was a really good book with the exeption that it leaves out several major players especially egwene. Her story seems to be far from being resolved. But hopefully in the next book, rj will take care of much of that."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Many Wheel of Time fans have noticed the lag in the plot of the last two installments of this series. &quot;The Path of Daggers&quot; was a frustrating disappointment because after such a long wait, more questions were raised and it seemed that none were answered. &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; brings back some of the excitement the series had lost, and puts to rest some of the questions that had been in readers' minds for far too long. I could only sigh in contentment after finishing this book, the first Wheel of Time book in forever that I had a hard time putting down. I remember now why I cared about this series; I was about to forget it. With &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; the excitement is back and the ending we have all been waiting for comes close enough to touch."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Before I launch into a harangue on Jordan's detiorating plot writing, I'd like to acknowledge that he is a great writer - and the wheel of time is a great series. 1-6 are tremendous. With that said, there just a few things I want to say. Beginning with book five, and especially in 7-9, Jodan has given us these terribly boring and annoying accounts of immature women, and their minor adventures. I'm beginning to think that Jordan has some distorted or unhealthy perception of women. Maybe all the women he knows are bullies, brats, or snobs? Regardless, the dialogue and plot concerning Nynaeve, Faile, Elayne, and most Aes Sedai accomplish nothing except frustration at all the pettines. The genius of the WOT was Jordan's characterization of the main characters (ta'veren)and many minor (Lan/Moraine, Loial, Isam, Elyas,Thom, the Forsaken, and especially Fain). Also genius, was the sense of history conveyed, the good vs evil drama, and the plot movement. Well the plot movement is coming to a standstill, and all the character development is coming from the annoying and boring wives or girlfriends of the main characters. To top it off, the book length appears to shrink as the spaces between the lines increase. Please Mr Jordan, do your fans a favor - devote 1 chapter to the stupid wives instead of the main characters, and build some plot development with the characters your readers care more about than most of their friends."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book seems to move a few strands of the plot forward a bit. In that regard, it does move more briskly than the previous two books. But to put it in perspective, over the course of nearly 700 pages, it advances the timeline of the story by about three or four weeks. This series is certainly addictive. So is nicotine."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Is Jordan now going to have 12 books in the series? Only two things really get resolved in the whole book. When I was reading this it felt like it was something that was rushed, almost like it was written by someone else. I am disapointed in this book. The rest of the series is wonderful, but this book seems to be the sequel that is terrible by itself, but you have to read it to finish the series. Lately the books in the WoT series have been getting much shorter, and I am wondering if Jordan will end up writing more than eleven books by the time this series raps up."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan's ninth book in this series was like a relaxing drink from a magnum of champagne. Problem is, there's soooo much to drink! Anxiously waiting fans (like me), were waiting to snap this book up and hope for some conclusion to the many plotlines running amok in the incredible world of the Wheel of Time. Unfortunately, this book was just another stop in what may be a 15 book epic. Jordan manages to maintain his many characters' personas while adding several new ones(again!) to the list. There seems to be a focus on the influence of the women foretold in the fates of Mat, Perrin, and Rand. The stunning ending of the book is a tiny bit vague, but serves to quench some of the thirst to read about the One Power in action. Jordan also details the internal politics of Andor (and we thought Gore/Bush was bad!) while updating the individual adventures of Mat Cauthon, Perrin Aybarra, and Rand Al'Thor. There is the feeling that he is beginning to close major loose ends in preparation for the Last Battle, but the magnitude of accomplishing that with all the running storylines is going to take awhile. Personally, I was happy to finally read some more about the Wheel of Time world. It is a well-established world with a plethora of peronalities, culture and history than you can dive into. I just wish I didn't have to wait 2 years for next book!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The latest in Robert Jordan's series is what I've come to expect since Book 6. The first 100 pages or so are dull, dull, dull, but it picks up after that. It reminded me of the last book, Path of Daggers. Everything seems pretty quiet right now, but soon everything's going to blow up and get amazing. I was hoping this would happen in Book 9, but alas, it seems we all have to wait for the next one. The main difference between this one and the last one is that Mat and Rand's stories keep moving better than in book 8 and that the ending is incredible!! This is the best ending I've read in the series so far (except for book 2). Overall, you won't be disappointed, but you won't be blown away either (until the end)."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have been reading this series since it first came out. I loved the first ones but the last few where just not as good. This one is MUCH better than PoD which unlike some I did like. My only real problem with the series is the length of time between books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, anyone else getting worried that Mr. Jordan will die (god forbid) before this series ends! I can't imagine it ending in the next book... maybe in book 11 or 12 but not much before, so I'm getting worried that we'll never actually see the end... And of course Mr. Jordan is the first to say that he's not gonna tie up everything which leads me to believe their will be parallel novels when he does finish the bloody thing. And for those of you who complain and fuss, guess what, the supposed master, Tolkien, has as many flaws as Jordan, and to tell you the truth, every writer has flaws, PERIOD!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Book 8 was not as good as the rest but this book certainly made up for it! Jordans books are amazing the best ive ever read so far. This series has captured me and i cant escape. Winters Heart i could not put down like the others and i read it in a few days. Some charactors are left out completely or just a little but i think it would be very confusing if they were all there! Every time i read this series i find out something new, some small but important detail i missed out before. This book is full of suprises (that i wont tell you other wise i will spoil it), and made me giggle quite a few times! My only complaint is the wait for the next book. It drives me crazy!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I read through the other reviews and am amazed at indiviudals who go out of there way to put something down. Even to the point of complaining about the women characters in the book. Come on people, this book was wonderful anyway you look at it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"...and endings don't seem very forthcoming either. However, book nine of the hernia-inducing &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series does something few of the books seem to be able to accomplish. It seems too short. At six-hundred some pages, &quot;Winter&quot; picks up the pace that has been lacking for the last two to four books, depending. Jordan could have gone with his habit of nudging the page numbers against the quadrupal digit boundry and I don't think reading it would have been an effort.If you haven't started the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series, don't. Not unless you have nothing else to do with your year. But if you are in the series, keep going. Suffer the mild boredom the &quot;Crown&quot; and &quot;Path&quot; will induce and &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; will be your reward, with a few of the long-promised turns-of-event that Jordan has been promising us, and an ending that will leave you panting and checking for more pages. Maybe the series finale won't be for another half-dozen books or so, but this one will remind you why you are still reading, nine books into it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"i just noticed this. If you go back to the first reviews of this book almost all of them are 4 or 5 stars. That's 2 years ago, but the book hasn't changed. Nowadays, you see more 1's than, um, the US mint. My theory is that people got sour over these 2 years. They went back and concentrated on the bad parts. I enjoy these books and find them more interesting than everyday TV sitcoms. If you can't handle the nuances, then go read the veggie tales or something."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"For all of you who want a conclusion and finality, tread not near this series (and please quit with the whiney reviews). Stay away and enjoy the empty feeling you get every time you finish a good novel, knowing that you'll never be able to reenter the pristine adventure you enjoyed so much. Go and enjoy the authors who stoop to gross perversions and bloodied gore (can you say Martin?), or try to trail along after their story with some half-empty sequel (or prequel).If you do start this series then realize you are entering an unfinished work. There are no guarantees that you'll enjoy it. No promise that it will turn out in any way you imagine...in fact there is not even a glimmer of a conclusion (up to Book Nine), which is why I enjoy it so much. The tale is still alive and could go anywhere...what could be more epic then that?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan's books are epic, long winded, and meandering. But I have to ask you is this so wrong? What is this overwhelming need for the books to finish? I for one want this series to last forever. I have never been so enthralled with a story line and don't really know what I'll do when its all over. The only qualm I have with the man is that it takes him so long to pen another installment, and even this can be forgiven when you are dealing with such an epic scope.The story is so well crafted that you involve yourself in it deeply. Guessing what he's getting at and constanly being proven wrong or at leaste catching an unexpected twist. I highly , highly recomend these books to anyone with even a passing intrest in the realm of fantasy, and to anyone else who wants an engrossing read. Let the man craft the story as he will, I for one hope it runs another ten volumes."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After Crown of Swords I resolved not to buy anymore books in this series. Jordan's first few books in this series seemed to be going somewhere but then I realized he was just writing a soap opera: no plot, no action, no momentum; just endless scenes of pointless bickering, traveling, and whining, with a tiny bit of action thrown in at the end of each book.I decided that if the next one(Winter's Heart) was the LAST book in the series and he FINALLY wrapped it up I would buy the last two but low and behold I read the sleeve description that said: Rand continues his journey, Elaida continues, continues, continues... on and on it goes. That's it. I'm NEVER reading this series again!! Ten years is ridiculous."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book was one of the best of the series. Plot lines were wraped up and new ones opened. Winter's Heart really finished strong, leaving me on edge for the next book. I hope Mr. Jordon doesn't give in to everyone and hurry's the series. (Just don't die on us)For all you 1 star, no attention span babies go back to the &quot;Cat in the Hat&quot;.Every book doesn't have to have good guy kills bad guy, Small army defeats Large army blah blah...

Then he started milking the series for all its worth. As one of my friends would say, &quot;After the 4th book in the series he started describing useless things. He would spend 4 or 5 pages describing some guy's horse and then you never hear about the guy or the horse ever again.&quot;I do like Robert Jordan's style of writting. His characters are rich, vivid, and realistic. If you get sucked into the Wheel of Time books, then it is hard to not finish them. However, save yourself some time and money and don't get hooked."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This series is an extremely indepth one, with exceptional descriptions about characters, places and cultures. It develops characters, plot and history to a wonderful degree and takes you on a vastly enjoyable epic adventure.All of these books have some slow times, most books do, so persevere and it will be worth it in the end.This last book was as good as the rest, and is a wonderful tale with high adventure, good plot twists, and a great slate of characters. It is definitely worth reading. The whole series is."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"\\"'It will begin soon, I fear' Cadsuane announced. Turning away from the seated pair, the gray-haired sister planted her hands on her hips and swept a piercing gaze across the hilltop.\\"Winter's Heart by Robert Jordan is a fantastic thriller. This book continues the journey of Rand Al'thor around the world preparing for the Last Battle. As the Dragon Reborn, he (Rand) can channel Saidin (special powers). Unfortunately the effects of using the Saidin can cause madness and Rand is starting to feel the effects.This book is a difficult read because Robert Jordan creates many words of his own. This book refers back to the happenings in the previous 8 books in the Wheel of Time Series. It would be wise to read this series in order starting with the Eye of the World (Book 1)and I suggest you read the Prelude (Early Spring)also. I really enjoyed this book because it is suspenseful. I highly recommend it to those who like fantasy books with descriptive texts and are up to a challenge."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan has the knack to keep you anticipating the novels. I would rate the series higher if the publisher would publish the novels sooner rather than keeping us waiting for so long. This one is one of the better books (comparable to the first 2 or 3)."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan just keeps getting better and better.Winter's Heart can be described as the prequel to Tarmon Gai'don - the last battle of the Age, if not the Wheel itself. It may be the ninth book in the series, but the characters are just now assuming their positions for what is coming and the reader can feel the urgency between the lines. Jordan is making good use of his RAFO ploy to keep readers coming back for more. So many threads, so many plots begin to converge the reader can almost see Jordan setting everything in place to begin what it has all been about: will Light conquer Darkness?Winter's Heart is well written and is full of intrigue. Narrow escapes, assassination attempts, humorous dialogue and mindnumbing love all play a part in this novel. With all of the characters battling their own troubles in Winter's Heart will they be ready for what is coming?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"&quot;Winter's Heart&quot; significantly ties up such questions as the identities of Osan'gar, Aran'gar, Moridin and Cyndane and climaxes with the fate of the Ashaman and the Taint. It probably has the most significant plot developments that we've been waiting years for.Honestly, I don't know why the reviews posted before this decided to knock &quot;Winter's Heart.&quot; If you didn't enjoy Jordan's books since book 4 (which came out in 1993!) then why are you still reading them 8 years later? If you don't have the patience for this series then you shouldn't even be reading it. The man has created a great fantasy universe that doesn't resort to the cliched elf/dwarf/wizard stereotypes that STILL run rampant throughout the fantasy genre. If you are content with that method of storytelling then I recommend that you turn to Anne McCaffrey and her dragons and princesses and leave Jordan alone."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have just finished Jordan's 9th book. It was everthing I had expected it to be. Adventure, mystery, cheesy teenage love, and total frustration that I have to wait another two years for the tenth book to come out. While this book was better then some of the other later ones, it still was lacking in some subjects, namely Perrin. Once again, Jordan devotes only a few chapters to the most interesting one of the bunch (in my opinion). I am hoping that the tenth book will finish the series, so we can all get some closure. If you are keeping up with the series, read it. Otherwise wait until the final book comes out, and read the entire series without the two year breaks."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Despite a lot of negative comments, what you get is generally good. We finally see a use for Rand teaching his Asha'man the sword as he fights the intiguing battle against the renegades, and in the end Padan Fain. I had almost forgot there are places you cannot channel in. Winters Heart just turned out to have good content but not the content we expected. Is no one surprised at how many women who are popping up with an even greater strength than Nynaeve. We had always been made to believe that Nynaeve was the most powerful woman except for the forsaken, and now we have met a Seanchan Damane who has more power even than Lanfear did! I think she will be the one to use the two great sa'angreal in the Last Battle, and that would explain why she will help him die (my theory). And doesnt anyone find it worrying that the female Choeden Kal (right spelling?) was destroyed in the healing of the taint. Elayne having excellent skill (for the time) in ter'angreal making will probably have to be the one to rebuild it, and maybe that explains Elaida's Foretelling about The House of Andor being the key to the last battle. So in fact a lot of questions are being answered and Robert Jordan is slowly weaving towards the Last Battle. What I didnt like was we did not get enough of Perrin, and after all the vaunted promises of a great battle between the rebels and The White Tower, we got zilch! Still the coming of The Daughter of the Nine Moons and the excellent ending more than makes up for this. So if your bored of the series quit your complaining and stop reading, but if you enjoy it than persevere and you will be rewarded!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Since book 5, Jordan has been losing touch with his story and more importantly, his characters. Also, his writing seems to be getting worse. It's choppy and seems so drag on and on in some cases. I wish he would stop making his characters complain all the time and create some real dialog. If it wasn't for the last 50 pages, this book would have been a waste.A better series is the &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; by Terry Goodkind. The writing and the plot far exceeds Jordan's."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I had been waiting a long time for this book. I admit to being completely enthralled by the entire series and this book was not enought to satisfy my appetite for Jordan's creation. This new book did not have the character details that I feel have been bogging down the plot for the last two books. When you reach the ninth book in a series, it is safe to assume that most of those who will be reading have read enough of the other books to know what is happening and who is who. The book really pushed the pace of the plot throughout and I found it much more fulfilling than the last two. I didn't want the book to end."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winters Heart had just what the series needed, the beginning of the long trip down to the end of the road. Some questions answered along the way. And most of all some direct action taken against the bad guy(s). I dont want to give anything away but the book is great As most Jordan readers know, he kind of got things dragging a bit with the last few books, but Winters Heart definately gets things moving again and with the events at the end of the book things should really get moving in the next book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I just don't understand all the angry rants directed at the latter books of this series! I read the same complaints over and over - &quot;It's too complex,&quot; &quot;There are too many characters,&quot; &quot;There are too many subplots.&quot; I am amused by these comments, since they *are* some of the defining characteristics of an EPIC story!Perhaps I'm just different - I *very* rarely dislike a movie or a book. I believe this is because I don't make (what I perceive to be) the mistake that most people make: I allow the storyteller to tell his or her story while I observe it, and I keep myself open to being entertained. Unfortunately, most people develop, within the first several scenes or the first couple chapters, a picture of what *they* desire in the story. As the author or director diverges from that idea, the person becomes less and less entertained. It's silly.Bottom line: understand that you are not the author - you are the audience. Consequently, if you don't enjoy what the genre offers, read something else. The suggestion by a previous reviewer that Jordan write each book as a stand-alone volume is a suggestion made out of ignorance; if you need small doses spoon-fed to you so you can digest easier, then perhaps you might find the style used in the Harry Potter series more palatable.Leave epic fantasy to more mature and more disciplined readers who have an appreciation for the genre."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've read many complaints from readers who have lost interest in the series because of the previous couple of books (and i agree with them), but Winter's Heart takes the series out of its slump and rises to the standards of Eye of the World and the other first books. The book has a longer climax because a large event takes place both in Mat's and Rand's life which leaves you with less repetitive pages in the beginning and more excitement at the book's end. Unfortunately, judging by the ending in this book there will be at least two more books in the series, probably three, which means a few years of waiting for the grand finale."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I think the first three or so were pretty good. I got sucked in and kept reading, waiting, hoping for some closure. There does not appear to be any in sight. I've even forgotten some of the connections between characters. I discovered that I really don't care what happens to Rand anymore. I feel like the storyline is slowly grinding to a halt. I can't sit around and wait for &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; Book XXVII, &quot;Sleep falls&quot;.But there is hope! I was recommended the &quot;Sword of Truth&quot; novels by Terry Goodkind.

I hope this is a trend that keeps on going!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I don't understand what people are complaining about. There is no way you can tell me that nothing happened in this book. Rand finally removed the taint from the one power for goodness sakes!!

I read the book all day and night til the break of dawn. I did't even know it was dawn until I finished the book. The only bad thing I can say is that I have to wait(who knows how long) for the next book to come out. Winter's Heart reveled some of the plots that were on going, but opened the door to many more plots.

This book, like the rest in the series, was magnificent. It was written with great care and detail. This, however, is not for everyone. The younger crowd will have a very hard time with this series. I say this because, at least in my experience, kids need to have the constant flashing lights, the explosions around every corner, a few witty dialogues, and a happily ever after. This is a book, not an action movie. If your interest is to be blown away with intense fight scenes, blood and gore around every corner... go watch a movie. If you would like to be drawn in to a world that sings to the soul, this might be the type of series for you. If you have a hard time savoring the fine wine, and are simply looking for a quick and easy way to get drunk, this is not the series for you. Take your time, relax, curl up with a book filled with inventive characters and vivid details. This series is worth the effort."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is one of the best series I have read.

Unfortunately, it repeats the primary flaw of The Path of Daggers--too much of a (relatively) short book is given over to less interesting and important plot threads. The prologue through chapter 10 (10 of 35 chapters) are devoted the Perrin and Elayne's storylines, two of the least interesting and relevant storylines of the series. Almost a quarter of the book is from Elayne's perspective, grossly too much.One of Jordan's failings as a writer is a tendency towards a belief that more is always more, and that tends to show in Winter's Heart (and in the latter books in general) than in most of the series (both Tylin's relationship with Mat and Far Madding being good examples, as well as the introduction of Alivia and Talaan).Winter's Heart, in contrast to the books both immediately preceding and following it, does ends with a (triple-headed) climax of immense importance to the larger story. Unfortunately the climax still lacks in immediate punch in comparison to those of most of the other books in the series.Supergirls \`It's a Trap!' Counter: Winter's Heart-1, total-7"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After nine books so far in the series, I'm still not growing tired. This book shows the entertaining style of writing and very good structure of the previous books of the series. Winter's heart does not contain as much action as many of the previous books, instead \\"building up to\\" the next novels. Some people eventually grow tired of this series, but I do not find that the case."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"In Winter's Heart, the ninth installment of Robert Jordan's epic series, the author learned the lesson from his previous entry (The Path of Daggers) by having one of the myriad of character arcs from the beginning of the book develop over it's course so as to reach a conclusion at the end of the book. This dominating character arc was the series' primary protagonist, Rand al'Thor aka The Dragon Reborn, who's dual goal was to kill those who had attempted to take his life at the end of the previous volume and to cleanse the male half of The Power from the Dark One's taint. The other strong point of Winter's Heart is the return of Mat after being missed in the previous book, like what happened to Perrin in The Fires of Heaven. Elayne and Perrin's arcs continue as well, though they are tertiary in the grand scheme of this book especially as Perrin's is partial seen through the eyes of his wife, Faile.Jordan's return to having a dominating story arc that gives the book a beginning, middle, and end is big improvement over The Path of Daggers. However, of all the story arcs given space in this volume only Rand and Mat's seem to have traction throughout. Elayne's arc is broken up into several portions through the book while Perrin is gone after the first third of the book. It seems that in correcting the problem Jordan had in The Path of Daggers, he messed up the transitions from story arc to story arc that were a plus from The Path of Daggers.Whatever the flaws, the last 34 pages of Winter's Heart can make up from some of them. The last chapter, With the Choedan Kal, is one of the best (but not the best) that I've read in the series so far and by far the best since Book 5, The Fires of Heaven. Overall if I could give Winter's Heart a 3 1/2 stars I would, however unlike The Path of Daggers in which I rounded down to a 3, but for the ninth installment I'm giving a 4."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Sometimes I think Robert Jordan got paid by the word. Winter's Heart is so overwritten and has page after page and chapter after chapter of content that does nothing to move the story forward. If you cut the novel in half, it would still be too long for what actually transpired. Nothing of real consequence actually happens until about the last 20 pages, which is unacceptable for a 600 hundred plus page novel.There are other issues with the novel, namely the unwieldy cast of characters that are impossible to keep track of. Basically there are maybe about twenty characters in the series who matter, and about 500 hundred minor characters. There's just no need to have that large of a cast. As a reader, I don't have any interest in following that many characters, and it only serves to water down the characters who do matter.As for the content of the story, Perrin appears in the very opening of the book and is never heard from again. This is an example of a major character who has been marginalized in favor of the thousands of characters who follow in the book. The storyline with Mat, which dominated a large portion of the book was uninteresting and seemed to go nowhere. The Rand storyline, other than the last twenty or so pages, also seemed fairly inconsequential.The bottom line is that Robert Jordan had lost his way at this point. I have been told to stick with the series because it gets better. I suppose I have invested too much to drop it, but picking up book number 10 will is about as appealing as a dentist visit right now.Carl Alves - author of Blood Street"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Subpar book in the Series, But more importantly it appears that The WOT are no longer available on the KINDLE for USA Amazon Kindle Users and that is disappointing because I have been re-reading all WOT books on my Kindle Fire.

We get back to Mat and he meets the daughter of the nine moons. We discover a lot more information about who, what, when, where, and whyThe minus: local politics and the Seanchan seemed to dominate a large portion of the book.I think that it would be great to head back in the direction of Trollocs, Myrrdhral, dark hounds, and Drakkhars.

Then again, I don't like Perin much. I have always dreaded reading about him and Faile, but this books did a good job of making both of them characters I could like again. There was some of everyone in this book, something I have missed. (Though Egewene was almost a side note.)This book got over the plodding plot advancement that Jordan apparently needed to make to fit all the pieces together for this book. It was, though a bit tedious, worth the wait.There were things in this book which were finally resolved and it was wonderful. I was surprised by many of the things that occured and pleasantly at that. The last four chapters of this book were amazing. I would read then entire thing over just for those four chapters.I don't care if he finishees it in the thirteen he's predicted (yes folks, his estimate is thirteen or was a year ago) that's great, but I really wouldn't mind it going on.

I faithfully slogged through the previous 8 overlong volumes, but I have finally had my fill.We could've gotten to this point in the story after 4-5 books, it certainly doesn't merit 9. Way too long, overly detailed, extreme lack of anything happening for at least a book or two. Was an editor assigned to this series, or does whatever he churns out make it into the final print?I particularly dread the sequences with the &quot;Forsaken&quot;. Does anyone find these at all interesting or compelling?Another point-if you're going to have a series with about 5000 characters, please put a complete character index in each volume. I grew tired of reading a 30 page chapter on some character that hadn't appeared in the series for 5 volumes and not having the faintest idea of who exactly they were, and why I was supposed to care about them. Jeez."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"There is no doubt that Robert Jordan is a talented writer in many ways. He is very adept at word building and character description, but at this point I feel that his series has stalled. Given the length of the book I was left feeling that very little of any substance happened.Winter's Heart continues to add detail and depth to the characters in the series. I really enjoy the rich cultures and their varying customs. Anybody who writes creatively or plays RPGs would certainly find some inspiration from the WoT setting.In my opinion there are just too many different threads to the story at this point. They add detail and explore the many rich settings of the world Jordan has created, but they have also caused the series to bog down. I don't think its worth 25 pages just to set up a few small details that will be important later (which is what I get the feeling was going on at times). This problem, which has existed through much of the series, seems to be especially serious in Winter's Heart. Those who feel this is a strength, and who have liked the direction the series has taken will be pleased with book 9.I think those of us who are this far into the series will want to continue on, but at this point I'm telling people not to start the series in the first place because I just don't feel there are enough quality scenes given the length of the books. I don't feel that the recent books have been fulfilling the promise made by the earlier ones. Its important that people who are thinking about starting the series take this into consideration."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The book's content has, I believe been sufficiently reviewed by now. As for the readers, I want to say that they are excellent. The male reads all the parts of the book told from a male perspective (which in this book, is sadly not the majority), and the female in turn reads the parts written from a female perspective. Though I found the male to be the stronger reader of the two, I absolutely recommend this recording, even to those of you who consider yourself very picky book listeners--this is a great choice!

To anyone who has read the series to this point, here's a tip; skip the first half, it will all be repeated either in the second half, or surely his next book!Personally, I'm done with WoT until the final book is published.

The complication with Faile and Perrin, even while interesting, ultimately detracts from the flow of the story that has been established over the previous eight books.From reading this book, you don't get the feeling that the series is drawing to a conclusion, which after almost 7,000 pages is sorely needed for te sake of all our sanities."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok unlike a lot of Robert Jordan fans out there I thought this book was wonderful. Rand finally cleanses the male side of the power. Mat finds the Daughter of the Nine Moons. I thought I'd never get this far into the series. I must confess that I thought the first two books in this series were long and tedious and well to be frank . . . very boring. But about halfway through the third book it just clicked. And while it took me almost 6 months to read the first two books I scooted through the the other 6 in no time. I like the way the series plays out. I hope that it doesn't end.

I LIKED the continuity in characters' behavior and thought patterns. I've come to KNOW each of them. Each individual in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series is extraordinarily well-developed, even minor characters. That has always impressed me in this series. I know of very few comparable books in the realm of character development....[M]y sole disappointment with Mr. Jordan's books has been at the last page of each new book - I don't want to quit reading.Jordan is a &quot;reader's writer&quot;. I admit I look forward to knowing the conclusion, yet I could read about these character's lives 'until they nail my coffin shut'. Unable to avoid the delay between his books, I've simply read each of them five times.I am writing this review in a visit to Amazon.com because of their excellent feature for placing an order for a book soon to be published. I was, of course, hoping to find volume ten of the Wheel Of Time ready for placing a pre-order. I'll have to check again soon. Meanwhile, I'll enjoy reading all nine volumes a sixth time. I encourage Mr. Jordan to start another series (equally as long) about the next cycle of the Wheel as soon as he gets to the end of this one. And I support him in writing volumes for this series until he reaches the conclusion in his own good time."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This may be my loyalism to the series talking, but I found this book entertaining and satisfying, especially the ending. Things mentioned briefly in other books are wrapped up in this book (or at least moved quickly along the plot line) and previous mysteries about certain things are cleared up. This book may not be the kind of book for somebody in need of instant gratification (Hero get's girl, hero kills bad guy, hero conquers world blah blah blah) like many of the other reviewers, but it is important to the series and if you would like to keep up with the world of WOT, don't kid yourself. Buy this book, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I picked up my first fantasy book while waiting for my flight. I read Robert Jordan's Conan book during the flight, and throughout the night upon arriving home. Simply put, Mr. Jordan weaves a tale that is impossible to put down. After reading all the rest of his Conan books, I had hoped that there were other Conan books up his sleeve. To my surprise, he was working on another series called the Wheel of Time. I scoffed at his abandonment of such a wonderful character and went on to other authors for a time. Book after book, I was disappointed with the quality of the other authors. Some were better than others, but none were the same caliber as Mr. Jordan. It was then that I gave his Wheel of Time a try. From the first book, he had me hooked. I've enjoyed every plot and character. A good book can usually bring a smile to my face, but Jordan's humor had me laughing out loud at times. While some books in the series have been better than others, they've all been very enjoyable and been the cause of many late night readings. Now we come to his 9th eagerly awaited book. Winter's Heart was a treasure and a let down at the same time. A major conflict that has plagued our hero from the beginning has been resolved, and it's interesting to see how this will effect the entire world. The disappointment is that the book does seem a bit rushed. Though some of the sideplots are thankfully given attention, they end right when you begin to become interested. While I wish he could have included more of the sideplots or left them out completely, I do feel that whatever happens, it is worth the wait. I have faith that his coming books will be as good, or better. I'm here for the ride."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I found out the secret to Mr. Jordans books, there is no end, that is why it is the Wheel of Time epic, saga, poem, story, and whatever else you want to call it. It will only be over when this man is forced to end it by his death, God forbid, or the publisher says no more money. If Mr. Jordan wants to keep this world and actors that he has created, then just let each one have there own series and then we could read the ones we like. I thought when I started this series that 8 books was a little long, however I held out hope and have read and tried to keep up with all of these. But after this book, the last 2 chapters were all that were of interest and that is a waste. If Mr. Jordan would finish this series and use it as springboard for other charcters in his story, that would be fine, but to keep us stringing along with a morsel here and morsel there seems a bit much. I hope that Mr. Jordan and the publisher read this and heed, as I am sure I am not the only one dissappointed."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"We are conditioned for instant gratification in this world, especially in the United States. I can see why people get frustrated with Robert Jordan with this series because he forces us to be patient. After reading 75% of Winter's Heart I found myself wishing that more had happened. I decided to change my attitude once I finished the book, however. I was reminded of how some people are always anxious for some future event to happen (can't wait to graduate high school, or college, or whatever). You end up wishing your life away with that attitude. So I choose to take a different approach to this series. If Jordan had been more brief, the series would be over by now and there would be nothing left to look forward to. I started this series when I was 23 years old, and I'll still be captivated by it when I am 36 - 38 years old. What other form of entertainment could capture your attention for that many years?

Who knows? You may enjoy greater success than Mr. Jordan; the world will never know unless you try.Winter's Heart is, undoubtedly, the most powerful and inspired book of the series to date. The ties to stories told in even the first book, Eye of the World, serve to raise the level of excitement and understanding to a totally new and rewarding dimension. Each and every one of the 10 books is satisfying and gratifying in its own way; each is powerful by itself for reasons that differ from those of each counterpart in the series.This installment brings culmination to several sub-plots. Key characters are (re-)united in surprising ways, and done so in a way that, I believe, exceeds expectations. The characterizations and cultures are richly embellished - one can see, feel, even believe and immerse in the integrity (or lack of) every single person in the tale.The man is deft at exploring facets of ego, personality and emotion - sense of: pride, love, scorn, hurt, avarice, greed, compulsion, anger, bliss, pettiness, identity, judgement, righteous indignation, will, stubbornness, alacrity, submission, responsibility, shame, ambition, humor, sadness, grief, well-being, dignity, grace... Too numerous to mention. My enjoyment of the book, and the others before it, is forged on the anvil of relatedness - I can believe in the characters, their successes or failures, greatness or short-comings, because the tale is told in a way that strikes nerves. THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is the mark of a master wordsmith.Think what you like, folks. In my opinion, this book represents world-class story-telling of unrivaled proportions. Tolkein, Brooks, Saberhagen, Modesitt, McAfferty, Anthony, Eddings, Goodkind, and a host of others hold a position on the Board of Directors, but Jordan is the Chairman of the Board.."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan continues to expand, expand, expand. I think that these books could use a little shortening.I mean, come on, the only thing Rand does is chase after some renegade Asha'man except in the final 20 pages. These people showed up for what purpose? The important thing is compressed into 20 pages and the rest of the book is endless detail.I still enjoy the books though. They create an entire world. And I mean entire. It is nice to experience every place on the map, but could we do it without the Shaido? And how many books has it been since Salidar? Can't we just topple Elaida already? We don't need drivel about ten million Aes Sedai stealing the oath rod, getting captured, standing around for a month, etc. And have you noticed that there is an Aes Sedai in almost every scene?Plus, the whole series can do without THE ... ATHA'AN MIERE. They are completely pointless. Why do they always seem to walk right over every main and subcharacter? These people are supposed to be the ones having everyone bow to them, yet some ugly, pierced, smelly fishermen boss them ALL around no matter what.Now, Forsaken. I was very caught up with the way Jordan intruduced these servants of the Dark One. It seemed like about one died every novel. That's a good idea, don't you think? It helps tie all the novels together. But noooooooo, we have to have 4 or so get reincarnated. And how many times can Moghedien get away? Cyndane is obviously Lanfear, as illustrated by the final scene of Winter's Heart. At least one of them got killed in that scene (by a Darkfriend, no less! lol), but I think more should have died, what with all those angreal, ter'angreal, and linked Aes Sedai & Asha'man running around. Now we have eight, is it? when it could be four, argh! What was with that black dome, was that the shield that Cadsuane wove or the taint or soemthing else?Mat. He has accomplished almost nothing. He got that dagger, slowing everything down. Then, he almost got hanged in the waste. He is supposed to fight and capture Illian. But, of course, Mat sits around for a book or two, then Rand hops in and does it himself. Mat gets thrown of on a tangent and ends up in Ebou Dar for several books, or so it seems. The scenes with Tylin were simply INSANE. Finally, he's leaving, but with yet another side character to slow down the books.Perrin. I used to think he would be the best. I mean, anyonew who can talk to wolves has gotta be cool and do stuff, right? Wrong. The only major accomplishment of his was saving the Two Rivers from a bunch of Trollocs. Now, all of the scenes with Perrin are all about Faile, or something to do with her. I'm getting tired of Perrin saying something to her and having \\"her smell be angry and irritated\\" because he doesn't yell at her.The borderland army only spells more deviation from the plot. More importantly, Rand has a grand total of 2, count em, 2 nations directly under his control. The 4 borderlands may be added to that, possibly by book 12 (a.k.a. two months their time). Carhien and Andor are hopefully going to be under Elayne's rule eventually, so that may be a few more. Unfourtunately, he has yet to try at Murandy, Altara, Armadacia, Ghealdon, Tarabon, or Arad Doman. He won a battle in some nothing country, but never followed it up.And speaking of Tear and Illian. What's with all the rebellions? Luckily, we haven't spent to much time of those. Also, what happened to his grand army that he assembled to take Illian? Somewhat thankfully, that plotline was cut short, sprouting afew more though.Enough with the snow! We realize there is a lot of it, everyone doesn't have to mention that they're cold every ten words. And what happened to the Dark One? There aren't any Trollocs, the heat wave is gone, and the taint too! Jordan seems to have forgotten to include him in this lasst book. How many times do we have to hear \\"the blight is quieter than ever\\"?Sorry folks, but I'm all out of time. Thanks for reading, and be sure to at least borrow the Wheel of Time series from the library. It really is a great read, despite what I've said. Hopefully, the concluding books will wrap up everything magnificently. You can only make so many filler books. Perhaps we'll get \\"Book #13: The Last Battle\\" or, more realistically, \\"Book #23: The Last Battle, part 1. Trolloc fashion\\"."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The latest installment in the Wheel of Time books continued the groggy slog of the previous couple. Robert Jordan's ability to create a world is unsurpassed. So to it appears is his inability with resolution. Without having read the previous volumes one is lost, and may be lost even with them due to the hundreds of characters, dozens of plot twists, various lands, customs, sects, military units, intrigues, and romantic couplings. At the end of Winter's Heart there IS one thing resolved, but given all the other things that pop up it's hard to see how RJ is going to finish this series and/or the major plot elements in less than another 5-6 books. At the current rate that's another 10 years or so. My advice: Wait until the series is complete (if ever, remember he wants to write until they nail shut his coffin) and read the books continuously end-to-end. This is the only way the reader has any chance to keep any semblance of understanding what's going on. I don't even think the author can."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Finally, stuff actually happens with the plot. I'm sure Jordan is paid by the word, hence the increasing size of his books, but I was pretty close to quitting this series with the last book. Winter's Heart was the last chance I was going to give Jordan, and he managed to drag me back in to the fold. Now, if only he can follow it up with even more plot closure in the next book, maybe we can wrap this series up in the next few. There are other stories to be told in this world, or the next, and it's time to spin that damn slow wheel of time so we can get there."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok, we have this series getting less creative and more bloated. So far, we are on book 9 and I have to say this is starting to drive me nuts since I want to find out the ending....... Also, he needs to work on these things in the story1) These girls are a bunch of freaking twirps who won't just freaking grow up. And another thing, all the girls in the book have red hair. TRY BLACK2) There are about three or four metaphors this author uses way too much. He will constatly say &quot;his face looked like it could have bored rocks&quot; or something about eyes like ice. Don't people ever have WARM EYES? or and expresionalful face?3) If this Rand guy is some freaking Messiah or something why does he waste all his time with these stupid girls. He needs to be ruling the world"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"My husband and I are avid fantasy readers, and our favorite authors have to be George Martin, and Robert Jordan. I just finished Winter's Heart, and it was awesome. Where as the last two books dragged on (because they were setting up what was to come), this was his action book. It seems to me that Jordan's style seems to be changing. He was not as long winded as he usually is. I cannot wait for the next book in this series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The Winter's Heart continues as the author began, long on discription and character development. In the process, he is tapping into our millenial doubts; the same which have caused the Left Behind series to be so popular. All the bad guys, the Forsaken, bear names given to Satan or other demons in ancient Isreal. The good guys struggle both within themselves and without to understand the Creator's purpose in allowing evil. The mythological underpinnings are varied. From the ancient Norse, Celtic, and possibly Native American, through the Arthurian tradition, and finally to the modern myth-makers of sci-fi/fantasy Herbert, Asimov, and Tolkien, Jordan begs, borrows, and steals with a fine hand. He has also created something very new, an odessy as symbolically revealing of our time as Homer's was of his. The hero is right for our age. This is not a drive-by series.I will admit to being frustrated by the author's pace. It has become a barrier to enjoyment. I do hope Tor takes notice of all the negative reviews, but I also applaud the author for continuing as he began and not slapping together an ending that leaves the tapestry full of holes."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Among the myriad rants I've seen aimed at Heart and at WoT in general, one caught my eye, calling the characters &quot;spoiled brats&quot; or some such. It, as did many others, said that the characters also never learn. Personally, I think that this is fully in keeping with Jordan's project...Jordan, whether or not you agree with his process, is creating an entire WORLD; the complexity and sheer perversity of OUR world should more than equip readers to cope with a fully-realized fictional world. Furthermore, look around you at the people you know, even the people you like and respect. How many of them change their mannerisms significantly in a few years? How many of them truly LEARN from setbacks, instead of stubbornly trying to force ahead in their chosen way? Pride, whether consciously admitted or subconsciously hidden, plays a huge role in the &quot;plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose&quot; lack of real change in our world, and Jordan is doing nothing more than recreating this in the characters of his own world.In general, I was still mildly disappointed with Heart. I expected much more tying-together of storylines - rather, I HOPED for it. Nonetheless, it occurs to me that this, too, is much like real life; how much is truly brought to a quick, tidy, satisfactory solution? Be that as it may, I saw some very interesting progress and look forward to the next few books.Have some patience and insight, folks."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As a longtime cheerleader for Robert Jordan, I found Winter's Heart fairly enjoyable, on the surface. After talking with numerous other readers, and analyzing the sum of the entire series to date, I was forced to acknowledge several oft-voiced complaints about the past few books. Compressing Books 6 and 7, and Books 8 and 9, into 2 separate megavolumes on the order of The Fires of Heaven would have solved many of the problems many readers have seen. The last 4 books have been less enjoyable than the first 5, and this compression would have alleviated that.Despite this, the cries that the Wheel of Time, and Robert Jordan himself, are no longer capable of turning out quality fantasy are pure garbage. After numerous re-reads, I can confidently say that, although the books in the last half of the series have difficulty standing on their own, they play their role in adding to the glittering story held up by the first 5. Yes, Jordan is having some problems, writing the middle and late-middle parts of the story. The excellent descriptive style he found so successful early on is becoming somewhat less so, and the world he has created is no longer shiny and new.Nevertheless, the story is moving forward. In Winter's Heart, Jordan's style gives some evidence that the series is moving toward a conclusion. Numerous long-standing mysteries (ie. Dashiva = Osan'gar?; Taim = Demandred?) are decisively concluded. It seems unlikely Rand will be able to avoid Cadsuane and his vital &quot;de-icing&quot; for another book; this is one of the critical steps necessary before he can be successful at Tarmon Gai'don. Additionally, I found some hope that Jordan is beginning to move past his classic character stereotypes. Specifically, it struck me that Nynaeve seemed less obscenely stubborn than usual, and generally move pleasant to be around. Admittedly, there is progress to be made here (ie. Perrin and Berelain).In summary, I'm thinking 13 may be the magic number. Readers who have grown tired from the long pauses between the past few books may abandon the series if they wish, but unless Jordan's early performance was one of the great flukes of history, I think that he will return to form, and those readers may miss the finale of one the greatest fantasy epics ever."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I just finished Winter's Heart and I have to say that aside from the end of the book I am not too impressed. It seems since A Crown of Swords Robert Jordan has developed a formula: short books with minimal plot development. There are so many storylines that he only addresses once every other book that it makes the waiting between installments seem like wasted time. I would prefer to wait a couple more years and get a big honking whopper of a novel instead of these 600 page snippits. I am beginning to lose faith..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First of fans won't be disappointed. This was a good book. But its becoming obvious that Jordan is needlessly perpetuating the series. I mean, cmon, RJ just get it over with already. I feel fortunate that I didn't start reading this series until book six came out. As such I've only been waiting for ending now for about six years. At the rate you going I'll be in a rest home and you'll probably be dead before you finish. If your not going to pick up the pace of writing the books then do us a favor and finish the series already. Your making it hard to pick up new fans because how many are not going to be daunted at having to read 5000 pages just to get caught up and your annoying long time fans by making us wait for years between volumes."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"There was a time when I was in love with the Wot series. Unfortunately, I have gradually fallen OUT of it. In my opinion, when reading a book starts to feel like studying for a history final.. it's time to put it down. What happened to this series? It reminds me of an aging horse. There's a time when you just have to put it out of it's misery. If only Rand would go insane and kill all of the females the book would improve dramatically. But honestly, what people claim is rich storytelling is actually a bunch of BORING RUBBISH. I read to enjoy myself, not to fall asleep 10 minutes after cracking the book. Am I the only one who SKIPS PAGES when the focus of the story turns to the women? If Jordan skips all the useless female chit-chat he can wrap this series up in two books EASY. I say have Rand kill EVERYBODY, then kill himself and be done with it!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've been disappointed with the last four books in this series. Winter's Heart kept the streak going. The last one I enjoyed was #4, The Shadow Rising. Books 1-4 provided the reader with a genuinly enjoyable complete story.Winter's Heart was 600+ pages of fluff. As book 8 ended, Perrin's wife had been kidnapped. In book 9, we get as far as Perrin breaking camp and starting to give chase. Book 8 had Matt trapped in Ebou Dar, Book 9 ends with his plan for escape just starting. Rand is 100 or so pages of weak writing, ending with a boring &quot;climax&quot;.Thinking about it, Jordan has always spent allot of time on fluff. He has gone to great lengths to give background information, in some cases simply reprinting paraphrased sections of earlier books. I never really minded it because he still told a good complete story. Winter's Heart went to the extreme, it was almost all fluff (designed to fill pages)and no story. It could have been salvaged had he provided and extra 200 - 300 pages to complete the significant subplots started in book 8. Without the pages required for a certain amount of closure, it was the equivalent of a high school student rambling on so he could fill the 10 pages required for a minimum passing grade.For whatever reason, Jordan no longer bothers to tell a complete story. He has taken to adding countless minor subplots, spending significant time on background filler, or foolish twists (like renaming villains). These detract from what started as a great seriesYears back, one of the best books I read was the first book of L. Ron Hubbard's Mission Earth series. Book 2 was also good. 3 and 4 went down hill but I bought them because I expected what I had received in 1 and 2. I think I bought a couple more out of habit before I simply gave up on the series. Mr. Jordan has just about reached the same point where it's time to give up on him.Bottom line, Winter's Heart was a waste of time and money. The odds are I will wait until the series end (one can only hope that will come soon) before I bother, if I bother, with any future books"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"In truth it is the writer who has lost his heart. The plot drags on and on. Even the new civilizations Jordan is trying to create for Matt falls so short of the Aiel that its embaressing. In the first four books the readers could feel the characters, know their strengths and failings, see how they grow from boys to men and girls to women. In this book, not even Elayne getting laid did much to help the story along. She's become such an incidental character her story doesnt really matter and Jordan is so lost with all the other characters he has invented for the sake of plot, that if you never read this book, you wouldnt miss much from the series. Id wait until paperback comes out if you consider buying it. Where has the thrill of reading this story gone?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is the worst book in the Wheel Of Time series. Like the last three books nothing much happens. Not worth the time to read ."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I waited 2 1/2 years for this book, and it was worth it. Once more Robert Jordan has picked up the pace of action as several plot threads are resolved and the final battle between good and evil draws closer. Per usual, RJ juggles four plot lines in simultaneous time. I found 2 very interesting; one plot thread concerning Elayne was less interesting, but it had one very good and surprising scene. The plot line concerning Perrin was good, but too short--here RJ did not advance the plot enough. The great story lines concerned Mat and Rand--both are nearly as good as the best in the series.I rate this book in the top three or four of the 9 book series. Only The Dragon Reborn and The Shadow Rising are clearly better. Read it and enjoy."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This series ground to an almost complete standstill 2 books ago, and this newest one is upholding that fine tradition. These 600+ page books seem to be written so as to draw this serious out as long as possible, dribbling just enough actual story at the end of each to rekindle your interest in the next one.I've lost any respect for Jordan as an author, this is shameless. Keep in mind that this series started over 10 years ago, it's actually LIKELY at this point that Jordan may die before finishing it. He'll have spent at least 13 years on it, making that just over 1/5 of the average human lifespan.(edit) Yep, he died before finishing it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The Wheel of Time is still turning! Frankly, I had my doubts through A Crown of Swords and The Path of Daggers (books seven and eight). The first three books, Eye of the World through the Dragon Reborn, were great. From there, things seemed to get off track and slow down to the point where I thought books seven and eight were a waste. But then, maybe I'm dense. With Winter's Heart, Jordan clearly advances the story line, and brings the series back up to the quality of Dragon Reborn and The Shadow Rising (books three and four). Admittedly, this book started slow. I was half way through before Jordan pulled himself out of the morass of details that had clogged seven and eight, but the logjam finally started to give. The ever-expanding cast of characters began to make more sense. The activity in this book became more engrossing, and the Final Battle is beginning to move into sight. I enjoyed Winter's Heart, and am tempted to go back and read the whole nine books over from the start. That's just the opposite as I felt after The Path of Daggers (book eight), so I can happily recommend this installment in the Wheel of Time series. I said the end is coming into sight, but don't expect to get close in the next couple of books. At this point, I would expect at least four more books for Jordan to bring all the threads together. Still, they say that patience is a virtue. It will have to be, while I wait eagerly for the next book, hopefully in just two years."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordans latetest book, has all of the plot problems the last two books showed up in a magnified form. Unlike his earlier works the plot seems forced at times, and I got the impression that Jordan doesn't really quite know where all of his characters are going. The deepest concern that I have is that much of the character devolopment seems to be slowing down or stoping. The characters are just somehow too predictable or too familiar. Maybe its just that I am getting older (I was fourteen when I started reading this series almost six years ago.) but the characters seem to be getting more juvenile every book. With the exeption of Rand none of the characters seemed to have learned anything more about themselves, since the series started.Compared to his earlier works this book seems as if it were quickly thrown together, and not well thought out. Jordan has started letting his character lead him around in circles when he should be letting the plot drag these characters along for the ride."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book is better than PoD (that's why I gave WH two stars instead of one). The writing is technically good (not elegant, but solid) and the plot limps along, but at least it limps, which is more than I can say for PoD. Some plot lines, esp. the one handled at the end of the book, are closed in a rather lame way, but some people might like it. My advice: buy the book if you are a die-hard fan (but wait, if you're a diehard, you already have it), but if you're not a fanatic, wait for the paperback."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Just lame : no progress in the plot, actually went backwards !!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As they used to say in those commercials---where's the beef. I have just finished reading all 9 volumes in sequence-not because they are good but because I am the kind of reader who for better or worse reads things to completion. So Mr. Jordan, you will still get my money for the remaining books in the series but not that you deserve them.The only thing this series has going for it is complex world building. But that alone cannot make good literature or fantasy. The quest theme has been done many times before. That is not a critique just a fact. But to make this a good series requires more than just plot outline. It requires developing characters who come alive. The characters here are just pasteboard, uni-dimensional being who engender no empathy. He brings characters in and out of the narrative using a deus ex machina that is frivolous. Actually the one character who does intrigue me is Moraine who has disappeared, and who knows whether he will revive her like Shakespeare brought back the &quot;fat knight&quot; in the Merry Wives to please Elizabeth I.Furthermore his writing style is at best puerile. He writes like someone who has just completed a creative writing segment in his junior year high school English class and only got a C+. For that matter it seems that his editors must have taken the same course and got a lower grade.If you want to see how the use of language can make characters, plot, and a world come alive, I urge any and all to read the Majipoor series by Robert Silverberg. Now there is a master!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"All you people out there who think this has been dragging on for too long, that the story is thinning out, and that Jordan just isn't up to it anymore: Perhaps you should for once remember that he has already spent 20 years of his life developing this story, that, rather miraculously, he still knows where he's going - and all that in spite of the more than dazzling complexity of the series.What's more, I really can't see that anyone here is a literary critic fit to give a fair account of what Jordan is doing wrong and where his story needs improving. Why can't they just say that that they can't follow or don't want to follow where Jordan's going? Fair enough. But please stop this self-congratulatory &quot;Jordan could have been a great writer, but...&quot;.Notwithstanding all the problems I have with this series, the sometimes all too post-puberty-crazed women prominently among them, the merits of Jordan's work are just too great to be thrown aside just because of a few hundred pages of a stagnant storyline. If you haven't noticed, for Jordan, the characters and their development obviously are just as important as the storyline.This series has come closer than anything else I know to real life in the way of the characters' development. It is the best whodunit I can think of. Its complexity has me standing in awe of what Jordan must have been juggling in his head for the last 20 years. The subtle problems he raises at every other turn of the story are a rich bounty for all who keep their eyes open and do not like their food for thought pre-digested. All of this means an intellectual feast I wouldn't want to miss. This series, I am sure, has never been meant for easy reading although it can spellbind you to think it was.Personally, I am grateful for this experience. Others will certainly not like the way the whole thing is developing. Again, fair enough.

Some confusion does arise when minor characters that haven't been seen in the last few books pop up, but there are plenty of resources on the internet to refresh your memory. A great series that everyone, regardless of their opinions of the &quot;Fantasy&quot; genre, should read."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Firstly, I must say that if you do not believe that an enthralling political center combined with terribly realistic characters in a novel can bring together a story line just as well as a simple, &quot;Let's go smite evil...again...&quot; story line, then do not read these books! These are not your run-of-the-mill fantasy novels; they are filled wih intrigue and subtle twists that leave you filled with wonder and tingling with anticipation for the next page. Of course, there is always the omnipresent life-or-death struggle between good and evil that should fulfill all of those adventure-lovers' desires out there. Oh, and that British summary is horribly inaccurate; please remove it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The opening of the book was traditional Robert Jordan and it took quite a while for the various plots to develop but develop they did.

And it's a satisfying one. I found this book exciting. No, the book doesn't resolve the many story lines that have been going on for so long. Does anyone expect that yet, with several more books to go? Still, it gives us a bit of closure, in a highly interesting way, on Rand's romantic life. It continues the story lines of almost every major character, and answers long-asked questions about several minor ones. And it does resolve, or apparently anyway, one major thread that goes back to the beginning of the series (and what a scene *that* was). I could complain about a couple of things that weren't included, but what *was* included was engrossing reading. I couldn't put the book down, I resented the time it took to eat and sleep while I was reading it, and I think that says it all."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"What can I say - Robert Jordan has been able to keep me captivated enough to read this series over and over.

Enough of my favorite plotlines have been touched to keep me interested, and the new stuff that is being introduced is keeping me on my seat. I am glad that the series keeps going on, because I know I am going to be entertained for years to come.

I began to fear thar RJ was headed down that path.With WH, my fears have been assuaged.Three words describe my impression of this book.Oh. My. God.I have never, and I repeat never, read such a well-written book as this. Never before have I sat for 12 hours straight just reading, with only a small half-hour break in the middle. Never before has every scene evoked an emotion in me, whether fear, excitement, amusement. WH pulled strings at all the right places.From beginning to end, WH draws you in like Eye of the World did, except more completely. Never a dull moment, I even found enjoyment in the chapters involving some of our least favorite characters.The thing that made people the angriest about PoD, the complete lack of plot lines being resolved, has been completely turned around in this book. There was one major, and I mean major, plot line resolved, another pretty big one, and tons of small ones.Theories were proven or disproven, and the entire book was a masterpiece of literature.Read this book.

One book will be fairly good, while the following book will be disappointing, and so on. Such is the case with \\"Winter's Heart\\". It was much better than its predecessor, \\"The Path of Daggers\\", and the action has once again picked up considerably.There are many sub-plots contained in this book. At the beginning, Faile is captured by the Shaido and Perrin sets off to find her, but abruptly, this storyline ends. I was disappointed with the way Robert Jordan handled this aspect of the book, because this had the makings of a very interesting part of the story. It was a shame that he let this part die, unless he plans to re-visit it in the next volume. Elayne is still waiting to claim the crown of Andor, and she, Min, and Aviendha have bonded Rand as their Warder. And, in perhaps the most exciting ending of any of the books so far, Rand finally changes the balance of power in his battle against the Dark One.I thought this book was a step up from book eight. Aside from his unexplained abandonment of the Perrin/Faile story, this book moves along at a fairly good pace. I especially liked the way Jordan developed the society of Far Madding, where channeling cannot take place. The final chapter is some of Jordan's best work so far, and the end of the book is very exciting. I hope that the momentum that has been created here will carry over into the next book, but I'm a little skeptical, as each good book in the series has usually been followed by a poor one. Hopefully, that pattern has finally been broken."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've been reading Jordan like a madman this year to catch up to his tenth book. This is the third book in the series I've finished this year. Things finally start to move in the second half of the book and it finishes with a major series altering development. Jordan sometimes seems to have created too many characters and subplots for anyone, including himself, to keep track of. &quot;Heart of Winter&quot; starts with Perrin and his party, but gives way to Matt and Rand, leaving you to wonder about Perrin after his temporary disappearance. I suppose this keeps you waiting to see what happens to him and his wife, but it can get frustrating not to get a clue as you finish the book.

I take my book every where I go and read it every chance I get!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I give this book four stars mainly b/c of the ending. In the final 30 pages the action picks up and I was riveted. The rest of the book followed the course set by the last 2 or 3 in the series, IE getting so bogged down in the hundreds (it feels like) of minor characters and subplots that the book becomes difficult to read.This series would be much better if Jordan used about 300 less pages a book, but I still think that it is well conceived and contrary to the opinions of the past two reviewers, well worth reading."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"one thing i've always had against fantasy stories, including this series is that they never seem to give the enemies more than a two dimensional characterization. this one attempts it rather well with the forsaken and some of the darkfriends, but trollocs are just fodder for rand's lightning strikes.but my own pet pieves aside, this story is rich and complex. this world that robert jordan has created is imaginative and innovative. it may seem like he is using some stereotypes from our own cultures throughout our world, but he's mixed it up well enough to be considered his own creation.the story will engross you, as it should and you will be caught up in the characters' drive for survival. enjoy it, and all nine books so far.this one gave me hope for his future books. now that rand did what he did, the tide will turn against the dark ones. great idea, robert."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"In a word its &quot;Awesome&quot;. Sure some of them say its becoming a drag but its not! 'They' only want action and only Rand, what Jordan creates successfully is a diversion and set up parallel stories to make sure that the reader sticks to the book till the last page. Most fans would love to see Rand in action (same here I'm afraid) but hey! its a person we are talking about here. Each character takes time to build and Rand is just one of those characters. It is a must read for any 'Wheel of Time' series fan! And guys, a piece of advise, LET JORDAN DO HIS WORK PROPERLY, he is an outstanding writer and he needs time for his magnificent creations. I hope he continues to write for as long as he wishes to."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan unfortunately has sold out and it seems is only interested in the money. Another boring book that is tiresome reading, i'd say about the last 30 pages were worth reading. Whats next 700 pages on how the sea folk build ships. Someone e-mail me when the last book comes out, maybe in about 20 years. I'd ask for Jordan to e-mail me but I couldn't handle 600 pages of boring e-mail."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book, although very well written, is easily not worth the 2 years we've had to wait. The plot progresses at an alarmingly slow rate and makes one wonder if Robert Jordan ever plans to finish the series. On the other hand, the adult content seems to progress at breakneck speed. After the first 500 pages of this book, Tarmon Gaidon still seemed as distant a battle as it did on the very first page of the 'Eye of the world'. If I had rated this book based solely on the first 500 pages I would've given it a measly 2 stars. I'm sure Shakespeare had &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; in mind when he came up with the name of his play &quot;Much ado about nothing&quot;. Robert Jordan, however, snaps out of his reverie towards the end of the book. The last 50 odd pages could have been part of some fast-paced thriller and I would highly recommend this book, if only for the last few pages. Robert Jordan still has a long way to go before he can satisfactorily conclude the series. We have a long wait ahead of us. A very very long wait...."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It is hard to come away from reading this latest book in the WoT series and not give credit to the critics who charge that Mr. Jordan is only for the money at this point. In 600+ pages, no effort is made to progress the plot that has become very stale over the last few books. This latest book doesn't even have a complete sub-plot, rather it closes some sub-plots from previous books and starts new ones.I have come to expect more from Mr. Jordan and whether he only now cares for the money, has run out of ideas, or has taken to writing only while on weekend long benders the result is the same; a poor ending to a great start. I will buy the next book(s) just to finish it out, but they will be from the used book store and not pre-ordered at full price. At least then I will get my money's worth."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I did enjoy the book immensely simply because it was written by Robert Jordan and was a part of his great epic, Wheel of Time. However, I do have a few problems.As Ta'veren, and thus according yo Jordan and a number of characters in the novels, the story should be fatefully wrapping itself around Rand, Mat, and Perrin. However, Rand, Mat, and Perrin seem to get the least amound of pages dedicated to them. This particular sequel seems to revolve around Egwene, Elayne, etc. The series should be renamed to &quot;The Women of The Wheel of Time&quot; or just plain &quot;Aes Sedai&quot;Rand is the Dragon Reborn, and darn it, I don't want to have to read through 5 chapters of snotty Egwene and clueless Elayne just so I can finally read maybe 1 or 2 chapters on Rand and then be back to reading chapter after chapter about the supporting Aes Sedai characters rather than the most important one, Rand.Perrin had almost no attention given to him in this book at all. Mat was given okay time, but his whole Ta'veren status and the whole thing with Manetheren definitely needs a lot more development.If I didn't know better, I'd say Jordan was making some sort of feminist statement with the arrogant Aes Sedai and the overwhelming percentage of pages dedicated to Rand's girlfriends. It seems to be all we ever read about. Perhaps his wife digs it and he's failing to realize that she only buys one copy of the book, not the millions of copies that Rand-Mat-Perrin fans buy to keep him living and eating well.Jordan: Go back to writing about Rand, Mat, and Perrin! They ARE the story."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Death! Death to this entire series! It refuses to end. Ack! Well, i'm just sitting here praying that Jordan doesn't die before this series is over and done with. How many books is he writing??? Some say 13, and so in that case it will be eight long years before the last one comes out. Mabye I should just write my own ending. Something like: And all the seals were broken, and everyone died. Of course, I wouldn't kill Egwene because she is obviously the most awesome character. Rand is insane. there is no doubting it. And whatever happened to Faile? I doubt she'll get out of this charade before the thirteenth book. Doesn't it sometiimes feel as if you would like to strangle Robert Jordan until he told you what was going to happen? But then, I can always settle for the next best thing and throw his books up against the wall until they're likely to come out of their spine. The ending was good. But then, all his endings are good. I hate this. You read about a character and come to the usual cliffhanger and then he switches characters and you throw the book up against the wall because you don't want to know about THAT character, you want to know about THIS character, and alas, you can't just skip chapters and figure out what happens but then it might make more sense, but then, you spend most of your reading time flipping back and forth in books trying to figure out what he's talking about anyway. Mabye you could just accidentally see what happened... I need some sort of omnipotent glossary that tells me what I need to know. Two more years. Two long, long, long more years. What am I supposed to do until then??? reread them? NEVER!!! It emotionally drained me the first time I read the series and I will not do that to myself again. Did you know they put the eye of the world on some high school reading lists? Poor kids. I personally would have never done that."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I give this book 3.75 stars. It was a lot better than the previous book, The Path of Daggers, which IMO, is probably one of the least enjoyable books in the series. The past few books have slowed, time-wise, and again Winter's Heart is set a few days after the conclusion of the previous book.Not much occurred in the previous book, but I'll give a brief re-cap of some important events that did occur. One big event, in which Perrin's wife, Faile in addition to a few others of her party, were kidnapped and taken captive by the renegade Aiel not following Rand, the Shaido. Nynaeve & Elayne had to flee the countryside of Ebou Dar as the Seanchan army appeared on the scene, and fled to Elayne's home country of Andor, where she is the Daughter-Heir to the throne. Rand was the target of a surprise attack by some of his own Asha'man, with a couple of them trying to kill him, and Egwene had finally prepared her Aes Sedai and army to march on Tar Valon and the White Tower.Winter's Heart picked up the pace in the plot, and it was a lot easier to read than the previous book. There are a few more character perspectives included in this book, more on Cadsuane, a mysterious Aes Sedai that had come out of hiding in the 7th book, A Crown of Swords, to assist in guiding the Dragon Reborn. I'm still not entirely sure of her motives, although in this book, you get a glimpse of them. In the previous books I was left wondering what exactly her agenda was (like 99% of the characters in the Wheel of Time world!LOL), but in Winter's Heart Jordan gave a small clue as to what one of her goals are regarding Rand and why she behaves the way she does with him. At first, I didn't really like this character, she seemed as arrogant and high-minded as the other Aes Sedai, but given the little glimpse into her motives in this book, I could understand a portion of her personality.Another mysterious entity, the Seanchan, was only briefly alluded to in prior books. The Seanchan people were suddenly thrust upon the scene in book 2, The Great Hunt, when an invading Seanchan army landed, and throughout the series up until Winter's Heart you, the reader, are only given bits and pieces of information about these intriguing people from across the ocean of the known world in the WOT world. However, in this book, you learn more about the Seanchan, their customs, culture, and people. One important character introduced in Winter's Heart is Seanchan, the High Lady Tuon, and I won't spoil by saying who she is, but this character is more than she appears to be.Rand has been on the hunt for the renegade Asha'man that tried to kill him, and you learn in this book where the kill orders came from. I think this will prove interesting for later books, and I look forward to what Rand will do when he realizes what has been going on in his Black Tower full of Asha'man.Nynaeve & Elayne, both in Camelyn, deal with the all the problems that come with different factions of women channelers all jostling for power and suspicious of each other. In addition to that, Elayne has to contend with securing her claim on the Lion Throne as there are still enemies waiting behind the scene to see her fail in that and in other things. One thing I'll note here, Nynaeve has changed very much from the young woman first encountered in the first book. I think her change was for the better, and although she's still prickly and has a temper, she has reigned it in considerably. Not sure if that is due to the fact she is Aes Sedai now and has to show a facade of calmness to the world, or due to the fact she's now married to Lan (Moiraine's former Warder). I enjoyed seeing Nynaeve change and become more flexible with others around her instead of only seeing \\"her\\" way or the high way.The one main character not given chapters in this book is Egwene, she is only briefly seen, and in one of Elayne's chapters during a meeting in the World of Dreams. There was also not many chapters from Perrin's perspective, and the ones given only showing him very upset and frustrated at Faile's disappearance so the plot doesn't move forward much in either of Egwene or Perrin's chapters.One character that was noticeably absent in the last book is Mat Cauthon. He is back on the scene in this book, and I enjoyed reading his chapters again. He is one of my favorite characters, and his wariness around Tuon is very funny to read about. He is one of the characters that lighten the story, giving humor, and it's a part of his character personality as the ever irrepressible rogue and gambler. In one interview Jordan gave, he was quoted as saying he took some traits from mythological gods (such as Odin, Loki, the Trickster, etc) to flesh out the character of Mat.In fact, Jordan did this with all his main characters (where he took from well-known myths or legends from the real world), and in some characters it is more obvious than others, but know when you're reading these books that everything about the Wheel of Time world and its characters were not done without intention on the author's part. Everything was painstakingly crafted, from the cultures of the various nations, to the personalities of the many characters. Nothing was done without a reason.In another interview when Jordan was asked where he got his ideas for his fictional fantasy world he freely admitted to taking from cultures from various countries (Imperial China and Japan, the Middle East, medieval England and Europe, Africa, etc) to create his fictional countries and cultures, mixing and creating his own ideas from the real ones. Jordan had thousands of pages of notes on the histories, customs, and cultures of the Wheel of Time countries. For instance, on the history of the Aes Sedai and White Tower alone, there were hundreds of pages written on the subject. Just on the character profiles there were probably enough to fill a book as well. Added together, he was able to create a very rich and complex world that you expect to be real once you stop reading, that it takes a moment or two to realize, \\"Wait a second, this is just a fantasy world!\\".I found this book had a quicker pace, and my favorite scene was the ending scene. I won't explain what happens in the scene, but it was described in very good detail and had some good action too. I'm sure I'm not getting everything in the book down in this review, and what I thought of it all, but these books are so incredibly intricate that there really isn't a good way to summarize each book by itself, or the series as a whole, without needing dozens of pages to explain it all. There is so much going on in the books, and right when you know one thing, and given one answer, Jordan drops another clue or question that makes you ponder and think, \\"Oh...what is going on here now??\\" (case in point: one of the Aes Sedai that was introduced early on in the series, Verin Mathwin, has always been an enigma and that hasn't changed in this book and I still question what is her agenda).Anyways, if you've gotten this far, might as well keep reading until you reach the end. I know I will. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Despite the unfortunate critizism of the more recent Wheel of Time books, I loved Winter's Heart. The pace of the series has slowed a little with different paths in the story the characters are taking, but everything is coming together again and the characters are still as engaging as they always were."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Get the next one from the library or a friend...let someone else do the spending."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan is a great author by any definition, and I do agree that he has elaborated on certain points a bit to much. He also tends to throw in a number of plot lines to confuse you. BUT!!! Winter's Heart is still a solid book, with quite a few interesting developments. The last chapter can also rival the last chapter of the Great Hunt. Mr. Jordan needs to wrap up the series, but Winter's Heart is still a good Wheel of Time book. I will buy Crossroads of Twilight and I think that we will start to see some resolution within the next 6-10 years."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am trying to remain faithful to the amazing story created in the first five books, but after the last few books in this series I'm unsure. The main plot is not advancing and main characters are not present, but you've got plenty of detail on not as interesting sub plots. I will buy the next book, but if it continues like the last two I may put the series to rest."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan has lost focus. The first three books were excellent, but part of that is due to those early installments being written as if they were a trilogy. There was structure that not only built and resolved conflict per book, but that succeeded in doing the same over the course of all three. It began in The Eye of the World with the fulfillment of prophecies which said that the Dragon had been reborn, and it ended two books later in the aptly titled The Dragon Reborn when that very event transpired. A very clean and well executed piece of fiction.Since then there has been no structure. No trilogy like format to keep a sprawling story both interesting and reasonable. After The Dragon Reborn every book has wandered further afield. The story is now woefully in need of direction and resolution. Had Jordan enforced the structure he began this work with, the ninth book would've been the last one neccessary to complete this tale. Quite possibly he might even have been able to pull it off in six, with the first three leading to the proclamation of the Dragon, and the latter three leading to Tarmon Gaidon. As it stands now, and at his current rate, he'll need nine more just to wrap this thing up.The Wheel of Time is plauged with so many useless sub-plots and secondary characters that I will never read this entire series. There are too many great books of substance out there that do not meander and waste time with nonsense for a commitment of that sort. Instead I'll construct this series from the eighteen books it will become as I believe it should've been built from the first. Paring it down to six or nine books total, I'm certain I will have read the entire story without all the useless filler that is diminishing the tale.It's a shame that a work started with such greatness should be reduced to this. I for one am terribly disappointed and will approach all of his future endeavors beyond The Wheel of Time with skepticism."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"To give Jordan his due, &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; used to be a *great* fantasy series. What started off as a Tolkien knock-off in &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;, quickly evolved into an original and innovative epic in the volumes from &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; up through &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;.But then... things started to decline, with succeeding volumes (e.g. &quot;Crown of Swords&quot;, &quot;Path of Daggers&quot;) starting to drag, as the number of characters continued to multipy, as did the number of side-plots, with sub-plots developing within each of the sub-plots, and further digressions developing on those sub-sub-plots, requiring the need for Jordan to jump around so much that the main story got lost and nothing much at all really seemed to be happening any more-- until the last 50 pages of the book, when more or less out of nowhere, a suden flurry of activity took place-- a flurry that was so sudden that it was completley incongruous with the rest of the book... almost as if Jordan's publishers called him up after getting the draft and said, &quot;Um, Rob... you *have* to make something happen in this book with the main plot. Can't you just give us 2 more chapters?&quot; Still, the greatness of the earlier books gave me enough energy to move through those with some degree of enthusiasm.&quot;Winter's Heart&quot; is supposedly something of a recovery for Jordan, with a returned focus on the main characters. I suppose there's some truth in that, but to be honest, I found this book even more tedious and dull than the last ones. Yes, there's more of a focus on the main characters, but the overall plot here still seems to be quite lost in all of the sub-plots, sub-sub-sub-plots, and digressions just involving those main characters-- including new ones that are raised here (Oh no, Fail gets kidnapped...) and frankly, I just find that I can't muster the enthusiasm for any of it anymore. Even the parts of the book involving *Rand* seemed tedious to me (especially since, once again, the biggest part of the story involving him is-- guess what-- a new sub-plot/digression. Moreover, a lot of the distinctive little features of Jordan's style and world-development are starting to seem repetitive after so many books. Once, the detailed descriptions of Aiel bonding rituals seemed neat, and the continuous comments of the various characters on how men can never understand women and vice versa were kind of cute and playful. Now though, it just seems like, &quot;Oh yes, this again.&quot; About halfway through, I realized that I was taking no pleasure whatsoever from the book and it was a major chore to force myself to read through to the end (and even then, it was only skimming that made it possible.)Maybe, on some purely objective level, &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; is a bit more on-target than the preceding pair, and maybe, just maybe, if there hadn't been such a big delay between this book and the last, my enthusiasm for this would be higher. But I justcan't fool myself into thinking that I am enjoying this series any longer. Based on how slow things are moving along with this series, The Wheel of Time will undoubtedly continue to keep turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning and turning-- but for me, the ride stops here. There are too many good other books out there for me keep spinning along endlessly with a series that is no longer enjoyable."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I began reading the WoT several years ago, thought it was the best thing, then realized that Jordan was &quot;borrowing&quot; from Celtic, Arthurian, and common fantasy cliches ad libitum. &quot;Tarmon Gaidon&quot; is Armageddon; Shaitan is Satan, and actually Shaitan in Arabic; Tel'Aran'Rhiod is the name of the Celtic moon goddess; Artur Hawkwing is Arthur. Where is the originality in this series? This man lacks even the subtlest ways of stealing material from ancient and medieval sources. But I thought I could stick it out to the end, till I read he has anywhere from 3 to 5 more books planned in the series after this. Thus, it takes 12-15 books to complete an entire saga? And each book advances the plot no further than a snail's pace? I usually ignore what people say about the length of a book; but this truly shows how inept Robert Jordan is at writing. Read his Conan books, read any of his books, and you'll notice how flat his characters are. 6000+ pages on Rand do not make him a 3D character. Nynaeve tugs her braid every other page; Rand finally gets his act together to clean up Saidin; and you learn how incredibly fruitless it is to keep paying peanut money to feed RJ's bad writing habits and lack of skill. I bought this book from B&amp;N, read the first 200 pages, then returned it promptly the next day, and bought the first two books of George RR Martin's Fire and Ice trilogy using that money. I like to compare new SF and fantasy books to Gene Wolfe's works, and sadly most of them don't compare. If you want real story, real action, and real characters, I recommend you take up reading Gene Wolfe (who is admired by even Orson Scott Card) and George Martin, because they know how to handle story lines and characters par excellence. Lux dei vitae viam monstrat."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After Path of Daggers, which wasnt really disappointing and a good read, but without the magic of the first books, I was starting to lose interest in Jordan's books. After reading Storm of Swords by G R R Martin, it only went downhill. I still bought Winter's Heart before the release date (go Holland!) and went to read.And yes, yes, yes! Jordan proved that he still can do it!I had some minor points of irritations: the arrogant Sea Folk and Kin, Perrin's lack of action, and the fact that the Battle of Tar Valon hasnt started yet (*insert dutch curse here*)......but that last chapter, 'With the Choedal Kan' made up for it. By far. That chapter was one of the best I *ever* read. The quick POV switching, and the intensity, made me feel that good old stomach knot and breathing problems again. What a finale, it was SO good.Tension, two serious plot boosts (Mat and... well, ehm, Rand), intensity, and a marvellous final chapter.So, RJ, you did it again. You left me, wanting more. Well done!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"There's really not that much different in this book than any of the others in the series. Thankfully a few characters who were dropped from the last one have returned. The author has branched out on so many subplots certain characters are in every other book.There is one issue I would like to address regarding to the reviews. There is a large amount of people who love the books and put down five stars, and yet spend the entire review insulting the intelligence of readers who do not think its great. Contrary to their opinion, we aren't idiots. In fact, it takes very little intelligence to follow these books. No more than you would use in watching a soap opera. I read an average of a book every 1 to 2 days, and have read a lot in my life. Frankly, I've seen most of this before. Fantasy tends to repeat itself. I just happen to see problems with the series. There was an excellent review a couple books ago that pointed out numerous grammatical and writing errors. The characters are fairly stereotypical, and are interchangeable. The author uses the typical cliches over and over again. We are constantly bombarded with Jordan's favorite sayings and phrases. \\"In stories heroes never...\\" and who could forget the tongue twister \\"the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills.\\" Actually try saying that out loud. It reminds me of the constant may the force be with you in star wars. How many of people out there are tired of skirts being smoothed? Before I started #9 I seriously considered counting how many times Nynaeve pulls that braid. When I reread the series (if) then I will put tally marks on my bookmark and see just how many times that braid gets tugged. Girls are always pretty, plump, or not quite pretty but handsome. Every girl is about the exact same. They are rude, stuck up, spoiled girls who have temper problems and act like pre-teens. There is not one shy, respectful, reserved female in the series. The author has lost control of all his subplots. If certain characters, especially main characters, can only get fit in every 1 to 2 books and yet the plot still isn't finished it shows something. We've got plots hanging over from ages ago. They recently reintroducted Elyas, but this Slayer thing was from book 5 and that hasn't been resolved, Gawyn is still hanging out there somewhere mooning over Egwene, Morgase still hasn't done ANYTHING productive, Faile, Bain and Chiad are still captured, etc... It goes on. The clothing descriptions are unbearable. It's been a lot better since he stopped using the World of Dreams as often. He does automatically assume you know everything about his world when he throws you in the first book. Using the glossary is the best advice to give a newbie.The Forsaken is another matter. There used to be the little required Forsaken per book to kill. What on earth is he trying to do by bringing them back? He brought 3 or 4 back already, which means how many more books? Unless they start dropping like flies it's going to take another 8 or 9 books to finish the series up.I finished the book and yet, what happened? I can think of a few things. 1) Mat seems to have finally gotten out of the city. 2) Rand has been bonded. 3) Saidin was cleansed. Sheesh, I couldn't see that coming. cough. 4) wait... let me think... is there a number four? I don't think so. Nothing really happened with Elayne or Egwene. Thank the light the search for enchanted tupperware is over. No, nothing else really happened. How many pages did that take?Don't get me wrong, I've really enjoyed the series thus far despite its many many problems. It is far from being great literature. I hope Jordan finishes now before the series goes down too much farther."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Some readers apparently confuse length with depth. An epic is defined by its content, not its length or complexity. Beowulf is an epic. So is the Song of Roland. So are the works of Tolkien and Herbert and MacCaffery. But they seemed to be able to tell their epics in a few thousand pages or less. Can any reader out there really say that he or she is following everything that's going on in WOT? I downloaded a glossary/cast of characters after three or four books from a WOT site that was 100 pages long! Jordan needs to tie off some loose ends, ignore others, focus on the three ta'averan and can the travelogue, architecture tour, and fashion show. At $25 a pop, I'm starting to think he is the Dark One!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Here's the problem: this series started out as a wonderful example of how dramatic fantasy can be. It featured moments of genuine tension that were enhanced rather than ruined by the fantastic elements of the story. The rich world used to be a setting for a plot that kept you on the edge of your seat. Then the world took over and the plot ended up on the back burner. From that point on, the drama ceased to be meaningful, and what happened (what LITTLE happened) to the characters became irrelevant in the face of tons of useless pontification.Another problem: there are no consequences in this series. With the exception of Moirraine, no one- not even the bad guys- dies and stays dead. It seems that everybody has croaked at least once. The consequece of this revolving door of mortality is a total lack of emotional impact. Major characters need to die or they get sidelined. Then, they lose their relevance (see Thom Merrilin, most of the Aiel, various Lords, random Aes Sedai, even Lan). In addition, what's the point of cleansing Saidin if no one ever went mad anyway? The whole idea of a hero who could go crazy at any moment was terrific. Now, after building that tension up for NINE books, we're left with no consequence. The whole taint might as well have not existed.Another problem: Robert Jordan used to be very good at the &quot;show not tell&quot; school of writing. His text conveyed nuances that weren't necessarily stated. Now, however, everything is tremendously obvious. Every time Lan walks into a room, there's a four paragraph description of how deadly he is- despite the fact that he has never really killed a major character!Ultimately, Robert Jordan has in effect promised us an epic to rival the Lord of the Rings. But like so many stories today, his is all promise, and no deliver. The shame is that the series began so well- but whether it was the pressure, the fame, or the money that led Jordan to lose all semblance of literary discipline, the result is that the Wheel of Time has squandered its place as one of the classics of Fantasy."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"...of Robert Jordan in his writing study working on the next WoT book.

No matter, there are plenty more where that one came from. New notes are created and pasted over others - insuring that pages on pages will be filled with detailed descriptions, names, and quirks of characters who have very little to do with what plot is hidden on the walls behind them.Stubs from publisher's advance checks litter the desk and floor as well.

It's that, at the beginning of this series, there were actual characters. I speak particularily of the female characters. It doesn't matter of what culture they come from, every female character may be strong but they are strong in exactly the same way. And that supposed strength is also a weakness. They are all stubborn, unwilling to compromise, and hot-tempered. Very child-like, as other reviewers have pointed out. I don't think he can write women very well. It's really unfortunate, considering at the beginning there was some actual differentiation between them. And with all of these plots and subplots he so masterfully weaves throughout this epic series, he seems to have lost the humanity of almost all of his main characters. Detail we get, and characters in large numbers, but they have begun to blur at the edges and hardly resemble anything more than stereotypes. There are exceptions. But I actually liked Rand at the beginning of this series. And after the Dragon Reborn, I began to lose him. And at one point there was an actual difference between Nynaeve, Egwene, and Elaine. No more, apparently. And the relationships - as I believe one of the characters put it in the beginning books \\"whenever we're not fighting, we're kissing.\\" The men aren't really entirely subservient to the women, but the relationships these people have are all unstable, to say the least. And all exactly the same. It would be refreshing to have a relationship where two people could actually get along half of the time. And Mat as a boy-toy, and this entire three-woman and Rand thing - if truth be told, it is difficult to mark the actual point in the storyline where Rand went from thinking Elayne, in particular, was pretty to when he was sleeping with her. It's getting a little ridiculous.But I will say that to keep a work like this straight and without conspicuous editorial mistakes is an accomplishment. His description of culture is rich and fruitful. But if you're looking for humanity in your characters, I would suggest, like so many others, George R. R. Martin or Michelle West's Sun Sword series. At least their characters are distinguishable and are not so omnipotent that the author has to keep pulling increasingly large rabbits out of his authorial hat to keep the story trudging (slowly) along.All of these characters have too much power than can be good for them; all battles have worked to their advantage, no one intricately important to the plot line has died recently - I hate to say it, but it's beginning to get a bit predictable. They haven't really lost significantly yet, but they aren't progressing either. Jordan is a good writer. I just am beginning to wonder if he's spun a web to big to control.Nevertheless, if you're hooked, you'll keep reading. And it was better than the two previous books; more development, some actual (if minute) charater progression. Maybe he'll pull it off yet."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":".. But somewhere along the road, Jordan got it into his head to start supplanting main characters, and that's not cool. I can handle the disappearance of Egwene and the almost-disappearance of Perrin. I can handle the realization that book 9 takes place between the last chapter of book 8 and its epilogue. I can even (sort of) handle the fact that Mat is supposed to marry a bald noble who can learn to channel and who has some inordinately close relations with Semirhage. Sort of. But I don't understand why suddenly it was necessary to introduce characters who Healed better than Nynaeve, and now at least three non-Forsaken characters who are stronger than she is. Nynaeve was like the Rand of the Aes Sedai. There were some parallels. Yet suddenly, Nynaeve has gotten married and she's become useless. Essentially. I don't care what she did at the end of _Winter's Heart_, but her actions before it, both in book 8 and book 9, were deplorable compared to what she used to do. Nynaeve has been slowly declining, her courage leaving with her bluster and returning only in brief spurts, but leaving her without even her strength in the Power is just... unbelievable. I feel almost betrayed. Until the end, the action of _Winter's Heart_ was rather unremarkable. There were some amusing surprises, like Perrin waking up in Berelain's bed, or Min, Birgitte, and Aviendha 'experiencing' Elayne and Rand... complicated, repulsive, but funny all the same. There were some rather predictable plot twists, as Perrin abandons Rand's plan to find Faile and Elayne essentially gaining control of Andor (and proving herself an utter moron as she did so). The last scene of the book was the best, returning to the high level of other books in the series, but at the same time it was too short. With so many characters present, and so many POVs at once, it would've been nice to see a bit more detail. It would also be nice to see the Forsaken acting as though they had even one brain between them, but I think that that's about as impossible as the sun turning green, another reason that _Winter's Heart_ irritated me. Here are these villains, the most frightening group of people in the world, and they can't even settle their differences long enough to launch a successful attack on Rand that would finally end their troubles and leave them free to deal with each other? Jordan made his Forsaken too powerful, and leaving them beached and helpless against Rand not only does them a disservice, but it *feels* wrong as well."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The book is terrible due to Jordan's inability to say &quot;the end&quot;, I think he is lost in his own fantasy land. Maybe he is afraid to let this series end--if he had stopped 3 books ago this series could have been a classic impossible to top with any follow-up series.I don't want to argue but even the people who gave this book high marks pointed out the overbearing flaws in this book and the series. The book received high marks on a relative basis. Comments prevail like, &quot;best book in a while...first good one since book 5&quot; etc. That fact does not make it a good book. The story has degenerated.Bottom line, lets not make this one a bestseller, borrow the thing or visit your library, you're not missing anything by waiting 6 months for a paperback or your friend's copy.Sorry, I'm not intending to be mean, the series is over for me and many others, just an opinion."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This series will never end. It goes on, and on, and on, and on...Opps! Now I'm doing it. The content is a continuing re-hash. What started out as an interesting series has been exploited by page stuffing, cut and paste authorship until the glow has been completely erradicated by this effort at milking extra dollars from loyal fans. Too bad, Robert Jordan once had me as a fan but this is too much...will it take 10, 12 or even 15 books before the publisher lets him out of this overdone dollar game he has been in? It reminds me of &quot;Friday the 13th - part 13&quot;. If they bought the last one, let's sell the 10 more like it with a fresh coat of paint. Would someone please bring in Reader's Digest to condense this series down to 3 novels?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I first became aware of Robert Jordan not long after the Great Hunt came out. It was a friend actually who had received the books was gracious enough to loan me them to read. Now, I am the one rushing out on day 1 to acquire copies for both of us.Let me continue by saying that this is the first sci-fi/fantasy series that I have truly become immersed in. Having read little or no sci-fi/fantasy before this (not even Tolkein) Robert Jordan's series truly seemed Herculean. Even to this day, I am astonished by the amount of word-vomitting this series has gone thru.If nothing else, Robert Jordan can write, and write, and write and write. Never have I encountered a series whose average length ran 600+ pages per episode. It truly boggles the mind to think of how many hours I have spent reading and re-reading this series. But thank god, now I have the luxury to skip over the hundreds of pages that no longer bog me down with drudgery and instead can zoom in on those sections where resolution/revelation and actual conflict take place. Some people may take relish in all the micro-management and sub-sub-plots woven throughout the book, but after awhile, without a flow chart to keep track of who is doing what to whom, it can become very easy to get lost. And not only that, but one reads the entire series with the desperate forboding that very little is being said, despite all the words being used. Jordan's characters do not interact within his world; instead they exist within narrow margins of thought, bullying their way thru every situation so that it seems as if nobility's emphasis upon arrogance and secrecy were a virtue instead of an impediment. Instead of peasants bringing straight-forward talk to the fray, the peasants become even more aristocratic than the aristocrats, in terms of secrets and pressing arrogance. The more Rand takes himself seriously, the less dangerous he becomes, except to those around him, and the less of an impact it makes upon the reader. The double-edged sword with Jordan's series is that although Rand is titled as the 'pivotal' character, there is no lack of supporting characters whose stories not only deeply enrich the plot but work as better examples of storytelling than the main characters sometimes. Even simple sub-plot characters like Bayle Domon, the merchant sea captain first met in Eye, continue to reappear throughout the series, and that brings up my main fault: some of these people are infinitely more interesting than some of the main characters. I am not sure about anyone else, but Mat has become a favorite of mine, and his haphazzard appearences can either make or break a book sometimes to me. With so many characters, just when you find someone worth reading about, the story switches and you have NO idea when/if they might be reappearing. With an epic this size, that is unfortunate, but it also begins to feel unwieldy, as if the story were taking on a momentum just from the sheer number of characters involved.So what does this have to do with Winter's Heart, just that the same elements that appear in every book appear here, with no exception: shifting perspectives, characters appearing and disappearing far too often, long-winded descriptions whose value can be summed up far more quickly and whose end result often leaves a 'mixed' taste afterwards (with thoughts like 'I dragged myself thru that unbearable chapter for THAT???')And just like the other books in the series, Jordan momentarily redeems himself at the end, allowing action to cut thru the ridiculous machinations of everyone and allow them an almost zen moment of pure 'movement', unburdened by all the worthless strategizing they have fretted over previously, and at length. Whether it be rescuing Rand from a renegade Shaido army, resulting in a slaughter, killing a Forsaken, or just fulfilling yet another of the Dragon Prophecies indirectly, Jordan's characters drop their weighty pretenses and actually do what Jordan has them thinking they were doing in the previous 500+ pages; fulfilling their destinies. Every novel is broken down into 85% acting important, 10% moving around and 5% doing something important, and Winter's Heart is no exception."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Whew. I finally made it to the last installment of the WOT and am amazed I can still see. After how many pages? And it's still nowhere close to being finished!I have seen the WOT books in stores for years and finally decided to read them -- all at once and without realizing the series wasn't finished yet. But ignorance is bliss and I plunged into EOTW with gusto. Wow! Good book! On to book 2! As on... and on... By the 5th book I was seriously thinking of abandoning the whole thing. Unfortunately, it's addictive so I plodded on. I did get through &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; although I admit I checked it out from the library, having no desire to shell out bucks on a hardcover.What happened to the good stuff? Somewhere in this intermitable &quot;middle&quot; Jordan lost his train of thought. Or maybe the whole train. I agree with reviewers who say you need an encylopedia to keep characters straight. Even though I read the series back-to-back, I can't remember who is who. There must be a million names to try and keep track of. I don't even remember what group the name is affiliated with! So confusing!And the plot has certainly deteriorated to the point of being drivel. Can we please get Elayne crowned so we don't have to follow Andorian politics any more?? (I can't follow US politics, how am I supposed to remember who is head of what major Andorian house and whose side it's on??) Can we stop hearing about the trauma poor Rand faces trying to fight off three women -- and how much they love each other, too, even having to share their man? And can the aes sedai please get their collective acts together so we don't have to waste any more time on which-sister/ajah-is-on-what-side? (And who cares?)It's fun to invent a whole world, complete with geography, politics, clothing (and we certainly hear enough about fashion styles, don't we?!). I suppose it's natural to want to tell everyone all about your new world. However, a million pages of fluff does not make up for the thousand pages of good reading. &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; was better than the preceding 3 or 4 books but it still wasted the lives of many, many trees. Come on, Jordan. Let's stop milking the helpless addicts (such as myself) and give us a good old-fashioned slam-bang ending! (And maybe not even mention Nynaeve pulling her braid this time!!)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Even Robert Jordan in mediocrity beats most other fantasy writers at their best, but, oh, what disappointments have followed the first four or five in the Wheel of Time series. Certainly the last three installments of this multipiece work (vingtology??), probably the last four, and maybe even the last five have lost the imagination, the creative excitement and the fast moving action of the first ones. What was once indisputably the best fantasy serial work since the Lord of the Rings Trilogy has become a somewhat lumbering and labored hulk of pieced together scrapple. The characters seem even to have lost track of themselves, so where does that leave us, the faithful followers? Only the most ardent and devoted Jordanites still have a grasp of the intricacies of the plot, character, history and myth that has gone before.None of these four or five novels seem to move the story line(s)forward in any significant degree. Frankly, Jordan himself seems unsure of what do to now. One wonders if this seemingly unending tale is really now viewed by its author as his lifelong annuity. Certainly, he has gathered enough loyal followers that their continued devotion will ensure continued purchasing of the unending stream of new releases and a continued stream of nice royalty income to Mr. Jordan. I must say that it pains deeply to say that and still hope anguishingly that he will return to the form of his first four or five pieces of this work.That said, however, there is this silver lining: Winter's Heart takes a small step back in the right direction after what had seemed to me to have become a mire pit with Crown of Swords and Path of Daggers.Robert Jordan no longer rules the roost, and The Wheel of Time is not the only game in town now. A Song of Ice and Fire Series has moved past and easily displaced The Wheel of Time as the best going these days, and I believe (and hope) that George R. R. Martin seems intent on not doing to his superb series what Robert Jordan has done to his. The Sword of Truth is not more than half a step behind Jordan, but Terry Goodkind shows signs of falling into the Jordan morass. Raymond Feist, although not quite in the same league (but not wholly left in the dust, either) has always been much more direct, honest and businesslike in moving his series forward and wrapping them up. The same goes for Robert Eddings.Robert Jordan needs to reassert his creative pride.So, Robert Jordan, please come home!!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have the same sentiment as most reviews here. The Wheel of Time series has been prolonged into a tedious soap opera of trivial and insignificant events. It does become annoying to follow minor characters that had ten page cameos five books earlier and then suddenly reappear. Futhermore, the constant stereotyped &quot;Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus&quot; comments along with the obligatory blushing that give the books a &quot;Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew&quot; feeling are cumbersome. To give Jordan credit, Winter's Heart (Book 9) does progress the plot more than some of its most recent predecessors. (Specifically, Books 7 &amp; 8.)I read a review here where someone wrote that if they had to do it over again, they would buy the entire series and read it in it's entirety. Being recently introduced to the Wheel of Time series, this &quot;new&quot; experience is what I have encountered, and it has probably allowed me to enjoy the series more so than the long-time fans who wait a year or two for the sequel only to be disappointed when it doesn't live up to the climaxes in some of the earlier volumes. One of the few fantasy series with as much creativity as Lord of the Rings just not the same writing and story-telling ability, but I would still recommend the series to anyone that hasn't started yet. Some reviews mention that the series has become boring enough that you must flip through some of the pages. To be honest, I've done that with most of the books. Jordan is a decent author, but sometimes puts a little too much detail and attention into his story to make it worth reading. There are many instances in all 9 books where you can skim through a few pages very quickly and still gain the same feeling. Like I said earlier, great creativity but sometimes lacking in the content department - considering the decent, but not excellent wrting, some of the fantasies don't need thirty page narratives on their importance. It almost reminds me of growing up with Edgar Rice Burroughs titles and the addiction to sequels that would present your favorite characters but never live up to the initial &quot;creativity high&quot; you obtained by exploring the series in the first place. The longer more volumes are out, the better. (So you can continue from book to book.) As far as waiting for the next dramatic sequel, Jordan may have run out of ammunition to make it worthwhile. But we all know we'll buy it anyways. ;)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I love Richard Jordan. His first books in this series were so addictive I think I blew through them in like two weeks. The action moved right along and the characters were great. But in the last few books everything has slowed down to a halt. This lastest book in hardcover is two inches+ thick, and approximately like two days or so have passed from the beginning of the book to the end...or so it seems. I wish Jordan would pick the pace up a bit and get Elayne on the throne, Egwene in the tower, and Rand to Tar'mon Gaidon already. Geez. Another complaint I have with this book is that Jordan does very little review of what happened to the characters in the previous novels. This is especially important because he takes like a year and half to come out with each book. By then I have completely forgotten everything. In most serial books I have read, the plot comes back to me very quickly. This was not the case with this book. I suppose, I'll read the next books because I have read them all...but I doubt I'll buy them at hardcover prices...I'll wait for the paperbacks."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Just what I wanted over 200 pages dedicated to what Elayne wears and eats!

Should I go on?Oh, the &quot;great climax.&quot; It was only anticipated about 4 books ago. It certainly could have at least been made more interesting. How disappointing, Rand finally DOES something but the writing is so drawn out that you almost fail to notice it.Hire a REAL editor already. Jordan's wife certainly isn't cutting it at the job."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After POD, I swore off this series. However, positive reviews and my own curiosity suckered me back in, and I borrowed a copy (at least they didn't get MY money). It stunk. This series has become to literature what a soap opera is to film. It goes on and on, but it never ends, and that, judging from the continued popularity of the series, must be appealing to many readers. I cannot, however, see any quality in all this quantity. The story in this volume doesn't stand on its own or advance the overall plot, and the quality is so far removed from what got us all addicted to this series in the first place, that it is difficult to believe the books were all written by the same author. Remember WOT? It was engrossing. If WOT had been as poorly written and downright boring as this volume, there would be no volume 9- none of us would have bought volume 2. The continued popularity of this series must be based upon fond rememberances of the first 3 volumes, or perhaps a desire to follow the comic-book antics of this never ending soap opera. However, after the intial quality of WOT, I keep hoping to see a coherent plot and engaging story. This book provides neither. Once again, I feel as if I just walked through that hole in Barnum's tent, expecting to find something exciting, and instead I find myself in the parking lot."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After reading the first three of four books from the Wheel of Time series, one can't help but wonder at how Robert Jordan masters the art of storytelling, and surely can't wait to read the next ones. Yet, as the story goes on, many readers will be discouraged by the ever-increasing lenght of the series, its slower pace, without mentioning the not-so-positive comments from unsatisfied fans growing more and more impatient.However, what one has to realize is that Jordan's is one complex story, and it surely wouldn't be proper to finished it the good old &quot;deus ex machina&quot; way. Yes, I too find that having to wait two years between installments is sort of frustrating, and I too agree that the story moves at a somewhat slower pace. But on the other hand, I surely savour the high level of complexity of the story, the depth of the different parties and politics involved, the mysterious threads not yet uncovered, and it would be simply impossible or very unsatisfying for Jordan to quicly wrap up the whole story in an action packed, get-all-the-answer-at-once bundle. Just compare the WOT series with the Sword of Truth, and there you go. Even though SOT is very entertaining, it is now at its sixth book of more or less telling the same story, with few important development. Even though the settings are never quite the same, the essence of the story is always very similar. At least, with Jordan, the story always bring something new that paves the way for the new installment, and especially with this ninth book, you get a feeling that the end approaches.So now, about the story. I was quite happy with the new developments this installment offered, and quite a few loose threads were finally coming back and woven to the story. The pace also started to pick up after a very slow Path of Daggers, and how ever happy was I to find Mat in the story. One important piece missing was the development of Egwene andthe rebel Aes Sedai but were are getting use to some characters not being part of a whole episode. For a change, there is quite a major ending which makes me see that Tarmon Gaidon is ever-approaching.So please be it that Book 10 gets to us faster and beware impatient readers, Jordan will not just magically write a crappy fast ending that you would simply not enjoy no matter what you think. Jordan will live up to our expectations, and write nothing less than we expect of him: a detailed, logical next episode coming closer to the finish line."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"i started the WOT series and devoured books 1,2 and 3.

Winters Heart only continued that way downwards although the main plot line finally moved a little when Rand cleansed Saidin (on the last 10 of 7 or 8 hundred pages) but altogether the story became even more unbearable. I almost stopped reading this book when I came to the part where everybody suspected that Perrin had an affair with Berelain. Unfortunately I decided to continue reading it but I won't make the same mistake twice!!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart revisits themes left dangling from earlier books. Characters who made an appearance in Book 2, like Rand's Uncle Luc, show up again, if only incidentally. At least we know Jordan hadn't forgotten them or discarded what seemed like promising themes at the time.I think many of us have become used to fast paced action, thanks mostly to movies, rather than the old style books which were long winded because there was no TV or big screen to entertain.By definition, The Wheel of Time is very complex and minor details in one book develop into significant ones in later books. It's true that the many descriptions of fashion in Winter's Heart kind of annoy me, but instead of seeing it as filler, I prefer to think that Jordan wants us to see what's going on in our mind's eye.For those who like action, however, Mat is back and, unlike Perrin in this book, plays a significant part in this book. Rand is also involved in some good action sequences.There is one other thing I think we need to keep in mind. The last battle involves many pieces coming together. When we first learned of Mat's impending marriage to the Daughter of the Nine Moons, who finally appears in this book, I think we all assumed this marriage would have something to do with aligning this vast horde of flying channelling warriors for the last battle. But in a realistic sense, this sort of thing takes time. Mat fist needs to get to a location where he can meet the Daughter of the Nine Moons. The Return has to happen and she has to be there. Mat then needs to encounter this Daughter of the Nine Moons and all of this in the context of Rand's movements. In many fantasy novels, the action is so fast paced that the necessary pieces come together in an unrealistic manner.What we see in the Wheel of Time is a logical progression toward the final climatic battle. Pieces and characters interacting to get to where Jordan needs them to be. If you think about it, how many books would you have to read to get a really detailed picture of World War II, a war which took seven years?Jordan's plots and overall tapestry is so complex (do you remember all the characters from book to book?) that it takes time to realistically get the pieces in the right place. This is not a stock standard 350 page fantasy novel in which the end of the world is threatened in the first 20 pages, and the threat averted on page 350. This is a slow paced description of fateful events.If you realize what this series is trying to achieve, I think some of the lower ratings would rise, if only a little.Winter's Heart does move the plot along nicely. More pieces are now in place for events to move more quickly, and I would imagine that after the events of this book, the Dark Lord will have to step things up a bit. It may have taken two or three books to move people and plot to the right places, but after Winter's Heart, they are pretty much there now. I found the book most enjoyable."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Make him stop! Robert Jordan, that is. I agree with all of the negative reviews of Winter's Heart--it's not a very good book but, more importantly, it's part of a more and more frustrating series which continues to sell (well? I wonder) and which has addicted a number of unsuspecting readers like myself. I want to stop, I just can't. When a new volume in a series only comes out every two years or so, who can remember by then how annoyed one was two years ago? Maybe it will be better, one thinks--maybe it will end some day, hallelujah! I don't know what Robert Jordan's motivations are for writing so poorly, i.e., dragging this out endlessly (please, get this man an editor who can stop the madness), but he used to do better. Which is what hooked us all. And, puh-leeze, stop those poor girls (I can't call them women) from sniffing, pulling their braids, gripping and/or smoothing their skirts and all the rest of their incredibly annoying, and endlessly repetitive habits.

Oh, he takes up a lot of the book, but he never does anything...and I mean NOTHING. Elayne? Nope. Egwene...was she even in the book? Nynaeve? She seems to pull her braid less often, but that's it. Cadsuane? Let's be honest...Jordan regretting killing off Moraine 2000 pages ago and conjured Cadsuane up as a replacement...she's boring, shallow, and predictable, and, by the way, does nothing in this book either. And what about Rand? OK...besides falling in love, he accomplishes one thing...after spending 640 pages doing nothing but sitting on his couch, he spends 9 pages trying to do something he should have tried two books ago.As for the bad guys...if there is one fictional setting in fantasy writing that I would want to be the protagonist in, it the WoT books because the bad guys clearly sit around doing nothing all day. Total time devoted to Forsaken is less than 10 pages.I hate to say this. Understand that I loved the first three books and enjoyed to next two or three. For a period of time, I enjoyed no other author more. But after many years, I now realize that it's time to give this series up.

After counting down the days until #9 was published, my impatience has been satisfied (of course, now I have to settle down to wait for book 10). Sigh. Anyway, for people who haven't read this series before, stop right here and begin at book one (The Eye of the World). Otherwise you'll be completely lost. After a somewhat dissapointing read in #8, which moved very slowly, Jordan's picked up the pace. The first 100 pages are a bit of a snooze, but things really start happening after that. My favorite character makes his reappearance, and we finally meet the Daughter of the Nine Moons. However, Egwene and her impending siege are completely left out, much to my frustration; Perrin and the Prophet have very minor places in this book as well. Winter's Heart resolves some major plot questions,and the last chapter will leave you out of breath and your stomach in knots. ( I won't be more detailed, I don't want to ruin it.) The scenes are richly detailed, as always, but the characters seem a bit distant, with less internal development of character. I'd say this book is definately darker in tone, with less of the comedy mixed in with more serious scenes. The only real complaint I have is that the writng ( stylistically, not plotwise) seems a bit rushed, like the author hurried to just get the book written and published. ( Yes, I know, it's been two years, but he wrote another book in that time, and I think he focused on that one more). Bottom line: read this one, it's a lot better than The Path of Daggers. Though not with the charm of the first two books, the ending is written in true grand Jordan fashion. It'll take at least two more books to finish the series,but Winter's Heart heads toward a conclusion. And for those of you who think the series is too big and long, go watch TV and its 1/2-hour plot lines. The world needs a few big stories."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan has created a wonderfully vibrant and extremely detailed world. That is where my praise for this book ends. After finishing \\"Winter's Heart\\", I sat back and began to wonder why I started reading this series in the first place. Nine books and ten years later, I came to realize that I was falling down a very steep hill. To confirm my suspicions, I re-read the entire series from start to \\"Winter's Heart\\". This task took me the better part of two months. Just as I expected, I truly enjoyed the beginning of this series, but as I started to re-read \\"The Fires of Heaven\\" my interest waned. However, I am an extremely patient person, so I endeavored to persevere, and managed to finish the (current) entire work.The length was not the problem; it was that I simply stopped caring about what happened to the characters. I also found the male/female character interaction juvenile at first, but after nine books it became downright annoying (it actually reminded me of how I acted towards the opposite sex when I was in grade school).Overall, I would still recommend the series. I truly hope Jordan exits his current \\"Money\\" mode of writing and returns to the style and flair that made the early books of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" enjoyable.\\"Winter's Heart\\" will be the last Robert Jordan book I buy until the series is finished. When \\"The Wheel of Time\\" is completed, (hopefully I'll live that long), I'll buy the ones I've missed and finish the journey I started in 1990."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, that's that... I gave Jordan three chances to get the series back to what it used to be, and it's just not happening. I won't be buying another Wheel of Time book in hardcover. In fact, I may just go to the library and check a copy out next time, rather than even buying it in paperback.I used to be impressed by Jordan's ability to have so many plot threads going on at once, and yet tying them all together. Now I'm just bored by it. He has too many characters doing their own little thing in their own little places... I can't fault him too much for not moving the series forward, the problem is with the way he has the story set up, he _Can't_. There are too many plots... but he could do a much better job in focusing in on those plots and making something happen within them. The female characters are extremely under-developed. They're all so similar... But again, an author must have a hard time developing characters when he's thrown so many into the mix.The end of this book was fairly decent. I can't say this book was better than the last two, however."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Be warned all ye who read these reviews: This is NOT a 5 star book. Even the reviews contained here should tell you that if you read them. Sure, there are 5 star reviews but even those people tell you that this book is not that great, or has problems or suffers from pacing issues. The truth of the matter is that Jordan is riding on reputation and a public's perception that his new stuff is good ONLY because he has written good books in the past.Jordan has passed into a form os self mockery. His character are starting to act in a unintentionally comical fashion. Entire pages (and yes, I do mean entire pages) will cover a rather meaningless discussion in which Jordan will describe how each character responds to another character's facial expressions. NO JOKE.IF THIS WAS THE FIRST BOOK YOU READ IN THE SERIES YOU WOULD'T READ ANOTHER ONE! That is the absolute truth. Instead of rewarding dedication with a plot that carries through the promise of exposition and background, Jordan plods along. This book's plot (as well as Crown of Swords and POD) is so instantly forgettable that only the most diehard fans would be able to repeat it, although the story could probably be described in short shrift.My message to my fellow reviewers is to judge this book for what it is, and not within the context of a series which was once full of promise. To grant this book a 5, or 4 star rating simply because, say, you loved the Great Hunt (as I did) does a vast diservice to other readers.I am realistic about the fact that a reader of this review isn't going to use it to determine whether to start the series. I am sure that this review is being read only be people who's opinions are set in stone one way or the other. But in the hope that there is someone out there unsure about whether to read this book, or even to start this series, my answer is &quot;No.&quot; After such a long amount of time devoted to this series and its characters, it has turned to utterly terrible. I strongly feel that I have wasted my time reading through Jordan's last three books. I am sorry to say this, but if I had known at the time I started Eye of the World what I know now, I believe that I wouldn't have started the series. Instead, I would have dedicated myself to stories and authors who understood basic storytelling devices such as plot and pacing.One additional point for those people who would ignore my advice: If you must read these books, I would take breaks often. It took my months to finish Crown of Swords, for example, because the plot would literally stop cold. Additionally, do not think yourself daft because you do not like Jordan's writing style. At first I thought it was just me, but I realize by the other reviews, that I am not alone. Yes, Jordan has a great grasp of the English language. What Jordan suffers from is an apparent disrespect for his reader's intelligence. While other writers will fast forward time (say a week), Jordan seems intent on describing every hour in the day. The result is that the reader is told every detail of a character's day, even those events which the character himself thinks are boring.I would also be very wary of the earlier reviews. Having read many of the reviews on Jordan's earlier books, I have found that many of the earlier reviewers simply gave the book 5 stars and then admitted in their review that they hadn't read the book yet but they were &quot;sure it was going to be great.&quot; Obviously, that type of review is worthless. However, check for yourself: the Jordan faithful are so dedicated to a author who apparently feels less respect for his audience."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I consider my discovery of the Wheel of Time series, way back in 1990, to be a life-changing event. The first books were brilliant, tightly-plotted, powerful epic fantasy. I would not have believed, then, that Robert Jordan was capable of writing a bad book. However, the last several books have convinced me otherwise. And these books aren't just bad compared to Jordan's earlier works--they are bad compared to the worst drivel out there in ANY genre of writing. Let me get a few things off my chest....First of all, the sheer, mind-numbing REPETITION is almost impossible to read. The characters all ruminate for pages on the same boring things, and they ALL have the same thoughts on these things, and even use the same physical gestures. They sniff, they pull their braids, they plant their fists on their hips, etc ... ALL of them. You'd think someone with Jordan's imagination could think up a few DIFFERENT characters, as opposed to these cardboard cut-outs. Alas, no.And his women .... don't even get me started. I'm not sure what sort of women Jordan has known in his own life, but these characters are an insult even in a fantasy universe. Are we really to accept that all women(queens, Aes Sedai, hardened killers), are really so petty, self-centered, obnoxious and obsessed with status??? Five year-olds behave better than these people, and are much, much smarter. I have never in my life read a book(except, of course, the previous four in the series), where the characters are so unbelievably idiotic. Are women really no more able to get along than Jordan's imbeciles? Are they so full of ego? Simply put, I cannot begin to accept these characters as believable, and they ALL are the same.The men, of course, have no backbone, brains, or courage. Oh... except when it is time for them to come forward and save the world in the last chapter of every book. (While being treated like &quot;woolheads&quot; and half-wits by the women, of course). On every page, in every paragraph, Jordan beats this drivel into the reader; it seems he is somehow compelled to repeat himself. At points I could barely keep reading this book. Finally, I decided to skim the boring parts(ie. most of the book), and began to skip through whole pages of boring description of what color the women's nose rings were, etc, and how it was SO important for each of them to be acknowledged as more important than any other character around her.Jordan is OBSESSED with one character being subservient to the next, with one CONTROLLING the other. Find me a relationship in the whole series where he does not come back to this. No one does anything because it makes sense. They put each other on leashes, &quot;bond&quot; one another, swear unbreakable/magical oaths, become willing servants to one another, create agreements that make no sense, hold each other captive(the women raping the men, blah blah), but EVERYONE is locked into his or her place. They do what they do because they are FORCED; rational motivations are beyond Robert Jordan.And, please, don't be fooled by the pyrotechnics at the end. I looked back at some Amazon reviews for the previous books, and I kept seeing things like, &quot;The first 700 pages were boring as sin, but the ending promises that the next book will return to the breakneck pace of the first in the series.&quot;Promises, promises. I can't hold my breath any longer.I give this one star, because I am not allowed to give it zero. This is some of the worst writing I have ever read, a shame given Jordan's apparent imagination. However, I have more than had it with this series, and will not be reading any more. Remember, this is a democracy, and every time you lay a dollar down you cast your vote. Stop shelling out for these books, and this series, at last, will come to an end."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Though all have been praying for the Wheel of Time to break free of the sludge which has been holding its plotlines in tow, Winter's Heart is still sitting in the mud. However, though it is again plagued with repetitive commments, pathetically worthless arguments, and flaccid characterization, it is clear that this series is definetly on the up.This is definetly a neutral book; no more, no less. I agree this series has gone downhill since around Fires of Heaven and continually plummetted until smashing like a pumpkin in the dirt in Path of Daggers. And for those of you who constantly recommend Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire', you have my full commendation and approval for that series is indeed phenomenal. But this series, the Wheel of Time, is definetly something to stick with. There is a reason that almost 2000 reviews were posted for Path of Daggers. We all love the series, but can't stand the rut it has fallen into. Yet, is not necessary to leave WOT for Martin. The Wheel of Time and A Song of Ice and Fire are very different stories. That is not to say one is bad and one is good. I am saying that we were all captivated with the series and it's magic in the first 3 books. We loved the magic then, so saying Martin's series is better due to the fact that magic is virtually non-existant is very hypocritical.This series' biggest problem is that after Jordan gives us such interesting characters, they become annoying, petty, and uninteresting. We were presented with great minor characters who had such potential. Faile, Cadsuane, Min, Elaida, they all seemed that the could be very interesting people. Faile, who's attitude and edge appeared initially interesting, is now so constantly irritating that you wish Perrin would just leave her kidnapped. Cadsuane, a character that I thought showed promise in the view of Aes Sedai, has pitifully become another bland Aes Sedai character. Min, who was the only one in rand's love quadrangle who seemed like a likeable, decent character, has become so much like Elayne that they could be the same good-for-nothing charcter. Elaida, the powerful woman who spoke in Morgase's court in Book 1, and who is not even in Winter's Heart, is nothing more than a frightened child.And if the the minor characters are losing it, the main characters aren't amounting to much either. Rand's love pool is becoming so stupid it should be blasted right out of the water. Elayne's absolutely unneccessary sex drive was the biggest ruination of the story. And not to far behind was Perrin's constant inability to deal with women, especially Faile, Berelain, and wise ones (who are even worse than Aes Sedai), and his ultra-dissappointing character.But, as we know, though we really can't stand him, Perrin will never die off. Min's viewings, which now seem like another everyday quip, pretty much describe what's going to happen. When she says something about someone, it's obvious that they cannot die until they fulfill her viewing. Perrin is needed at the Last Battle, so he will be there. That is another thing which is so blatantly bad about this story, it is so predictable. Besides Min's irksome viewings, you never think that any character will die. There seems to be too many safety nets out to catch them. And whenever anyone mentions something, even in jest, you know they will get it done. All to obvious was Rand's plans in the beginning of the Book. You know that by the end of the book, he will have succeeded.What a Wheel of Time needs is its characters to wake up and take charge. The boring, annoying, and uninteresting characters need to all be killed, and especially the useless ones (like Loial). The interesting characters need to make more of an appearance. I am really waiting for people like Galad, Berelain, and especially Moiraine to become more prevalent.The GOOD PartMat has returns to the Wheel of Time with quite a bang. His storyline is excellent, and very exciting. Though he is constantly griping, his plotline is the Robert Jordan we knew and loved. Certain characters do come into play. The Daughter of the Nine Moons shows her face. Hers was a long awaited coming and it was not really a mystery what her nationality was in previous books, but she was still an interesting addition. And captain Egeanin is back, as I hoped she would be, adding her own bits to Mat's storyRand is definetly on a mission in this book. Though that mission is fairly obvious and it is rather evident that he will succeed, his trip to Far Madding is a refreshing twist instead of travelling back and forth between Caemlym and Cairhien and killing off Forsaken in his spare time. Though the end is quite dissappointment in terms of excitement, the means of his mission is worth the ride.Nynaeve, who has become such a crab over the last few books to say the least, revives herself in my opinion. If you think about though, most of the time you see or hear Nyneave in Books 6-8 is through the eyes of someone else. Almost always, it is from Elayne or Egwene's viewpoint. And their characters are so backward that anything that they say or think seems like drivel. However, when the story is seen through Nynaeve's eyes, she herself seems like a decent character. If you can tell, it is Nyneave who still has the protection of the Emond's Fielders on her top priority. Egwene concentrates only on the Aes Sedai, and Elayne on herself and her kingdom. Nyneave seems the saving grace.Not many subplots are resolved in this book. Yet, there are better ones here, such as Daved Hanlon's new position, and Verin's questionable loyalties.To conclude, Winter's Heart is no spellbinding &quot;Storm of Swords&quot;, but still a worthy read which provides promise."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Like many other readers, I was blown away by the first few books. The complex world Jordan has built as welll as the development of the smaller group of characters from the Two Rivers had me waiting for each subsequent book to come out.But like a lot of others, I've become very disappointed with the tediousness of this series as of late. I've begun to wonder if Jordan is stalling the arrival of Tarmon Gai'don because he can't quite figure out how to do it. Jordan can surely write but let's face it, to write an apocalypse isn't all that easy. With all the secondary plotlines and characters he has developed along the way, he could be wracking his brains out trying to tie them all together, all the while writing \\"filler\\".Or maybe something is happening in Robert Jordan's personal life (i.e.: an illness, loss of a loved one, etc.) that is causing him to lose focus on this series. If that is the case, he should stop writing and take care of himself because that's much more important than the continuation of any book series.It could also be that since we've paid for his kids to go to college with the previous books in the series, he's now trying to set up a college fund for his great-grandkids by stretching out this series beyond all reason. Seriously, I found myself skipping whole sections of chapters dealing with various character's internal worryings (mainly Nynaeve's endless bitching about men and Elayne's endless bitching about men and almost every female character's bitching about men). And from reading other reviews about this book, I'm not alone in this.SIDE NOTE: Robert Jordan seems to think strong female characters have to be perpetually foul-tempered and be willing to hit male characters when their tempers boil over (imagine the outcries if the genders were reversed in these situations). Nynaeve's crabbiness was almost interesting for the first few books, but this got painfully old very quickly.That's a lot of \\"maybe\\"s to try to figure out why a series started off so brilliantly but is now almost a chore to read.The thing is, one shouldn't have to try to figure out this particular problem when reading any series of books. The enjoyment is either there or it's not and in this case, the enjoyment has faded big-time.If I ever decide to read the rest of this series (and that's a big \\"if\\"), I'm going to check it out from my local library. I'm not spending any more money on Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"How this made the bestsellers list, I will never know.Doubtless on the strength of the first few books... When I first read Eye of the World &amp; The Great Hunt some 7 or so years ago, I was excited by to see the debut of a new major fantasy epic (just love a good rollicking epic). I eagerly anticipated the 3rd and 4th books. Even possibly the 5th. Since then, it's palled more with each volume. I bought Winter's Heart out of a weird obligation to see the epic through, but though I've had the book for a couple of months, I can't seem to read more than a few pages at a time.I'm a woman, and am nauseated more than anything else by the women characters: a bunch of simpering, power hungry, self-righteous, smug creatures whom I could never imagine calling friends. For example, while I never (from the beginning) particularly liked Elayne, and REALLY disliked the sanctimonious Egwene, Nynaeve was a strong fiery character. Along with the Amyrlin Seat, Min and one or 2 others, she was one of the few I liked. She (and most of the others) have been reduced to mere cowering shadows of their former characters. Perhaps this is supposed demonstrate lessons in humility, administered by the obnoxious Egwene &amp; Elayne. ANd then.. the Kin? A KNITTING circle? The backbiting harridans of the White Tower? Boxing men's ears? Sheesh.I've heard Robert Jordan models his female characters on his wife. Whoa! That must be something.As for the rest, I agree with all the other criticisms: that nothing happens (800 pages to describe a day, with details of dresses, costumes and names of a huge cast of minor characters), endless repetition of the same battles under different names, and of course... you can never kill the creatures of the dark. They always come back. Oh woe. End it already, Robert!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"How many of you know that Jordan's editor at Tor happens to be his wife? Hmm, strange coincidence, eh? He's the cash cow for the company, so it's no surprise he keeps pumping out books in this series. Tor is letting him run wild, with no editorial control.Give him another editor who will force him to pare his books down by 100,000 words per book, at least.Otherwise, this book barely moves the story forward. I suggest folks read Martin, Kay, Sean Russell, Glen Cook or Robin Hobb for good fiction that has a beginning, middle and end."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"For someone who considers himself smarter thaa your average bear and a discriminating reader, i find it hard to rationalize for myself, not to mention the world at large, why I continue to read these books. At least I can take solace in the fact I haven't paid money for any book since five, which of course, has already lost its rick-shaw quality Tor cover. I came down to this realization: I already read eight books, goddammit- I have to think my time is worth something. I read each new book at a slower pace than the preceding one, hoping vainly to validate my needs. Whenever i hear that &quot;BOOK X IS OUT!&quot; I slather at the mouth and beg to be first in line for my more gullibles friends' copies when they finish. This slathering and twitching brings the truth out, for me at least- tWoT is crack, sold in the form of a book. It starts out nice enough, but the high diminshes the more you put in your body. You develope a kind of tolerance to seeing fire thrown through the air and hearing vaguely articulated plots by hidden Forsaken. By the time you hit book seven or so, you are now an addict: you no longer necessarily WANT the next book, but your need for it abides. It can lie dormant for years at a time, in which you can read actual pieces of &quot;Literature&quot;(you know-the good stuff they compare Jordan to when he gives them dumptrucks filled with money), but when you hear those magic words &quot;BOOK X IS FINALLY OUT!&quot; you begin shaking like a dope head whose methadone prescription has run out. You need the fix, and you gobble it up lickety-split. Afterwards you are left feeling dirty, confused, unsatiated and more than a little ashamed. Some readers content themselves with blatant lies, such as the popular &quot;Oh, this book was transitional- he's building to something BIG.&quot; So they said in books 4-8. In book nine something happens nine pages from the end, after six hundred-odd pages of filth. This &quot;something&quot; should have happened in book five, max. If Jordan wasn't paid by the word, no doubt it would have been. As it stands, I loathe this series about as much as I'm capable of while still retaining my addiction. In the meantime I will lambast it wherever possible, and after every new book read some real authors in an attempt to get the taste of Jordan outta my mouth. Thank god a Storm of Swords came out a week after Winter's Heart. The joy of reading Martin was more than enough to kill my self-loathing for being a Jordan junkie.Oh yeah, one last thing: I hope all of you Jordano-philes out there have realized the sad truth: he will die before he finishes this damned series. By book thirty one(which will take place about four weeks after book nine, knowing the way he keeps things a'movin') Rand will have seven arms, each tattooed, three pregnant women and a necklace made of forsaken ears. He will have conquered Seanchan in three hours using Callandor, helped by Perrin, whose control over animals will now extend to Elk, weasels and wombats. Why wombats? Because he's Ta'veren, of course. Once the elite Wombats of Manetheren have destroyed the Deathwatch guard and routed the three forsaken fiendishly scheming to control Rand &gt;again&lt;, the last chapter will see a litter of septuplets brought by shaidar haran to Shayol Ghhul. These septuplets will, of course, be reincarnated forsaken sent out to screw up another plan and be disemboweled by the ever increasing power of the slack-jawed yokels Jordan chose as his protagonists. When this book, which will be called &quot;The Litter of Seven&quot; is completed, Jordan will run out of air in the room he writes in. He wil die feebly and alone at the age of 98. Why will he die of suffocation? Because some of the money piles laying around him will fall onto his head, causing a wad of franklins to lodge themselves down his throat. At that point, the series will be picked up by the grandson of Terry Goodkind or someone of equally poor writer's stock. Tor books, by then a subsidiary of Wizards of the Coast, will continue the series again, at the breakneck spped of one book per day in the life of randland.enjoy, for you've been warned."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"1) Sweet mother of Ghandi I think Robert Jordan has achieve a world record for the most repeative writing in the history of mankind. Amazing. 9 books to prove it. Nine. The worst are the women in his series. They're boring, repeatitive, and downright stupid. There are times when I groan if the next chapter has the name &quot;Nynaeve&quot;, &quot;Elayne&quot;, or &quot;Egwene&quot; on it. This book is perfect for male bashing lovers out there. Rand, Mat, and Perrin are no better. Most of them still act like farmers and, after 9 books, still deny/refuse that they're &quot;ta'vern&quot; and still think kissing girls are yucky. Wow. I'm not sure if I want to pat them on the back or slap them. These so-called &quot;heros&quot; are going to fight the last battle and save the world. The world is in the hands of teenage pimple face farmer kids. Great! Why can't we have more characters like Lan? How many times must Rand bully the nobles? How many times will the braid-tugging skirt-smoothing shawl-adjusting smooth-faced stone-stared women must bicker between each other over minor problems that readers won't and don't care and will probably be forgotten with 5 seconds? Judging by the number of times Nynaeve tug at her briads half of her face would be torn off by now. Why does he write half a page of detail on what the Innkeeper wears? Or a servant?2) Unfocused. Big time. Two steps forward three steps back. Two old subplots get resolved, three new subplots emerge. When will it end? No one knows. Probably not even Robert Jordan himself. I find it extremely difficult to see him actually finish this &quot;saga&quot; within the next decade without loopholes. Some subplots are actually interesting but when you step back and ask yourself &quot;What does this has to do with the main story?&quot; and you'll realize it doesn't. I'm beginning to think that Robert Jordan love his world so much he doesn't want to finish it. The first 100 pages in this book are worthless. You can put The Path of Daggers and this book together and make it one volume. Robert Jordan it is time to let go. And it'll be okay."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, its been close to two years and was it worth the wait? Definitely!! The book brings back a significant number of characters from previous books (minor to major) and also has a halfway satisfying ending unlike the previous two books. Also most of the plotlines (save one major one but its forgivable considering all that happens in the book) are moved forward and you can start to get a sense of the end approaching though Jordan has said he will need at least 3 more books to finish it. Just one comment though...this book and book 8 could probably have been consolidated into one book if Jordan had not taken on 2 or 3 other WOT projects while writing book 8 but oh well...can't have everything."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book is awesome. Don't wanna spoil it for anyone who has yet to read it. It is a really good one and finally Matrim gets some light. Buy it, it is worth it. Couldn't put it down. The prologue is worth buying the E-book, it is a long good one."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am now on page 183 of this strong competitor for slow torture and absolutely NOTHING has happened. A majority of the main characters haven't even made an appearance as of yet. The entire 183 pages could be condensed into twenty without ANY loss in plot line. So does the other two-thirds of the book get any better? It does appear that criticisms of &quot;hair tugging&quot; seem to have taken effect, only to be replaced repeatedly with &quot;breath cold enough to see&quot; comments for every character thus far. Imperfect behavior modification? The series has come to standstill after the battle of Dumai Wells. Unfortunately, too much time and money have been invested not to see this through to the end."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I coulddn't put this thing down. As soon as I bought it I was reading like crazy except for occasional food and sleep breaks (can't forget school though). I was impressed by how the book's views are always changing. The Seanchan aren't as bad as you think and things are panning out to be very interesting indeed. I will have to say that the last 100 pages were some of the best and couldn't believe that it happene. Now I eargerly await the tenth book. I am just really happy that a lot of my predictions came true. I strongly suggest rereading some pages if you seek true answers, I know I did. Some things are just blatantly given to you now. Enjoy and no one is going mad again....."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Unlike the previous 3 books this one starts pretty good, then dies in the middle and picks up again in the end. The previous 3 books pretty much had crap until the end. I do think this one has shown a little bit of a come-back compared to the deathly slow previous 3 books. Therefore, I'm giving it a very cautious 3 stars.This late in the series I'm amazed that Jordan continues to create new sub-plots and a plethora of new meaningless characters. I hope he has an ending in mind. He starts it off by putting Faile and Perrin in dire straits, then leaving them there while we are forced to endure page after page of Elayne's boring political maneuvering, and the usual meaningless crap. I guess we will find out about Perrin in book 11 or 12.The characters are so fragmented now and so much crap fills the pages (description of new characters, color of dresses, what the horse's second cousin ate for breakfast.....) that you easily lose track of even the main characters for multiple books. Does anyone remember Loial the Ogier? He was one of my favorite characters and we lost him about 3 books back.I'm cautiously optimistic that the next books will be consistently stronger. I believe this, because there are so many loose ends in this series that will have to be tied up before it can be ended. The way Jordan writes he will have to start cleaning this mess up in the next couple of books. There is no way he can wait until the last book and reconcile everything unless he makes the last book 5000 pages long."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I found the book frustrating. I realised by the end that there will be no end to the series. The author seems to have researched his varied cultures very well, but I find he has stereotyped the women characters to one style, good or bad.Please end the series!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"You know I still love this series but can any one remind me of who's who? I don't think I remember half the characters from the first book anymore. Also I wonder if Jordan realizes that he doesn't need to bring every single kingdom of the world into the book. Yes I know he's building toward the final battle but honestly let's just have it out already!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"What happened to this series?? How could such a fine story devolve into a major disappointment?I'll be the first to say how much I liked the first four books in the series; in fact I would rate them all at five stars. Since that time there has been a downward spiral (read plunge). For some reason the plot has stagnated, there has been no character develpment and nothing of import has happened in the last five books! The grand Aes Sedai sisterhood seems to spend their time bickering about petty, trivial matters, such as necklines and hemlines rather than serious threats to their existance.The characters have not matured in any respect, but neither has the story line.One theory we have among us is that Robert has actually passed away and someone has been trying to finish this series based on his notes they found lying about.This would not be such a disappointment if not for the promise of earlier books. Can the series be saved?? Let's hope Robert finds his stride."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"In his latest book Jordan finally moves forward in his series. It took almost 250 pages in this book before things really start to happen. Hopefully, this is a sign that the filler books have been left behind and a resolution is on its way."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book seems to me like Robert Jordan inflating the tale. If I re-think my prior sentence, the impression I have in my mind (I hope is only one personal impression) is that he hired somebody to add chapters to the book, in an effort to reach volume 10. Mr. Jordan, it's time to plan on finishing!The initial books where fresh, following the whereabouts of the main characters, and they appeared to have a light at the end of the tunnel. At the middle of the lecture of this book, I found myself bored of so many new characters, some of them brand new with a very weak conection with past events. So, I had to exercise my will to find time to finish the book, though at the end of the book things were a little better.The last two books are a serie of lateral sequences. Again, seems like somebody is helping Jordan to add pages, and expand the volume of the story line.With so many distance between books, is impossible to remember everything that happened before.Let me finish with a hope that Mr. Jordan has already a written end to the serie. If something happens to him, I would like to know how Rand errands end with a defeating (or not) of the Dark Lord. Does anybody remember what happened with Frank Herbert and Dune? or Philip J. Farmer and The Riverworld?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"A funny thing happens through the Wheel of Time series: as the plots bog down in a mass of characters and subplots, the actual writing improves. This book is the best-written of the series thus far. Unfortunately, very little happens, although the rock-em, sock-em ending sees Rand's group in battle with numerous Forsaken, along with the resolution of Rand's plan to cleanse the male half of the Source from the Dark One's taint.The main characters are roughly split into 5 storylines at this point. One of them, Egwene's thread, is not advanced at all. Perrin learns of Faile's kidnapping, and that's about all that happens to him in 5 chapters. Elayne flails around Caemlyn and surroundings, dealing with the armies from the Borderlands (yes, they finally make a reappearence after 1500 pages) and starting to cement her claim as Queen of Andor. Mat finally reappears as well, plotting to escape from Seanchan-occupied territory; this subplot is the most interesting and entertaining, not least because Mat is the most interesting character in the series at the moment. Unfortunately, I fear he, too, has been saddled with an insufferable wife (as Perrin was), as we learn near the end of the book who his bride will be. Finally, Rand and Min set off on a quest to remove the dark stain on the male half of the Source, in the hope that this will eliminate the insanity problem that plagues men who channel (including, of course, Rand himself).Thus, there is a fair amount of advance in the story, at least in the Rand and Mat threads (and Elayne's consolidation of power was always bound to be long - it took her 4 books to simply get to Caemlyn, after all!). Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of action - most of the plot involves making plans, moving from place to place, sneaking around and spying, etc. Jordan's greatest talent, like Tom Clancy and others, is protraying clearly the chaos of battle and quick-cutting between points of view within the battle. With only one battle, covering half a chapter, it seems that Jordan's talents are not in full blossom here. So why the 4-star review? Well, it's clearly not as interesting nor exciting as previous books, but the writing style is vastly improved. His annoying tendency to give each character a defining characteristic and then using that characteristic incesently (e.g. Nynaeve pulling her hair) is almost completely absent in this book.Of course, nothing I say in this review is going to change anyone's mind about reading/purchasing the book. Once you've got to Book 9 of 12 , it's too late to turn back! (and the twelfth will be the last, as Jordan has recently passed away)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"On the good side of Winter's Heart, one can say that this ninth volume in The Wheel Of Time series continues on the multi-faceted adventures and worldscape that Robert Jordan has created. On the bad side of Winter's Heart, one can say that this ninth volume in The Wheel Of Time series continues on the multi-faceted adventures and worldscape that Robert Jordan has created.How can one say the same thing and yet claim that one it is bad, but two it is good? You would have to read the other 6500-odd pages in this series to understand. The problem as I see it is that Robert Jordan has created an exceedingly complex and interesting world. It is a world populated by different races of people with various agendas of their own. Unlike many of the Tolkien-clones, Jordan does not use dwarves, elves, orcs, and ogres. His characters are humans for the most part with a sprinkling of other races which are imaginatively detailed (Ogiers?)With a very complex world as your setting, it is understandable that it takes much times to describe the different societies and their customs. One of the fun things for me in this series is how much of it is dominated by the women in the world. It started out in Volume 1 with the description of the Wome's Circle and Aes Sedai, and continues on in this volume with the governmental structure of Far Madding. This sub-theme provides for very entertaining portions of the book as we see societies that are matriarchical in different ways exploring each other (the Aes Sedai vs the A'athan Miere; Seanchan vs Ebou Dar, etc.).On the negative side, this wide ranging and complex world is coupled with a very ambitious story line involving many characters in major roles. Since the characters spread out, it becomes a chore to follow them. I guess this must explain why we see main characters appearing and disappearing in various volumes. Two books ago, Perrin was not mentioned at all. Then, it was Mat's turn. At least in this book they are all present, but they move forward at different places and paces. The first few chapters deal with Perrin as he finds out that Faile was captured and deciding what to do about that while also following Rand's orders. Then, abruptly the scene changes to Elayne and her struggles to be recognized as the Queen of Andor; But this is just a brief interlude before we focus on Mat in Ebou Dar. This portion of the book actually is the longest (I think) and culminates in the introduction of the Daughter of the Nine Moons so an incremental move forward is made. Another incremental move happens with Rand but only after he gets to play at getting his revenge on some renegade Asha'aman.Of the main characters, Egwene only appears in a brief sequence in the dream world while Loial is not even mentioned. Cadsuane is becoming a major character while the Aiel are almost completely absent.In other happenings we get to meet more of the people inhabiting the world and even learn of other parts of the world. Did you know - before reading this book - that the Seanchan lands are actually bigger than the world that you have been reading about for 6700 pages? I did not and learned it here. But, that brought up a question in my mind as to why they invade the lands under discussion? Especially why do they need to colonize the world? The discussion of the Seanchan in the book introduces a very complex society with many of their terms and habits being described in painful detail. So, now the books can be replete with references to So'Jhin and Da'Covale as well as the other terms...This review is starting to look like a Robert Jordan novel so I will stop. If you are an avid reader of these novels, then you need to read this to follow the story to its next volume. If you are considering starting do not read this one. You definitely need to start at volume one and work your way through."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am about 500 pages into this book. And much like the last3 or 4 books in this series, the plot just barely moves ahead.I mean 200-300 pages of hair tugging, man hating women and woolheaded men is enough to make you yank a few strands.Also, now Jordan is either introducing new characters as if they are old ones, or they are old ones that havn't been in the story for so long, I don't remember them.Robert, end it already. I love your style of writing but pleasemove it along."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The Wheel of Time has matured into a soap opera... you get hooked, but then you realise how empty it all is. There will never be an ending, Tarmon Gai'don will never come, there are too many loose ends to tie up! And to keep up with everything you would need to read everybook in the series all over again to understand fully every characters role (Even Robert Jordan doesn't do this since he seems to forget about some characters). You really do get the sense that it's just going to keep turning as the wheel (world) turns. (cash flow...)I wrote down every name in book 7 (the worst book in my opinion) and I had 90 names on that list! (Maybe Setalle Anan was on my list two times... not sure!) My point is that in this book he's again telling the story of characters that we have either forgotten, or just don't care about (I'm tired of Elayne). Jordan gets us hooked on some characters but then puts them on the back burner, and forgets about them.People bring up the fact that the &quot;slow parts&quot; are meant to flesh out the story... Well there is alot of flesh if you consider a character as flesh. I crave for the feelings I had when it was 4 in the morning and I told myself.. ahhh, just one more chapter... Everything was fresh and new, and there was a sense of wonder and excitement to it all. I'm thinking of the Aiel (the politics, the culture,), the Ogier (they are long forgotten), Mat beeing the fox (not a limping fool) and Perin the wolf (now we only get a glimpse of his yellow eyes), and what of the Dragon... you only get a peek of him in the last chapter... I loved the Rand-Min-Elayne and Aviendha triangle(square I know!). But Rand is not the Dragon anymore... he sulks in his room all the time. And when he get's out he falls off a rooftop! Imagine that in a movie!Oh! and every question (ok... almost every one) that are formulated on the front and back flap are not answered! He can just print the same thing for book 10.I will read the 10th book, hoping that the last chapter of book 9 was a clue of things to come.The glossary was essential and well written in the first 6 books, now the information is bland and not very important. Who cares about Ishara, when what I want to know is information about Cyndane and Alivia.You want epic, go read Tolsto or Proust or Hugo or Dave Sim. That beeing said, reading the Wot series could be more enjoyable and less frustrating if it is read from gegining to end without stopping a year or two between books.nuff said for now... I guess that's what you call a love-hate relationship. Jordan and Tolkien in the same boat... I do not think so!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I feel this book as well as this series catch a bad rap based simply on the scope of it all.Personally my only complaint is the time between publishing although even this is somewhat excusable when considering the magnitude of what RJ has undertaken.I would now like to take this oppurtunity to remind people that this is not a fairytale,you are not expected to like all the characters even the &quot;good guys&quot; have faults much like real life.Bad things do happen to good and bad alike,this story deserves better than to simply be wrapped up and tied off with a pretty little bow like some thoughtless hollywood movie.My advice is to revel in the length of this series as you will not find a better written more in depth set of novels in this genre.Finally I thoroughly enjoyed Winter's Heart and anxiously await the next installment after some admittedly slow going."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"At least that is what is seems like in this 9th installment of the series. The ratio of pages worth reading to the pages of fluff has become completely inverted during the life of this series. If you buy this book, be prepared to skip lots of pages. You won't miss a thing."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart is better than the POD, sure. However, it still does not have enough plot development. Basically, nothing important happens until the last chapter. My major complaint is in the amount of characters in this series. There must be at least a thousand different characters explicitly named by RJ. Think about it. You have the various Aes Sedai in Tar Valon and Salidar, not to mention the ones with Rand or just wandering around. There are the many Aiel chieftains and warriors. Also,there are the numerous Wise Women of both the good Aiel and the Shaido. Then there are the people of the Two Rivers, both at Emond's Field and travelling with Perrin. Then you have the countless nobles of all the cities Rand has conquered(Tear, Cairhienin,etc). Next are the common folk of all the lands. How many innkeepers, barmaids, farmers, soldiers, and craftsmen have been encountered? Of course, there is still the Band of the Red Hand. Oh, and the Asha'mon. Whoops, can't forget about the Darkfriends. And the Forsaken are still around, what with reincarnation and all. Well, then there's the Seanchan also. The Borderland royalty are becomimg more important now that I think of it. To be fair, there haven't been that many Ogier or Aelfinn characters. I smell a couple of subplots coming on. Or maybe some stuff with the Sea Folk. Maybe RJ could introduce us to every being that lives in his world one by one. &quot;This is Bob, a Murandian barkeep. he enjoys walks on the beach and etc...&quot;"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan looks like he's returning to the form of the earlier books here, but the book is still slower, and more disjointed than the fifth and sixth.

The book contains some good, suspenseful fiction, as well as moving some of the main plots along quite nicely. One can tell that Mr. Jordan has an ending in his head now, and is navigating towards it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"While Winter's Heart is an improvement on the previous three books in the Wheel of Time series, it still needs a lot of work. The power of the first four books were that they all finished with a climactic battle involving all the main characters. Since then, however, each new book seems to isolate on one or two characters and ignore the rest. I had hope, however, with the cliffhanger ending of Path of Daggers, that Winter's Heart would go back to that previous tried and true method, but found myself let down. While Mat is back, which is always a bonus as he is one of the most intriguing characters in the series, Egwene and her rebel Aes Sedai are barely mentioned. Perrin, while at the beginning appearing to be one of the focuses of the novel (he even is on the cover) is dropped a quarter of the way through. Loial is not even in the book. Faile, like Perrin, isn't mentioned for most of the book. Taim doesn't appear at all in the book, and Slayer, though possibly mentioned once late in the novel (he's never referred to as Slayer), suffers the same fate as Taim and Loial. While there is a lot of plot progression in this novel, a reasonably satisfying climax, and the book on a whole is far more satisfying than recent efforts, this book still lacks the magic of the first 4. This doesn't mean I'm ever going to stop reading the series; Jordan has me, and many like me hooked. I can only hope for better in another couple years."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"....While this book clears up a few character ambiguities,allows us to indentify a few recycled personalities, and has asmashing good finish, it left me feeling, well...unsatisfied.Thereturn of Mat is welcome, as is discovering more about Verin,Cadsuane, and the Seanchan culture. But once again, Jordan gives usmerely a &quot;kiss and a promise.&quot;As in Path Of Daggers,characters appearing in the Prologue don't show up again for the restof the novel. The whole of Winter's Heart is set BEFORE the ending ofPOD, so Egwene has not yet set out to attack the White Tower. Perrinsets out to find Faile, but for all the 300 pages devoted to his pointof view, all he finds are her clothes. Aside from the majorconfrontation at the end of the novel (as ALL Wheel of Time novelsseem to end), there are no major plot threads tied off. Don't expectto know absolutely who killed Asmodean, if Moiraine is alive, ifSammael is still skulking about, or to know how many Forsaken arestill living by the end of the book.Ever since Lord Of Chaos, thebook pages themselves have gotten smaller, the font size bigger, andthe margins wider. While this installment may contain the action thatsome readers have cried out for, it seems whip from one point of viewto the next without truly forwarding the overall narrative. A decentaddition to the WOT story, but to me a disappointing end to a two yearwait. At this pace, I shudder to thing how many years it will beuntil the series is concluded."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have never not finished a book let alone a series before but I've had it. As the story went on I could find fewer and fewer characters that I could relate to and actually care about. Parrin was interesting while he was with the wolves but now all he does is say how Faile smells (usually [bad]). Mat was interesting but has barely shown up in the last books. As for Rand, he has about as much personality as the terminator. That leaves a bunch of scheming woman who don't accomplish very much. With thousands of pages in the series, almost all of the last three or four books, wasted on a bunch of characters you don't know or care about Jordan has gotten so far away from the main story and characters I find myself skimming the book looking for anything happening that will actually further the story. It doesn't.I decided not to buy WOT books after book 6 when it seemed he was milking it for more money but now their not worth the time it takes to read them, which is a shame because the first four or five books in the series were very good.If he ever gets back to just the war with the Dark One, who hasn't been mentioned in several books, and the taint of the magic and the good against evil thing it may be worth picking up again.

It's not too late...LOL."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"When I picked up this series after the excellent The Eye of the World, I was expecting to read a great fantasy story, not Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus done up in sword-and-sorcery motif.The good guys divide themselves by gender, and spend most of each book engaging each other in absurdly unproductive psychological warfare that never lets up. From cover to cover of of book after book, nearly every page contains some silly confrontation between men and women. The women are snobs in the extreme, constantly trying to assert their superiority over the men, who just bumble about scratching their beards, whining about how they don't understand women--over and over. The good guys refuse to engage in any direct communication with each other, choosing instead to practice deception and distrust even amongst their closest friends and jump to silly conclusions. This precipites a comic array of ignorance and misunderstanding that makes the heroes' lives, and their task of banishing the Dark One, considerably more difficult. But I suppose that's all in the name of publishing a greater number of novels.Jordan's heavy-handed foreshadowing allows even the least vigilant reader to know any event that will happen three novels before it actually does, and when it happens, Jordan writes it as if we're supposed to be surprised.The first few novels had a really strong buildup to a big ending. But with the last several novels including this one, Rand and co. mill around totally idle, worrying about their clothes and playing mind games with each other, for 95% of the book. Then, 20 pages before the ending, Rand gets up, says, &quot;Whoops, the book's almost over, time to have a climax,&quot; then teleports across the continent and does battle with someone. Then we don't even get an epilogue. Winter's Heart at least has a major development at the end; Path of Daggers denied us even that. But it still felt rushed and tacked-on. The action we've gotten in the 9 books so far, coupled with the interesting character development, could have been compressed into 4 or 5.Winter's Heart is starting to go in the right direction, but this story is getting way too cumbersome. There's no energy left. Let's pick up the pace Mr. Jordan."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It certainly wasn't as awful as the Path of Daggers. In the view of a hobby writer who (hopefully) knows what he's doing, there were a lot of blaring errors. He told, and didn't show (the opposite of Show don't tell). He was repeating the obvious - what everyone knew up to that point. He had all these long explanations &quot;What? A WOMAN warder?????&quot; when a startled or surprised expression would have sufficed.Although I had initially liked the fact that women were in all the positions of power, or most anyway, this made him have FAR too many damsel in distress situations, even in the most absurd of circumstances. It got old after a while. The very fact that no culture tries to obtain any sort of understanding with another is painful, and those &quot;Men/Women are woolheaded stupid people&quot; are annoyingly abundant...like tuna with too much salt.On the plus side, I really was fascinated by the political intrigue, just a little, and was reading those scenes where Elayne was dealing with who and whatever it was. The ending scene was spectacular and well-thought out and I was turning pages during Mat's attempt to get out of Ebou Dar.I must criticize the endings though. Unlike the first four or five books, where he had tied up all to loose ends, right now only one loose end is tied up and all the others are flapping in the wind. Even Mat's escape attempt wasn't completed fully. Rand cleansing the male half of the source was certainly good, and would have made the whole book great *IF* it had been leading up to that. Less than one-fifth of the story, in my opinion, actually had anything to do with the ending. Talking about Perrin, Elayne, Faile, and everyone else was just pointless blather that didn't significantly change a thing. Only Mat and Rand's story really affected anything. Maybe Elayne getting the Borderlanders sprinting towards Caemlyn was important, but not significant enough to spend as much time as he did in the Palace of Andor.It's certainly better than Path of Daggers, but only slightly, and not enough to redeem him yet from eternal damnation of angry readers."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The latest Robert Jordan novel continues the ninth iteration his &quot;epic&quot; epic. Although the book begins in the tedius, repetitive style more suited to afternoon soap operas than a book of this genre (which has afflicted the last few books in the serie the book picks up speed in the second half as the author returns to the adventures of two of his best characters, Mat and Rand. As the book reaches a conclusion, Winter's Heart becomes a real page turner.It is understandable that a story which has six often widely dispersed main characters, over a dozen other major characters, and literaly hundereds of other named and described people is going to move ponderously. It is a shame that a writer as capable as Robert Jordan has allowed himself to get bogged down describing so many of the periferal characters in such grinding detail. His writing away from the action is decidedly a step down for him. But as a fellow veteran, I must say the author has captured the FEEL, the sickening confusion, uncertainty, anxiety, and fear of war as well as anyone writing today. I can only hope he keeps the momentum generated by the close of Winter's Heart going in the next installment."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This story has branched out so wide, Jordan doesn't even bother to address all the major plots in this, the ninth book of the series. The end of book 8 has Egwene transporting her army to depose Elaida while book 9 never even addresses what happens. I read at one point this series would consist of 10 books -- good luck. I figure at least 3 or 4 more just to straighten out the various conflicts/competitions and then probably a couple more to give a second by second description of the final battle. It's too bad that RJ seems to have slammed the brakes on this story development as the early books were very enjoyable.

I realized as I read it; he hasn't. It's in hiding, but touches of genius reappear. Rand's actions at the end of the book are awesome, and I look forward to seeing how Cadsuane can help him overcome his stony nature - I miss the Rand of the first few books: a caring, yet dangerous, character. The one criticism I have for this book is that too little occurred. While some major events did transpire, we're still sitting around waiting for Egwene to reach the White Tower and for anything to happen with the Perrin/Faile/Berelain plot (does anyone else remember that Berelain is tied to Perrin - after all, Min did see it). I also want Rand to getdown to the business of hunting down and killing the Forsaken. And taking control of the rest of the world, so he'll be ready for the Last Battle. Oh, and did I mention kicking some Seanchan butt? We need more action as opposed to just a few things happening in each book. We also need Padan Fain/Mordeth/Ordeith to show up for a big showdown for Rand. We haven't hardly heard about him since the fifth book - there's a few mentions here and there, but not enough. Next, the line, \\"I'm in love with three girls, but I can't marry any of them - I'll just kill them when I go mad,\\" is getting old fast. I mean, saidin is cleansed! And Rand is half-Aiel, after all... I don't think it's too indistinct of a possibility for Min to become a part of the \\"first-sister\\" thing, either.

Jordan - enough of the no stop reviewing by the characters of instances and how a woman should act or feel - I like character depth - but you are duplicating to a point where your work begins degrading significantly.Lets get on with this - show us your plots in the writing style that we use to love - not the one that you have degraded into which just churns out rehashed material with a new plot thrown in here and there.You are an amazing writer - but MOVE IT ALONG!! 9 books is way too much, this would have been a significantly more effective series if the 9th would or even the 10th would have wrapped things up - as it stands - this could go on for 10 more books!Last - for all your readers - put in a synopsis that summarizes the last book in each book - it is a good investment of your time and a true benefit to your readers - having to rehash the last book because it takes 2 years to get the next one is just no fun.Now, in conclussion - love the series - it is amazing - just TOO BLOODY LONG!

I bought this book before a deployment to Greece, I started reading it, got to page 200, slowly placed the bookmark in it and closed the book. As I left Greece, I had a lot of full bags of souveniers and was very tempted to leave it in my hotel room to make room for some of them. I kept it and gradually, in very painfully boring spurts finished the book, if The Rock where to rate this book, any book after 5 for that matter he would most likely say &quot;This book absolutely SUCKS!!!!!&quot; Why does this book suck oh so badly? For starters, who in the hell are all these new people? Bobby my friend, you need to stick with the characters we know and love, it's fine to mature them and change them, it's part of life and we understand it, but don't just throw new main style characters in the mix. Secondly, it's fine to throw a bunch of detail out there, detail is good, it makes the book, but too much detail makes the book boring. Lastly, the book just plain and simple has no action, not that the first few had a lot, but they had enough to keep you enthralled. The simple fact is, Jordan has lost his touch, his direction, and yes, he has gotten greedy. Why do I still read this series? I don't, this book was my last chance for it. So for all you cheapo's out there, if you want a free copy of the book, I'll send you one free of charge. In the unlikely event that Bobby Jordan reads this: Bobby, if you feel that you can't finish the series in a timely and entertaining manner, let me finish it for you."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have been reading Wot for quite a while now and eagerly awaited this latest installment. I loved this book, and unlike some, I like the fact that Mr. Jordan actually writes out his sub-sub-plots for us to enjoy. I think the main problem people have is the nature of our instant gratification society. Yes, you have a long wait between books, yes there is a lot of side plots that don't have too much to do with the main thrust of the stories. That's ok. A well fleshed out story requires such things. he could have said- Rand was born, did stuff, fought in the last battle... would that be a &quot;good read&quot;? I don't personally think so. So to all the people freaking outover the length and number of books, be calm. Just imagine all the other little boring, plotless books you could have read instead."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"What surprises me most when reading the reviews of this and the books after 'Lord of Chaos' is that there are so many people bickering about the fact that 'nothing happens' in the books. I wonder what these people are looking for when they pick up a book. It is definately something different than I expect when I am reading. To me a good book takes me in, makes me believe in the world it describes, and that is exactly what happens to me every time I read a new installment of WOT. Again, in this book hardly anything happens; Mat finds his bride and Rand cleanses the male side of the source. And still, I put pretty much everything else aside to read this book so void of 'things that happen'. What matters to me is that the characters are interesting, and even though even I think Jordan could cut back a weebit on the stream of forsaken, when I read I find myself wanting to know more about everybody. What made me decide for 4 rather than 5 stars is that the male-female thing doesn't quite convince me and the fact that I'll probably will have to wait another year or two before I know more about the characters I have come to like. For people that want something to 'happen' I know a nice alternative. It's called 'movies', especially in expensive movies a lot of things happen. Usually a lot more things happen than the storyline really needs, but hey... that's what you want isn't it ?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This series has been dead for at least five books. Jordan became addicted to royalties (or has realized that many fantasy writers have only one good series in them) and has chosen to endlessly prolong the series. It is boring, the characters are flat, nothing happens and nothing has happened for five books. Finish the series already. Jordan is stealing your money now and will continue to do so until you stop buying these silly books. Who can blame him, if we are stupid enough to buy this crap then why wouldn't he keep writing.For those of you looking for how a fantasy epic should be written and paced I would reccomend George R. Martins A Game of Thrones, a Clash of Kings and a Storm of Swords. It is so much better and more interesting than the Wheel of Time that you can't believe it. Each book has been better than the last thus far and they are all better than even the best wheel of time books (ie the first two or three). Unlike the wheel of time the Martin series is probably not appropriate for children."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, I've just finished Winter's Heart and Path of Daggers (not in that order). It took me this entire time to even finish PoD and I can't say it was worth the effort. I also just finished the first book again and was blown away by the difference. The first book was gripping and a generally gut-wrenchingly exciting. Winter's Heart made my gut wrench alright, but it was typically in pain. Sure, stuff happened...whoopee. The point is, so much more could have happened and should have happened. An author should not reward almost ten years of devotion with mediocrity. And, not to jump on the bandwagon of complaint, but I think there must be a mass purging of nearly all the female characters if the series is ever to regain its former glory. I am a female reader, maybe one of the few, and I cringe everytime one of the major female characters opens her mouth. I mean, hey, we can certainly be shallow, scheming, manipulating, look-obsessed, power-hungry little punkies, but jeez! Every single one? Jordan's female characters are caricatures and I just lose respect for the male characters everytime they interact with a female. So, here is my plea, Mr. Jordan. Get rid of the most of the female characters or give your men some backbone when it comes to women...jeez. Tirade completed. Alright technically this was not really a helpful review of Winter's Heart, but I thought I'd air my grievances anyway. Sorry."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend... In this age, the Ninth age, an age yet to come (when is the REAL book 8 due out?), an age long past [due], the creator lost yet another loyal reader...Please forgive me the rather pithy, albeit petty opening of this reveiw, but at least I kept it succint. This is more than can be said for Mr. Jordan, although upon even the most casual perusal of Winter's Heart, the latest labor of his devising, one will feel compelled to argue this statement to a fine point.What HASN'T been said by Mr. Jordan during this episode and the previous? What meanial, useless point has he failed to press so far as to dull his once sharp plot and his faithful readers' wits? The readers who he snatched up in the first spinnings of his inarguably splended first 5 passes (one could justifiably argue the 6th and 7th passes as well)upon his Wheel, have been left dangling, desperately grasping for plot threads upon which they might find purchase for their loyalty of purchase. Sadly, the threads have become far too far unravelled for this. I will not even digress into describing the deliniated dross that comprises the bulk of this effort of fiction. Pointless points, Characterless characters (even those for whom one previously could care), and lots of words in between grind the Wheel to a halt.It's sad really. The Dark One was suppose to be the entity who's mission it was to sunder the Wheel of Time- not the creator."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The lastest installment in Jordan's massive Wheel of Time series gets back to where it should be.... almost. This is one of the stronger books in the series since The Fires of Heaven.The one major thing that lacked in the last book is back with aplumb in this one: Mat. By far my favorite character of Jordan's he plays a pivotal role in the book and his chance encounter with the Daughter of the Nine Moons.Perrin starts the opening chapters of the book searching for Faile who we learned was kidnapped by the Shaido Aiel at the end of the last. But after those first few chapters, Perrin vanishes from the text.Elayne sits on the Lion Throne in Caemylyn. Jordan fleshes her character out more and more. She is a very well rounded character now. It'll be interesting to see where he takes her in the next book.And of course there is Rand. He is, as to be expected, a main point of focus in the book. Jordan delves deeper into Rand's character and he becomes mroe and mroe rounded.One area of complaint though is the battle between the Tower and the Rebels. It is non existent. Egwene shows up only in the world of dreams and for the rest of the rebels and tower, they might as well not exist.A good book after the last. Now we buy have to wait 2 more years to see who gets excluded from the next."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I gave this book a bad review because it doesn't measure up to the quality one expects from Jordan. I think the problem started at book 6, even though the Lord of Chaos was excellent. It was the first time Jordan didn't write a complete book. He then continued this trend in books 7,8 and 9. Books 1-5 could stand on their own as a novel as well as being part of a series. Where as if one didn't read books 1-6 then books 7-9 would be meaningless. So it becomes obvious that this series is now being exploited for every dollar it can produce. This theory was supported this summer when readers had to pay 5 bucks to obtain the prologe. The extention of this series is deliberate and irritating. Remember Jordan used to put out a great book every year. Now its a half book every two years. Think about it, if he put 6 and 7 together, then put 8 and 9 together he would have had a great 7 book series. What really worries me though is the content of this book. Jordan takes a whole chapter to talk about Elayne taking a ride through Camelyn and he describes the sword fight between Lan and Toram Riatin in two lines? I think Jordan is falling away from the concepts that made this series great, not to mention becoming very greedy."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"OK this was definately wayyyyy better then the last book Path of Daggers, but then it probably couldn't get any worse. I really liked parts of this book, Jordan tied up some loose ends which I had been waiting for from about book 7. I also thought the ending was brilliant, finally unlike his previous ones which just sat there. And thank god, Mat was back and no Egwene, she just pisses me off. But can someone explain to me what Perrin's whole 100 pages of nothing was for?? He just did nothing. All that was affirmed was that Faile was taken by the Shiado and we knew that form PoD. Oh and that Berelain's *still* trying to trip him into her bed. Please Jordan, drop all that real desrciptive crap and write the good stuff. i used to really love his descriptons, but after a while they get very very tedious. You end up skimming, and then half the book is gone. Ultimately this was a brilliant, series. I loved it heaps and waited and waited for each part. If you've read the previous ones, read this, its way better then the last one and actually gets somewhere. If you've never read them, try them anyway, everything to about book 6 is excellent."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"the book it self isn't bad, but it goes on and on while standing still. how many times do i have to read the men's frustrations over women ? why does elaine have to &quot;think&quot; of all the politics behind every noble whose name is very important to remember, yet that very important noble will not be mentioned again ? why is perrin even mentioned in this book, his wife is kidnapped, but for some reason the author decides to tell me how he feels helpless and frustrated and makes me feel that perrin is not a figure worth mentioning in this book ? why is perrin being neglected throughout this book with relatively only a few pages about him and absolutly no progress in his plot ? and why, why do i have to wait for another book for so long ? eventualy i'll just be fed up with this rate of buisness and leave this series to more exciting ones !"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan has an amazing talent for spinning multiple plot threads into a fascinating and entangled saga. The earlier books in the series showed a great balance between fast moving storyline and enough detail to make the overall story a rich experience. However, the later books in the series (A Crown of Swords, The Path of Daggers) showed signs of major imbalance; there were so many plotlines that the overall story began to bog down. &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; finally gets the primary plot moving again, and even includes some tangible milestones towards the apocalyptic endgame of the series.I must warn you that several of the most recent books in the series has a victim of plot overload i.e. the character who makes no more than a token appearance because they've been edged out (temporarily) by all of the other subplots. While Matt Cauthon was MIA for all of &quot;The Path of Daggers&quot;, Egwene al'Vere and Perryn Aybara are the casualties in &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;. Don't expect to hear much from either of them in this outing.Despite these minor failings there's little doubt that Jordan still leaves 99% of his peers in the dust. Each book in the Wheel of Time series has been a pleasure to read and Winter's Heart is no exception. In fact, it was a welcome surprise after some of the slower-paced installments that preceded it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I was very sceptical when WH appeared in the bookstores. Jordans last two books were horribly disappointing, endlessly going on about details, I almost thought Jordan was getting paid by every word he wrote. But then this nineth part... Because I felt let down by this writer (as do/did lots of his fans) I didn't buy the book right away. No, I waited a few (I confess: agonizing) months. But now I've read it, I must say that it's actually good. Okay, it is still not as good as parts 3-6 but he is recovering. Gives me hope for the next books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After reading through the entire series (well, the 9 existing books), I came to the same conclusion as most. The last few books were a serious let down. However, the more I thought about it, the more I see that the last few books aren't as good as the earlier WOT volumes, but compared to most fantasy works out there, they are top notch. Be happy that you have been spoiled by this magnificent series and get off Jordan's back."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is what the last book in the Wheel of Time series should have been. Despite what some people say about it being longwinded, its really not. It is Jordans typical style of giving the book a feeling of realness. There are great plot twists and character development. The only bad thing I could really say about the book is, if someone new to the series (ie, never read the other books) tried to read this book, they would not have a good time. A knowledge of the previous books is essential."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, finally! I finally got the latest book in this very long series, and I finally enjoyed reading one again. The last two books were disappointing in that very little of significance happened to any one character, and Jordan seemed to be spreading himself far too thinly. This time around, he seems to have realized it and chose to focus the plot much more on a handful of the main characters (mainly Rand, Perrin, Elayne and Mat), devoting about a quarter of the book to each one.The other characters (Nynaeve, Egwene, Min, Faile, etc.) are still involved, but in a much more subdued and effective way, making more along the lines of &quot;cameo&quot; appearances than the tendency in the past couple of books of having their own sub-plots that wasted a chapter.There's still a lot left unanswered, giving me the impression this is going to be a 15-book series (if not longer). I also felt the final chapter was rushed. Yes, there was a lot going on, and the &quot;good&quot; side is much stronger than it was in the beginning of this series, but I still feel that Jordan glossed over this far too much. Without revealing too much, I'm annoyed that all we're told is that the good guys lost two people while only &quot;singeing&quot; a few Forsaken. Jordan gives the opening of the various battles, but then leaves you hanging and simply jumps to &quot;they've gone, let's end the book&quot;.If he had just fleshed out this a little more, I probably would have given it 5 stars (or four and a half, if they offered it). As it is, it's still a much better book than volume 7 or 8, which at times just seemed to ramble needlessly. Hopefully, when volume 10 comes out Jordan will get even closer to the quality of the first three books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First I must address some issues about Robert Jordan and The Wheel Of Time series in general. For one thing Robert Jordan is not focusing on minor characters the last few books, if you think about it during the last book Mat was recovering from injuries, now that would be exciting and relavent. Second his characters are very well defined and so is his entire world. The Wheel of Time is a very long series, but that makes it so much the better. In my opinion if you can write the worlds biggest conflict in less than 10 books it is not worth it. Now Winters Heart is just the latest addition to this wonderful series. Finnaly things are begining to come together. Now Rand finnaly makes some signifigant gains in his war against the Shadow. If you have read the previous books this is a must!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Yes, I am addicted to Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I need to know how the story ends, but unfortunately, Jordan's Wheel of Time books (aside from the first few) do not have conclusive endings. Winter's Heart is no more than a segment in a soap opera. This entire saga has rambled on too long. There are too many characters and subplots to keep track of. This is made worse when many characters and plots are not even visited from one book to the next. While Winter's Heart does provide some answers to the mysteries posed in previous books, the story in Winter's Heart could have been told in almost half the pages that were used. Do not buy this book if you have not read the previous eight books in the series. This one is only for the serious addicts, like myself."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book is paced muched better than the last two books. Also, it has a more interesting ending. This book ends with something that will effect the rest of the series, not just another &quot;I must fight a Forsaken&quot; type ending. The book has the main characters interacting with each other more than in the last two books as well. Overall, an enjoyable read. It is still better than most of the fantasy being put out today and appears like it may be finally heading towards a conclusion!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I was delighted when I read this book and found that a lot of questions that have been floating around for a long time were answered... But, I felt like they were answered just for the sake of being answered, and a lot of times, the answers were irrelevant and artificial-seeming. The book would have been so much better if the irrelevant revelations had been replaced with, say, the thoughts in Rand's head, and his reasoning, which lead up to the *SPOILER* cleansing of Saidin. That is, we hardly understand what is happening, which of course may be because Rand himself does not, but in that case I would like a little more insight into Rand's uncertainly, fears, etc. On the whole it feels like RJ has stopped story-telling, and is now using the books for an extended Q&amp;A session with mystery-obsessed readers. Still, I have high hopes for the future, and of course I'll continue to read them."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"For anyone thinking of jumping in to the Jordan series, I'd recommend waiting until it finally ends before buying any of the books. I coughed up the cash for the first five, but this series has really died out in the last three books.Series as a whole: excellent take on the epic fantasy concept, but the basic limitations of the genre are truly taking their toll on this reader's interest.Nothing happened in this book. At all. I haven't bought the last three books, I just checked them out from the library. I wouldn't recommend the investment of time, much less cash on this book.I'll probably check the next one out of the library when it comes out, but if Jordan continues his trend of churning out mass quantities of pointless text, I might not make it all of the way through."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As with everyone else, I think WoT needs to end. As with everyone else I am going to buy every single book till it does end. Winter's Heart is a great read for one reason alone: MAT CAUTHON IS BACK! Book paces pretty well and the finish is suspensful with the changing perspectives."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm anxiously awaiting the next installment, since I read book 9 the month it was released.. I've re-read the series 3 times up to this point, and there are a LOT of subtle details and subplots that you don't see the first time you read it.Book 8 was too short, and covered too short a time period. However, some of the excitement has been brought back with book 9, and I would like to see conclusion to some of the side-stories."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"*I hope the series never ends.I think people might get frustrated, because they read through a lengthy series, get to the end without the reward of a conclusion, and then have to wait for the writer to spin out more information. If you are ravenous about books, you will get through it in no time and wish there were more. I ate through these books in a month, and the time spent was highly enjoyable. You encounter interesting ideas about geography, gender, culture, and politics; all embedded in tales that allow you to escape humdrum life. I look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Thes books are getting worse and worse. The story in Winter's Heart just wandered around without getting anywhere.

There has been so many story lines introduced that it has became quite a job to keep up with them all.The first six books, in my opinion rank along side the Thomas Covenant books for sheer scope, depth and brilliant story telling.Number 9 is as good as the first 6. The comedy elements were excellent especialy the scenes with Rand,Min,Elayne and Aviendha, I won't give any of the story away but it was very amusing.The main problem that I have is that if number 10 is to be the last book it will have to be 3000 pages long to sort out all of the unfinished story lines."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It's been more than ten years now since this series has begun, and by the time Perrin finds Faile, or Mat marries the Daughter of the Nine Moons, or Aviendha has her seven children, this series may last another twenty years more. Actually, I do agree with the Amazon reviewer who says that this effort is somewhat better than the previous two or three installments. But not much! We still have Jordan wasting so much space on marginal or plain uninteresting characters such as Faile or Cadsuane. We still are being introduced to new characters who are just not given the space to become more fully developed such as Tuon, the Daughter of the Nine Moons, who spends most of her time wandering around Tylin's castle, and bumping into Mat. Worse still, is Jordan's use of villains in a story so rooted in good versus evil fantasy. Instead of focusing on one or two classic villains, he gives us whole groups of nameless, faceless ones, the Shaido Aiel, the Forsaken, the Seanchan, without ever giving us a chance to really grow to hate them. And as Rand destroys each adversary easily, Jordan has to dig deeper to find new opponents for Rand to fret about, each of course, being a little less interesting, a little less worrisome, except that it makes the story go on and on forever. Too bad that he brought Lanfear back as the weak and useless Cyndane, she might have provided us with a villain who could destroy Rand in a war and at the same time perhaps seduce him to the darker paths of the Forsaken. Instaed we are left, at the end with a battle scene which goes absolutly nowhere, as if Jordan can't spare the thought of killing off some of his less important characters. Strange, for a novel that has at it's core the need to destroy the world, that Jordan seems to have to go to extreme lengths to preserve it at all costs. As long as he realizes that it's his audience that he's slowly losing in the process."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Nothing happened in this book until the end and the ending was not really very intriguing......I am cutting my losses and bailing"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan's ninth instalment of the Wheel of Time series is a delight to read. Having taken the decision to not read this until the Crossroads of Twilight came out to provide immediate continuity I was instantly reminded (after such a long time away from the books) of the easy familiarity that Jordan provides. Whilst some epic fantasy authors suffer from a sense of vagueness about people and events after the long periods between instalments, not so Jordan.And so, we find ourselves, in the Winter's Heart, opening with the first ta'varen, Perrin, as he slogs through the snow on his mission to bring the fanatical Masema to Rand and is subsequently diverted south to chase the Shaido sept who have kidnapped Faile, making her gai'shan. We then race across to Caemlyn where Elayne has entered the city as the Daughter-Heir laying her claim to the throne of Andor (backed by Rand) but finding her position precarious and having to survive assassination attempts. In the process Rand turns up and bonds with both her, Min and Aviendha whilst Nynaeve looks on. What Rand has come to do is take Nynaeve and two ter'angreal in order to use the greatest sa-angreal made for both men and women in his attempt to cleanse Saidin of the Dark Lord's taint.We visit the ageless Cadsuane before the two main themes of the ninth installment take over. We are introduced to the child-like Seanchan, Tuon, Daughter of the Nine Moons, who arrives in the captured city of Ebou'Dar where Mat is residing under the silken bedchamber chains of Queen Tylin, whilst trying to avoid the gholam who is trying to kill him. Mat spends much of his time plotting to escape Tylin and worrying about the dice that keep rolling when ever he sees Tuon. Eventually, he manages to orchestrate an escape taking with him two Aes Sedai damane and sul-damane amongst others. Meanwhile across the world in Far Madding where the source is untouchable, Rand finds himself hunting down renegade Ashamen before both he and Lan end up barely escaping after encountering Padan Fain. After Cadsuane arrives in the city to assist him the group Travel to Shadar Logoth where he and Nynaeve link to the two sa-angreal to cleanse Saidin of the Dark Lord's taint. Inevitably the epic nature of the magic unleashed draws the Forsaken who end up in private battles with the Cadsuane led Aes Sedai who are protecting Rand but, by the very end as he lies unconscious the awe-struck Ashamen with them realise the taint is gone.Threaded throughout are the politics and subserviency-based matriarchal society with its WinderFinders, Aes Sedai, Wise Women, Kin et al who struggle to retain ascendancy in a World turned upside down by the Dragon Reborn. Most of the recent books in the series are given over to lengthy social dictates and the sundering of those dictates as an equality is sought and armies converge. Another enthralling episode by Jordan.What places Jordan amongst the upper tier of fantasy writers (though none of them have the ability, so far, to alter the very nature of their prose style through a book as Tolkien did) is that many fantasy readers put down the final instalment of any great series wishing it never ended.It looks like Jordan's finally giving the genre's fans precisely that and whilst everyone wants to race towards the climatic denouement you realise that by delaying it, Jordan is keeping the magic of the Wheel of time alive."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Out of the 766 pages of this book, less than 100 are worth reading. If you like over 600 pages of identical women trying to manipulate each other, while yanking on their braids, twirling their skirts, and turning a well-turned calf, this book is for you. If you like anything resembling the earlier books in this series (that's to say, anything resembling an interesting story), I suggest you skip to the very end of the book -- I certainly did.Normally, I hate abridged books -- I feel like they are an insult to the author's vision. However, if there is any book in the history of mankind that needs it, it's this one.To compare Jordan to Tolkien is like comparing a Harlequin Romance book to Homer's Odessey. Do yourself a favor and read a real Fantasy writer."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"If there is divine justice, the karma piling up from the loss of plant life due to rotten WOT books will inspire Robert Jordan to write a good sequel. In case he does not, I suggest printing Book ten with biodegradable ink, and pressing little seeds between the pages. This way, if the next book stinks as bad as this one, the reader can dig a hole, bury the book, and with luck...by the time WOT ends, have contributed back to the earth at least one tree to atone in some way for the needless slaughter of it's brethren."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Borrowing a term from the nearly endearing Dragonlance series, perhaps WoT is Jordan's Life Quest. And if it is, I highly doubt and sincerely hope he would never be foolish enough to compromise his incredibly robust vision to accomodate a mass of people with short attention spans. Granted, everyone has his or her own tastes in everything thinkable, but I don't understand why anyone would come this far along the road to Tarmon Gai'don only to find fault with the paths Jordan's children make. (Don't speak ill of the Creator, anyways. He might have you reincarnated as a silverpike.)Anyone who's not a woolhead knows that Rand, Mat, and Perrin are ta'veren. Thusly, they tug others in the Weave of the Pattern. Those people who had interacted with them 3 or 4 books ago are now being woven into the greater pattern of the pattern. Take Bayle Domon, for instance. When was the last time anyone even THOUGHT of him? Fain keeps popping up at the most innoportune times, waving that flaming curved dagger around like a bull-goosed fool at Sunday...ah, burn it. My point is, and the Subtle But Not So Subtle point which Jordan is trying to present is this: a work of art takes time. We may not all...agree...on the...necessity...of some of the characters (Egwene, for one. Just let Elaida have her shawl, she's Chosen fodder anyhow), we may not like the elaborate plots by nobles who represent the Light knows which nations, and we may as soon court a Trolloc as care a whit for Andor's fate. But we all care about the overall story, and most likely, Jordan revels in the fact that we care enough to coolly disdain certain aspects of his unfoldings. Peace favor your swords."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Looks like the diehard Robert Jordan fans, afraid for the series after the absolute BS that was books 7 and 8, finally have something to rally around. Thats because this book is actually better than Path of Daggers! Yes! Unfortunately its not much better. Why has this series turned to mud after book5, it started out with so many fans. Now the only people left going are those who are thrilled to hear that Nynaeve still tugs her hair when angry.The book is worth half a star, really (half a star more than Path of Daggers). It actually brings some major plotlines NEAR conclusion (i.e. Kinslayer) but Jordan is still dragging things out. Looks like the only reason the series is so drawn out is because Jordan wants to build up the suspense. Wow, Rand is hearing things again, there's a new one. Will he go mad? No one knows, and probably wont for a Long Long time. He seems perfectly sane apart from this occasional 'voice-hearing' thrown in. Apart from that there is STILL no major theme building! Its like a history book of Randland. with some decorations.The female characters apart from Min are as annoying as ever, and as badly drawn as ever. The Aes Sedai are STILL up to their dumb schemes. Can't ANYONE get along in this world? The people who hate the Dark One haven't yet decided to actually FIGHT him instead of just talk. And its book 9.Well, if you're a crazy Jordan fan (and I know some) then yea you'll probably love this book, its only a little better than Book8.

Don't put yourself through the pain."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The first couple of books were decent formula fantasy potboilers -- nothing to write home about, but nicely imagined and certainly better than some I could name. At some point, though, it all has to end. There's simply no conceivable excuse for spinning out exactly the same exhausted plot elements, over and over, book after book, until the end of recorded time. This thing is longer than the Bible. It's longer than the Bible and The Lord of the Rings combined. It's longer than the Bible, The Lord of the Rings, and the Annotated Works of Stephen King, with a little Proust thrown in for desert. It's even longer than that, and NOTHING IS HAPPENING. The girls get into trouble. The girls get out of trouble. Rand is tormented. Rand kills a Forsaken. Over and over and over and over and over.

I never read Winter's Heart or Crossroads of Twilight. I read half of Path of Daggers and gave up. Two months later, I decided to finish the other half. It started with boredom and ended with even more boredom. So then I decided to bail out on this series.After a while, I began to wonder about the next two books. I never read reviews for ANY fantasy book before reading it. But this time, just to make sure, I read some. Winter's Heart seemed promising. But I didn't care because I looked at the reviews for Crossroads of twilight (after 1600 reviews it has a 1 and a half star rating). Well, I didn't expect more. I have never thought that books could be THIS bad.I remember I read the 1st book and it was pretty good (not the best opening novel, though). Thankfully, I never spent a single penny on this series. I borrowed every book from the library. When I couldn't find the 2nd book anywhere, I thought that I should forget this series, because even the 1st book had problems. Most people bailed out on 8 or 9; I almost gave up at 2.But no, I kept going, and now I regret it. From book two to eight it just got worse and worse. All the things like the Horn of Valere (I just barely rembered that one), the heron mark blade (this one too), the Eye of the World, etc. are completely disregarded. Even though I didn't waste any money on the books, I wasted a lot of time on it. For those of you who want to give up, feel free to do so.I've read Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. Now there's something worth reading. Its the easiest way to get out of this wreck of a series. And I read that series BEFORE I read Wheel of time."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"An otherwise tolerable installment in Jordan's once-great Wheel of Time series has been ruined by exactly one character: Cadsuane. If you thought Jordan's women were annoying in previous books, you will probably despise Cadsuane. I was hoping that Rand would balefire her or at least show her how to treat the Dragon Reborn. Unfortunately, Rand, in a stunning (and, in my opinion, extremely out-of-character) move continues to accept her abuse. The other women in the book haven't changed from being annoying and ludicrously hypocritical, either. This trend throughout the series has always detracted from its epic atmosphere, and in Winter's Heart it is simply unbearable. I would love to finish the series, but I cannot bear to read such &quot;tainted&quot; books. I will always wonder what compelled the author to give the vast majority of the women in his books such characters."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is the second time I've reviewed this book: the first time I gave it 3 stars, and declared it an average read(worse than some, but better than most). Since then, I've read George R.R. Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' series. Martin deals with huge numbers of characters and multiple plot threads, and manages to move the story on at a blistering pace, all the while incorporating an impressive back-story, deep characterization, and rich description. The reason I'm mentioning this is that it really highlights the defficiencies of Jordan's writing (books 6,7,8, and 9 in particular). While WoT started off at a brisk pace, Jordan has become horribly bogged down in his multiple plot strands: there is simply so much going in so many places, involving so many characters, that the overall storyline has ground to a halt. Add to this Jordan's tendancy to describe every person and item in minute detail, and to describe absolutely everything that occurs between two points in time and/or space, and we have a recipe for a 15-20 book series. I relly don't think I have the strength to go on!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I can't see why anyone can possibly think that Robert Jordan's writing is deterioratng. The series only gets better with each new installment, and Winter's Heart is by far the best book ever written. The depth of description that Jordan can muster is second to none, and the richness of the seven thousand-odd subplots in each book is something to revel in, rather than a tedium that should be found to be rebarbative. I originally read this book in December 2000, and did again this December, wondering if perhaps I'd make it a yearly tradition. For any fan of Fantasy, this series is a must, even if only to get to this book, Winter's Heart.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"An excellent book. It's true that Jordan starts a few more twisting plot lines, but that's ok. At least he tied up a few loose ends.The ending is probably the absolute best writing I've seen in any book, ever.To you people that keep complaining about LOC and COS, shutup. When you have a story with this many plotlines and characters, you have to have some boring stuff. You cannot just skip writing about their sections because it doesn't involve the main character. It's part of the story, and it has to be written sometime. There is some of this in Winter's Heart as well, but everything is worth it for the ending.I think this is my favortie TWOT book. ;)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have read many books in my life, but none have come close to Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series. Tolkien never even wrote so well.He still offers the vivid, complicated world that he always has. Then why do people complain? They may say it is too long. I have never heard anyone say that War and Peace was too long. Believe me, I have read many 1000+ page books and they tend to go just as fast as a 200 page book; one page at a time.Another complaint is, &quot;The series is too long. Can't it end now?&quot; In other words they are saying, &quot;I can't wait. I am impatient and I want it too end right now.&quot;I have heard it said often, &quot;You can't have too much of a good thing.&quot; With Jordan's intricate universe of detail, the roller-coaster plot of twists and turns there is no other story more intricate and complicated than the world of the Wheel. It is almost real life, with the vision of the impossible so vividly clear, it is like a photograph. The reader almost believes that he saw a Nym or a Trolloc, a Myrddraal, Draghkar or Ogier. You can almost feel the One Power rushing through your veins! Any fantasy fan would agree with you that that is a good thing. After all, what fantasy fan would not want a series that a non-genre reader could pick up and enjoy and would flip off one of his &quot;Breathren&quot; for looking at him cross-eyed. (Don't do that; it would not be positive.) That would give fantasy a good name (and believe me; that is happening of late.) But really, how many good fantasy authors have there been since Tolkien and Lewis. There have not been many more than twelve over the last dozen years. Maybe three before that, but only one would be considered in the elite today and even she does not really come up with anything original. What more could a person want?How do books become classics? They stand the test of time. They stand up to a baroge of critism and they servive. And sometimes, they even flourish. Robert Jordan's book sales have increased 30 to 40 percent with his last three books. (Winter's Heart being 40 percent.) Yet many people will tell you that the last three books are the worst. I have read them all and can tell you the last three books were the BEST and that is why they are out-performing the rest and selling more with each new title.A little tip: No one has ever built a statue for a critic and noone ever will (unless the critic will be another Joseph Stalin).If you are new to the series, begin with the first title The Eye of the World.

Granted, it was slow-moving, but he needed to do that to keep the characters in place, lead up to events, and keep the integrity of the book! And just because it didn't FEEL fast moving doens't mean it wasn't. Rand not only got to see his three women (*giggle*) all together and say that he loved them (etc), but he killed some of his enemies (those insipid Asha'man) and cleansed the source. Mat found the daughter of the nine moons and got away from Tylin (if that isn't an amazing feat, what is?!?) That's four large events and I probably missed some as it is. Usually, all this fastness that you're all talking about is made up on little events and one or two bigger ones. This one has at least four. And as for Egwene he COULDN'T have her in the book without ruining it! Have you ever heard of time?? Why do you think when Rand used the rainbow-colored stones (can't remember their name... it was in one of the first couple books...)to travel to catch up to Fain (I think... its been a while)? You know why it took him months to do that? Why Jordon didn't just have him travel or have it be instantaneous? Because of TIME!!! Egwene and Elayne and Nyneave had to have been in the Tower for a while so he skipped those few months using Rand the the stones. Its the same thing now. Egwene isn't DOING anything but getting ready to attack. While she's getting ready, Jordon is concentrating on other people. Do you WANT to know how much the soldiers are getting paid, what they're doing in training exersizes, etc? That would be even more slow-moving than this book was!

But Jordan has taken it a step further. With this series, he has introduced us to a world of imagination and glory, a place where a tale may never end. The charectors, including Rand, Perrin, Matt, Elayne, Aviehenda, Egwene and others, are so detailed and thorough that you believe you know them in real life. The details of the surroundings, the way things are described, all are Jordan's ways of painting the oh so perfect picture of the story in our minds. The series dosn't seem to tell about a made up fantasy, but instead of a historical invent witnessed throught the eyes of the author then relayed back to us, the readers. In every book, Jordan seems to know just how to add things in, and create a richer world for the charectors to explore. But the deatils arn't all of Jordan's talent. The plot itself is a unique tale. Many other authors have written fantsy stories, with wars and magic, but Jordan seems to do more than just tell a story, instead he allows you to enter it. The plot follows many main and non-main charrectors, each contributing a part to the story's patteren. It follows Rand, as the Dragon Reborn, with magical abilities, and trying to controll himself from going mad. Or Elayne, queen of Camylen. Or Matt, whose unusuall talent of gambling tends to get him in trouble. And Perrin, a wolf brother, and so many more. Jordan seems to let the charectors write they're own story, while he acts as the supervisor. All in all, this series is one no fantasy reader, correction, any reader, can put down."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"If you need a good, long book series look no more, The Wheel ofTime is waiting.I'd love to place a complaint, Damn people whin of the series tolong, Hell, look at Harry Potter and The Order of Phoenix (of c-ourse I like Harry Potter) but do not listen to the souls who i-nsult this wonderful, Tolkien (since he died) replacer, think ofRobert Jordan as The Vice-President...

Then again, once I step back and review the scope at what has been written, I am impressed at the vision of what has been created. I have read, on numerous occasions, the critiques of the volumes written to date. Many lambast RJ for the wordy, pretentious length of his saga and others comment on his innate ability to drag this out and still suck people in to buy the next volume. My response is....why?Dickens was paid by the word and people in the 19th century lamented that he was not wordy enough. They waited years for his next installment of the Pickwick Papers. Yes...years (remember England was a global empire and there were no waygates). Again...why? Do you really care how many volumes it takes to finish this story? When was the last installment of the Dark Tower series by King? Anyone...?For those of us who enjoy the scope, the character development and the plotlines of what has been written we congratulate RJ on a work welldone. For those of you who are of the comicbook/videogame/short-attention-span ilk...step back, take a deep breath and concentrate on one character, say Rand for instance. Remember how he was in Book 1. Now trace his development through the series (you could, of course, trace any number of characters. With the exception of Nynaeve, all went through a growth and maturity phase). Having done that....how much time has elapsed? 5 years, maybe 6? Do you begin to appreciate the scope of what is being written here?Relax and enjoy the show. If you're bored maybe Wheel of Fortune is on and don't read the next volume (if, and when, it comes out). That may peak your interest.

Do you really want him to finish the series with the next book?. Seriously. Think about it. I, for one, woould be very disapointed if he did. The Last battle should at least take up 2 books. And think of all the Prophecy he has written. If he doesn't take the time to deal with it I KNOW all you readers will be disapointed.I do agree with you that books 7 and 8 were a little boring. Obviously not the best in the series.

Really i can. I can calmly sit here and read the Robert Jordans faithful fans have abandoned him. People who waited in lines for his books. I can understand that. To tell you the truth i might have said the same thing a while ago. but, you see, i grew up. I started reading R.A Salvatore when I was in fourth. His books are great, action packed with tons of exciting battles. But to tell you the truth, when a character died i really didn't care. The characters just didn't have depth. I recently read a number of Mercedes Lackeys novels. Unlike Salvators action adventures her books were set in a world where i could belive in true love. Her characters have not only acheived a normal level of depth but they have surpased even my expectations. I was brought to tears by the thoughts of a woman as she cried over a lover she couldn't have. And yet these book were not perfect either. The lack of action made them slow, almost dull at times. When a friend of mine introduced me to Robert Jordans Wheel of Time series two weeks ago i thought i had found the best of both worlds. Jordans books merged my most inventive dreams and hopes of what a fantisy novel should be. Not only did Jordan merge the worlds but he has written books that can satisfy even my thirst for pages(I read a mite bit fast). The characters he has created before our eyes, grow, bloom wilt and die and as much as it pains us to let them go, we must. Some reviewers say Jordan has no idea where the plot is going, then tell me this: how can a suggestion in book 2 lead to a prediction in book 7 and to the reality in book 9. Did you really think you understood the complex plots and themes woven into the life of this world? AS to the new characters let me say this, the blood line was getting soft, just as Failes blood line was getting soft. Nynaeve is changing. She is not abandoning who she was, she is blooming. She is maturing and growing up. That is what i sugjest you do. And when you have, look back at Robert Jordans books.

For this particular book the characters are getting to thin and far too many of them are seeing storytime. I think that having up to twenty characters infiltrate the scene is powerful, but it is bogging down the story. Truly only one important event has taken place, the cleansing of the male source, but nothing else except a setup of a multi-story cliffhanger that by the time the next novel ocmes out there will be little in my mind about the series remembered.

It's ironic because these are the same people who would complain if there were too FEW subplots, or only a handful of characters to follow. it probably stems from the frustration of being a reader of books, but having a lack of talent to actually write. Here is a little piece of advise - These books come from the imagination of a man who CANNOT write them any other way! To ask him to do so would be like asking him to stop breathing or eating- it's just not possible. If you want to become a part of his world than do so, read the books, skip over parts you don't like - take what you want and leave the rest- but enough of this whiney, sniviling BS. THESE ARE WONDERFUL BOOKS! They are part of an imaginative mind that can weave a story that very few of us readers could consider trying, and as long as he can keep up with the subplots and characters then that should be enough. You just enjoy the tale or put it down and read something else."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Before I vent my frustration, let me say that Jordan is clearly one of the most talented sci-fi world creators that I have ever encountered. Unfortunately, the latest installment in this series, much like the past two, fails to advance the plot sufficiently. After plowing through more than 600 pages, I would like to feel as if the main characters have moved closer to ultimate resolution of the main plot (in this case, the Last Battle). However, Jordan seems to be dragging his feet. In fact, some of the progress made in the first few books now appears to be undone since basically all of the Forsaken previously thought to be dead have returned in some form or another. Some writers are so quick to wrap things up that the final chapters seem more like news reports than fiction. Jordan certainly doesn't have this problem. The slow pace is killing the momentum of this story.Bottom line, I will see this series through to the end because I have invested too much time thus far to end the journey now. But I would like to see a quickening of the pace.

The basic premis is simple and despite what many fans would have you believe the characters are simple. So why the long route to the conclusion? Which I assume is Rand battling the dark one on the slopes of Dragon mount. It's revealing when the most interesting character is the legendary Artur Hawkwing who even when mentioned in passing is far more fascinating than the central characters. Characters like Mazrim Taim and Lan are under utilised, only the Seachan are of any real intrest. The basic thrust of my reveiw is that series is too damn long and is rapidly becoming boring. I was told by a very reliable source that Robert Jordan is a fan of Paul Edwin Zimmer I would suggest that he then takes a leaf from his book and learn to get to the point and consider writers like Paul Kearny, Glen Cook, P.C.Hodgell, David Gemmell where quality is not defined by volume, the only exception to this rule of late is Steven Erikson writer of the Marvelous Malazan series. All in all a very disappointing book but then I'm certain all the Dave Eddings/ Terry Brook / Tad William/ Fiest fans of the world will continue to ensure that more of this increasingly tedious series continues."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan constantly leaves us wanting more, and this book is no exception.

Though the series has stretched out to nine books, each is still compelling and interesting.The characters are invigorating and alive, full of quirks and nuances. Though I recommend starting from the beginning, reading any of these books will leave you hoping for more. I began with Dragon Reborn and then went back to read those before it.Jordan is a master of storytelling, describing his fantasical word in great detail, bring his characters to life and making us care for them, or hate them and paint an eloquent picture of what his story has to offer."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan has his strengths and weaknesses, fortunately, this book displays more of his strengths. Agreed, the series is getting long, agreed there are too many side characters to keep track of, and agreed that he needs to roll the ball a bit faster - &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; may be the off ramp from the circuitous and overly-long character development books 6-8 displayed we\`ve been looking for. The best characters in the series are featured (Rand and Mat), and they both progress the plot in-totum significantly. The conclusion of this book is the most exciting finale of the series so far (including the spine-tingling endings of &quot;The Great Hunt&quot; and &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot;), and so shatters the world Jordan has created one must guess he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.There are some problems with Jordan\`s latest effort, however. Essentially, the Perrin plot-line has been dead since the end of book 4, and about 1/4 of the book concerns him. Fortunately, Jordan freezes this plot-line early on; unfortunately, it means he will have to thaw it in the next book. With some exception, the Elayne-plot line is also growing cold, but it is not given much ink. One thing that Jordan seems not to understand is that some of his most interesting characters are the evil ones (a lesson that Dante taught us well over 500 years ago) and yet he reveals them so sporadically, and with so little real &quot;evil&quot;, I sometimes find myself cheering them to succeed - if only to justify the great pains to which the heroes in this book suffer to destroy them.If I had to rank all 9 books of the series: &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; would certainly be in the top half of the series, perhaps even 3rd behind &quot;Great Hunt&quot; and &quot;Shadow Rising&quot; - but honestly its the superb Mat-plot line and the finale that pushes it there. It is good, but not as masterful as its two betters."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Here's the skinny on the leather-bound edition. Arrived in cardboard wraps. Board slipcase, exterior in dark green leather, no markings, white interior. Volume is fully bound in dark green leather. Faint oily residue from both. Gold imprint of the title, author and publisher on the spine. The fit is snug, but the book slides out easily.Both front and rear endpapers are the color map of Randland. Book Nine starts on p.15 and ends on p.656; Glossary runs to p.668, followed by one-page &quot;About the Author&quot;.Signed in black ballpoint or similar on the first page (facing back of the front endpaper) by Robert Jordan, above a printed paragraph that reads, &quot;This signed limited edition of *Winter's Heart* is published in an edition of 202 copies, of which 150 numbered copies have been released to the trade, and 52 lettered copies reserved to the author and publisher.&quot; Below in black broadpoint is &quot;69/150&quot;. On the reverse side, embossing is evident from the hand-signing by Jordan and the edition number.Copyright page is identical to the trade hard-cover edition, though the actual release was February 2001. Between the copyright and dedication pages is a double-page color plate of Darrell K. Sweet's cover art, without text. Sweet's copyright is on the reverse of the second plate.Collecting purists will not want to open the cardboard case, because it too is numbered, albeit in black marker. I'm no purist, but I kept the box.In all other regards, the edition seems identical to the trade hard-cover edition, including the poorish paper quality (waviness seen along the top and bottom.) One star is deducted because the Glossary is word-for-word the same as included in *Path of Daggers*.On the content... I wrote a review early on, after reading the uncorrected proofs, but it's since vanished. My impression is that this is the first book in the turn towards Tarmon Gai'don, that from *Crown of Swords* to now has been that lingering on the crest and *Winter's Heart* is the first step down the other side.The Prologue is extraordinarily tedious, couldn't remember the first character for the life of me, nor was she listed in the Glossary. (I eventually did remember.) But even there some gems are found. Certain developments with Elayne, Avienda, and Min are...intriguing. Mat's return was nearly anticlimactic, considering he was buried by a building last he was heard from. And I may be wrong, but I can't recall Nynaeve tugging that braid even once! Light be praised!The book includes what may be the best last chapter I've ever read. Something very cool happens (beware earlier reviews; some give it away and trust me, it's so cool you want to wait for it)."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I absolutely love this series! The previous 2 books were a bit of a dissapointment, but with Winter's Heart, Jordan, at least in the last 100 or so pages of the book proves that he hasn't lost his touch. I do wish, however that Jordan kills Perrin and Faile off! They're so annoying and the Aiel should just return back home. It's so good to know that Alivia is the strongest woman with the One Power, Nynaeve was starting to irritate me with her arrogance. Cadsuane is just brilliant. You can tell she has vast experience in dealing with foolheads like Rand and his number of girlfriends! I pray that Moiraine returns with a vengence, but I don't see how, because Lanfear really did die in that fight with Moiraine, so if they fell into the same pit, I can't see how Moiraine would have survived.If Moiraine returns she'll probably be an ordinary woman without any power at all. That's the only reason why she is going to marry Tom. Sisters of the Blue Ajah don't have husbands and I hardly think she will go Green.Anyway, this series is definately picking up pace! I absolutely love the smaller plots with new characters and stuff! It makes for an epic Last Battle! Everyone plotting against everyone else...this is gonna be huge!Jordan could try making the Forsaken a little formidable! You can't even tell that they're from a much advanced age!Please don't complain that this series is too long, I hope it never ends.

I, for one, prefer to have something left for me to do with my brain beyond passive entertainment (or I'd be watching TV instead). I'm afraid that Mr. Jordan has stretched 6 books worth of plot into 9 books worth of pages in a distressingly Jean Auel (Clan of the Cavebear series) like manner. I appreciate the fact that complexity of plot is important but GET ON WITH IT!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book really didn't live up to the expectations created by the unfortunately long wait loyal fans endured. Still, this really wasn't all that bad. The pace at least accelerates from the previous few, with some plot lines even moving somewhere (Perrin being excepted, and being the most notably neglected main character of late, even if Mat wasn't even in the last book). Still, it definately leaves more loose ends than it ties, causing a great sense of &quot;so what?&quot; and not the extremely satisfied and eager energy present from the early books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As always, this book is no quick read. It is long and involved, with the slowly evolving plot turns we have grown used to in Jordan's writing. However, contrary to what many reveiws may tell you, it is not SO slow as to become boring. Unlike the lasy book, Jordan has stuck in enough exciting battles, stunning relizations, and tricky plot twists to keep the pace from faltering to much. I think this is a good read even for someone who is not a hardcore fan, and certainly for those who have read most of the series. Just beware the couple of long chapters about the Seanchan.yaawwnn."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, I understand where everyone is coming from with this whole thing about the series being to slow. Each book contains ~800 pages, and there are nine books and going, but I still think it's worth it. Slow, yes, but that makes it interesting. I think Jordan could definately speed it up, but all in all the series is the best in print. There are enough plots, sub-plots, and major and minor characters to get almost confusing. This, however, is what makes the series so good. Admit it, every Jordan fan was first drawn in by the deep, and realistic like story lines and characters. No offense, but I just don't understand people who &quot;bite the hand that feeds them.&quot; Anyway, just thought that I'd like to put up what I was thinking"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Along with other fans of this series, I was anxiously awaiting the next installment. But all I can say is that I hope Mr. Jordan will slow down and take a bit more time before publishing the next book. This is a disjointed, dull effort with little plot, not at all on par wwith earlier, exciting novels. Characters who were developed at length in other books do not appear here. Most of this novel's characters -- and their often complicated backgrounds -- are never reintroduced. It is assumed that the reader understands the most casual of references to events that occurred in previous books. But only those who have thoroughly digested all eight other books have a prayer of understanding what is going on. I was very disappointed in this novel."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Granted, the pace of this book falls short of the pace of some of the earlier books in the series. Some of the descriptions do get a bit repetitive, and some key events and details were glossed over or omitted altogether (Whatever DID happen to Herid Fel's clue? And 2 sentences for Lan's fight with Toram?!?). However, Robert Jordan's story managed to keep me enthralled, as focus has shifted more towards the actual plot, which has become so detailed and convoluted that I would be thoroughly engrossed even if the characters were not developed as beautifully as they were. I think the change in tone in Jordan's more recent installments reflects the fact that much of the character development has already been accomplished. We understand the motivations, character, and thought processes of the major characters pretty well by now, as the characters have (for the most part) finished progressing from juvenile to adult. A lot of the early character development reflected the fact that the characters were still growing into the roles destined for them. Now that they have matured into their roles, Jordan's focus rightly shifts to the details of the plot. This focus on the plot appears to weaken this book, as most of the plot is either the continuation of previous storylines, or the beginning of new storylines. Very few plot elements are actually completed in this book, which only heightens the anticipation of the next book. However, the plot elements that are completed will have tremendous impact on the overall storyline. Overall, I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars, because the book doesn't have quite the impact of some of the other books in the series. However, it is a necessary piece of the larger epic, which deserves 6 out of 5 stars in my book. For those complaining because of the abundance of descriptive detailing, or the intricacies of the politics revolving around the plot, well, the interplay of the multitude of characters' perceptions, desires, and motivations are what makes the Wheel of Time such a brilliant epic. Real people plot, make mistakes, behave in a petty matter at times, and sometimes worry about inconsequential things. Jordan incorporates this into his characters, which is what makes them so believable. The idea that it would be preferable to just read plot summaries of the later books, or that the only important parts are the first couple of books and the eventual finale, is ridiculous. Why not just call Robert Jordan and say &quot;I don't feel like reading anymore. Just tell me who wins.&quot;?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"things can only get worse.....if your still reading these books, do yourself a favour and find a series that actually goes somewhere....starts off alright and ends in boredom"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I wish I was Robert Jordan. Who else could throw a couple plot line bones to readers every 2 years for millions of dollars. Anyone who doesn't admit that Jordan's producing water downed novels to extend his WOT cash cow is either dillusional or a fool. I can predict every description of each character when they get angry - which is too often. Pull hair, scowl, glare, etc... Ughhh. I'm glad I didn't pay to read this book. The rest of you who pay for this drivel, say Baaaaaa like good little sheep."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The last time I reviewed RJ, everyone was screaming about how horrid &quot;Path of Daggers&quot; was. Now, everyone is screaming about how dreadful &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; is. Amazing.First off, if Jordan is such a poor writer and his books are so ghastly, why do you keep buying them? Just what are any of you whining about, if you want it to be the same book nine times in a row, why not just buy nine copies of &quot;The Eye of the World&quot;? It's not like your reviews are going to get any different. Your complaints certainly haven't gotten to be any more creative.Once upon a time, there was a thing called the Hundred Years' War. Nobody ever knew what was happening from one district to the next, never mind on the other side of the continent, people dropped out of sight, news got convoluted and confused, and in fact, sometimes people didn't know if family or friends or even an entire population was even there anymore.And amazingly enough, it wasn't over in a day... or a week... or a month, or even two years. Lots of information got lost. Not everything got resolved. And life went on, so lots of new things started up, and sometimes, nobody was really certain how they were going to turn out.Today we have a little problem called The West Bank. Hasn't this conflict been going on for about 52 years, now? Does anyone know how it's going to turn out?Personally, I find the story fascinating. I've enjoyed reading about all the characters, good and bad, and I've watched them grow and change throughout the telling of the tale. People who seem insignificant in earlier rhetoric pop up in a pivotal moment and turn everything on its head. Some who seemed key suddenly disappear, and who knows? They may surface again, or may not, and perhaps they weren't so important as I might have thought. Kind of like people I see every day, in work, in school, in town, on the highway in passing cars. Some things have been resolved, to my immense satisfaction. Some things have been introduced, which I find intriguing. Some things were left hanging, and I'm going to wait with baited breath for another two years, I suppose.Ah, the two year wait... as a spoiled rotten brat who didn't get into the series until &quot;The Dragon Reborn&quot;, I had the advantage of not having to wait at the start, and now I anticipate each release. I eat this story up with each new publication, and I re-read each of the older books before I read the new one... and get something new out of the series each time.Now: I only call this book 4 star quality because I cannot call it 4.5 stars: I think the only 5 star book was The Dragon Reborn. And OK, truth be told, Path of Daggers was a 3.5. The Fires of Heaven, by the way, I think was the weakest link. I'm sure I'll be lambasted for my opinion on that. Oh well.I would not even presume to say I can write 5,000+ pages of literature. And until one of you would-be critics can produce that sort of output, why don't you hush? Because I truly enjoy the experience of reading this story -- and I recommend it highly to everyone who enjoys smart reading.by the way, I would not presume to criticize Tolkein, either."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I read the first book in the series and couldn't wait for the second, read that one two and then the third, fourth and fifth.

Enough is Enough, I'm not investing anymore time or money until the last book is finished and Everyone is at home.

I think this is false. It is false because many people fail to see that it isn't his writing that has gotten worse, it is the plot that has gotten smaller in the books. This isn't bad because it alows him to fill in detail he wouldn't be able to fill if there was action and adventure all through the book. This book certainly has more action that the previous 3, but it still fills the void of detail some people want more of."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"If speed reading becomes a sport this is a great one to try it on.

Perhaps the worst I've read so far, but still a good book. I say it's the worst so far because (and I apologize if I ruin anything for a new reader, but it happens shortly into the book) the way Jordan has made sex a large part of the story line does nothing for the story, and the way Elaine, Birgette, Min and Avienda are portrade in one chapter of the book- especialy Elaine!- is done in poor taste, with no purpose to the story line, and with no entertainment value. That particular part of the story comes out of no where and just hangs there. You get the feeling Jordan was looking to fill pages and just pulled something out of the air to fill a gap and then went on with the story. And it took up an entire chapter! A chapter that could have been done without. Elaines charactor is way off from what she was when Rand and she first met to the point where it isn't Elaine at all but some street tramp looking for a one night stand. I understand the changes Rand has gone through and some of the changes others have had forced on them due to their circumstances, but Elaine was a proper lady raised to be a queen, not a street urchin who raised herself, not from a culture where sex is simply a physical expression, and not a woman created to be born over and over and live a life filled with adventure, but a life that will ultimatly be cut short. And the way Min and Avienda act towards Birgette is especially poorly written and out of charactor for both of them. It would have been better to leave that chapter out and just continue with the story line as it is. I could also do without Mat's sorted affair with the queen of Abu Dar, but they are a different culture and Jordan never gives you even a glimps of what goes on, just a hint from Mats point of view on how he feels humiliated and used. Far better than the way Elaine's time with Rand is presented.Other than that, so far the story is progressing well and is up to my expectations based on the rest of the series. I enjoy the way Jordan has built the series in an almost real time fashion, although there are some gaps and jumps in events that leave you wondering what took place in between, but nothing detrimental to the story. I am more than half way finished and finding myself wanting to keep reading at the end of every chapter to find out what happens next.All in all a good book, an excellent follow up to the last book, well written (with exception to the afore mentioned parts) and well worth the read. I look forward to reading the next installments of the series and especially to the end- to see whether Rand cleanses the one power and survives the last battle or not."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"this is a good book that I read awhile ago...I just purchased for my son...the book was in perfect condition..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"this wa a very good addition to my collection. i enjoyed the book very much and like the whole series. excellent.

It was hard to decide which books to review, but I've decided on the later ones, as they've had some bad reviews, and I wish to even the score. This book is the ninth in the series, and is once more read by the fantastic readers, Kate Reading and Michael Cramer. It mainly concentrates on Elein's struggle to claim her rightful throne of Andor, Matt's escape from Ebboodar, and Rand's quest to clenze the male half of the one power from the Dark One's taint. Robert Jordan is a master of intrigue and suspense, combined with amazing scope and emagination, but perhaps his gratest strength is his characters. His stories are told from multepull points of view, which really gives his readers a chance to get inside their heads. Though each book focuses on different characters in turn, Jordan always leaves you with juicy titbits about the others which leaves you waiting anxiously for them to take centre stage. I for one can't wait to see if Perrin rescues his wife, and as I wait for Egwane to claim the white tower, the suspense becomes unbarable. It's just as well I have the next book to hand. Jordan also takes care to develop his supporting characters too. Cadswane really gets established in this book, and also the fabled daughter of the nine moons that we've heard so much about. Personally, I think Matt could do better, but perhaps she'll improve in time. All in all, another outstanding book by a master story teller."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After slogging through the last few books, I was happy to see some of the story lines moving forward.

The funny part about Mat in this book is that you get to meet the daughter of the nine moons.As the book progresses you understand what the characters are like and what they are going to do, but the book takes wild turns throwing people of things all over the place. This is one of Robert Jordans best books. This is the ninth book in the series and i suggest that you read the first eight before hand. Robert Jordan is at his best when he writes books with this much feeling.Down to the book. This book is mainly about Rand and Perrign is hardly mentioned. Mat his ordered around every where and the girls seem to be in control.

I love seeing viewpoints from Seanchan characters, because there clear up the mystery of Seanchan just that teensy bit that makes me want to know even more.

There is one major plot line resloved in the book, and a good deal of action towards the end. The first half of the book is little bit slow, but things start to pick up from there on in.Mat maks a re-appearance and he finally gets to meet the daughter of the nine moons. There is a good deal about Perrin in the early chapters, but mainly what he is doing is looking for Faile, and the storyline does not continue throughout the book. There is nothing about Egwene, her rebel Aes Sedai or the seige. Elayne is busy trying to consolidate her power, and Nyneaves character begins to redeem itself (there is a lot less braid pulling in this book than the in previous ones)Rand is chasing the rebel asha'man who tryed to kill him in 'path of daggers', and this counts for some of the best scenes in the book. Rand also finally meets all his girls face to face, and that scene is one of the funniest in the whole series. The ending on the book is brillant, the best ending on any of the books since 'the fires of heaven'.I only gave the book three stars because parts of the book really drag on, and even though the storyline moves on a bit, we still don't seem to be any closer to Rand defeating the Dark One, or the series ending"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart is ok.

The answer is while this book is definately better than the previous two, Mr. Jordan is still milking his fan base. I have come to hold Mr. Jordan in the highest regard because I feel he understands that the reading public are not stupid, and are not afraid of a complex story with many subplots. He is as adept at creating and developing characters as any author I have read. Be that as it may, &quot;ENOUGH ALREADY&quot;, 9 books and counting, please Robert take a cue from Eddings, you can complete a brilliant story line, and still bring the same characters back, and place them in new situations, and we will love them just as much as we did in the previous story line. Well, back to the book. As I said this is a much better story than the previous two, although, he still wastes almost two thirds of the book before anything of import happens.

The answer is while this book is definately better than the previous two, Mr. Jordan is still milking his fan base. I have come to hold Mr. Jordan in the highest regard because I feel he understands that the reading public are not stupid, and are not afraid of a complex story with many subplots. He is as adept at creating and developing characters as any author I have read. Be that as it may, &quot;ENOUGH ALREADY&quot;, 9 books and counting, please Robert take a cue from Eddings, you can complete a brilliant story line, and still bring the same characters back, and place them in new situations, and we will love them just as much as we did in the previous story line. Well, back to the book. As I said this is a much better story than the previous two, although, he still wastes almost two thirds of the book before anything of import happens.

I think that the books are still very good, it's just difficult to fit so many plots and subplots into one text and still make it light enough to lift and carry from one room to another. Granted it seems like an eternity between sequels, but in my opinion, it's well worth the wait!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Reading this book went a long way towards restoring my faith in Mr Jordans ability to deliver an entertaining and well written 'Wheel of Time' novel. Winters Heart is a much better planned book, with good clear writing and decisive action. In particular it is good to have Mat (and buddies) back in the book, with their absence probably being one of the major reasons 'Path of Daggers' was so disliked by a lot of people.However the book/series still has 2 very large problems. The biggest of these is the collosal mess that was 'Path of Daggers'. As noted before by other reviewers 'Path of Daggers'and 'Crown of Swords' saw Mr Jordan introduce several extremely large plot developments that threaten to bog down the entire series. Indeed despite its considerable size (650 odd pages) 'Winters Heart' only covers a period of about 3 weeks and only mainly deals with Rand, Mat and a bit of Elayne, leaving Perrin and Egwene each with their own very considerable storylines to next book. This relative lack of progress makes me worry that Mr Jordan may have bitten off more than he can chew (plot wise)and that the series may drag on for years, or worse have an over hasty conclusion. This makes me nervous about the next installment, as he is really going to have to pack stuff into the next book if he is too succesfully complete this great series in 13 books ( which is supposedly what some Tor insider was suggesting).The other big problem I had with this book was that the female characters got even shallower than they already were (if that is possible). Although it has long been known that Robert Jordan/Jim Rigney is a bit of a chauvanist, 'Winters Heart' sees the good female characters become almost totally objects of lust, with nearly all of them fixated on male attention/attraction. Although this is not entirely unentertaining to read ( being a male reader) it undermines them as 3-D characters and makes the considerable portions of the series given over to the female main characters not very satisfying to read. I would be very interested to read what any (are there any??) female readers of the book/series thinks about the topic and whether they find it annoying or otherwise.Apart from these two worries I found the book highly entertaining and a lot better than the last book in the series. I would still recomend the 'Wheel of Time' to anyone as one of the best and most original fantasy series ever written."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"A wonderful and enjoyable read. Jordan does a great job ofbringing the rest of the characters up to date with Egwene's march onthe White Tower. Sorry, you won't see that battle in this book but hehad to fill in the month while Egwene sat in Murandy and let her armyrest up. And a good thing he did. Alot happened that I don't thinkwe would have wanted to miss. (None of us really wanted to seedetails on Bryne's recruiting and Egwene's attempts to feed her army,did we?)So, everyone missed Mat in book 8? Well, here he is andnow folks are upset because of so little Egwene in book 9. Go figure.It just goes to show the proof of the saying, &quot;You can't pleaseall of the people all of the time&quot;. Although shorter than theearlier books, I'm just as happy not to wait an extra year to get 300more pages.There are new points-of-view but I'm certain these aregiven to add depth of perspective, not necessarily to introduce newstorylines. After all, wasn't it the fact that this world is not justtwo-dimensional that hooked many of us in the first place?Myadvise: be realistic. Unreasonable expectations are the fastest wayto ruin a good book. Forget whatever you wanted to see happen andTHEN read the book...then read it again. For some folks it'snecessary to reread the whole series in order to put a new book inperspective. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book thefirst time through...but then, I've long since learned my lesson andtry to judge each book on it's own merit. (Personally, I read theseries again last month and have read Winter's Heart 3 times thismonth...along with all my other reading the last two months!) Mybiggest complaint is that Jordan tended to &quot;lump&quot; hischaracter stories together rather than intermixing them and thistended to make some parts of the book tedious. Perrin's story, forinstance, may have made for better reading if it's chapters had beeninterspersed throughout the rest of the book. But perhaps Jordan wastrying to maintain a certain timeline in relation to Egwene'smonth-long wait in Murandy.Yes, the book is shorter than others.Yes, Tor seems to have neglected the editing stage on this one. Yes,there is still lots to be resolved. Yes, Jordan could have given moredetail on how Rand puzzled out his plan to cleanse the taint. (And heprobably would have been criticized for too much filler.) Yes, ALOThappens in this book...just not necessarily what you expected tohappen. No, Jordan has not said that the series will end on book 13.That's just the latest of many guesses and will probably fall by thewayside just like all the others. His last estimate was that theseries would be completed whenever he finished writing the lastchapter.I apologize for the long review but hope it helps some ofyou.Shel END"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Does anyone else remember when the writing for this series was fresh, the plots tight, and the action enthralling? Sure, I'd like to quit buying the books but, after 10 years, I am bound and determined to get to the end....If there is one.On to the Review: Stale, boring, and Hemmingwayesque in detail. When I finished the book I sat back and realized that only one plot item was truly advanced with this book. My advice for those looking to keep up with the series but not willing to pony up the dollars is to read the book jacket and then read the last chapter... Nothing else of note happens in the book...At least nothing that won't be covered in excruciating detail in the next books 200 page prologue."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"You've got to be kidding me. Jordan has derailed his once epic series with a third-straight book that bogs down in the details and makes you want to scream. Through the first four books, Jordan had compiled a marvelous fantasy series where major actions happened with all the characters and you could barely put the books down, but the Wheel of Time has a flat tire and isn't going anywhere any time soon.This book does have things happen, although way too slowly. Mat does indeed meet the DoNM, but they only meet. Nothing too drastic happens with them. Perrin has a few chapters devoted to him at the beginning, but that's it. Way too many details of Elayne's difficulties ruling are covered, and Egwene is seen briefly in only two chapters. Didn't the cover state that one of the plots covered would be the Rebels vs. The White Tower? The end is eventful, but poorly written. Once again we have a very fuzzy ending. Is the taint removed or not? I assume that one of the Forsaken died, but it was so sketchy, it's hard to tell what happened. You would think that cleansing the taint on Saidin and a battle with six Forsaken would be incredible, but it's not. It was downright disappointing.I miss when Jordan fully fleshed out his characters and had epic plot threads crossing each other, but it is sadly over. Mat was taken take by Tylin in book 7, and he finally escaped her cluthces in book 9. Faile was kidnapped in Book 8, but that's still not resolved. Can we please move this thing forward. Remember when Rand would conquer a country and face down at least one Forsaken a book, Mat would face epic battles and learn more of the memories in his head or find the Horn, and when Perrin found he was a Wolfbrother, returned home, and led an army. It has degenerated into a really bad soap opera where nothing happens anymore, and it leads me to a very scary conclustion. Jordan has no idea how to end this thing. He had a great idea for four book, but now he's trapped in the middle. Or maybe he just wants to milk this thing. It will go at least 15, probably 20, but regardless, the series' best days are long since over. Somebody wake me when this thing is over, because until then, it's just not worth reading this drivel...unless you like Seinfeld. After all, that was a show about nothing."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Honestly, I think it's an insult to Robert Jordan to say that another writer should just take over and rewrite something he's worked on for the past decade. Of course it's possible to take something like the end of the world (as we know it) and resolve everything in three books (i.e. The Lord of the Rings). But ROBERT JORDAN IS NOT J.R.R. TOLKIEN!! I'm getting tired of people thinking he should be.Cadsuane seems to know everything. OK. And of course that seems strange and oddly convenient. I think it's meant to be so. But I don't think that we, as readers, are meant to understand it all. That would defeat the purpose of even reading the books.Plot Convenience Playhouse does seem to be offering a lot to Jordan's characters these days. But I think the constant criticism of his &quot;faithful readers&quot; who are complaining about the series being too long is driving him to it. How else do you expect him to resolve everything in a timely enough fashion to please you?Although there seem to be a large number of &quot;unnecessary&quot; characters in the series these days, I can't believe that Jordan would introduce new characters just for the heck of it. I'm sure there's a purpose behind everything. To use a somewhat tired phrase, the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills.Ya know, the poor man can't win for losing these days. Either he gets criticized for taking too long in getting us Constant Readers (to borrow a phrase from Stephen King) yet another volume in his series, or if he leaves a character out of said book for the sake of getting it to us sooner he gets criticized for that too. Cut the man some slack.I stopped reading the Left Behind series because I got tired of the constant cliffhangers and having to wait until the next book came out. I'm just gonna wait for the whole series to be done and read the whole thing at once. For all of you getting tired of waiting for Tarmon Gai'don, why don't you do the same? I for one plan on buying each and every book as soon as it is published and reading it, because I am a faithful reader and Jordan's series is important to me, as are his characters. For those of you who obviously don't agree with me, please stop complaining and give Robert Jordan the respect he is due."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Like the last 3 books in his Wheel of Time series, &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; is pretty much a waste of good paper. There's no plot, little action, and little apparent effort by the author to do more than meet a publisher's deadline. What started out as a truly great example of fine story telling has become nothing more than an effort to make a buck.I would not recommend this book to anyone, nor will I waste another dollar on anything &quot;written&quot; by Robert Jordan. Like I said above, it appears that the author has worn out any interest in the story line which he so carefully created in the first four or five books in this series. It's on to better literature for this fantasy reader."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"In the beginning, there was a great story. So where did it go? I have more than drifted away from enjoying the story. I don't even remember half of it anymore. To many inconsequential characters with too much time spent on them and not an end in sight. The first books in this series were masterful, but I really believe that Robert Jordan has lost the direction for his tale. I seriously doubt with all the garbage he added in the last two books that he can tie everything together for a big finale in SIX more books let alone three. The last two books were so boring that I found myself skipping whole sections that didn't deal with the main characters. And in this last book I found myself skipping sections devoted to the main characters. Please, find your way back to the real story and stop the bickering between characters. A real personality and something to like about them would be nice, too."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I loved Winter's Heart. Many people claimed it to be sub-par; that the series is gradually downgrading. While I agree that the past few books were definitely not the best in the series, The Wheel of Time is still rolling, and Robert Jordan has yet to prove to me that his ideas are running out. The ending of Winter's Heart may not have been a surprise, and was indeed a long-awaited and expected part of the plot, but there were many twists of the plot and sub-plot that tied up loose ends. The novel was just as compelling and full of intrigue as most of the rest of the series, and I have no doubt that the next book will far surpass all the previous ones in scope and imagination. Few other epic fantasy series have caused me so many sleepless nights in bed, and I have no doubt that it will continue to do so."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As someone who has been reading this series since the first book was released, I have to say I was extremely dissappointed in this book. It used to be whenever the next Robert Jordan book was released, everything would stop for me until I finished reading it. With Winters Heart, I found myself struggling to get through most of it. In fact, I read several other books while trying to finish it. The first half of the book was extremely slow filled with what seemed like mundane details, focusing on events that just weren't very interesting. Not to mention the fact that I was having a hard time remembering what had happened in the previous books.I know I sound like I'm being disloyal, but I'm ready for the series to end. There are some cool things that that occur in the book, so if you can make it through the first half, you'll have some intersting reading. Hopefully the next book won't take as long or be as boring."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I blame Stephen Donaldson. He was the one who first dragged fantasy into the practice of spending hundreds of pages doing little to advance plot, characterization or theme. But there's no question that in the last 4-5 books of the \\"Wheel of Time\\" Mr. Jordan has set new benchmarks, leaving Mr. Donaldson and other pretenders to the title of \\"extended narrative\\" far, far behind. Maybe 4,000 pages or so behind.It's gotten so bad that even the modest advancement of the main plot that's in that last two chapters of this opus feels like a triumph. Finally, something happens. It makes you willing to forgive perhaps as much as half of the wasted paper that has gone before in this book. It doesn't make you forgive \\"Path of Daggers,\\" arguably the longest book in the fantasy genre in which nothing meaningful happens. But perhaps half of \\"Winter's Heart.\\"Special note to Jordan's publisher, Forge: Please, get this man an editor. If he has an editor, fire that one and find one with some spine. Force your author to start wrapping up some of the narrative threads. And I mean more than one per volume. What kind of contract did you give him, anyway? How about a bonus for Jordan for each narrative element he closes (and a penalty for each new one he opens)?Special note to Mr. Jordan: Shoot the dog. Wrap it up. Finish it. How about a goal of moving the plot significantly in each chapter?But I won't be buying any more of the volumes until someone tells me the last volume finally has been published. I'll buy it. And then decide if I want to read any of the intervening books. I'm voting with my wallet. And saving trees. Consider joining me."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have been reading through some of the reviews from the last two months, and noticed that depending on who the reader is, the most enticing or repelling part of this entire series is the ever-evolving sub-plots and expanding character base.Yes, this series started out quickly and then began moving slower as it went on. But this is to be expected as new places are travelled and new aquaintances met. If the single group of people who left Emond's Field together in EotW were still adventuring together, I agree that this series should be long over. However, that is not the world, or the style, that Jordan has presented us with. He has shown us an intriguing world with intricately placed sub-plots and twists.It is for this intricacy that I read this series. I, for one, love the inner workings of this series and trying to envision how it will all come together. The successful use of world history, prophecies, and a complex environment make this series what it is to me. It is an epic, and I think as such it does a wonderful job of placing the reader in a strange world where not everything is simple or obvious .It is these same complexities, which are the heart of this series, which drives many people to criticize Jordan and this series as a whole. They are not looking to explore every element inside the world created by Jordan, and would like to see a conclusion since, at the beginning the series started at a much quicker pace.Bottom line: If you are looking for an engaging, complex world to explore, start reading this series and continue reading this book. If you would rather read a story which is composed less of complexity and driven more by action, read elsewhere.I will read this series until completion, as this is just what I look for in a series. However, if you haven't started be wary what you are jumping into."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan continues to keep me interested. I like the epic proportions... And though I wouldn't have taken some of the steps he did in his story telling he still continues to suerprise and entertain.I agree with the other reviewers, the story is very complex. And yes it doesn't appear to be drawing to a close soon. But still the books are masterfully written. And book nine improves upon is predecessor which I thought wasn't likely until I read it. (Path of Daggers)I think the coming plot for the next books will actually add instead of draw out the story. The books are very well done and the characters are very well thought out. It really comes alive. Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time is in a world of its own.To the Author I say. Please finish your story. But don't short your readers. Your entire epic story is one of the best of our day.Please pick up the first book if you haven't already...If you don't feel the urge to read the next in the series than maybe this isn't your line of novels.

The Wheel of Time series is one of the best I have ever laid hands on and shows the promise of being a truly great epic, if it ever finishes running its course. The first six books in the series were mind-blowing, covering all the bases on what a good fantasy series should have. Sadly enough, it does slow up during the last three installments. So many lives become intertwined that the author has to keep track of them while still keeping the main plot on the move. Winter's Heart was slightly more satisfying than it's two predecessors. Mat's future comes into focus little by little, the White Tower will go to war with itself, and Rand makes moves to secure his victory against the Dark One by attempting to cleanse the source. Having been a fan of the series for a number of years now, I want to trust Jordan to make good on the concluding books of the series. He has woven quite a tapestry of intrigue, action, romance, and mystery that is difficult to maintain. Yet he does it (most of the time) very well. Readers (myself included) would do well to be patient and keep on reading the stuff. Believe me, there is nothing with this kind of depth and detail on the market.

It's true that book nine is slower than they, but it is an improvement on #8 (which was not that bad). Besides, when I say slower, I mean slower for Jordan, which is great compared to most authors. It's also true that Nynaeve's braid-pulling thing is annoying, as well as Elayne's upturned nose, and some of Min's quirks. But the plots and subplots DO advance here, and we get to see Egwene and a few others develop more of a character. And the climax, with the Choedan Kal, was amazing! All in all, it's still a great book that all lovers of sci-fi/fantasy should read."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am hooked on the wheel of time series. It is one of the best series in the science fiction world, in spite of the fact that it is sometimes difficult to follow the story. Mainly because he takes so long between books, and he doesn't reintroduce the characters in each book. Each book just takes off as if you just finished the last one and the reader remembers all the characters (and there are many) with no clue of how they fit into the story. And, have you noticed how many of his charaters have similar names? However, I think Jordan has reached the point where he just doesn't know where to go with this series. This entire book could have reduced to a single short chapter in advancing the story line. There is no arguing with the fact that Jordan can make the experience of the hero walking down the hallway an interesting experience, but I would like to see more things (read action) happening to advance the plot to a conclusion. While reading this book I kept waiting for something to happen along the main story line, but to no avail. This is one that could have been skipped with no lose."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I really liked winter's heart, it was really great, a lily in the winter was fantastic.

I started when Eye of the World was first published back in '90. I was not originally satisfied that it didn't end in 3 books, but I was young and still happy to read stuff I had read in jr high school. Mr. Jordan's characters are some of the few that I could talk to if they appeared in real life. They aren't perfect. They have peccadillos like all real humans do. They aren't sketches, relegated to a shadowy corner of your imagination until the author needs them to advance the plot on Rand Al'thor's behalf. There was a point or suprise to every less than blockbuster chapter in the book. Hooray! Matt found the Daughter of the Nine Moons. (wonder what he'll do to the Seanchan?) No man wielding the One Power will go mad. Logain suddenly has the potential to be a great man. Life is a suprise. The characters in these books are a fairly accurate mirror of a human being.

If it's been a while since you read the series, some secondary characters and plot lines may take a little while to remember, but the main details come back quickly. The last chapter was excellent and reminded me of why I enjoy RJ so much. For die-hard fans, go buy your copy now.

I mean how many times can she bag on rand for being a foolish male, or how many chars can Jordan talk about that will never be a part of the story. Anyway... the last halve of the book has all the old Jordan flare. All the theory sites that have contemplated who is desguised as whom can now give it a rest to some degree.

Although, page wise, it is a little thinner then some of the other books in the series, nonetheless, it seems to possess as much in the way of content as the best of them. This is in large part due to the fact that Jordan, (perhaps reading some of the commentary that the previous two installments in this series received) has again quickened the pace of the action, placing our beloved characters at the forefront rather then focusing on the armies that each now leads. This is not to say that he is rushing. Even though this book is a MAJOR step forward in the series, it keeps as many avenues open for the story line to take as those which it resolved. Over more then 8000 pages, Robert Jordan has developed an entire world, and set in it a story which constantly reinvents itself evan as it builds up to a climax. He is not about to rush to a closure. The old plot line of thwart evil plot and bring bad guy to justice in under 300 pages is a thing of the past, in large part thanks to this series. Jordan is to be commended for not falling into that trap thus far, and it would disappoint a great many fans if he started down that path at this stage.To the thousands who claim to have been put off by A Crown of Swords and A Path of Daggers, I advise you in the strongest terms possible to pick up this book and see if it does not rekindle your interest and set you salivating for book 10 of the Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Let me begin by saying that this is the most effective teaching tool that I have ever encountered, with the likely exception of Crossroads of Twilight. If you want to teach students the effect of early success then burning out and milking the cow, this is *the* book for you (again, with the notable exception of CoT).Having somewhat mildly said what I really think, I will offer this suggestion: novel writers, like songwriters, really don't care whether you love or hate their work, they just don't want you to be indifferent. If you are indifferent, then the book/song won't get any attention at all (do people often write reviews about a mediocre book? No)and the next book won't see the light of day. That's what authors fear.When the wheels fall off, as they have in this series, then ignore it. That will get the author's attention."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'd like to start by stating that I'm a huge fan of Robert Jordan's previous books, but every book since # 6 feel like he is milking his readership and writing for the money rather than for the story. Literally 3 or 4 events occurred in this book - Nothing is happening in the series since book 6.Please Mr Jordan, give us a book like books 1 - 6 and let us know how the series ends. Some suggestions... Moiraine returns from limbo where she was sent (book ?), Lan unites the north behind Rand, Perrin unites old Manetheran, Matt is the general, they all meet to fight the Trollocs, etc., and Rand and company win. Rand writes a book entitled &quot;From there and back again&quot; and sails off with the Seachan. The end. Please, please, finish this up versus making me read through endless details of no value to the series. The last few books have felt like reading the phone book. These books aren't cheap and you are close to loosing me."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"My God!... If I have to hear about Nyneave tugging her braid and smoothing her skirts for another 1000 pages I'm going to scream. This book was the worst yet. How can Mr. Jordan waste that much time and never get anywhere? I am hopelessly caught in a never ending loop of useless description of charactors and what they are wearing. Why does Mr. Jordan spend so much time describing what someone is wearing and then only devote a couple of pages of a very long book to any real action? Of 766 pages, only the last two chapters did anything to advance the story. I got caught into what I thought was going to be a very good series and have now been left feeling I have wasted my time. I am just glad I never wasted my money on the hardbacks. I will be waiting patiently for my turn at the next grueling book(at the library!!). Mr. Jordan PLEASE finish this!..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I think many other reviewers have said it well...the series had promise but as it goes on, too much is happening (plot lines aplenty) and too little is happening (none of the plot lines go anywhere). I have only one thing to add: has anyone else noticed that Robert Jordan seems to be obsessed with clothing? Pages and pages devoted to descriptions of what everyone is wearing. I can't keep track of who anyone is anymore, but by gum I know what they all are wearing in excruciating detail. Perhaps Robert Jordan should consider writing for Cosmo."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"When I read the first Wheel of Time book I was very impressed. It was suspensful and had a good plot and everything. Now, several books later, it has gone hugely downhill. Robert Jordan is good at weaving good and very complicated plots, but its gone too far and I doubt he can pull himself out and bring it to a good ending. Also, now that theres so much to keep track of, he can write these 1000 page books and still absolutely nothing can happen. In the last book, Perrins wife Faile was kidnapped. Now(get ready!) he starts looking for her! The other events go on (or not) at an equally slow pace. Hes adding in too many things to make it more exciting and only succeeding in making it more confusing. On top of that, hes taking forever to write a new book so when Crossroads of Twilight does finally come out I'll have forgotten the names or everyone except Rand, Mat, Perrin and whatserface. My last complaint is that even though I'm only in high school I'm certain I could write women better than Robert Jordan. Its like he thought of one personality (one of insane feminism) and gave it to every single female character in the series, and to be honest its getting unbelievably annoying. The books started out great, but its getting torn apart. I'm not sure I can truthfully recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book marks the sad disintegration of what might have been a great series by Robert Jordan into a verbose, confusing, fragmented, unsatisfying mess. Those who dared to compare him to Tolkien in his earlier works will lament with me the death of what might have been. Save yourself some money. Go to the bookstore and read the last chapter. That will keep you informed enough to make sense of what comes in the next book-maybe, and, it will keep you from having to slush through page after page of boredom. Were it not for a desire to find out what finally happens to Rand and the world, I would probably give up on this series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have read all of the Wheel of Time series and have become dismayed at the change in style with the last three books. Mr. Jordan is belaboring old issues and is not at all clear how new ones relate to the plot. He does nothing to assist the reader's memory in recalling characters and their importance. A prologue would help or, at least, a more elaborate glossary which includes the dozens of minor repeated characters, locations, and events. Certainly one motivation for this stretching out of the story would be to continue his revenue; his editor would gain by that tactic also. For number 10 and beyond I will wait for others to read and review his production and not automatically get the book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Have read all of RJ's books and really wished I had waited to read the reviews of WH. Way too many characters, and plots that require access to a database just to keep informed. And yes, I agree that action is not a requirement for a great book, but action is usually required to tie up all of the 1012 loose ends that are still dangling after this book. Count me out for future editions, I will read the reviews that are written in less than a 1000 words and will chalk up the last four books as written by someone barren of inspiration and clouded by greed."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The prologue in this book gave way to what promised to be an excellent book. Then the next 100 pages of useless description was frustrating (I still think he should permanently get rid of that Faile character). However, there was good material in most of the chapters after those 100 pages. The last few chapters though made me think Mr. Jordan may finally be on track again. Despite what some readers believe, constant action and battle is not required (or wanted) to make a book good, and I bet most fans don't expect it. But, advancement of plot is needed. For me, the point of a story is to give description and details that hold a reader's attention and also lead to the conclusion of the story; a bit of filler may be required, but not 100 or more pages (like we find in this book and in the one before).Though it had its slow moments, we were thrown a bone at the end (with some loose ends tied up and a major problem solved) and I grabbed it with all teeth and ran. I only hope the next book advances the plot (without introducing too many more characters and new story lines), and that it is not two or more years down the road."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan is a mastermind at keeping his fans, but this is starting to bore me. I eagerly wait book after book for some hoope of an end but it never comes. He should listen to Eddings quote &quot;Don't ride a good horse to death.&quot; If you have read this series already, I'm sorry, you have to read this book. If you havent started yet, for god sakes, wait!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First off let me say that I am a big fan of WoT. It is the best fantasy series ever. My problem is that I still had hair when the series began and will probably be dead before it is finished. The last two books have been four years in the making and the source of my irritation is.... WHY?! The first 5 books of the series (the best ones!) were put out in about three years, so obviously Jordan can put out quality writing much faster than he has been lately. The last two volumes together are 1300 pages of double spaced &quot;Dr Seuss&quot; sized print and more than half of that is braid-pulling, sniffing, blushing,skirt smoothing,stalking, tantrums(you get the idea)and all manner of description and scenes that could all be cut and pasted from any of the earlier books.(In fact I could swear that some were.) Waiting so long for so little is enough to make me want to pull what hair I have left out by the roots. Still, Winter's Heart is a step in the right direction as the plot actually advances a little and some plot questions are answered but... please RJ, you OWE it to your fans to devote a little more time to this series. At the current pace I can't see the series concluding in less than 4 or 5 more books, which is fine, (I will be sorry to see it end) but waiting 10 years is completely unacceptable and I'll bet that the majority of WoT fans agree."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart is the first book since Fires of Heaven to actually move forward with the Prophecies of the Dragon rather than continue world-building at a snail's pace. Without ruining the plot, a number of major plot lines throughout the series advance quite nicely -- Rand and saidin, Elayne and her kingdom, the relationship between Min, Elayne, Aviendha, the Forsaken and Darkfriend plots, Mat's eventual fate, the use of all sorts of neat toys, a new city and culture that's not inserted solely as a backdrop. Where I was somewhat disappointed -- and where I still shake my head with this entire series -- is why Jordan continues to insert a dazzling amount of new characters when so many of the old ones (Perrin, the Aiel, Moriaine and Thom, Padan Fain, the intrigues of the White Tower and Aes Sedai, and most of the minor powers-that-be-in-conquered-and-other-kingdoms) have so much more that could be done with them and remain relatively ignored from book to book. (It may say something that the prologue here runs a full 85 pages to try to at least touch on some of the otherwise ignored plot lines!) By now, you should know whether you love or hate Jordan's style of writing, so the paragraph long vivid narrations either grab your attention or allow easy speed reading to find what happens next. He does also use a lot more in-the-mind-of-individual-character views here which does move the plot forward (at least you know whose side they're on for a change). Net-net, this is clearly the best book from him since either the Shadow Rising or Fires of Heaven and the ending here does make you wonder for the first time in about 4 books as to where the series goes next which is perhaps the most refreshing of all things about the novel. The only bad news is that given the plots he has to wrap up I still think he's got another 3 books at least. For now, though, a worthy holiday escape."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"We know much of what will happen in the rest of the series, because of all the prophecies. Those of you who are hoping the next book will be the last are in for disappointment. There's still a lot left to cover, so this series is a long way from being finished.I'll share some of my theories about what's going to happen, but to avoid spoilers, I'm not mentioning anything that happened in Winter's Heart.A lot of reviews have mentioned Moiraine, and people are wondering if she's really dead. The answer is a resounding No. Moiraine is still alive, and trapped in the land of the Snakes &amp; Foxes. Recall Egwene's dream where &quot;Thom Merrilin put his hand into a fire to draw out the small blue stone that now dangled on Moiraine's forehead.&quot; This seems fairly obvious. Thom will have to rescue Moiraine. How will he do it? Also recall the words Olver chanted at the beginning of the game &quot;Snakes &amp; Foxes.&quot; The words were &quot;Courage to strengthen, fire to blind, music to dazzle, iron to bind.&quot; Looks like Thom will need courage, some fire sticks, his harp, and some iron. And nothing is more romantic than a good old-fashioned rescue, right? Thom and Moiraine will be married by the end of the series. It'll be interesting to see how Robert Jordan handles a mature, honest romance instead of all the relationships we're stuck with now.Other reviewers are disappointed in the lack of Egwene's storyline, but we're given clues as to her fate. I don't think Elaida was far off the mark when she said the Salidar Aes Sedai would sacrifice Egwene in order to make the tower whole. Egwene will be betrayed. She's already dreamt that &quot;A grinning Nicola denounced her to the hall&quot; and &quot;straps at waist and shoulder held her tightly to the block, and the headsman's axe descended...&quot; Another damsel in disress, eh? It looks like Gawyn will have to rescue this one. After Egwene's rescue, she'll rally her forces and overthrow Elaida. Probably just in time to tackle a Seanchan invasion.We already know who the Daughter of Nine of the Moons is, but what else will happen to Mat? Consider these: &quot;Mat throwing dice with blood streaming down his face.&quot; &quot;To give up half the light of the world to save the world.&quot; &quot;Mat, placing his own left eye on a balance scale.&quot; Mat will choose to sacrifice his eye, and in doing so, will gain some knowledge that helps to save the world. There's also Egwene's dream of Mat. &quot;Mat sat on a night-shrouded hilltop, watching a grand Illuminator's display of fireworks, and suddenly his hand shot up, seized one of those bursting lights in the sky. Arrows of fire flashed from his clenched fist, and a sense of dread filled her. Men would die because of this. The world would change.&quot; Tie this in with Mat's involvement with the illuminator, and we can guess that Mat will invent firearms and/or gunpowder.What of Rand? One thing seems certain. Rand will definitely lose a hand. Many of Min's viewings involve Rand, Elayne, a severed hand, and an axe. Remember that game the Seanchan empress likes to play? The one where she uses an a'dam to chain a woman who can channel to a man? If the man can also channel, they both die screaming. Also remember Min telling Rand that Perrin would have to be there on two different occasions, or Rand was doomed. Perhaps Elayne and Rand will be captured by the Seanchan and chained together. In order to save their lives, Perrin will have to use his axe to chop off Rand's hand. Rand will also spend some time as a beggar. &quot;Perrin thought it was Rand. He wore rags and a rough cloak, and a bandage covered his eyes.&quot; There's also Min's viewing of Rand and a beggar's staff.It also appears that the Black Tower is going to split, much like the White Tower. Too many of the Ashaman are fanatically loyal to Taim, and we know Taim is bad news. Logain will probably have to bail Rand out of this mess. Finally, Rand is going to purposely destroy the remaining seals on the Dark One's prison.Some reviewers are saying that some of the major characters need to die. Min's viewing of Perrin always seem to show that Broken Crown, which is from the land of Saldaea. Poor Perrin. The current queen of Saldaea is Tenobia, who has no children and no husband. Her present heir to the throne is Faile's father, Davram Bashere. For Perrin to gain the throne of Saldaea, it looks like Tenobia, Faile and her parents will all have to die.Who else will die? Well, what about all those prophecies that mention Rand's blood on the rocks of Shayol Ghul? There are several, but none of them mention Rand's life. They all say &quot;Rand's blood.&quot; Blood has more than one definition, and what we're looking at here is probably blood as a family connection. Rand's only living blood relative is Galad. Galad is certainly doomed, but will undoubtedly go down in a blaze of glory. How about a whitecloak battling the dark Shaidar Haran?Birgitte's death is necessary, because in order to join Gaidal Cain, she'll have to be reborn. She'll probably die just in time to be summoned when the Horn of Valere is blown at the Last Battle. I'm guessing that someday Rand and Elayne will have a blonde daughter who likes to play with bows.And how will the series end? I don't think Jordan will be able to resist ending the series with a quote from Loial's book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I was a bit concerned after the previous entry (Path of Daggers) that Jordan was running out of steam. Not a lot seemed to happen and I was worried he was padding the story some. And the fact that Matt was completely absent was a real bother.This one removed most of my worries. Not a lot happens in the first half or so - which is not unusual for a WoT novel, really - but the ending is (almost) spectacular. We get to see a lot of Matt this time - a very good thing. The three &quot;main&quot; characters - Rand, Matt and Perrin - each get their own distinct cliffhangers, of sorts (Rand's big task is essentially complete at novel's end but we won't know the repercussions for some time).The one real problem with the book is that Perrin's dilemma is set up and left hanging very early, then we don't hear from him again. That's okay, as it appears a fairly minour subplot, but Jordan usually spreads stuff out through the book better. A few of the characters we've come to expect to hear from more get short shrift (i.e., Egwene and Elaida) but that's a small thing. Contrasting that are some excellent interactions, a few truly amazing events (Rand's climactic scene in particular) and the usual splashes of terrific, character-driven humour.If you've been reading WoT, this one will be sure to please."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"too longtoo obscureI wonder if Jordan is still writing these books?The style has changed, he repeats himself endlessly to fill pages, and nothing ever happens."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I loved the first 5 books and tolerated books 6 and 7 but the last 2 &quot;epics&quot; are absolutely miserable.

Each character possesses a small part of what we feel in everyday life and hopefully, the only rare tragedy.

Sure, Jordan can be slower than an armadillo crossing a Texas road, but his descriptive prose is wonderful. He has created a vast world and is able to keep this world new and alive. There are so many characters and plot lines going that there is just too much going on to rush things. This novel picked up the pace from the Path Of Daggers though and Rand and friends are getting closer to their respective goals. There were some exciting things that came about in this book and some things happened that should have happened a long time ago. Jordan does however lose sight of Perrin and Faile.

Each novel leads into the next, and though some may have slow points, they are few and far between. Jordan spins out new and amazing plot twists, and forks in every novel that need to be resolved for the series to end.

The characters are complex and have habits that make us wild, but if they didn't have those characteristics, they would not be who they are.

Not really. It would not matter if Mr. Jordan did not publish a book for ten years, and then put out a picture book to end the series. I am telling you, I am there.Everyone will tell you that they like this character, don't like that character. I'm thinking if you want to control the world, write your own book. In the mean time, I can't fail to appreciate the fact that Jordan has created a world that while you are watching Mat make a fool of himself that the world is moving and changing with each decision that he makes. This is what helps to define the work of a genius. One dementional stories are easy to understand, but not much fun to read. I like working my way through this.I have started the series over 12 times. Each time reading my way through each book in sucession. WoT is in five pieces (memo to self: order a new book) and I will continue to do this until the series is at an end.

Before book six, someone obviously said to Jordan, \\"Not Eight Books! At Least 20!\\"The result for Books 6, 7, and 8 was a disaster.Happily, Winter's Heart, is a vast improvement. It's not quite up to the first five books, but the improvement is sufficient to keep me a reader.There are problems - characters and subplots left behind from the last book, or started and never touched in this book. Vastly irritating. At times, some of the book is like marching through a beach covered in Jello.However, the plot is finally moved. The emergence of Cadsuane helps return some balance that was lost in the dismissal of one of the main characters in the first five books - that was perhaps a good idea when there were to be eight books, now it's a disaster.In short, this book is far more enjoyable than the prior three, and gives me some hope that Book Ten will be \\"A Summer's Roar\\" rather than \\"A Hummer's Snore.\\""},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I thought book nine was much better than seven or eight and made me fall in love with the series again. I almost gave up on the series, but this book was worth the wait."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have been an avid Jordan fan for a while, but recently, I have been getting more and more impatient. There is only so much a normal human being can read without going crazy over the lack of action. At least this book actually has more action and less politics! Of course, only Rand and Nynaeve actually do anything, but thats okay. Its and improovement over the Path of Daggers, which was possibly the worst of the series(with the possible exception of the Crown of Swords). The beggining was so great, lets try to end this thing in the next 2000 pages okay?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have read the other books in this series and I have to agree with other reviewers. The first four books were fantastic and I counted myself fortunate that I found them after all were printed. I have been waiting for Winter's Heart for a long time and needless to say, I am very disappointed. It feels like Robert Jordan is simply shuffling through drudgery in the attempts to satisfy publishers. This book is REALLY hard to read. Not for difficulty, but for sheer boredom. The women in this book are irritating and mindless. The CONSTANT references to sniffing, snorting, pulling of braids, blah blah blah. Come up with some new descriptions. Also the fact that ALL the women are so full of themselves it makes you want to throw the book in the trash just to escape them. Bottom line: Save you money. The Wheel of Time has finally stopped turning."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"A lot of people have been complaining that Jordan is slipping. Oh, the series has definitely slowed down since the mighty days of the first three to four books, but I found Winter's Heart to be momentous.Rand has done the unthinkable, unfathomably cool deed in this book, and he has finally stopped running from a (potentially) even scarier commitment than his part in the Karaethon Cycle.I see the future of WoT in this book. It vividly and very effectively lays the mooring tether for the remainder of the series. Readers who have patience will find that Winter's Heart is no Dragon Reborn (Book 3), but it is certainly a critical and interesting piece of the puzzle. I found this book to be exciting at points, humorous, daring and even a tad suspenseful. Again, I urge readers to glean the future of the Wheel of Time series from this book, rather than hold it as a looking glass to the past. Great book, Bob :)"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have read this series three times now. The first time I loved books 1-3, 4-6 were OK, and 7 and 8 were a drag.The second time through I only got to book 7 and was actually enjoying the plot through all the books. The final time I read this book looking for clues and actually loved reading all of them. Yes Jordan has become the master of book padding by adding irrelevant details to the text(Taking a paragraph or two to describe the color of someone's clothes can be tedious at times). But are you so sure what you are reading is irrelevant? There are many hints in the text to help you guess at future events and explain past ones. It was defenately more fun reading the series that way. As far as the tapes are concerned, I am torn. It is definately convenient. The only problem is that I tend to drift off while the tape is playing. I suggest reading the book before listening to it. It works better that way."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Life is short so you die. Finally we are getting to the end of the story. I love this saga, and will keep on reading until either the story ends or Rober Jordan will die. I am seriously afraid he is so obsessed with the Wheel series that he will not live long enough to complete it. I first read the six first volumes in one, and wish I could have done the same with all the books. If you read one after the other, no problem, you can follow the story. But by the time you understand what's going on, after two years of forgetting the story line, the present volume is already over. My recommendation is for anyone that has not read a single volume of the series: start from the beginnning and you'll have the best of time. For others, do read the previous book at least partially, so that you can enjoy the new book from the start. I guess we shall have three more volumes until the end, at around a book per every two years. Expect grand finale in 2006"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am a big fan of this series, and really love the characters and storylines. I also have been disappointed with the series lately. They had lots of pages, but didn't really accomplish much, or push forward to an ending. After Lord of Chaos and a Crown of Swords, it looked like Jordan was building towards a great ending, and was setting a fast pace. Path of Daggers and Winter's Heart slow the pace down way too much. As much as I love these characters, I'm getting tired of hearing them say the same things over and over again. We're all aware of each characters quirks by now. It's time to let them move to a conclusion. I will say this much in the book's favor: the ending was truly great. Rand did something that will profoundly affect the world in which he lives. I can only hope it sets the stage for an action-packed finale."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"All his books have been phenominal in this series, but they all did have their own problems. The main problem that Jordan must face now is that he has spent so much time building up, and revealing so much to us that he now needs to turn it around to the end and is having trouble doing so. It should take two or three more books to finish the series, one to get everyone where they need to be (whethor or not in control of it or accepting of it does not matter, they need to be where they need to be) and (or in a second book) needs to reveal their places and puropses in the 'prophecy' and needs them to control and accept whatever it is they need to, but to late...and he should finish it all in a grand second (third) book that leaves us all astounded and satisfied."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This series started off as a great story and was comparable to the best. But Jordan seems to be more concerned with filling pages with meaningless descriptive paragraphs, and introducing more and more charactors. Now it does not compare with the shorter excellent works of other fantasy writers like Gemmell or Eddings nor the Dragon lance series, all these leave you with a wish for more, Jordans books now leave you with an &quot;I'll be glad when its finished&quot; feelng"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"i loved the first half dozen books of this series as much as the rest of you. but we've reached the point now where it is just painful to continue. i don't want to give anything away about book nine, but here's a hint. NOTHING HAPPENS! remember how awful book 8 was but you were trapped by the exciting ending and forced to look forward to book 9? well, you're going to have to wait another 2 years, because the battle was never discussed. didn't happen yet. that's right. 650 pages worth of two days where NOTHING HAPPENS. you want the cliff note version? read the the book summary. i swear. everything is in there. even the ending. had i just read that, i could have saved 8 hours of agony. the sad thing is that i'm going to read book ten. but i'll be damned if i spend a dime on it. i beg all of you to take it out of the library like me."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I find it grimly ironic that I am given only 1,000 words to review a book that is thousands of pages long. The best way to characterize this book, and perhaps the series itself, would be to have a 700 page review laden with wacky &quot;It Must Be Fantasy&quot; words like t'angeral or Aes Sedai, or whatever else pops out when you mash your hand against the keyboard a few times. What were the other 999,999 monkeys doing that day? Such a review would also need to be filled with one-dimensional female characters that may be mild or assertive, but are always shrill, spend a lot of time with flashbacks and details like the buttons on Lord Haversham's butter-creme highlighted velvet damask afternoon undercoat and, after 59 chapters, end with a sputter. I'll try to keep it shorter.Jordan had it once, for a book or two. It was there for all to see. Then, like Lucas, he started to slip.. began to fancy himself an authority rather than a member of the gang like the rest of us. It was our duty to read the great works he deigned to cast before us like pearls before swine, just like it is apparently his editor's duty to never make a single change out of fear of losing the precious account. And here we are.. nine books along and no closer to the end. Tolkien's crown has long since slipped from Jordan's head and is rolling, tumbleweed-esque, towards the future and, hopefully, long-lived real heir. Winter's Heart, like the series itself, collapses rapidly under its own weight and tedium, like a violet-and-mother-of-pearl brocaded hoopskirt ballgown left in a downpour. Even the Bible is less preachy, and weighs in at a slender 2 books. Save yourself.Another good way to appreciate the aimlessness of this series is to take the last 6 books, randomly shuffle them, and read them in that random order. You will not be able to tell the difference."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've put my last 26.95 into Robert Jordan.This book was slightly better than the previous installment, but it still was a shadow of A Shadow Rising -- the last good book in this series.There are now more side-plots than real plot and more dangling threads than any of the many WOT message boards.I no longer enjoy the company of Rand or Perrin -- even Matt's antics wear thin. Of course all of Jordan's female characters are harridans and intolerable -- I actively hope for their deaths.Of course no one actually dies, because they are either saved by the deux et machina of Tav'eren'ness (sp) or recycled by the Dark One (he's so enviro!).After the ninth installment in a series where there are now more mediocre books than good ones, I've decided to seek help for my battered reader syndrome."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm a big Wheel of Time fan. I got book 9 the very day it came out, the very hour. It took me over a month to finish reading it--considerably longer than the first 4 books in the series. The storyline is not near as urgent or interesting as the first few books, but I wouldn't necessarily say that it's enough to put you to sleep. I'd rather be reading about Aes Sedai than about boring sorcerers fighting dragons. There are also several other points that I'd like to make that might be of some help to those who are wondering why the series is seemingly dragging on. First of all, starting with book 5, we noticed that RJ started to take a major character out of the storyline so that he could develop another one. That's actually a pretty brilliant idea, since it FORCES YOU to read book 7 to find out what happened to the character in book 5. OBVIOUSLY, IF ROBERT JORDAN TOLD YOU THE FATES OF ALL THE CHARACTERS IN ONE BOOK, THERE WOULD BE NO NEED FOR A SEQUEL. Unlike some fantasy series where the writer has the last battle in the first book and then comes up with a lame excuse for a sequel, saying that &quot;oh, there's ANOTHER ultimate evil in the world, Robert Jordan promises a LAST BATTLE. There will be no book 14, The Revenge of the Dark One. Finally, although book 9 may have been lacking in many areas, I CAN GUARANTEE YOU that book 10 is going to be AWESOME. We all know what happened at the end of book 8, and what's waiting for us at the start of book 10. . ."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First of all, I'd like to say I found Book 9 of the Wheel of Time a riveting page-turner that I read in two sittings. My rating of five stars is based entirely on my enjoyment of the book, and very little on what I will say below.You cannot judge any single book in Jordan's series without looking at the series as one unbroken piece. Jordan weaves one incredibly grandiose tapestry, and only when you look at it like that can you put each book into perspective. When the series is finally complete, with its 12 or whatever titles, and a new reader goes back and reads the entire thing from start to finish,there will be no complaints of too many sub plots and cliffhangers that are not resolved for several books, or too many characters. The wheel of time is a series meant to be read as a whole, but since its being written in parts, we must deal with only having one piece at a time. If you need to judge this book as a piece, then you can certainly find plot holes or whatever, but its not at all fair to say that with the series still ongoing.To those who feel this series is far too drawn out, your not looking at the big picture at all. Jordan is trying to literally and realisitcally create a entire world, wage an entire war, and move every character and every army to wherever they need to go in a logical fasion. Its extremely complex, but so is the real world. If a real war was fought at that scale, moving everything into place would take a great deal of time, and its entirely fair that it should take a great deal of time in Jordans series.To the fans of this series: Remember that this is Jordan's series, his creation, 10 years of his life totally taken up in its making. Dont throw away his achievement to petty complaints about length and plot and tired lines. He is trying to write a series of the scope no author has really done before, and hes doing a pretty good job of it. My evidence of this? Millions of fans and people who enjoy his book without bothering to comment online about it.Finally, the whole point of reading is enjoyment, to be caught up in a tale. If you truly achieve this state, you won't be so put off by little plot holes, or oft-repeated lines. Sure, I notice them, but they don't take away from the magic that a book like Winters Heart creates for me. I honestly cannot possibly believe that many of the reviewers here feel that way when they read."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Unlike other people, I prefer to read when travelling rather than work. I find that you can engross yourself in the novel and time flies.Robert Jordan has the ability to be one of the great writers, but has unfortunately lost his way.The Wheel series started off with an excellent entrance and I sincerely believe he intended this to be a trilogy. Commercialism rears its ugly head and he has seen a long term money making machine. He has run out of ideas and the plot drags on. The entire last four books could have been condensed into one without loosing any of the plot.Mr. Jordan, please bring an end to this series and take time off to reflect on a new series that does not take years to finalize. Only the masters such as James Clavel and Frank Herbert had the ability to become better with each book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Ok, call me a critic, but I think I have the right after dropping so much money and time into Jordan's uh...stuff. Since he takes so long between books (and understand that I don't want to rush &quot;greatness&quot;), I have taken up reading several other series and would like to take a moment to compare his stuff to another incredible writer, Terry Goodkind and his SWORD OF TRUTH books. Let's see, where should we start....how about at the beginning.....It all starts off with a simple woods guide (Rand/Richard) who meets a beautiful woman (Moraine/Kahlan) and thus begins the adventure. He find that his simple life has developed into something else. He is the key to saving the world from the evil dude (Shaitan/The Keeper) and must do so unsing his &quot;gift&quot; of magic that has been inside him this whole time without him knowing it. Low and behold he must fight an evil, evil man at the end of the first book (Ba'alzamon/Darken Rahl) and the reader sees that it only begins from there. There are the Aes Sedai (or are they the Sisters of Light?), but they are questionable with their help because you might not know if they are of the Black Ajah (Sisters of the Dark?). Rand conquers the Stone of Tear, but Richard also finds the Stone of Tears. Rand and Richard also use &quot;the power&quot; and require a man's help to teach him since no one else can (the Sisters of Light can try, but to no avail). Rand chooses a Forsaken (Asmodean) and Richard has a host of others. It goes on and on from there... Does anyone else see these connections? If you read interviews with the writers, neither of them have read each other's work. Shyea...ok.I started off reading Robert Jordan's books back in 1946 when he wrote THE WHELL OF TIME and have waited somewhat patiently for the rest to come out and finish the story. I must admit that I thought they were the greatest things ever written, until I started reading Goodkind and the others. Then, I had a basis for comparison. While Jordan's series is still enjoyable, it doesn't have the fire that it started out with. Maybe I have just grown up since then and have learned to expect more from a book. I have to honestly say that I like Goodkind's more, but I am so hopelessly hooked on Jordan's saga that I can't stop. We've all devoted so much time and money into following our favorite characters that it would be foolish to stop now, even though the books are not what they should be.Bottom line, don't expect much and you will be pleasently delighted with Book 9. You and I know that no matter what I say here, we are all going to buy this one and the next 15 that come out until Jordan get's anywhere close to finishing the series, but at least we can grumble about it together. While you and I wait the next couple years for Book 10, I humbly suggest that you pick up the SWORD OF TRUTH and start in on it. I think you will find it a bit better...."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"One recent reviewer put in a (unwittingly) funny comment about this book, intended as praise: 'As anyone can see, there are FOUR major events happening in this book!... Get with it people!' (in fact the whole review was so ridiculously obsequeous that I would think it was sarcastic, only for the 4 star rating). Only in a Robert Jordan books would four (not so major) events be thought of as a miracle, or some wonderful occasion. It's like a joke or something: each book has no point, and if we see a major event we're so happy we think its amazing.Robert Jordan is putting his readers through a kind of perverse program: If you slog through these thousands of pages, you'll get the occasional bit of interesting plot, and meanwhile I'll get rich. Frankly I've had enough with this series. When I found out the series has ended (probably when I have grandchildren, and I'm 17 now) then I'll read the last book. Until then I have better things to do.PS All those good reviews that you see? those are all written by RJ and his wife. After all he LOVES to write."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Those of us (like me) who have first been hooked, but later disillusioned by Robert Jordan's &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series will be pleased to note that the decline in quality, first noted in volume 6, (and greatly increased in volumes 7 and 8), seems to be reversing itself in this, the 9th volume in this series.In Andor, Elayne seems to be gradually strengthening her position as (apparent) queen -- but trouble she doesn't expect is looming over the horizon.Rand is realizing that the rot in the Black Tower goes deeper than he ever imagined -- and the two former &quot;false dragons&quot; seem to be taking opposite sides. He is also realizing that loving and being loved by three different women is not as easy as it looks!Mat, long used to playing the role of the cad himself, is finding himself in a situation where the tables are turned!Perrin is devastated by the (apparent) loss of his wife.And the book ends in a very satisfying and dramatic fashion -- which I won't reveal here.Although I'm still of the opinion that Jordan has more loose threads than he can reasonably tie up, this book is such an improvement over the last 2 or 3 that I'm more than willing to re-read -- and eagerly wait for the next installment.However, one thing is clear. The Tolkien comparisons which flew thick and fast when &quot;The Eye of the World&quot; was first published, came too soon. Jordan is good -- even very good.But he is not the Master."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Most people who are review this book are sounding like broken records. First of all, if you expected instant gratification from a series with elementary A+B=C plot development, perhaps you should have started with the Harry Potter books. But if you want a story so rich in detail that it feels like you actually KNOW the characters, then go with this story. For people who have complained about book after book, and that the series is dying, then Robert Jordan must be doing something right, because if it was so bad, why are people still buying his books? The latest installments of the Wheel of Time, granted, haven't been full of action. In an epic of this proportion, you will have a rise and fall of action that will be slower than that of just one book. Jordan has written NINE books for this series. What exactly does everyone want? Zero suspense? A non-dimensional plot development? If you want a lack of tension in the stories you read, then don't read these. These book are for people who take the art of epic writing seriously. Every one of these books has contained a lot of plot development one way or another. Winter's Heart has perhaps changed the entire storyline as we know it, yet people are still complaining. What, not enough blood and gore? Robert Jordan will continue to keep his true fans, because they believe he is one of the best fantasy writers out there. They will stick with him, because they know he has a story worth sticking with. No two books have been or will be the same in this series, and as the story continues to unfold, it will only get better. Perhaps you all who have lost the faith, forgot to realize that the name of the series is the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;. The story centers much upon the development of these people's lives, than just one person. For that reason, it's not called &quot;The Life of Rand.&quot; So for all of you who out there who still appreciate the artist known as Robert Jordan, book 10 will be amazing. For those who have fallen off the wagon because you don't understand the components of an epic, I hope you will find Harry Potter very redeeming. My eight year old cousins do."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am amazed at how sometimes readers forget what made them love this series in the first place. Wasn't it the intricate details? the realism of settings and characters alike?the logic of the storyline? and the credibility of worldbuilding? All these conspired to make the Wheel Of Time not only a normal fantasy series but a whole world that seems very possible to have existed for true. And here come the genius of Robert Jordan.. Let's not forget people: this is Fantasy and not some contemprory novel with New York as the setting! And he still made it seem so believeable... That is because he created a huge world with all of its basics, he has to maintain this world or it will crumble on itself..It took him several books to build it now readers want him to end it in a book just because they can't wait anymore??? Like everything else in real world, it takes time for events to occur...and Jordan is respecting this time table while at the same time showing how characters evolve amidst what's happening. This is real life...Things are not effected by one person even if he were the Dragon Reborn but by the concerted efforts of all people involved... Let readers choose: would they want Robert Jordan to satisfy their impatience and in doing so flaw one of the biggest epic masterpieces of all time, or would they rather curb their curiosity a bit so they would be rewarded at the end???

This ninth installment reaches a new low. Jordan seems to have lost complete touch with his characters and the plot. I have a sneaking suspicion that Robert Jordan doesn't like women much. The women in Winter's Heart are forever feeling &quot;heat in their cheeks&quot; or &quot;smoothing their skirts.&quot; (If you get really bored, run a tally of how many times these phrases are used.) Nynaeve yanks and tugs at her braid so often that I began to wish she'd pull it out. Jordan's treatment of the men in the story is only slightly better. Mat and Perrin are reduced to mere shadows of their former selves and Rand is hateful. HATEFUL. The only shred of excitement occurs at the end of the book and is not enough to make up for the 600-odd pages of drivel that proceeds it. I know that there are more books forecast for this series, but I'm done. Let the Trollocs succeed.

Perrin searches for Faile and the Shaido. Mat returns and prepares to escape from Seanchen controlled Ebou Dhar. Elayne attempts to solidify support for her bid for the throne of Caemlyn. It ends with a great battle between channelers and a very important event.What I liked:*The last 100-200 pages. The events in Far Madding and at Shadar Logoth. Fantastic!*The return of Mat*Mat vs. Gholam part 2*The arrival of Noal and the theories that he sparks.*The irony of Elza vs. DashivaWhat I didn't like:*The Elayne portion of the story. I like political intrigue, but this was way too detailed and snail paced.*No progression on White Tower Split.*Perrin, who had previously been one of my favorite characters, is now involved in a tedious story line.In summary:Despite the slow pace of the first half of the book, once the story turns to the events in Far Madding, the enjoyment and excitement that I've experienced in the rest of the series comes full force and stays until the end. The ending was quite satisfying as well.

You just need to have patience.I was dissapointed with The Path of Daggers. It was just not as good as the rest and when I bought Winters Heart I hoped that he would not continue the downward slide. Thankfully he did not Winters Heart is the best book he's written in a while. Not as much filler as the others.

Since then there has been a decline with the low point for me being \\"A Path of Daggers\\".I do understand the bad reviews. I review this book using as a standard every other book I have ever read. The reviewers are comparing the later books to the glory that was the beginning of the series. I understand the high standard. You want the later books to be everything they were in the past.This book returns some of the old glory. The main reason for me being something I have been waiting to happen since book one happens. I won't give away what it is but I set the book down totally stoked for book ten (I was sorely disappointed but that's a different review, though I should warn you this book does mark a rise before a massive fall). The writing is as good as ever, the characters seem to break out of some of the annoying grooves they have fallen into (there is a great scene with Perrin chopping a guy's arm off for info).

Wow, is this the same author. I didn't get bored at all reading Winter's Heart (I've learned to skip worthless descriptions that have no effect on the plot). The material of this novel, may be the strongest since The Fires of Heaven. I never felt like there were dull moments. Some parts of the novel were less exciting than others, but he kept the pace of the novel never slowed. In The Path of Daggers I would read 200 pages and wonder why, that never happenned to me while reading Winter's Heart.I really like this novel because Mat Cauthon seems to be the focus of it. Additionally, each individual plot leaves you ready to read more. He never writes through Egwene, but he gives us hints about what is happening with her. The plots concerning Elayne, Perring and Mat are left with a great deal in doubt. I am going to start Crossroads of Twilight today and I can't wait to see how Jordan resolves their situations.

I am personally not Tolkien's greatest fan, nor am I too fond of the first three Shannara books Terry Brooks has published.After reading the eye of the world, i was hooked to the series. i quickly went to get the following books, and until the end of book three, i could never put them down. Then, book four came, and while it still lived up to its standards, it was less action-packed than the previous ones. Then, hre's where things began to go awry. The fires of heaven, in my opinion, was the worst installment in the series, and while many of you may disagree, here's my reasoning: It was in that book that there were suddenly hundreds of new, useless characters stuffed in, many of which Robert Jordan seems to be trying to give important roles, though, very unsuccessfully. This adding of characters has continued onto Winter's Heart.Many reviewers say that Winter's Heart was slow, dull, and that nothing happened. That is highly false, for if you read only the last half of the book, you will be at loss. Believe me, that is how i read it the first time, following reviewers' suggestions. The book was full of intrigue, and in my opinion, the series has in no way deteriorated in terms of plotline. Your main characters are still very distinct, and the story still progresses, revealing more and more information.However, with thousands of mentioned characters in this book, most of which Jordan keeps following, have too many sub-plots that have NOTHING to do with Tarmon Dai'don (is that how you spell it?) and the glossary is way too short for us to remember most of them. Trying to remember who's who will give you incurable headaches, and you will be forced to put the book down for a breath several times.While I am still an avid Wheel of Time fan, my only recommendations for Robert Jordan, if he still wants to keep as many fans as he once had, he should focus on Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Nynaeve(shudder), Elayne, Min and Aviendha. And, stop linking all of the characters together. Too much linking in my opinion...I still highly recommend the entire series to the new readers, for it is marvelous in it's own way. Robert Jordan can still write, and he has proven himself to be even greater than I thought he was in the last chapter of Winter's Heart."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"For all of those people complaining about the last few books give Jordan a break. He's about to come out with Book 10 in this series and you can't expect him to hit a home-run with every book. Having said that, I agree with the reviewer who said that Jordan has begun concentrating on one plot at a time. Everyone has their favorites but Jordan has said time and again that this story is about Rand and how he copes with having to save the world. Every other character either aids or hinders him in the pursuit of that goal. All the man is trying to do now is get everyone to the point where they can finally fight the Last Battle. Inevitably, some characters are going to suffer since he no longer has the time to write the 700-800 page books he was writing in the beginning of the series (because of pressure the fans put on him) and needs to kill some people off to get them in the right place at the right time. After all that, this book is pretty good at beginning to wrap things up. With the climactic ending we finally can see a glimmer of hope that maybe we will get to see the end before we all start collecting Social Security."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The Wheel of time. One of the best book series EVER. As with anything \\"Post Tolkien\\" there are going to be the noticeable similarities, but Jordan has come up with something new. He has created a book that actually grabs the reader and pulls him into the story, into the character, into the writer's world. Jordan seems to take a lot of flack for being wordy, and slow to finish up the series, when all he's really doing is being detailed. \\"But do we need to know what tune the bird is whistling, in an over described setting?\\" no, probably not, but maybe that's what some people like. Replacing the detail for the \\"figuring out the complete plot within the first 10 pages\\" type of book. After reading Jordan, very few authors appeal to me, as while Jordan may be a tad bit wordy with the whistling birds, other authors are just not descriptive enough, one of the major lacking elements of the fantasy world today.Jordan's series, to me, took a turn down around book 7 when he wrote more about politics of \\"randland\\" then about the action we were used to in books one through six. Book seven was about the same, and while book eight was a little bit better, it was still lacking the \\"old Jordan\\" flair. Book nine was continuing where book eight left off, but slowly started to improve chapter by chapter until it culminated in a grand finale that resembled the Jordan of old. A finale that left everyone I know (that read his books) debating what would happen in book 10. It left us with an anticipation for a book, a feeling I personally hadn't had since the end of book 5. I think Jordan's snapped out of his slump and this series is back on track.Conclusion? Jordan can't please everyone, that's obvious by the amount of critics writing about him, but I think even in his worst books (which were about as well written as most authors good books) he still had a great fan base. A great enough one to warrant calling him the best Modern Epic Fantasy writer today. This book is proof that the series is back.I would recommend this book to anyone who has previously read Jordan, or to anyone who hasn't... though I feel you should start with book 1."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Don't believe the griping of some of the readers crying for an end to the series. This book advances almost all of the major plotlines, and most of the minor as well. Jordan's series has always had a concentration on how the events affect the chararacters. That is why the characters and events affect the readers. This book is a perfect match of new events and the effects on the characters that we love. This volume is also FULL of suprises. Wondering who Demondred is? Read the book? How about Orangar? It's in there! Ready for fulfillments of Prophesy, and events you thought were books away....Read on!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I find it hard to understand the criticism of such a tapestry of interwoven tales. I do wish that a full cast list was supplied, as some of the less famous names seem to drift into obscurity during the intricate weaves.I believe this book is the continuation of an Epic which, when complete will be one of the most famous tales, along with Lord of the Rings.Buy it, become immersed in the rich characters and enjoy the anticipation of what's to come!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have just finished reading Winter's Heart, and the only thing I would have changed is the length of it.

And hurry!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Start from book 1 and work your way up, trust me you will not be disappointed. Fans of Terry Brooks, Tad Williams or L.E. Modessit Jr. are welcome."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'll make this short and sweet.What to expect with book nine? A bit more action than the last few, and a resolution (perhaps) of a few major story lines. Apart from that, there were several hundred pages of political maneuvering and character development. Not that those are necessarily bad things...Yes, the story moves slowly, but that is what happens in an epic of this scale. Yes, sometimes story lines get ignored for an entire book, but other story lines get developed. My biggest criticism is the use of convenient plot devices that have not been mentioned in the past eight books, but make their appearance here for the first time. But I digress.Have you been reading the series? Well, you will enjoy this volume more than the last few. Are you new to the epic? Start at book one (Eye of the World), and enjoy. But be warned - the epic isn't finished, and won't be for some time."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"There are so many negative reviews, but I enjoy what most people see as obtuse blathering. This book is agog with new subplots, distracting politics and straying storylines, but I still enjoy the writing style, the detail and the characters. It could have been better of course, but it was excellent in my opinion."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"For all those readers of the wheel of time who continue to criticize jordan's evolution of his world YOU need to just stop reading the series until he's done. You obviously don't have the patience to wait out the craftsmenship of the author. I would agree whole heartedly that books seven and eight were painful to read and slow to inspire. However those who compare book nine to the last two are entirely mistaken. &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; develops the story as much, if not more, as any of the other books in the series. Plots and subplots that Jordan has spent books developing are illuminated and/or resolved.Are there sections of the book that could be improved? Yes.Are there certain character stories that I personally enjoy more than others? Yes.Do I believe that Jordan could possibly create as real a world as he has, one with a rich history, with complex social and political cultures, in a shorter series? NO.In short--for those who have problems with the velocity of the series, STOP READING! Wait until he's done, and figure out if it's all worth it in the end. I, for one, will read each new book within weeks of release. I'm still amazed with Jordan."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"No i'm just kidding this book still doesn't resolve these little mysteries but i'm pretty sure it doesnt say for certain that Taim isn't Demandred like one reader seems to believe. I'm certain that Taim is Demandred and that Fain killed Asmodean. It is either Fain or Isam and i'd probably give 50/50 odds on it being either of them. Anybody who thinks it is Graendal has their head up their a$$. The book is awesome especially the last chapter. Anybody who's read the book yet knows what i'm talking about. Jordan rules!!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan should have stuck to writing mindless Conan novels.He took a couple of fresh ideas, that could have easily fit into a nice concise trilogy format, and dragged it kicking and screaming into a mind-boggling 9+ novels. Hears a quick summary of 6,000+ pages of drivel.A small town boy discovers that he and his friends are linked to an ancient prophecy that heralds the eventual distruction (and salvation) of the world by an ancient evil. This imprisoned evil entity uses powerful pawns to hinder the boys attempts to create a consolidated front against him. The overall premise is that the war is never-ending with heros from the past being reawakened within present day people thus &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;. Everything else is sub sub sub sub plot.Like -What happened to the Trollocs?What happened to that nutty Dream World they were popping in and out of?What about Mat's stupid fox necklace?Not to mention the stupid horn and the stupid bowl?What about the Black Ajah? The Queen? The dope in the quilt coat?Where is the wolf guy and what is his connect to Perrin? What happened to the haunted city? and the boring jerks in insect helmets? the boat women? the wilders? what about the stupid sword?Good gravy I could go on and on for days!When all is said and done I'll bet any amount of money that most people will actually skip books 6-9+ and just read the last installment of this mess without missing a beat."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It seems people complain that Jordan's books dont finish the plot or have too many characters and they are just ready for them to end. I can't help but wonder, if you are just waiting for it to end, then I can probably do that for you in a few words. Some more of the women will probably die off, maybe Mat or Perrin. Rand will ultimately beat the evil and the world will return to normal. Good beats evil. That is the formula that virtually every fantasy writer falls to in the end (except perhaps Moorcock). Thus the huge ending you are looking for is right there. Enjoy the writing. Once he ends the series, you wont get any more on these characters. Embrace that they are fleshed out more than any other series I can think of. Enjoy that each book has so many plots you may have to go back and reread some of the earlier books to catch up. My only real complaint is the 2 year lag time between books. But when it takes such a long time for the books to fall off the best seller list, it gives a writer little incentive to push another one out there! Hey, Jordan is in this to make money. If you wanna see the next one out fast, we all need to buy the hardcover and no one buy the paperback!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Like so many, I am a hardcore Jordan addict. I wait with bated breath for the publication of each new inbstallment of the Wheel of Time epic. The latest, Winter's Heart delighted me thoroughly. Jordan has created a series one can completely escape into, and this novel is definately engrossing. The dynamic relationships between the main characters, and the dramatic events of Winter's Heart absorbed me completely. I whole heartedly recommend it, and the series as a whole, to any fantasy fan!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Finally the book seems to be picking up speed. I cannot deny that the previous three books were on the slow side but then the author has to position his characters so that they can come into play when the time is right.I know most of the readers want the story to end but I have to agree with the previous reviewer, we will all miss it the moment it ends. I have a feeling the book will end in another 2 or three series and I know I will feel the emptiness you all feel when something comes to an end and I am sure it will be more than one expects. And I know that I will continue to buy this author's books no matter how many books I have to buy.When there is war between light and darkness, the whole world will be affected and not just a small population of people that have been shown in other authors' books. Well in his books even the little people who contribute to the cause are shown. That is what makes Robert Jordan's books &quot;extraordinary&quot; and that is why most of the readers keep coming back for more of his books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After reading a couple of other reviews on Robert Jordan's latest books i noticed a pattern, everybody keeps on complaining about the lack of action, slowness of it all etc. well all i can say is that yes it is coming on slowly but if he did rush it you would be even more dissapointed. RJ is building an in depth world which he has to develop over time to create a truly phenomenal piece of work. Yes i agree that he really should have fit in a conclusion to the Perrin, Mat and Egwene plots but through not finishing them he has succeeded in capturing your attention so that you have to buy the next book. So stop complaining and just wait patiently for this epic of epics to unfold."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I already wrote a review for this book. However, I think I need to do a better one. While it's true that this series is lagging on, I do feel it's finally taken a turn for the better. In my case, I'm not a huge fan of the first two books. I hated whiney-Rand, I despised everyone pushing him around. Now he's finally a man, and is taking control of his life, and his destiny.Parts of Winter's Heart could be called filler material, but some important things do happen: namely, the ending, and Rand &amp; Elayne (I was jumping up and down for that one..).I do not believe Jordan is lost, or that he's attempting to rip off fans here. I think the problem is that he took on a bigger project than he thought it was originally. There were probably things that could have been cut entirely out of the series to make it a big shorter. Perhaps a way to go would have been to release the uncut material later on, much like Stephen King did with The Stand.Read Winter's Heart, even if you are frustrated with the series. It's worth it. And I think I can honestly say he might be able to finish the book in 3 more. Truthfully, I'm not sure I want it to end. Do you want Star Wars to end? No, didn't think so. However, the difference here is that while star wars did end in a way, the world continues through a variety of authors. I know Jordan won't allow this to happen, and I think that's sad."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The real torment that Robert gives me is that the books only come out every two years. He came out with another book about Conan rather than getting on with the series. The whole thing is great...he has manufactured this whole world of cultures and characters all the way down to what they wear and why. The book keeps me going and I find it hard to put it down. I wish they came out quicker. Not wanting to just rush to the end, but to be able to keep up with the story. I am going to have to go back and start with the first book again just to keep up. I don't agree with too many of the other reviews..I like the detail Robert puts into his characters. You get a real feeling of there moods and there differences. I thought all of the clothes that Matt had to end up wearing in the book was too funny! Now I am on my heels wondering what is to become of the parts that Robert has left us hanging on and disgruntled at the fear that I am going to have to wait another 2 years. I am in to it till the end whenever that may be."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am fed up with it. I started reading the series just few months ago and I went through the first 8 books in a flash. Since book 6 the story began being boring but I stick with it. This book does it. There is no way of following the plot. Probably I am stupid but I don't remember all the 10,000 names there are and stories keep intersecting in a way that you don't even remember what you're reading. Were the hell is Faile? And what did Elayne accomplish? Is the Dragon Reborn mad or not. Stop with those side wounds I am sick of it. It's since book one. This story is never going to end. DEAR MR.

He did, but the improvement wasn't huge. The 8th book was just boring. This book had the same slow plot and unnecessary detail, but with some very exciting parts mixed in. It's just frustrating how hard it is to keep track of all these new characters that don't make any difference at all. But yes, it's worth the read overall, for the sake of finishing the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I don't think anyone would mind if the people who continually whine about the length of the books would stop reading them. If you don't like his style, or think he is a terrible author, STOP READING. By all means, go right ahead, we won't miss you. There's a reason this book has numerous devotees, (just try searching for RJ on any search engine) and it isn't due to the poor quality of the writing. The plot, characters, and everything else are interesting, or at least they still are to some of us. I don't care when it ends, because I have enjoyed reading every book so far, critics are just about the most irritating people around, especially since they don't stand a chance at creating what they mock."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It was interesting to read reviews of WOT and find that others shared my opinions - both good and bad. I have enjoyed all of the books in this series. However after reading Winter's Heart, I found that it had been so long between books, and the story had advanced so slowly in the last several books, I couldn't remember who was doing what and why. Mr. Jordan did not refresh our memories with little reminders to bring us back up to speed, as he did in earlier books. So, I decided to go back and reread all of the books. I am on book 4 and am enjoying the story even more the second time. I recommend this to anyone who has been reading WOT from the beginning (I couldn't believe it has been 11 years since the first book!). I am not complaining about how many books there are, just that it is too long in between books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"While far short of his excellent work in the first five books, Winter's Heart is certainly better than the miserable 8th book of the series.

I can't stands it no more.I used to think that this was one of the best fantasy series in a long time, it sure started that way. Length may be the problem now. It's taking a long, long time between books and I get the feeling he's dragging the story out to milk more money out of us for his retirement. Bob, you're already rich, get on with the series.This could have easily been wrapped up in a dekology if he had desired to do so a few books ago. I love the world and characters, but have gotten so tired of the random injects of side characters and sub-plots. Every scene and action seems drawn out, and I guess padded is the right word. I can't keep it all straight anymore and don't really care to.Never thought I'd say this around book 5, but I'm done."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book kept me reading for hours on end. very entertaining."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is another excellent book. What do I base that on? Well, I ask myself if I really want the series to end? The answer is always no. I love the character's and the subplot's, as well as the way that the story is told. I started reading this series a decade ago, and I still find it as enchanting as ever. I know that it must end eventually, but what is the hurry? Is Jordan really stalling? I don't think so. I reread the series again when I bought Winter's Heart to sum up everything that Mr. Jordan has done since it started. I really don't see how he could tie up all of the loose ends he started without seriously diminishing the quality of the books. I don't want to feel that I am being cheated by a hasty last battle, etc., - this seems to be what some of the reviewers want. Shouts of HURRY UP JORDAN, GET IT OVER WITH!! resounding. I am as impatient as the next reader, but I am willing to go as far as the author will take me - the series is that good. I don't want to give away any spoiler's, but in this book we are being set up, or rather the conditions are being set, for the final confrontation - whenever that may be. Good job Mr. Jordan."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Yet another wonderfull addition to Jordan's line. To light readers it would probably seem too heavy but for the serious Jordan fan the book is filled with incredibly thickening plots, just the stuff we like.

I read the last few chapters 3 times!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"When you get to 9th book in his series you realize that Jordan is very verbose and sometimes to a fault.

But do not get me wrong: this book ends so unexpectedly that I jumped up and down on one leg shouting and laughing in exhilaration. Questions of identity are answered; questions of what exactly happened in the past are answered. In some ways it leaves more questions behind, but we know who Mazrim Taim really is, now, for example.Get this book. Then read it. You will NOT be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The last three books have been frustrating. The trend continues, if Jordan is developing a style it is that of a shclock-pumping serial pulp writer. The first books got my attention, but now he has betrayed his former works and slipped into the role of the non-story teller. I hope the he gets with the program or we'll be better off watching Sienfeld reruns (same level of content, but at least its humorous)."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After my utter disappointment with Robert Jordan's last addition to The Wheel of Time books, Path of Daggers, this books renewed my faith in the series. Many fans dislike the complexity of a series so long and drawn out. Howevern I view the length as a testament to Jordan's magnificent ability to create an entire world that includes (as worlds do) more than just a few three people, after all who can tell history through the changes that only three or six people have made. No, true history is a collection people with a few leading, creating, or simply a the focus of the change. Winter Heart returns with the non-stop action and completion of prophecy that was evident in the first books but lost in the last. Jordan has again captured my sole attention for receation literature! Buy it and you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"What a discouraging reviews. Back here in the Philippines, we haven't got our copy of the 9th book. But however much the (professional) reviewers rate Mr. Jordan's WoT series, I still am waiting with anticipation the arrival of the next installment. For me, his work on WoT is one of the most enjoyable books available on shelves right now. Luckily, i read the book for my own pleasure and not for the sake of other people's literary dissection. There are some merits on the pacing observation, and I agree with the other guy when he said that the completion may come out in 2040. But the way I look at it, that's another 40 yrs. of enjoyable reading."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I forgot to mention...anyone looking for an excellent realistic fantasy series based more on true medieval history (with excellent editing, no filler, and great storytelling) should check out A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin. Book one is titled A Game of Thrones (up to three books now; all three excellent) but be warned: this series is not for the squeamish or faint of heart; medieval life was not pretty. Please support authors who put out quality work and care about the reader's satisfaction, not authors who produce shoddy work and only care about the size of their wallets."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First of all, let me say that last few books have been Robert Jordan dragging on and on tirelessly and shamelessly. I don't know if all this was in his design from the beginning but I personally think he has made his world too big for his own good. Seeing how Seanchan is just getting started as well as Rand's relationship with Sea Falk and how the Forsaken has all of a sudden all risen from death, I doubt we'll see the end of this series anytime soon.Anyways however this book is a definite improvement from his last few books. I certainly enjoyed it because it provided some definite development that is very important in the story. I'm not gonna say it here since it's gonna ruin it for some people. But two exciting developments occur in this story, one is alread on the book's cover...Mat finally meets his wife, this daughter of Nine Moons. However it's not till near the end he finds out and does something about it. And Rand finally....umm...ok I won't say it. But I assume if everything goes accordingly (something could go wrong again because end was abrupt and didn't follow up enough to tell for certain, I guess he wanted people to want to read the next volume.) we won't hear the same whinning about the pain he feels when he touches the Source. Oh yeah now that I think about it, there's one more thing that happens in the middle of the book that's interesting. Let me just say it makes men envy Rand...Anyways not as depressing as few last books certainly and they don't drag on as much. But there are of course a few problems, such as Perrin's disappearance all of a sudden much like the way Mat did in last volume...but that's ok I didn't look forward to hear him whine about his wife missing for the rest of the book...although it was just a delay of inevitable I guess. And Egwene doesn't do much either. So hope for the next book? Don't let characters just disappear, maybe if Jordan got more of them together, not spread all over the place, it won't happen. And please let Padan Fain die already??? Oh yeah, why don't you bring back Moiraine? I know that will make things between Nynaeve, Lan and Moiraine a little hairy but that's ok. Lanfear is back, so why not Moiraine? I liked her although i guess new advisor, Cadsuane's alright, too.Ok, that's end of my babbling."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"All of you who wish the series was over, don't you realize that a story this big does need a lot of time to finish? True, the books could be a bit more condensed, but even if it has slowed down since The Fires of Heaven, it's still the same epic story and all it needs is some time to wind up to a satisfying conclusion. So don't be impatient - stick with it. Though I do wish a few of the books after Winter's Heart were out as well."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"first, let me say i like this series. I do. really. the problem is that Jordan dispite all his good points never resolves one thing! sometime while reading this series i feel like im watchin a soap opera? when i first started this series about four years ago a figured definatley no more than ten book max, probably less but at thi point it looks like the series could go on for another nine or more. in this most recent installment there was some closure at the end, the taint was finally removed. hopefully in the next book a few more things will get resolved hell maybe will even find out who killed asmoden who died several books ago. I certainly wish rand would take care of bussiness, he jumps around too much he needs to consolidate his power. establish a firm grip on the 'empire of the dragon' so to speak and deffinatly get more involved in the black tower.all in all it is good it just never ends. hope this helped a little."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I don't think the fact that this series has reached nine books gives the author or publisher any mandate to allow the writing style to go to hell. I know five-year-olds that can write with more clarity. When I took my one writing class in college, I got reamed by my teacher to forcing metaphors in where they didn't belong. I think that Jordan is the king of stupid comparisons. The book is frustratingly packed with &quot;medieval cliche,&quot; terribly slow, and not worthy of the acclaim that the first eight books might have received. I got to page 300, and realized that only maybe one or two things had actually happened so far.

It was a lot better than A Path of Daggers and I look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book was better than the last two in the series but still open more doors than closed! As much as I enjoy reading a long series I am ready for some closure to at least some major plots! In the interview with RJ he mentioned at 2 or 3 more books the series conclusion. I doubt this statement but time will tell. All in all I think that at least this one picked up some pace and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"there's only one thing more that I expected from this book and it was the battle between the Aes Sedai. I've been looking forward to that for a while, and that just means more books to wait through. but what this book had was great. It brought back so many plot threads that he's left hanging for a long time. some of the most interesting parts in the series in my opinion was brought back since book 4 (Slayer, Aelfinn, Eeilfinn)and Mat is back and he finally gets to meet the DotNM. one of my complaints about the last few books of the series is the lack of Trollocs and Fades, the two enemies we became so familiar with in the beginning, but I guess the Forsake have learned that they just don't do crap to the main characters anymore, that's probably why they no longer use them. but anyways, I think this was a good book. Perrin could have done more and it could have had more action, but I enjoyed it too much to give it any less then 5"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"When I purchased this book I set it aside and re-read the previous 8 novels. &lt;Which I've been doing since book 4&gt; When I came to Winter's Heart I had the Mr. Jordan's world etched into my mind. &lt;So, instead of taking this book simply on it's own merit I took it as part of a larger whole. These books are just chapters that have chapters.&gt; I was not disappointed. SO many things were resolved in this book not just major stings but tons of smaller lines that have been left hanging from several books back. I was completely satisfied with this book and think the real Jordan fans will to. One thing though I seem to be the only one out here that LOVE the ladies in these books. Rand and Matt are important and so is Perrin but I feel the women are just as involving and interesting. What I like to see is a more even coverage of them all instead of paring it down to a couple of the characters. &lt;Which I think would get boring real fast&gt; there is no way I could stand any of these books if I didn't get breaks between the characters. That's just my opinion."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have never felt the need to publicly critize someone, untill now. Jordan may be a good writer but none of us can hide forever what we really are. Somewhere between book 3 and now Mr. Jordan decided that by dragging on this story he could milk more cash out of it. It is truly sad, not because I will not read this series any more, but because Mr Jordan no longer has my respect as a writer."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"...and endings don't seem very forthcoming either. However, book nine in the hernia-inducing &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; series accomplishes a feat rare for Robert Jordan: it is too short. Where the pace started to drag for the last two or four books, depending on your point of view, &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; keeps building to a finale that will leave you panting and wanting more.At six-hundred some pages, Jordan revamps any waning interest. Maybe the series won't conclude for another half-dozen books, but perhaps Jordan can keep it interesting. &quot;Winter's Heart&quot; suggests that maybe he can. Some of the turns-of-events that have been promised since the beginning are finally coming around. One or two even seem to be completed, in one way or another. Of course new issues arise, mostly in the venue of inter- and intra-metropolitan squabbling, but the main story picks up the pace and chugs along nicely.If you haven't started the series, don't. Not unless you have a year with nothing else to do, or you have infinite patience. But if you have started, even if you're only on the first book, keep reading. Suffer through the mild boredom of &quot;A Crown of Swords&quot; and &quot;A Path of Daggers&quot; and the reward will be &quot;Winter's Heart&quot;. Robert Jordan has remembered what the series is about, and this book should keep you going, for however long that may be."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am the first to admit that I will buy the next Jordan book as soon as it is published, but I also am suckered into this series and will never learn. Jordan has spread his plot out so much the Wheel of Time can't turn very much in each book, and that is very frustrating. I waited two years for this book to come out, but after reading it I feel like I spent 625 pages of reading material that I could have gotten off the inside cover of any other book. Yes it is an improvement over POD, but not much. One of the most interesting things for me was just trying to remember what was going on without rereading POD. That is what kept me going through the usual &quot;skirt adjusting&quot; that Jordan has his characters do way too much.If you are thinking of starting this series, DON'T. You will only be left frustrated waiting for the next book to come out. For your own sanity, wait for the whole series to come out (if it ever gets finished) and then read it. Don't get me wrong, it is a great world and wonderful set of main characters, but the last 3 or 4 books have really dragged on. If I knew I could just read until the end of the series I would not as frustrated, but I can't, so I am.I just hope that it is less than two years till the next book!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Things are a happenin' in Randland. Many, many things talked about in earlier books come to fruition in this very exciting entry into Robert Jordan's series.From Mat to Cadsuane, characters are fleshed out even more and we learn just where their place in the whole scheme of things is.And let me tell you, the ending is comparable to Lord of Chaos. I wish this series would go on for twenty volumes!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have shared the Jordan series with new readers for years and I love the complexity, but the story is not moving forward enough even within these THICK books.

The last three including this one have been really poor. And I'm a fan. Jordan's really struggling now but seeing as i've given it 10 years I'll hang about for the last two or three. Tell you what even with Mat coming back in this one its still poor. The next book cannot get any worse!! Maybe Jordan needs to read one of the Malazan Books of The Fallen for a bit of inspiration."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After eight books, you would think that Jordan's Wheel of Time series, with its cast of thousands, would have no need to introduce more. I remember a time when I was thrilled to follow along with our five travelers from Emond's Field - I was able to meet them as people and participate in their adventures. Now, it seems that most of their adventures are happening offstage while Jordan reports the minutiae of everyday circumstance resulting from their adventures. Yes, we actually have three new BIG EVENTS which occur while we crawl through 656 pages, but in the meantime, I'm feeling like I'm wading through the Starr Commission report. Jordan has created a world of rich detail -geography, culture, politics, history - but he's allowed the details to overshadow the true strength of this series - the characters. I'm at the point where I am wishing for the occurrence of Tarmon Gai'don simply for the fact that it should kill off a bunch of the supporting cast who have been spending too much time in the series' spotlight."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I wasn't thrilled with PoD when it came out. At the time I would have rated it 2 stars. After rereading the entire series in a sitting in preparation for Winter's Heart (can't keep half the supporting characters straight with such huge gaps between books), I found I really enjoyed PoD as it was simply a continuation of the story and I didn't have to wait a couple years to read it.After reading Winter's Heart, I think the only thing that could possibly keep most people from ripping on Mr. Jordan is a leap forward in time. With the entire story in hand, it would be much easier to ignore the speed bumps in the story and appreciate it as a whole.Winter's Heart was good, but I found myself, well, 'bored' with the first 300+ pages. Thankfully, the ending was exciting and finished with a bang. The excitement is fading quickly though at the prospect of YEARS ahead before the next installment..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After spending a good portion of my life reading and re-reading the WOT series, I still am optomistic every time a new volume finally hits the market. Unfortunately, I seem to be eternally doomed to disappointment. Mr. Jordan has so many story lines going that adding a bit to each will fill up the 700 pages in no time. I was surprised that he started the book with Perrin and Faile and then left them hanging in limbo, Loial and Morgase seem to have disappeared from the written page, and so on and so forth. On the other hand, I am continually amazed by the amount of planning that must have gone into the writing of this series. Some of the things mentioned in passing in the first book are only now coming into play in book number nine. Obviously he does keep track of where he wants his characters to be and has plans for them. It seems that we get teasers on each story line and then are left hanging. I only hope I will live long enough to see the conclusion of the series, be it book number 11 or 20. Although at one book a year, if we are lucky, I might lose interest by then."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Wonderful ending. Absolutely breathtaking. Only problem I had was that it was way too short. He could've dealt with a lot more stuff with a couple more hundred pages. Mat's one of my favorite characters and the part when he realizes that Tuon's the one was hilarious.I have no problems with the length of the series. With such complex and intertwining plots, RJ should not be stingy about the number of books. It is the very complexity of the story, with its numerous factions that makes the series so great. Most other fantasy series have only one set of good guys vs one set of bad. In this one, there are so many different groups working towards their ultimate goal of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; in their own ways. That's what makes it special and so real. The only other one that comes close is the Song of Ice and Fire by George R R Martin but I suspect he got some inspiration from RJ.I still love the series. I hope RJ writes faster. The waiting just kills me."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Although i have to agree that the last few novels have lacked the appeal of the earlier books i still waited three years for Winters Heart to come out. And i still finished it in less then a week. This book is far better then Path of Daggers because it actually goes somewhere. A lot is told to the reader instead of just masking it up. I fear that Jordan is going to stretch this series out for another few books, which means more waiting time for the next book to arrive on the shelves. After finishing this book i can seriously tell you that i am very excited for the next novel."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I found myself really enjoying this installment of the Wheel of Time. I believe more than usual the main characters get to be the focus. Even the prologue has a lot of the main people in it. Rand is in this one a lot as well.The book is pretty good throughout but it is the ending that really wowed me. A lot happens. The plot has some major forward momentum.So in summary this is a good book for fans. Now on to book 10!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Love the Wheel of Time books. Been hooked on them from the beginning. The last books by Brandon Sanderson are by far the best of the entire series as he gets to the point without spending a full chapter describing what someone looks like or how the hallway is decorated, but not meaning to diss on Robert Jordan, I LOVE THEM ALL."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart is book number nine in the Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan. The story starts slow as the first part of the book concentrates on Elayne and Perrin. I like Perrin, but his story doesn't move much here. Things pick up with the return of Mat, whom we didn't see in the last book. Rand's thread is slow for most of the book until we get the climactic scene . This had the potential to be the most riveting scene since Dumai's Wells at the end of Lord of Chaos, but it was unfortunately not as great as it should have been and failed to improve an otherwise lackluster book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"When the series first started, it was great and wonderful. I was amused at the attention to details and the not so subtle jabs at other fantasy series. However, it is the 9th book already and it feels like it. It's great and wonderful that Rand's three loves are bonded to him but I am finding all of the \\"extra information\\" slowing and I am finding it somewhat trite. I remember inhaling the earlier books in only a couple of days. The thrill left me after having a building drop on Matt and having to wait a whole book to find out what happened to him. I might fall in love with the series in the future but right now I am looking at other books in my digital library."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This is another awesome book in one of the most amazing series that I have ever read.

If you are a Jordan fan this will be an enjoyable book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"First off, I love the Wheel of Time saga. I am on my second time through this series in expectation of the final book. Jordan has written such a fully visualized fantasy world that one almost feels as if they were experiencing it first hand. However, this has pros and cons. The reader is in the characters heads knowing their hopes, fears, and dreams. Jordan gives a complete and very detailed description of whats going on. The advantage for the reader is a vivid mental picture of this exciting world. The downside to this is the books can seem to drag along. Winters Heart in particular is very descriptive. The plot continues to grow, events happen that effect the following books, like Rands love interests, Elayne's conception of twins and her struggle for the Lion Throne. Unfortunately, Winters Heart is not fast paced and thus my four star rating. Jordan will give an entire page describing a sword or a building. The epic battle scenes feel painfully brief after plodding along for page after page of detailed plot development. I would not recommend reading this book by itself. However, I would highly recommend this as a series, of which Winters Heart is book 9. This series is for readers who love this genera and are always wanting more after the series ended. The Wheel of Time is an epic, super sized fantasy world you could get lost in."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"A n o t h e r g r e a t b o o k i n t h e s e r i e s."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"definitely the slowest book in the series, nothing happens. yes mat is back after fans demanded him more coverage in the series after bring excluded from the least book but to this extent is extreme. he just sits and does nothing the whole book.

My least favorite book was the hook book, Eye of the World, which failed to impress me until at least halfway through. Then my favorite was the second one- The Great Hunt- which made me a loyal fan.

For me, I love the character development and the number of subplots. I really enjoy how each book is not a novel in and of itself, but instead they are almost like long chapters. Alot of people out there are whining and want RJ to wrap it up. NOT ME. By his pace I figure the series will reach 20 to 25 books, and maybe more. And I will be there for all them. His stories are rich and complex with numerous good and evil characters, usually working for a variety of different goals and with incomplete information. The only thing I ask of RJ is to make the books closer to 1000 pages."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I don't know why some of you were complaining about it.

Robert Jordan is the best the genre has to offer to date and The Wheel of Time series is only getting better. The characters are fully fleshed out and totally engaging. The plot lines are intricate and so vast that many people just can't comprehend them and as such get easily befuddled. So much so that they fail to see the genius that is The Wheel of Time. I recommend reading the books multiple times so that you can come to terms with these facts. I for one am very disappointed by the three and a half star rating that this book has recieved, obviously these people wouldn't know a great book if it hit them in their behinds. I call on all true fans of Robert Jordan and the fantasy genre in general to rate this book as it deserves, with five stars all the way."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Some people have become to used to paying out the Wheel of Time for it's past ventures, and hence have not given this GREAT book a chance as they can't get away from what is the general all-round opinion of books 7 and 8.I am a die-hard RJ fan, I have thoroughly enjoyed every single book in the series so far and will continue to do so until the series end, which I personally hope is sometime in a long unforeseeable future :) But this does not mean that I am in any way biased, it was well-written more so than book 7 and 8, it was exciting and finally the ending just rocked.Maybe if some people would just see past their grudges perhaps they could see that RJ hasn't totally 'lost' his touch, and isn't in it for the 'money', but is still putting out great quality books, making it in fact, the best series ever written IMO..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As always, Robert Jordan delivers a first class reading experience!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I found Winter's Heart to be every bit as good as the other books in The Wheel of Time series. Yes, there are numerous sub-plots that add a level of complexity to the book, but that does not mean that they add confusion. For those readers who prefer the simplicity of a single track storyline that is spoon-fed to the readers by the authors, Winter's Heart is not a book, and The Wheel of Time is not a series, for you. However, for those who love a book that will engage the mind with believeable characters, interesting plot lines, and entertaining twists in the development of the story, this is definately a book for you. I highly recommend this book for anyone who has read the series, and for those of you who haven't you should start at the beginning and work your way up to Winter's Heart. In Winter's Heart, Robert Jordan resolves some of the problems that have been plaguing the characters in the past books while still leaving plenty of suspense to work with in the next book. Some people say that the book seemed rushed at the end, and I do tend to agree to a point, but this does not detract signifigently to the quality of the book. I read this book in two days, not wanting to put it down, and can't wait for the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Of course it is. Every character is interesting; Mat, Rand, Perrin, Nynaeve..., still. Everything is moving to an ending point. True, it isn't finished yet. Every detail that has been written in this series is purposeful. A good book, movie...whatever, always stirs up emotions. This book does just that. Mr. Jordan keeps his writing fairly clean... Robert Jordan is one of the best, and has not disappointed me yet."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I read this book again, mostly for lack of anything else to read - I realized that I remembered nothing in the past 3 or 4 books in the series, and thought maybe my attention was too poor and skipped many important parts. I read it again, and this time I did not search for chapters with the word &quot;Rand&quot; in it. I found the other characters seperate plots to be enjoyable, but alltogether UNCONNECTED - if your in the series for Rand you have no need to read most of the chapters (while he is the main character and the selling point of the books, only a couple chapters include him; the rest are about one of his girl/friends little problems with power/loved one) It is like reading a collection of short stories. JORDAN WOULD IMPROVE WITH MORE CONNECTION - put the characters together or somthing; many readers complain because they like Rand and get all these tales that have nothing to do with the main plot. You will go from reading about Rand smashing buildings the next chapter begins with Faile talking to some woman. It takes alot of patience not to curse and just skip to the next chapter to find out what happens to Rand (some 15 chapters later at times). He should probably just write about Rand and what he hears about his friends, until they meet him. Do separate books on the other characters or somthing; also, Jordan wants us to like all his characters, and he puts characteristics on them that he likes; good, but when there are many main characters, we find them all moving towards an ideal man/woman that is in his mind, and thus very similar - he needs to vary them. Maybe he should look for other likeable characteristics and tag them onto them - one may be quiet and one loud, one quick to anger one patient etc. Its fairly simple, but all characters seem to be very closely related, the most radical are Min and Mat, and even then they are moving towards each other- In the end I like the ideas (forsaken, channeling, angreal, etc) but there are flaws in the book structure and characters. If he used all those thousands of pages on one main topic (Rand?) these would be very good, but I feel as if I'm reading many books mixed together - he just needs focus!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Blood and bloody ashes, 766 pages of treading water! Mr. Jordan needs to get an editor (perhaps a life). It is somewhat mind boggling that this volume received such high praise by the majority of reviewers. Note to newbies to Wheel of Time: You can skip this volume without missing much of substance and hope that Jordan actually writes something worth reading next time."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've grown so tired of reading all the bad reviews about the last 3 or 4 Jordan books, depending on the review writer. In this era of instant everything, these readers(I can't call them fans) seem to need to complain about the slow pacing of the more recent Jordan books. I understand some points of their frustration waiting 2 years for a book(as opposed to the earlier books which were usually a year apart)and not getting the complete fix they were expecting whether it be enough action or character coverage, but what hooked me from book 1(which I picked up new when it first came out)is the complete attention to details and the slow methodical maturing and growth of all the characters which includes the world itself.One thing to keep in mind is that although the 10th book is on it's way all the books add up to one outstanding story on a completely believable world with characters that you hunger for more info on and wish the best for."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The plot is very complex and so intertwined with the rest of the series that you'll wish you had taken notes in the first eight books. Some of the scenes in Winter's Heart are mysterious and dark, others are beyond awsome and filled with light like the battle at the end of the book.A central message in the Wheel of Time series is that men can't understand women and women can't understand men. This theme is well supported by Robert Jodan's shallow women. He dosen't understand women at all. The only characteristics in most of his women are: lust, anger, moodiness, pride and empathy. There are a few exeptions to this like Anida and Egwene. In contrast his men typically make very deep, interesting, and complex characters. Not to mention they are more insiteful and intelligent. I think that the best characters in this series are Mat, Perin, and Fain.Overall this book is great. Other books I recomend reading are The Chronicles of Narnia, This Present Darkness, and The Cavern of Black Ice."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan has proven himself as master of his work.

I have read many other authors and have enjoyed many of them. But I keep coming back to the wheel of time to marvel at how well they are written. I admit that the recent books have become a bit bogged down in the details, but none of it is useless information. The extra words just help me get a better feel for each of the characters and better predict what might happen next.The newest book, Winter's Heart, is a excellent book that speeds right along. The first time I read this book it took me one day. I say first time because I have read this book several times, as I have for every book in the series.In conclusion, if you love a great fantasy story and have been having trouble finding an author that puts out, try these out.

Rowling's brilliant works have a genuine sense of wonder and mystery (which Jordan lost in Book #5 or thereabaouts), and they appeal to all ages. I know Potter fans from ages 10 to 70! And, if you want gritty, realistic, &quot;adult&quot; level fanatasy, you can't do better than the Thieves' World saga. Read this series, and you'll realize just how shallow, immature, and childish every single character in Jordan's world truly is. I cannot imagine anyone from Randland (especially the Aes Sedai) surviving more than a day in rough-and-tumble Sanctuary!Finally, if you want simple sword-and-sorcery action that you can translate into Dungeons and Dragons games (I'm a gamer myself, so I'm not being facetious), read the D&amp;D novels that Wizards of the Coast is publishing. They have fairly good plots (better than when TSR was printing them), have lots of action, and yes, they actually have beginnings, middles, and endings! I say this because from my experience, just about the only people who are still following this story ARE gamers like myself. And I feel you guys deserve much better than Jordan."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Last June, I stumbled upon one of the best books I have ever read.

Finally, Winter's Heart was released, and I was hoping for some kind of retribution for the terrible writing that I endured because I enjoy the series. I found that, but only with one part. Yes! Rand FINALLY cleansed the male half of the One Power, but that's the only thing that happened. Nothing else. Perrin is still looking for Faile, Elayne is still trying to be a queen and Egwene...well, what happened to her? Mat's bit was interesting as well, but it took him long enough to figure out who the daughter of the nine moons was. Please, Mr. Jordan, either end the series while you still have some dignity or start making the story move again."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I loved the Wheel of Time series and I started reading them years ago. However, it's been so long since the last book came out that I've lost track of everything. It's gotten so convoluted, that I feel I have to reread the whole series again just to refresh myself with what has happened. I'm sure Jordan still spins a good tale, but this reader has a life and can't wait years and years for the next unfinished chapter. Because that's what the story has become-unfinished and only the most die hard fans can keep up. I'm afraid the rest of our attention spans are not quite blessed with such fortitude. Maybe I'll return once the series is wrapped up and and I can enjoy a good story, but until then I've already moved on."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"People who continually criticize Jordan's books seem to have a few things in common. First, they think there is not enough action in the later volumes, second they think the characters aren't well developed enough(are all similar, especially the women) or they think that the books are just too long and need to be finished.For those looking for action, Jordan returns to his earlier novels with this new piece, filling it with fight scenes where the improbable becomes the likely. As always he also writes unbelievably engaging dialogue, whether between major characters, or in negotiations between nations.Alright, now for those who think that the characters are not solid and deep. Can you really complain in any way about the 3 main characters(rand, perrin, and mat) They are as different as can be, Rand plauged by the power that is slowly driving him insane even as he tries to harden himself for the last battle, and then Mat, who provides excellent comedy(could you really keep from laughing when Tuon attacked him?) and despite perrin's abscence in most of this volume, he symbolizes honor, devotion, and hard work.The major female characters are just as varied, and anyone who seems them as the same are just foolish. While the main characters are all strong women, it is necessity, can you imagine an effective character who cries and hides behind a man everytime anything happens? I have not noticed anyone complaining that all of the men are hard, tough men. In the roles they must fill they need to be competent and confident. Furthermore, if you look at Elayne, Nynaeve, Min, Sorilea, Cadsuane, and Aviendha just to name a few, they are all very unique.The interaction between these characters is unbelievable, at a level that could only be possible with the thousands of pages jordan has dedicated to it. Personally I think most of those who complain about these books should not bother reading them, and just read comic books or something instead if they are looking for quick and fast resolving conflict. For the rest of you who enjoy the books as I do, take a little extra time reading it and appreciate the writing. If you have the time i strongly recommend going through the entire series again, you will find an unbelievable amount of neat references to future events in the earlier books, and you will be amazed by how the characters grow and change. If you dont believe me, look at Min's character, or my personal favorite, Mat.Anyway, if you are new to the world of Robert Jordan, do not be at all surprised to find yourself enjoying his story immensely, and returning to read the books again."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"the gambler finaly meets the daughter of the nine moons. finalythe series looks to be going somewhere. It look to climax inthe next 2 books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"There is much to say about this book and Jordan's entire Wheel of Time Series. First, I will say this. Winters Heart does not contain the same passion and fervor I found in the first book. I have now read the series twice. Each time, after reading the first book, I cannot get enough. I finish the first three books feeling Jordan has composed a masterfull series. Looking back at the past six novels, I think Jordan has slowed the pace of his novels and changed his characters personalities so that the series has lost some of its original flair. If you have read the Path of Daggers, then I encourage you to read Winters Heart, which is a much better novel. Winters Heart reminds me of the Brothers Karamazov. An interesting beginning, a great finish, and a necessary but boring middle. How Elayne secures the throne of Andor does not play a huge role in this Last Battle plot. Of the major plots Jordan weaves, this one seemed boring in Winters Heart. I enjoyed reading about the developments concerning Perrin, Mat and Rand, but Elayne bored me and Egwene was hardly mentioned.The way Jordan develops multiple plots allows for multiple climaxs throughout the novel. In Winter's Heart Jordan takes full advantage of his style. He leaves you hanging with Perrin's, Mat's, and Elayne's situations, and I admit, the final pages concerning Elayne sparked my interest. The parts of the novel concerning Rand were very intense and suspenseful. If you are reading the reviews for this book, you have probably read the previous eight books. In that case, buy this book, read it, and you will enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The problem with this this book and in fact the series can be boiled down to one character- Nyaneve. If I have to read once more about how she &quot;tugs on her braid with white knuckles.&quot; I'm going to go crazy. It seems in the last few books, the only thing that women do is give each other &quot;cold stares and grimaces.&quot; I used to love this series, but really, finish it up,I started reading this series almost half my life ago."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am unimpressed with the complaints brought to bear on this book and the series at large. It remains, in my opinion and others', the modern benchmark for a fantasy series. I would begin with the disclaimer that I am totally biased in favor of the series as that I have been hopelessly addicted since book one. Yet I have no regrets save one: I wish I hadn't discovered Jordan's dazzlingly engrossing world until the series was complete. It's a similar feeling to the one I get when I think of Lucas' Star Wars. People need to be patient and let the Wheel do its work and if they cannot find the patience within themselves their loss. Kudos to Mr. Jordan for another heady installment, and can I just say: Matt is a ... I am looking forward to Battles yet to come and I secretly hope that once Tarmon Gaidon reaches its conclusion, Jordan will begin writing of the Age of legends so we can find out what the hell a Shock Lance and a Sho Wing are..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It's lame that Jordan want's to make money instead of writing.It's ok if he earns some bucks, but writing books for gaining money is not a cleaver move.I bouth the first books from jordan here in amazon, een my winter's heart copy.The book is just not worthy.Please be adviced Robert Jordan has just turned the series into a money making franchaise.

I started reading this series this *spring* and now I've read all 9. The books are good, though much slower in the last books, short of WoT. You know what? I like it. It's actually a very good series, and the descriptions of people and areas just add to the depth of the story. Was it worth the money? Sure.Would I say that this was the all-important Fantasy Book of the Millennium worth waiting several years for? Nope. Maybe I'll be more cynical when Book 10 finally arrives, when I've had to wait as long as you, but right now I very very much enjoyed this book.And, very much like many of the readers out there I'd wish the story was already written to it's end, but then rather in 5 books than 1, if they were all coming out this instant. Right now it looks like I'll have to wait many yeeeeeeeeeeears for the end :(, but well.. I can't have all that I want either.Kjella"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Many People are frustrated with Jordan's books, for the very reasons I love them. With so many inter-woven plots an image of chaos and confusion is created. Many of you people want an orderly nice step-by-step plot progression, but think realistically, if this were actually happening would it be so easy to control and contain? I think that this series gives a hint of the mad chaos that would occour if this were a true story. The reason that i love this series is that it attempts to become reality.If any of you would like to chat about the book give me a tell on AOL Instant Messenger.Nerio8havoc87@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book was absolutely awesome. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that I thought it was too short. There are definately major strides towards wrapping up some of the plotlines in the story.If you've read RJ up until now, I can't imagine you not reading this one. So to any of you considering starting this series, I would highly recommend it. Just beware of the painful and agonizing wait for the next installment. Hahahaha. Outty."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I just finished the book and all I can say is &quot;Whew!&quot; It seems that the series has moved into four major plot lines: Mat in Ebou Dar with the Seanchan, Perrin searching for Faile and the rest of the company, Egwene and her army marching on the white tower, and Rand resolving the major problems of his life :) I won't get into more detail than that.This book spends the majority of its time on the Mat and Rand plot lines (thankfully, since those are the best in my mind.) For the first time since &quot;Lord of Chaos&quot; Jordan has delivered a book to us that is mostly plot development - and good plot development at that!Bottom line is that this book finally gets the series moving again. Unfortunately, it sets book 10 up as a potential dud, as it will most likely focus on Perrin's search for Faile and the seige of the White Tower (that won't be too bad, but it's just not as good as Mat and Rand's plot lines). The pace set in this book erases all hopes of completing the series by book 11. Maybe 12 will do it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Since Jordan's editor at TOR is his wife, I'm not surprised with the low ratings he's engendering these days.I'm one person who won't read Jordan ever again. I stopped with the last book and am glad I did, to read the reviews here.Try George RR Martin, folks, or Glen Cook, Robin Hobb, Guy Gavriel Kay (the REAL master) and Sean Russell."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The true power of the WoT series comes from the graphic, awesome, world-development that RJ has employed throughout. The ancillary plots that are described only enrich the primary storylines. The story is no longer about three ta'veren boys ripped out of their comfortable village life, but about a world that is being plunged into turmoil in waiting for the cataclysmic event of the battle between the Light's champion, and the terrible Great Lord of Dark. It is the epic description of the people throughout the world seeing change and fighting for their survival that lifts this series above the nave one-hobbit-against-all-that-is-evil type stories such as Lord of the Rings.It is the rich character development that makes all of his books so interesting. Indeed, as the intrigue has increased, and different and more diverse characters have been introduced, whether serving the Light or the Dark, the series has improved. RJ's imagination has definitely matured since Eye of the World.Winter's Heart sees many questions answered, and gives the reader satisfaction by proving their thoughts correct about the identity of Osan'Gar and Aran'Gar, and Cyndane, and various others. The Chosen being mobilised under Death heightens the tension of the book, and the victory of Rand with the Choedan Kal shows that the series is now inexorably creeping towards a climax.Winter's Heart, with the exception of the tedious reactions of Perrin to his wife's abduction, which could definitely have been condensed into a single chapter, I found was the best of all of the series so far.However, there are certainly things that could have been done to improve the book. Where were the shadowspawn?!? Granted, the series is now about the mobilisation of the human forces, but it seems that Shai'tan does not even care that there is going to be resistance when the remainder of the seals fails. Where are the legions of the Dark that so captured the attention and imagination of the reader in book 1? If the ta'veren had been followed and harassed solely by Friends of the Dark or Seanchan through to Caemlyn before the Eye, would there have even been the satisfied readership to allow a book 2?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm sorry but I have to say that most of those who have written reviews here are a bunch of whiners. I think that most of you are missing a few of the points that have been around since the beginning of the series. It's a story of a world on the brink, and most of you get upset when new characters are introduced and not enough progress seems to be being made for you. Real life is much the same, reaching those points where you just want to scream because things don't go as quickly as you want them to. The point is that the diversity of characters and the &quot;stalling&quot; that you mention are aspects that make the series more believable and realistic than other fantasy efforts where the heroes run straight into the battle and pull off a victory. Jordan doesn't do this. He takes his time, and writes a damn fine novel. There was alot of things hinted at in the early books that still have to be covered for the story to make sense. So let Jordan finish his job, because he's doing it well."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I've been seeing a lot of reviewers who go on and on along the lines of &quot;WAAAA, Jordan's stuck ... he's in a rut ... the series is going nowhere!&quot;. Don't let the negativity deter you from reading this incredible series of books.Having been a voracious reader ever since I learned, I have to say that this series has been one of the most captivating and compelling I've ever read. The incredible complexity of the story, with so many strong and vital primary characters with an enormous supporting cast, draws me (no compells me) to want more and more of the story. As far as I'm concerned, as long as he keeps the characters and the story line so vital, Jordan can run this series to 20 books.So, if you're new to this series, I say ignore the immediate gratification detractors who are looking for a quick fix. Enjoy it! Savor it! Take your time, get to know the characters, learn about this incredibly complex society that Jordan has created. If you do that I know you'll enjoy it as I do."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I think that this book, as well as all of the other eight books, is a great book. I say Jordan is doing a wonderful job, and if he hardly mentions some of the main characters sometimes, well, get over it! He'll bring them back in later, maybe in the next book. There are more important things he has to say a bout the other characters. Also, the mini-plots I'm sure will come together at the end. They are necessary, because without mini-plots two things will have happened: 1)The books would be boring, with only one main plot, and the characters do nothing but go along with this one major theme, which would make the book completely unrealistic of normal lives, which don'ty always have a binding theme, and 2) The series would be long over. I don't know about you but these books keep me occupied, and I like them a lot. If you don't like them, don't complain. Let others amke their own decisions about the book, because negativity does not help anyone. In the end, I love all of the Whell of Time series, and cannot wait until January for the next book!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I can't believe all of the complaining from fans about this book. If you went back and actually took the time to re-read the reast of the series - you would realize all of the nuances and events that are occuring instead of being bored due to ignorance. Admittedly, the books due take QUITE a while to be published between each other, however, that is all the more reason to re-read since you forget so much! Jordan has built such a real, elaborate world that it would be cheating us to skip over minor characters since that attention to detail is what made us love them in the first place. Any who are bored with this book are not true fans and should just go back to reading their quick-action, no-think-required stories and leave the intellectually-pleasing, challenging world of Jordan to those of us that have the tools to appreciate it.

Needless to say, I was not disappointed. His characters and their realistic struggles and shortcomings held me riveted to the pages so that I had to force myself to take my time to make it last. I would definitely suggest this book to all fans of Jordan and fantasy alike. As for all you naysayers who complain about the length of the novels and the time in between, I denounce you all. What do you expect? That a book can be written overnight? I didn't hear anyone complaining about the &quot;Belgariad&quot; or the &quot;Mallorean&quot;.

Encyclopaedia Britannica is detailed but is not a compelling read. The only reason this book was better than the previous two was the action in the last 50 pages. So I paid for fifty pages of action and 600+ pages of dull plotting between Windfinder/Aes Sedai/Andor factions that just aren't that central to the plot?Please, take your hard-earned dollar and go buy George R.R.

Instead of reading it because I had to, as I had been recently, I found myself reading a spellbinding page-turner. For the first time in ages, all three of the ta'veren had something significant to do, with only Egwene left out of the action. Even Egwene's relative absence didn't bother me much, since I have grown a little tired of Aes Sedai maneuvering. Mat's bits were, of course, the highlight of the book.

Some of the answers you've been waiting for are starting to arrive. You'll see the end drawing near in this book. We'll all miss the characters, I think, but isn't it good to know that soon there will be a resolution? This one rates up there with the first three. READ IT. you'll be glad you did.

Lastly, and this is for you, Robert, why even have that poor glossary in the book? I'd prefer 10 or so more pages of story than that poor excuse for a reference.

The ending of this one rivals the ends of the first two books...and we get to see much more of Rand (finally!)My only complaint is that I do NOT want to have to wait two more years until the next book comes out - it's harder to remember all the characters when there's such a long lull.

He's everybody's favorite tramp, and should occupy a signifigant portion of each book along with Rand, ElayneEgweneMinAviendhaNynaeve(they should only get one portion together, it's boring), and various Forsaken and Darkfriends. Two very intriguing characters that don't get enough attention are Cadsuane and Lan.. I think both need a real battle so we can measure the strength of each against the other heroes in the book. This looks like it may be a 15 book series ,if Jordan lives to be 120!!

Winter's Heart was a decent book and many have said it does move SOME major plots along the way. Unfortunately I have come to see something in all of the books that I have read in this series that I just don't like, that being the LACK of accents. RJ spends s much ogf his time writing &quot;In a seanchean drawl...&quot; that you want to imagine what precisely what it would sound like. The closest tat he gets is the arrangement of words that Bayle Domon use's in his smal bit, like parts Throughout the different stories. After referring to an accent, he, then continues to write in standard englis. I feel that he needs to start showing how they would speak, such as the Redwall series by Brian Jaques (I know they look like kids stories, but, he hits on those little things like ACCENTS)Other than that the book proceeded Much better tan thatof the last two.

So I may be more critical than I would have been if I had just read Winter's Heart.Winter's Heart is boring. Well at least, large sections of it are. The first six hundred pages could have been edited down to two hundred pages without losing one bit of important information. The last fity pages could have been expanded to two hundred pages with the timeline advancing a bit more and this book could have been a good, maybe even great book.

The ending was absolutelt superb and it is my belief that everyone out there is being a little bit critical of Mr. Jordan. I mean, if you think that you can do better then please go out and write one of these books, I'll buy it and then tell that it really sucks.

For any of you bored by the last few books, just skip to the last twenty or thirty pages for some serious action! We finally hear something from Mat, and he even meets the Daughter of Nine Moons! A few of the things I didn't like, however, included: 1) Egwene and the rebel Aes Sedai never did anything like you expected them to from the end of the last book. 2) Mat's problem of learning how to make fireworks is never really solved, which it probably should have been. 3) The Forsaken show up at the end of the book, but, from the number of good guys there, you'd expect a little more to happen to them. All in all, however, this was a really good book. If you're interested, however, I'd suggest reading books 1-8 first, as all the books after 1 make no sense without having read the previous books. Definitely a good read, though!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. I thought that RJ cleared up a lot of loose ends in this book but that it seemed lacking in content. He left a lot of the characters out of this book. It was really short compared to the other books that started the series. He focused on Perrin for the first couple of chapters and then there was nothing about him in rest of the book. He barely had anything in there about the White Tower issues either. It felt like everything that had happened in the previous couple of books was totally ignored in this book. I can't wait for his next book but I hope that it is longer and more indepth then this one."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I sincerely hope that the next book is the last, and that this one is only meant to be a bridge to let all the action play itself out to a satisfactory conclusion. I have been waiting a long while for this sequel, and I was most disappointed. There is very little of anything resembling action in these pages. I am a loyal RJ fan, and have bought each book the second it became available, but this is the first time I was able to actually put one down for a couple of days. NOTHING HAPPENED UNTIL THE VERY LAST FOUR PAGES OR SO! It was an excercise in annoyance. Mat's storyline was just beginning to get interesting when it ended. Perrin didn't actually do anything. Elayne, Min and Aviendah certainly had potential, but that was all they had. Rand only really needed to be in the last four pages. All and all, it was quite a let down. Buy it, put it on the shelf, and wait for the reviews on the next book before you bother to open it. I know I will."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The book is ok. SOMETHING finally happens. But Mr. Jordan's seemingly endless colthing discriptions may do him well in getting a job at Vogue but after nine books it's getting a bit old. Have you all noticed that the tpye is getting larger and the space between the lines seems to be expanding? Good tactics - less writing means more money faster. If you want more book for your bucks read George R.R. Martin. His is a tale you can sink your teeth into."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I really liked this book. While it's still not as fast paced as the first three books, it's just as good. The only complaint I have is that I am going to have to wait until the next book to see what happens to mat. The book leavs you hanging at the point where Mat is leaving. Hopefully we will only have to wait for one year instead of too for the next book. I can't wait to find out what happens in the next one."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well the wait is over and it was actually worth it. Robert Jordan returns to the tried and true foundation which escalated his first six books from story to legend to myth. This foundation was sadly lacking in his last two books, and it appeared that his interests lay in stretching the series out as long as he could for the increased revenue. The fact that he sold the electronic rights to the prologue only solidified this suspicion. But this book abolished those doubts. The storyline honestly progressed. The characters honestlyly appeared rational. And the book honestly ended in a great battle scene, rather than an assasination attempt or a boffed forsaken killing. The only thing missing was Loial. But, even so, the day after finishing the book I found myself wanting to pick it up again and skim through it once more. The eighth book has sat on a shelf collecting dust since the first and only time I read it. What an improvement! Jordan is back."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"WoT has become Waste of Time and Robert Jordan seems to be stringing these along for no other reason other than more books equals more $$. I struggled through even finishing this one. I'd suggest trying another author like Feist, Eddings, or George RR Martin."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book was better than some of the previous books but the same problem with the series exists - where or where is this all going? I think Jordan has forgotten that people like to read books that have an actual ending. Sure this is a series and we should all be grateful that he puts all the detail in the world that he does, but without an ending to this series I might as well spend my time with MY real world instead of this fictional one. This series is dragging on for so long that the real world is becoming more interesting and has more sense of closure. I wouldn't mind it so much if just ONE story line had an end. Instead, Jordan keeps adding characters and story lines like a child who is experimenting with cooking for the first time and thinks that the more ingredients you add the better the taste. It's been so long that I forget ALL the characters but I'm pretty sure only Moraine has died so far. It's so bad that I had to jog my memory to recall who Pain was when he made his reappearance.I suppose that when each book comes out we are expected to go back and review all the previous books so we can refresh our memories. This makes me wonder what kind of grip Jordan has on reality. Does he really think that most people have the time (or willpower) to go back and read all his books when a new one comes out? If he published one book a year I would probably be forced to spend all my reading time with just the WOT series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Those who have faithfully read the Wheel of Time series will enjoy the plot resolutions of Rand fighting the Black Tower rebels, the mystery of Taim and Demandred, the revelation of the Daughter of Nine Moons, Rand's multiple romances, Mat's romance with Queen Tylin, and the use of the figurine sa'angreals.There are further developments in Perrin's character as he meets the Queen of Ghealdan and seeks to rescue Faile. Mat gets into another amazing scrape, and causes incredible side effects as he extricates himself.There is a climatic battle scene involving most of the Forsaken but NOT Rand al'Thor. That's a nice twist.There are some slow chapters, particularly with Perrin, but fewer than in Path of Daggers. This book is at least as good as Crown of Swords, and I think it is better, tighter, than Fires of Heaven."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This was by far one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. Robert Jordan makes this very realistic. When I was reading it I was wondering if something like this really could have happened in another time or another place. The books have a very large cast of important characters. There's a lot of bickering, bantering, politics. You will hate some of the characters and love some of the others. Winter's Heart is a large book but that shouldn't be an excuse of not buying/reading. It goes by quick and you will be relunctant to put it down. It is that good. I read this book in three days!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I started reading this book word by word.....Then just read the first line of each paragraph and then the first line of each page. I never missed a thing. There is no story..there is nothing but description after description of unimportant events, thoughts and environment. Over and over again and again. I got the book at the library....Why anyone would spend money on this nonsense is beyond me. Books like this should be condensed from over 600 pages to less than 100. Then it might be interesting reading. On a scale of 1 to 5 I give this a zero."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I thought this series of books was slated to end at number eight. It's too bad that it didn't really. I gave up reading them after the 5th installment and haven't regretted it. It's been so long since I read one that I became curious and picked up a copy from the library. Thank goodness I didn't pay money for this snoozer! I gave up on this series and urge you to do the same."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan, I want my money back! This book just does not have the stuff."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Never again will I read any of Robert Jordan's work. I'm sick and tired of this long and drawn out series. Too bad, his first few books seemed to have potential."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The book was a gift for my daughter and she could not have been more pleased. She has long since read it and I am about to get her another one. It arrived exactly when predicted and shipped to a second address just fine."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This book is a very good book in from (Robert Jordan). It is a fun book for the first word to the last word. If you like this kind of sciences fiction/ fantasy books, then I will recommend that you will want to read this collection of books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have to admit, I was a little disheartened by the lack of momentum generated by The Path of Daggers (Book 8). A Crown of Swords was fantastic, chock full of excitement and it left me impatient for more, but unfortunately POD gives you nothing but setup and little movement to keep the series alive. Only the developments at the end of the book keep it going.While Path of Daggers left me somewhat bored, Winter's Heart blew me away. I felt like I was back in the middle of the series - tons of developments and new twists manifest themselves in this book. We finally get back to Mat and his Seanchan woes; his absence in the previous book left a huge hole in the series. He's still finding ways to get into trouble, be it with Tylin, a gholam bent on sucking him dry or the recently arrived Daughter of the Nine Moons (hint, hint). Perrin also has a health dose, his story could have been continued a bit more though - between Massema, the Shaido and Faile's kidnapping that POD left us with I hoped for a bit more development. Still, it was satisfying.The best thing about Winter's Heart has to be the way the story moves. There is just so much going on; every page is captivating (excluding the prologue, which is a bit boring). We see Rand, Mat, Perrin, Massema, Thom, Elayne, Fain, and their respective followings as well as ALL of the Forsaken getting into the action. Much about the reincarnated chosens' identities are revealed, and we are still being teased about the mysterious Luc/Isam stalker of Tel'aran'rhiod.Winter's Heart was really a breath of fresh air; it has revived the series and with its spectacular ening (Rand vs. the taint and Aes Sedai/Ashaman vs. the Forsaken) it will leave you begging for more. I personally can't wait for the next book; Jordan has done a great job so far with this incredible series. A must read for fantasy fans and a great read for anyone!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"the question is, will he eventually bring this series to a conclusion before he leaves this life, or more importantly, before I do - I'm pushing 60 years of age and realize I'll never know 'how it all comes out' in the 'real world', will I suffer the same result with this series? You do realize authors have passed on before completing a series, is that our fate in this case?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The first few books of this series were very promising but now it has been trumped down into soap opreaish fluff. We get the point Bobby, Rand has a bunch of women chasing after him, now get the story. I am not saying that interaction and weaving between characters is bad, but after 9 one thousand paged books, GIVE ME A BREAK. What ever happened to the story line? What happened to the mystery? The magic? Oh well.. just another master-piece to be thrown down the crap shoot..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I love this series, I have spent much time reading the books and I have enjoyed every single one. I do not know where some people get the idea that his work has gone downhill, I for one believe that he has increased his work. I love the series and I truly like this book because of the different things that are closed, and many new things are explained and discussed. The book is truly a masterpiece of fantasy work. I have read many fantasy books and this is definately among the top 20. All of his Books have shown much work and time put into, I for one believe that he has spent his time to provide us with enjoyment. So I say, Thank You Robert Jordan."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After reading all the other reviews, I have to say that I hold the first few reviewers in contempt for abandoning these books. I know things got a bit slow in the past few books, but this one picked up the pace again. Several things I had been waiting for a long time finally happened, and several more are about to happen. What most of you seem not to understand is that the Wheel of Time is a masterpiece, a writer's dream (and a reader's too). This world, coming from one man's imagination, is every bit as complex as the one we live in now. It takes a lot of time and a lot of effort to create something so complex, and indeed, it was the very complexity of it that drew me into the series in the first place after a very good friend of mine introduced me to the first book. I'm a fast reader; I zip through books and then I'm left looking for more. These long and complicated books are just what I needed. The well thought out plot leaves me thinking through events that have happend, the effect of them, the various characters, and most of all, what will happen next. By the way, does anyone else think that Mazrim Taim is a Forsaken, possibly Demandred? Anyway, think twice before you give up these books. If you don't have the mental capacity to stick with it once you've started, then you shouldn't have entered this world at all. As a young writer, I praise Robert Jordan for his genius and hope that someday I will be at least half as good as he is."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"After reading a few of the reviews listed I had to say my piece. I have been reading this series since Eye of the World was 2 days old, and I have to say, everytime I get done with one book I cannot wait for the next, the biggest complaint I have of any of the books is the wait for the next one. From the first page I have read each book from start to finish without putting it down to even sleep, I might stop sometimes to really think about what all has occured before, but that is it, for those of you who don't think Jordan knows where he is going with the plot, I say so what, as long as he does what he has done and stick with the story he is telling, I say write another 10 books before finishing, I would not complain one bit, as much as I want to know the ending, I don't want them to end."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This one is definitely better then the one before, but Jordan has to many personages in to many places, so he needs to begin a bit of a slaughter among his main personages (preferably Perrin and Faile as first victims) and bring the others more to the same place, because it's getting to confusing. Secondly, the plot about Rands empire is illogical, anyone who rules so many people should get them on one line and check on all of them, especially on the Black Tower, but he's just jumping around doing none of the obvious, logical things. This is one of WOT's weakest points, while in other series, for example Sword of thruth the main personages have their logic and follow it admirably, even if they or their motivations change."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I hate to beat a dead horse but Jordan needs to finish this series soon! I know some will say that creating a tapestry this large requires many books but please, more than 9?! Unlike some Jordan fans, I do not have time to re-read previous books just to remember who someone is...and I don't mean the obvious main characters. Some of the names are so similar that I don't remember if the character is a Darkfriend, a Wavemistress, or a Aes Sedai. This is extremely frustrating. Get this book at a library or skim it as I did to catch the major events."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart continues the tradition of the Wheel Of Time series. Whilst Jordan has been critised for his writing style, to each his own and especialy his readers! Jordan has stayed faithful to his characters and whilst introducing some new ones he has again reintroduced characters that we thought were past. Jordan's style is not for everyone, but those who enjoy his work would I'm sure apreciate the magnitude of the universe and his attempts to create a world which appears to have a tangible history and exsistance. I applaude Jordan for his effort to keep the characters rolling along at a steady pace, but have reviewed this installment lower than the preecding books because whilst I like his style, I feel that perhaps with the end of the series assuredly just over the rise, Jordan should perhaps increase the pace slightly and included at least one more confrontation. But more importantly Book 9 should have been released sooner than this! To wait too long between chapters is dangerous and can be alienating to some for the perceived idea that the author is trying to 'cash in' too much so to speak by releasing ancillary titles. I belive and hope that Jordan will release book 10 sooner rather than later!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Like the below reviewers I too wonder why I read this series, perhaps like the others it's simply wanting to see how my investment of time will ultimately pay off.The last few books have been laughable, with the trademark Jordan 'women are tyrants' characters, next to no plot development and, of course, Rand's tired self-loathing (didn't see this better with the Covenant series?).But I didn't hate this one.Why? Maybe it was a bit sleeker. Maybe the women seemed a bit more like human beings, maybe there was the hint of resolution. But I actually enjoyed the reading of it.Jordan's sin, if one can call it that, is that as the genre's most popular face, he draws attention away from more deserving authors like, of course, George Martin. But so be it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I felt this book was not as effectively thrilling and adventurous as the first five,but I did think it was entertaining. Some of the reviews I read told the author to,\\" End it already! Nine books are to many!\\" I think the series has gone on for a long time but so far every book has been enjoyable.To me, this book aroused as many questions as it answered,but was still a compelling read. I wish that they had told more about Faile's capture and Perrin's hunt after her. Jordan only gave them a few chapters and then moved on to Rand, Egwene and the rebel Aes sedai, and Mat and the Seanchan. And to all of you who think men are sumpreme leaders of the world, I'd bet anything Aviendha could beat the ... out of Rand one-on-one."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Hee hee!I was out and about, browsing my local Kinokuniya bookstore, when what do I see? Can it be? the book that is going to be issued on paperback in January 2002, right before my eyes? Yes, kiddies, if you are in Japan, look for it yourself.....and yes, the book is a great read, as much as his 8 other Wheel of Time books. Here's one happy customer."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Robert Jordan has lost control of this series after Lord of Chaos (the sixth book)books 7 and 8 were very bad Book 9 seems to be an attempt to get back control . But Jordan needs to get atleast some of the sub plots to a logical conclusion and get on with the main story. The main problem is that there are too many sub plots which do not get closed. I got nothing against sub plots but they should get over in two books or so. Carrying them on and on dilutes focus from the main plots. Further the new books come with more sub plots and when the old ones are not closed it just becomes too much. Best thing about this book is that Mat resurfaces"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Unfortunately this book is as slowpaced and boring as the last two in the series... one begins to wonder if Mr. Jordan still writes this himself ... the problem is that as everyone elsewho owns the rest of the series , I am buying the new ones automatically as they come out, but I think that I will really wait and read some reviews before buying the next one.I would love to have one single female character not bukkying everyone :P !!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"God forbid people that forget things go back and re-read!It's GOOD to have loose ends and such leftover at the end of the book. It's what has me itching to read the next book.Jordan's complexity and the length is what makes it good. The number of books is irelevant; if he has a big story to tell than spread it out. As long as something is always happening than I'm happy. Nobody can argue with the fact that something always happens in those stories.I loved every book so far and I almost cried when I finished the last book because the next one wasn't waiting for me at the store."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"hehe... I feel sorry for all of you who strangely enough stopped reading in the middle of this book. My opinion is that it turned out to be the best Jordan book since the early ones.And the last chapter is if not the best, anyhow at least one of the best so far..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Well, I glad Mat is back, thank the Light. I know I got into this book, and the series, because I've just recently finished what's around so far, since I'm using the slang and other distinctly Wheel of Time language. That happens if I read good fantasy, and by good, I mean engaging. Sure, Jordan isn't writing like Shakespeare, but as far a a good read is concerned, this goes.What concerns me, however, is this book's reluctance to decide if it will appeal to the mass public or scholars. Most of the time, it is the former. However, endlessly branching subplots tempt me to make charts. I wish Jordan did better at compacting his characters and events. Sometimes the book also gets predictable. For example, who didn't see Mazrim Taim's true nature being revealed? I know I expected that much. In addition, Jordan (and this is a problem with all of the series) continues to have almost no characters that do not reappear again and again. Even the most insignificant personage, once being given a name, will be something like pivotal later on.If you're looking for fun, suspense, and a very creative series, yes, go with this. If your looking for another scholarly fantasy series along the lines of Tolkein, Jacques or C.S. Lewis, find another series. This is more of a criticism than a review, though the difference is subtle."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Winter's Heart in my opinion is a turning point for the series. the rules have been changed and Robert Jordan shows a hint of the next step. The important thing for this series is to read each book, in order, again, before reading Winter's Heart. I did this and was amazed at the aspects that I missed from the first time I read them. It was much sweeter the second time. Read the books and enjoy them for the journey that they are. I can't wait for the tenth book, and a chance to reread the first nine again."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It's been almost two years, I think, since PoD. So I strongly recommed to re-read the two previous books before starting this one. Of course Jordan takes his time, but then, who would want all these delightful sub-plots to end prematurely? The secondary characters are becoming just as important as the main ones, and as interesting. The end is impressive, and I think momentuous things are coming. I just hope the series has fifteen or twenty books, we don't mind. Although I can't wait till the next one."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm a long time fan of &quot;epic&quot; fantasy. However, Robert Jordan is trying even my patience. The first 4 or 5 books of this series were some of the best I've ever read. In my honest opinion, Jordan has writing skills in the top 10 of this genre. However, having said that, I'm extremely displeased with the progress of this series over the last 2 books. Characters and situations are left hanging from book to book. Mat was entirely left out of book 8, and Perrin only touched on in this one. I can't even keep track of the Aes Sedai anymore. Their names and previous deeds all begin to mix together as I wait the two years for the next book.I hope the snail's pace at which this series is progressing picks up soon, or I will seriously consider abandoning the remainder of the series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"In Winter's Heart, Rand is on the run with Min, and in Cairhien, Cadsuane is trying to figure out where he is headed. Rand's destination is, in fact, one she has never considered. Mazrim Taim, leader of the Black Tower, is revealed to be a liar. But what is he up to? Faile, with the Aile Maidens, bain and Chiad, and her other companions, Queen Alliandre and Morgase, is prisoner of Sevanna's sept. Perrin is hunting desperately for Faile as he moves through country rife with bandits and roving Seanchan. The Forsaken are ever more present, and united, and the man called Slayer stalks Tel'aran'rhiod and the wolfdream. In Ebou Dar, the Seanchan princess known as Daughter of the Nine Moons arrives, and Mat, who has been recuperating in the Tarasin Palace, is introduced to her. Will the marriage that has been foretold come about?There are many masters in high fantasy. J.R.R. Tolkien would certainly be lauded highest when it comes to development of the world in which the events he illustrates transpire. Robert Jordan, for all the criticism leveled against him for what appears to be a marketing ploy - stringing the series out as long as humanly possible to generate greater book sales - would certainly have to rank near the top for character development. His series is filled with various interesting folk with varied viewpoints and motivations. While most (decent) authors go well into detail in describing the motivations and quirks of their heroes, Jordan doesn't stop there. Even his villains are thoroughly detailed. Moghidien, for example, one of the wickedest of the fallen, has a history and personality that influences how she reacts, as well as insecurities and frailties. Good, evil, benevolent or malign, all of Jordan's characters are fully fleshed out, and we get a fair view into their minds and motivations as the drama unfolds. Yes, the world is on the simple side, and yes, the plot, of late, has lost its pace; but it's a world and plot filled with only the most fascinating of folks. At a series currently juggling over 50 characters, all unveiled over the last 10 volumes, it's a commendable and laudable feat, indeed.Fans of Jordan's epic series of many volumes of many pages have been whinging since book six that the series seems to have no end in sight. Unfortunately, it's now a race against the clock for Jordan and his publisher, whose decision to prolong the series as long as they have may result in the work never being finished. Ironically, Rand, the hero destined to die on the slopes of the Dragonmount, may outlive his creator. Full sympathies to Jordan, and I, for one, hope he holds out long enough to complete the story he began."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I'm most definitely a WOT addict at this point. I picked up Book 1 and was excited about this new engaging and mysterious World, which seemed to hold so many new secrets, that I could not wait to pick up the book again once I had set it down. Things kept getting better until around Book 3 at which point we reached a crescendo. After Book 3 things started to slow down. Robert Jordan kept introducing new secretes and mysteries at the same breathtaking pace, but I no longer cared to remember these little subplots, since in the long run, they didn't seem to matter anyway. The story also started to focus more on one character and their setting (some kind of city, which was linked with some sort of intrigue or quest, which tended to drag on over several chapters) There is a nice map on the cover of each book, but it would be good of Robert Jordan to include all the character names as well as a list of plots and subplots for those of us who have been reading these books for the last 5 or 6 years. I'm reading book 9 at this point in time and am almost finished. I'm sure the last hundred or so pages will be excellent and the battles and plots will come to some kind of conclusion. I hope the ending in book 9 is better than the less than stellar ending of book 8. The book has its ups and downs like most books I read. Rand seems to be having trouble overcoming the negative effects of using the power. Aviendha, Min and Elayne finally figure out what needs to be done about their situation with Rand, and we find out what happened to Matt at the end of Book 8. While this story is not bad, it doesn't seem to move around much like Book 1 did, and characters seem stuck in the same boring setting through the entire Book. Most new characters are still introduced matter-of-factly as if we should know who they are and old characters, which resurface, are not reintroduced so that we can remember their importance. All in all, not much happens throughout most of the book, hopefully something amazing will happen towards the end. When will we finally get to the last battle! R.J. said he had other ideas or stories which he wanted to write, I suppose he depends on WOT for his livelyhood, but I think we all deserve some kind of a conclusion. Most of my friends and family who are reading this book have told me they dont think they can read WOT anymore since there is no end in site."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Look, I'm not going to trash this series. I've enjoyed it so far and I'm not angry. Just disapointed. Books one through seven have been great. Yeah, they lagged a little bit but they were great none-the-less. However, when book 8 kind of lagged, I became suspicious of treachery from Jordan. And with this book, I'm right. It seems like a soap opera now and since I saw the reviews for the 10th book, I don't think I want to finish the series unless it ends or something good happens. Oh, well. Maybe Jordan will get out of whatever 'funk' he's in and start writing stuff like he did before. (Or better) Anyways, if you must read this book then read like the last 100 pages or so to get the jist of it and then read the 11th book."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I was happy to see this book come out, and managed to wait to buy until it was in paperback. I liked the continuation of the characters and the story, and don't quibble with the length of time it takes between books. When I picked up book #1 more than a year ago, I was looking for a series that kept my attention. This one certainly does that. I look forward to #10, even if it doesn't answer many questions, or if it takes 2 years to arrive. The TV series X-Files is similar yet different to this book series. Both have plot threads that have run for considerable time. However, I think Jordan is more successful in at least tying up a few of the plotlines. X-Files never reaches any resolution of any of its major threads. I found it so frustrating that I quit watching. Jordan is a better storyteller than Carter and company."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I have read this story front to back 12 times, starting ten years ago. Each time a new book came out I read the story twice, keeping the storyline as a single thread. Over 150,000 pages later the story is still as captivating as the first time I read it. Many feel that the story drags or forstalls an ending, but in order for it to be a story it must have an end. For there are neither beginnings or nor endings, but it was AN ending. My favorite character is Matrim Cauthon, for much like life, luck has a little to do with it."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Book one of the Wheel of Time series was one of my favorites--I met lots of lovable characters (Moiraine, Rand, Mat, Perrin, Egwene, Elayne) who I wanted to learn more about. Book two was enjoyable, I felt like I was staying in the swing of things and learning more about each character. Book three was great, things happened, and I had fun. But somewhere around the fourth or fifth book, something went wrong. Jordan's enjoyable fantasy series lost any forward momentum that it had gained. It became boring, repetitive, and circular. I call myself a Jordan fan, but I must emphatically state that I will not be buying the next book in hardcover; it's simply not worth it. This book, number NINE, actually went somewhere, but not until the last pages. Finally the One Power is going to be cleansed (sorry if you didn't know, but it's not like it wasn't going to happen at some point, right?), so maybe Jordan can actually have a plot that moves forward now. All in all, I found this series a disappointment, and sort of wish I'd never started with it; afer all, a good beginning with a bad--or never occurring--ending is worse than no series at all, isn't it?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The first half of the book was pretty tedious as lots and lots of characters, sub-plots and sub-sub-plots have to be accounted for. The 3 women-and-Rand angle is getting ridiculous and annoyingly soap opera-ish. The story and pace gets much better when Mat reappears and the last 1/3 of the book almost makes it all worthwhile. Having started this series, I still want to see how it ends and will thus read the next book. However, if you haven't started the series, don't."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"My girlfriend bought this book for me for my birthday last year and I decided to re-read the entire series so that I could refresh everything in my mind before I read the most current installment.In the course of the re-read I found myself getting just as excited in the first 5 or 6 books and then found the myself using that earlier momentum to plow through the last ones.The series is truly excellent, the characters well defined with an amazing backstory but the end is long in coming. I enjoy the secondary plots that Jordan introduces but following these ancillary plotlines does not leave a lot of time to move forward the main characters, even in an 800 page book.I'm in for the long haul and when the end does come I'll still think it was time well spent."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I cannot complain about Robert Jordan's writing. If he has any fallacies it is that he adds new characters and secondary story lines while keeping us fully versed in the ones he already has. His attention to detail in all branches of his world is very nice, but it means that he can't put everything in every book, and it also slows the story down a bit. If he were to resolve some issues, and (heaven forbid!) kill off some of the less important and more time consuming characters, his books would be much more interesting. But would we know as much about his world? Robert Jordan has done the impossible in my mind, he has matched JRR Tolkien in his creation of a believeable and exciting world. And for those who want to nitpick, go find yourself a perfect book, if you can, because everyone knows that the farther into a series a writer gets, the harder it is to write. Each new book that grabs the mind is tenfold the triumph of the one before. So keep writing Jordan, and those who complain can go to Shayul Ghul."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Would someone please edit this book! After wading through chapter after boring chapter of wasted paper you get a little action at the end. Would someone remind Robert Jordan of the old adage &quot;short sweet and to the point&quot;. This series started out wonderfully, but has grown into a bloated behemoth. I skipped whole chapters and missed nothing. Take a razor and cut out every other chapter except the final one, you will not miss anything important."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Keep in mind when reading reviews on amazon.com that people reviewing Robert Jordan's books often read them under different circumstances that you are. If you are reading this book for the first time in 2009 or later, then you aren't reading it as soon as it came out. People who did read these books when they came out were often disappointed by them. However, I am reading these books straight in line as the series they were meant to be, and I am repeatedly impressed by all the facets of Jordan's work. People who write the venomous reviews tend to consider the books superficially, and without the eye for detail that true fans of Jordan's work need to appreciate and comprehend the work he produced.In other words, don't listen to them! The best things about Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time books are his attention to detail in world-building --- the books are really believable! --- and his knack for constructing complexity. However, the truly great thing about these books is the commentary on humanity that they provide. Jordan said in an interview that he started writing fantasy because in the fantasy genre he could write about good and evil without smirking. However, the fantasy genre also gives him the freedom to make novel commentary about the human condition. The parallels to our own world are easy to make, but it's also wholely valuable on its own to consider the characters within their own context.Another thing to keep in mind when reading reviews, is that understanding these books takes quite a bit of maturity. I don't think that I would have enjoyed these books when I was a teenager: I was too full of my own ideas. However, now that I'm almost thirty, I have the maturity, the breadth of undersatnding and appreciation for art, and the experience to really get into the best parts of these books. Identifying with my favorite character, Nynaeve, for example, is something that I couldn't have done without my current set of life experiences. I feel like Nynaeve's experiences really parallel my own life, because there are things the characters live through that everyone can identify with.I also knew as little about history as any teenager. Jim Rigney (aka Robert Jordan) is clearly a very educated person who understands the intricacies and nuances that history holds. He is a smart guy, plain and simple. I am often surprised by his historically accurate portrayal of things that are totally fictional! This is a believable fantasy series: Elayne doesn't just waltz in and take the throne of Andor. That's not how things have worked in this world, why should they in a world of Jordan's building? I am also blown away by his knowledge of everything from birds to card games, horses and sailing. I have often found myself disappointed with other authors' portrayal of topics that I myself find familiar. I have only once had that feeling, and that was in the middle of the first book (The Eye of the World), when he describes a flock of ravens taking down a wolf. After thinking about it a little, the Ravens are servants of the Dark One, after all, I'm willing to forgive that one. Jordan is just a simply fantastic author in all respects and I think history will remember him as well as Sir Walter Scott, if not J.R.R. Tolkien (whose fame is, let's face it, just like Jordan's, a matter of the time when his books were read).It's really great that the fantastic elements of these books are highly limited. The characters are human, and the only fantastic elements are matters of skill and training, emotion and other things we as humans can identify. I've seen other readers actually complain about this: what do you want instead? A bunch of unexplained wizards, waving staves and flying through the air? Not for me. I just don't identify with hobbits the way I can identify with Nynaeve. And I doubt I would be able to identify with any of the characters if they were facing a cast of challenges derived from other fantasy works: e.g. Terry Brooks' books are full of gnomes, elves, trolls and dwarves, things I can get in Tolkien or the Brothers Grimm. When Jordan does borrow elements --- there are many parallels with Star Wars, for example --- he at least doesn't give them the same names, and that helps a lot. There are bigger human elements, too: all the societies, to some extent still carry the pain of the Breaking of the World. This is something that anybody who recognizes his own ethnicity should be able to identify with: kinda like the Holocaust, slavery or the potato blight.And Jordan explores every aspect of humanity, from responsibility, duty and freedom, to sexuality and relationships. He obviously is trying to entertain with some passages, but the myriad ways he explores each of these aspects shows that he understands that all of these aspects of humanity are complex, just like the world we live in. For example, he doesn't just explore sexuality with Rand and Elayne simply falling in love and making babies; no, he makes it complicated, twisted and absolutely hard to comprehend --- just like real life. And just like the world we live in, the only explanation for the complexities are the concepts that the characters can build to understand their world: they know their own perspectives are limited and they do what they have to do to rise to their challenges. Denial is a huge theme throughout the book: Rand denies that he is even important, much less the Dragon Reborn; in Winter's Heart, Jordan really explores the self-deception of the Sul'dam characters. I found this exploration very moving. I think literary scholars of the future are going to have a field day with the whole of Jordan's work, especially The Wheel of Time.Now, some specific comments about Winter's Heart: this book does not follow the format of the previous two books. Gone are the lengthy descriptions of action that characterized The Path of Daggers. In contrast, this book is filled with dialogue and deep introspective passages that get right into the characters and the plot. It's rather reminiscent of The Shadow Rising (my second favorite book). There is also not the four- to five-hundred pages of buildup that has been standard fare since Lord of Chaos. The action (and again, it is Robert Jordan's kind of action) starts pretty early. This book is full of moving passages that expose the core of the characters and teach us more and more about their innermost fears and desires. The prologue of Winter's Heart is right up there with The Columns of Rhuidean and the Portal Stone scenes from The Shadow Rising and the Great Hunt, respectively. I am really into this book, and I am very excited about reading it every time I pick it up.This book is simply awesome. Many reviews and comments I have read have said \\"the pacing is off,\\" or \\"the events slow down.\\" In Winter's Heart, I find simply no support for these claims. The other reviews simply sound superficial and immature: they want more boobs and explosions (as if this series doesn't have more than any other!). Don't listen to them, listen to me. Keep reading. My best hope is that more and more new readers will find these books and fill the pages of amazon.com with reviews written with an open mind. You should definitely read this book and continue with the series. Many of the reviews I've read have chastised Jordan for failing to deliver better books to his fans. Screw his fans; he has no obligation to them. He only has an obligation to his characters, and in Winter's Heart, he fulfils those obligations quite well."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series drags on it is slowly getting harder and harder to read. It seems as though he is becoming bogged down in the myriad side plots and such he has inserted into his series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Jordan took about 10 pages worth of plot and turned it into a few hundred pages of agonizingly slow descriptions of attire and addition of yet more characters that I could care less about.

At near 1000+ pages for each one of Jordan's books, it is getting hard for those of us with limited amounts of time to read and reread each of his books every time a new one comes out. Winter's Heart is a nice breath of fresh air after Path of Daggers and Crown of Swords. Why? you ask. Because there is plot movement. Mat Cauthon returns in this book after being absent for Path of Daggers.Let me put it this way. If you have already read the other 8 you should read this book. But if you haven't read any of them yet, do some soul searching and decide if you want to read what is totaling as of book 9 at over 10,000 pages."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"It might just be that I've only spent the last five years reading this series as opposed to others who started reading when the first book came out, but i'm at the point where i don't want the series to end. I personally am enjoying the rich world and 500 story lines - still. I struggled through Book 5 but ever since then I have devoured each book, and continue to want more. I'm pretty sure that if you haven't enjoyed the last few books, you won't be enjoying the next 3 (Jordan has said that it will take at least 3 more to finish it). Stop looking for an end and start enjoying the world again! The reason the first 4 books were so exciting for all of you is because Jordan brings a new world and cultures to life. Now you're used to them but I still enjoy my little trips into this strange land."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I would love to take a peek into Jordan's source for the Aiel and most of the descriptions that interlace in his plots. One thing I highly reccomend of his readers is to read a single book on the tribes of Arabia; trust me, you would be shocked. The Aiel for instances are a copy cat in all their toh and traditions of the Tribal Traditions of Southern Arabia Desert!!!?Even the clothing. Lets spin it a bit, the name al'Thore is actually a name of a famous Tribe in Yemen. How about the name Isam, again its an arabian name. Many things in his epic are diluted from the Middle East, its as if he pulled the threads from there and formulated the WOT. Nevertheless, everybody needs an inspiration. Thanx to my History class, I know where that inspiration came from. Still, the series are marked with nothing but a fantastic. I wouldn't hesitate to read them all over again. The man has a bottomless well of rich and vivid imagination that deserves red hot applaud."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Hummm... a six year old can even see this. Book by book, Rand goes madder and madder that to me seems to be the long story line. Hey, I did not even START to read this book; I am still trying to recuperate from the utterly dull 8th book. First few pages: As Elyne straightened her skirts, Rand could feel the taint, &quot;Luck be with me,\\" said Mat. B O R E I N G. But I could not stand to give it 3 stars. If they had a 3.5, I would. But, I am a loyal reader of The Wheel of time, and Mr. Robert Jordan, when is it going to end? Aren't you rich enough with your ingenious ideas? Can you at LEAST give all of us puppies following u blindly a little clue, when it will end? I want to see what happens in the end, and I thought HOPEFULLY this would be it. But alas, no.

One or two plot resolutions! By the time Far Madding enter's the picture, I couldn't put it down...The contrived plot's of Jordan's work are not everyones' cup of tea, if you liked the simplicity and single-minded direction of the first few books, you _won't_ like this. But if, like me, you thought book 6 &amp; 7 were two of the best, this book will reaffirm your faith in the Bearded one.Pick it up regardless, for it makes an excellent paperweight.Oh, and there is a scene that is included, that to me has been over three books in the waiting..."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I know that a lot of you out there are reading these reviews, and you see all these people saying &quot;I quit. No more.&quot; I even read a review stating that they quit a hundred pages prior to the end of Winter's Heart. That's sad, because if that person had read just another twenty pages....I would like to express my condolences for these people now (a moment of silence, if you please)...okay. Now, I won't deny that there was a bit of a downturn starting in A Crown of Swords and set in quite firmly with The Path of Daggers. But I implore you, PLEASE don't give up early. Winter's Heart starts off dull, I willingly admit that. But starting with Chapter 15 (the reintroduction of Mat Cauthon), things take an upturn. Mat's ending is pretty decent, and Rand's is nothing short of spectacular; it rivals the ending of Book Two, only lacking in length. I don't plan to give away anything, due to a complaint voiced in yet another review I've read, but my opinion is, if you've started this series, finish it out. It's well worth your time (and effort). Book 7 isn't all THAT bad, and Book 8 can be gotten through, with some patience. Book 9 should be read solely for the ending. Trust me on this one...I'm a hard-to-please reader myself, and I almost quit, too; but like I said, stick it out, and you'll be as well as can be expected."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I realize that the vast majority of those who read these critiques are devoted to the series already and will read this book regardless of what I say, but...Positives - the conclusion to WH is exciting and is worth the wait, believe it or not! Some of my major who-is-who questions were answered and the story manages to progress enough to keep me interested.I was very happy to read about the three Two Rivers boys again in the same book! Things happen in this book you have been looking forward to, but don't get too overly disappointed if it was not as grand as you envisioned. RJ rarely writes that way.There were also some loyalty questions answered about who-serves-who and who is truly devoted to the Dragon Reborn. So you lovers of the Light will be pleased, and Dark Friends, well...Negatives - too many threads! If you are like me you believe that RJ has already provided enough detail and sub-plots to have created a realistic and understandable world, but he has burdened the story line with too many.There is no real leadership in any character. Where are the natural leadership abilities people have that attract other leaders? Every single character, with the exception of Cadsuane that I can see, displays only positional/situational leadership.Communications - the weakest link in any campaign; ever since book one I have felt that the main characters need to improve their communications. Egwene, Elayne and Rand need to communicate in order to maximize their effectiveness. The same holds true for the Forsaken. Just imagine how much more effective they could be. They need a natural leader more than anyone!Regardless of the weaknesses, this book will hold your interest and blast you away with its climax!!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I bought the book saying,&quot;I've read all the previous books, so I have to read this one.&quot; I would have felt like a life scout never making it to be an eagle scout if I hadn't read it.Oh! how I was wrong.In my opinion, it was a waste of time and money. It doesn't matter what happens now in the series.Nothing happens in the book, and the nothing leads to nothing happening in the book. The book can be summed up like this. 200 pages of what Matt thinks. 200 pages of what rand thinks. 200 pages of what Elayne thinks. 200 more pages of what everyone else thinks. My wife would have gotten more out of this between episodes of 90210. I just got bored. I feel ripped off."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"....The fact of the matter remains -- Robert Jordan has created one of the most (if not THE MOST) convincing fantasy universe in the last fifty years.This series proves this. For all of you who want more action there are other writers who seem to specialize in the &quot;hack and slash&quot; genre. However, from what I can garner from this series is that Jordan writes in a &quot;High&quot; fantasy mode, akin to Tolkien, and he writes in such a way so that he can truly flesh out the universe he has created. And Winter's Heart continues to flesh it out. The biggest plus with this series is the minute detail that fills it. Jordan does not simply want to get his point across that is very easy. Jordan wants to ILLUSTRATE his action, his drama, his characters -- his world.Which brings me to Winter's Heart. Is this his best work -- of course not. Is it his worst? Hell, no. I found this novel to be a return to form. It seemed more inspired, more immediate, and just plain better than the last two novels. And so those of you who hated the last book can feel empowered, I too didn't think too highly of Path of Daggers. And it took two readings of Crown of Swords for me to gain an appreciation for what was going on there.... Something happens in this novel. And not just the obvious climactic event (brilliantly written though it was). Several things, in fact. I have been waiting for some time to see Min, Elayne, and Aviendha in the same room together. The sense of urgency apparent in this scene is representative of the novel, and is one of the most wonderful things about it. Indeed, Jordan is at his best when the urgency is palpable. Path of Daggers peaked early after the Bowl was used. Leaving the remainder of the novel lacking in force. Winter's Heart never loses its direction, nor does it really expand beyond it's relatively small scale. Jordan writes his main characters well, and he continues to do so through this novel. Even though Perrin bows out sooner than I would have hoped, but I'm not writing this series, so I'm not going to complain about how Jordan writes it.Which brings me to the final truths, as I see them:I too tire of his depiction of women. In my opinion, especially in the Fantasy Genre, it is hard for a man to effectively write a woman. Jordan does a better job than others have, but he gives each of his main women certain traits and makes them stick too them (Nynaeve and her braid, Elayne and her sniff, etc.). It is unfortunate, but not unexpected.I too grow weary of the Wait. But there are a billion books in this world. And a good many of them are worth reading..... imagine the mental energy that goes into keeping a world like Jordan's running. Try creating something on so grand a scale, and then keep track of it. There is some amazing focus going on here. Not once in this series have I seen Jordan lose control of the world he created. It has taken Jordan ten years to write/publish nine novels, Tolkien produced the Lord of the Rings Trilogy in the same span of time. Jordan isn't working slowly in comparison.Finally, Winter's Heart shows that Jordan can write a decent story, on a relatively small scale, that has drama, action, and plot development all working together toward a common end. Just as he proved he can write on a larger, battle oriented scale in Shadow Rising and Fires of Heaven. This book is not without faults, but no piece of literature is. I continue to have faith in Robert Jordan -- a dry spell in the body count will not deter me from reading and enjoying such a brilliantly vivid universe."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"From the get-go, this book beats _The Path of Daggers_ hands down, but, perhaps inevitably in a series this long, a few things begin to grind on the nerves. Jordan is a better storyteller than he is a writer (&quot;writer&quot; defined in this sense as &quot;creator of good prose&quot;). He has used certain analogies and metaphors enough now that they wear on the nerves. How many times have we heard Aes Sedai spoken of in superlatives in the earlier books...and then how many times do we hear things like &quot;[Insert name of member of newly introduced social/ethnic group here] could make an Aes Sedai look slovenly/foolish/etc.&quot;? I definitely noticed this in the first few chapters. Which woman or group of women is really the strongest in character? Do we really care by now?This book has more action than TPoD, and yet it still feels strangely anticlimactic, perhaps because so many of the questions that have been plaguing readers for eight books now are answered, with fewer new mysteries to theorize about. Of course, the end of this book is suitably un-put-down-able, as a long-awaited event takes place with RJ's best nail-bitingly tense writing.The story is pretty damn engrossing, and there are some truly stellar scenes, especially Elayne's and Aviendha's first-sister bonding ceremony and another that I won't spoil for you :)I'd put this installment overall on a level somewhere above _Lord of Chaos_ and below _The Great Hunt_.One big quibble: there are way, way too many typos in this book. Makes it look like a rush job, when a few hours with a spell-checker would have fixed many of the problems. (Quite a few simple grammatical errors too.) Was there *really* no time to proofread?"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":". . . . The worst is yet to come.I was actually impressed that something significant happens at the end of this book. I won't spoil it, but I would like to in order to save you the time and money. Besides the last chapter or so, NOTHING happens in this book. And if you are stoked about this Event happening at the end, do not, I repeat, DO NOT read the tenth book. You think that the plot is really going to pick up in the next book, but it does not. I thought it would, so after I finished the ninth book, I waited eagerly for Ten and I am still traumatized from the utter disappointment. So save yourself from the pain by not reading this book and especially not the tenth book.If you want something interesting and really funny, read the customer reviews--I mean bashings--for Crossroads of Twilight. You get a summary of this book and the next all for free told a hundred times better than Robert Jordan ever could."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I started reading this epic series almost ten years ago. With each successive book in the series I am forced to ask myself why I started in the first place. The plot is so tortuously slow and twisted that it is impossible to keep in mind what is happening from one book to the next. Maybe Mr Jordan is completely aware of the details of PoD and where things stood at its conclusion, but for me that was two years ago, and there is a 0% chance that i will remember and differentiate between the hundreds of bit-part characters with similar names and confusingly indistinct personalities.Given the rate at which the Forsaken are being eliminated (less than one per book) and in some cases reincarnated, I can only conclude that Mr Jordan will have to pen another 9 volumes before this epic finshes! Please, spare us, do the merciful thing and wrap everything up in the next book. Oh yeah, and cut the descriptive drivel down to a necessary minimum - and try to improve the current drivel:action ratio of 100:1!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Shameful as it is for me to admit, I have read every bloody word of every bloody page of every bloody chapter of every bloody book in this bloody series. Due to our dear ol' pal Jordan's (Requiem in Pacem) habit of writing his books as long as the Manhattan telephone directory, anyone who has looked at one of these tomes should understand fully the amount of time I have devoted to this effort. Looking back on it, this staggers me; did I have nothing better to do than flounder endlessly through the sea of Rand Rising? Can I really justify spending all of these hours that could have been spent on more profitable pursuits reading these books, and this one in particular?The answer, I'm afraid, is no. The first three books were very good, and contrary to popular belief, I don't think Jordan's writing style deteriorates any great amount over the course of the continuing saga of Rand Gets More Power, Perrin Worries Endlessly, and Mat Keeps Right on Chugging. The trouble is that somewhere along the line, Jordan forgot that he was supposed to be entertaining, and just started thinking about his life's work.More power to him, but reading a legacy isn't quite as amusing as reading a novel. The heady rush of the first three novels (and to an extent, four and five as well) falls by the wayside and settles gloomily into extinction around book seven. There are no more quests, no more chases, no more grand escapades and seat-of-our-heroes'-ornately-embroidered-breeches challenges. The replacement is interminable chatter and pointless maneuvering.Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne bicker endlessly with each other and everyone else, when, that is, they're not making schemes that Jordan forgets about and then reinserts when we've all forgotten the point of them. Perrin makes his plodding way across a countryside that appears to have swelled to the size of the Canadian Arctic when he had his back turned, searching for a wife who's too jealous to be a very interesting character anyway. Rand, meanwhile, pops in and out like a jack-in-the-box, to remind us that yes, he is the coolest character since Mighty Mouse, before vanishing in a puff of smoke and a smell of missed opportunity.The trouble with Winter's Heart is that the reader could skip the entire book except for last four or five chapters, and essentially miss nothing. Taking the next book into consideration, we might even be able to miss those last ones out, as once the thing's done with, no one seems to care anyway.Time. The Wheel of Time keeps spinning out more and more of it, until I realize that far from being the exciting, imaginative series it began as, with just enough mystery and just enough revelation, these books have degenerated into one big, rotund time-wasting machine. And that is a very real shame."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Warning: Spoilers for book 9 included within text of review.I've read Books 1-9 within the last 3 months. This is the first time i've actually reviewed. It goes without saying that the first four books are fantastic so i'll not go into those too much - other than to say I was riveted and spent way too much time reading every single word and staying up later than I should have and ignored a lot more housework than was proper when you have 3 kids and a husband.I have read much criticism from book 5 on as I tend to check out the reviews before starting the next book. I was surprised by the sheer volume of negative reviews. I would like to start out by saying that NONE of the books in this series, inluding book 9, suck. The world that Jordan has created and his mastery of the written word all but assures that the books are not going to be garbage. Though I do understand the frustration that is felt in reading beyond book 5. The storyline does slow down significantly and many, many more characters are introduced and there are plots within plots. By the time I got to book 7 I guiltily resorted to 'skimming' over the chapters that contained secondary characters. The characters that originally drew me in are all still there but they are scattered and because of the new plots and characters they are not given nearly enough time in their own right. It is hard not to feel short changed or disappointed in that respect.For example when Min, Elayne and Aveindha finally bond to Rand - it is great but Jordan leaves the reader desperately wanting more with no hope in sight for it. I would gladly spend a couple chapters reading about this bond and the interactions of all those involved over political intrigues and various groups Aes Sedai and their schemes. It seems that the original characters are getting lost in the traffic of ever increasing secondary characters that you just don't care all that much about.I loved the concept of Rand cleansing the taint from the male side of the One Power and that entire scene at the end was Amazing. Cadsuane is an intriguing character and I enjoy her interaction and strange sense of protectiveness towards Rand. I can't help but feel if some of the secondary plots and characters were trimmed out that Jordan could spend more time reminding his readers why we fell in love with Rand, Mat, Perrin (and to a lesser extent Egwene and Nyneave) in the first place. I am still thorougly intrigued with the world and characters that Jordan created and have every intention of finishing the next 2 books and waiting patiently for the final installment. I don't think the series is ruined at all but there is a marked decline in the greatness of the first few novels. I find myself unable to abandon the characters that so captured my attention - I only hope that Jordan gives them the attention his readers so obviously desire in the remaining books."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Busy with a project of my own I have finally found time to catch up on the WOT series. Unfortunately RJ has continued to add subplots with out closing out some of the existing ones. In short, WOT has become infested with too many major and minor characters running around doing their own thing. One of the more aggrevating additions RJ has made is the insertion budding technology into WOT in the form of steam engines, gunpowder, etc. It basically detracts from the main storyline and everytime I run across it I skip ahead. Winter's Heart does not move the story ahead much."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"This series, like many have said before, started out with style and panache that hasn't been seen since \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" or even more recently The Shannara Series by Terry Brooks. It was a spellbinding series that kept you reading no matter what was happening around you. Then the unforgiveable happened, The author saw that he had a gold mind and started to extend the series anyway possible. The results are these last 5 or so books in the series that, while superbly written and still OK to read, are nowhere near the spellbinding quality that they were. When the series was in the first 4 or 5 you couldn't wait until the next one came out and you would reread the previous volumes just before the new book because heck they were so good it was an excuse to reread them. Now you hear about another one and you try to remember to look for them on the used book list or the discount rack at your local Barnes and Noble. Very sad indeed, especially since he had another money maker waiting in the wings in the form of the prequel series. A whole complete seperate series about the time before the current age. They have so many mentions of previous great figures that you wish you could have a series just to read about all the old great battles and situations that led to the current time. So please Jordan, rap up this series in the style of the original first few and get on with the prequel series. You have beaten this series into just an Ok series instead of the legendary series it started out to become. If you had stuck to the original style and kept to maybe even seven or so and completly wrapped up the whole thing this series would have been right up there with the all time best, Mentioned as an equal to Lord of the Rings but with the continuing ho-hum when is it going to end books you are pumping out now you have fallen down to just another ran. I also read Terry Brooks series Shannara and that series keeps to a few books usually triolgies and wraps up the story. Then starts at a little different time and weaves a whole seperate hold your breath series that still feels as familiar as the original book. Very exciting and I would place those up there with Lord of the Rings.Hope this helps and I hate to say but I wouldn't pay for this book until I could get it as a huge discount. Or since they have become so slow to progress, it might be even better to wait until he has 3 or 4 new ones out and then buy them all so you can feel like you are progressing in the story line."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"What is wrong with Mr. Jordan? Did someone else write his last two books?What happened to the fast paced, heart pounding stories from the first 6 or so books? I made up my mind that if this book stunk, then I was not going to finish the series. Well, the book stunk!"},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I am slowly starting to wonder if RJ is still writing the Wheel of Time Series or has a ghost writer taken over? Books 1-5, maybe even 6 were top drawer. RJ pained his world in bold strokes, we got detailed descriptions, the main characters were developed, the story clearly progressed. Most important of all, these books gripped the reader; it was a real struggle to lay them aside for food or rest!After that, some taint (!) seems to have struck down the writer. The pace of events has become glacially slow, the plot line seems to meander in a sluggish maze, the very quality of the writing seems to have become sloppy. The characters do not grow and develop further; instead they seem almost to regress. What happened to the RJ who wrote that fascinating time slice view of Aiel history, who expounded the meaning of ji'-e-toh, who described for us the testing of the Accepted?One gets the feeling that Tor and RJ are taking the readership for granted. Take the size of each new volume. Picking up #9, it feels as long as the earlier ones. But look again at the typeface and you realize that #9 for instance is barely 70% as long as Book 1. This tactic was apparent in Book #8 as well and has been repeated in #9. In fact, Books 7-8-9 could easily be boiled down to one of maybe two at most. But three books earn more royalties than two I realize. The impact of this reduction in size is also apparent on the plotlines. Earlier, RJ could keep his sub-plots under control as the length of the book gave him enough leeway to sort them out. Now with the book size reduced, he no longer has the room to sort out the sub-plots, leaving messy loose ends. As a result, the main plot line suffers in the sea of sub-plots and cannot progress. Book 8 ended with Egwene's Aes Sedai and Gareth Bryne's army poised to attack Tar Valon. Now in Book 9 we find that the army is not yet half as big as it needs to be for this task! In fact Book 9 has absolutely no mention of the Salidar Aes Sedai. Where is the continuity? Perrin appears for a few brief pages in the beginning of Book 9 and disappears, leaving us no wiser about his fate than after Book 8. By the end of Book 9, Mat has barely started his escape from Ebou Dar; Book 8 ended with him trapped there!Huge discontinuities start to tear the fabric. Suddenly Rand appears in Far Madding but why exactly will he find the apostate Ashaman here rather than anywhere else? No idea. Suddenly, almost in passing we confirm our suspicions as to the former identities of Cyndane and Moridin. RJ spelled out Moghedien's leashing for us but not a word on how Aginor, Balthamel, Ishamael or Lanfear got their new lease of life. For that matter, if Moridin is Nae'blis, how come Mesaana and Semirhage don't even bother to acknowledge him, far less take orders from him? Rand apparently went to Far Madding to deal with the renegade Ashaman, then suddenly, out of the blue, he announces that he will cleanse the taint on saidin. How did he learn how to do that? Was it Herid Fel's undisclosed clue? How did he know to use the choedan kal for this purpose? For that matter just what exactly does he do to remove the taint? No idea. At the finale, the taint is cleansed, but apart from Aginor, what happens to the other defeated Forsaken? Blank.Apart from the story elements, again Book 9 sticks with the same old old hackneyed map, has no proper recap of the immediate past and the wretched excuse for a glossary is so paltry that I wonder why RJ bothered with it at all, except maybe to get 6 more pages.I think it would be instructive for Tor / RJ to run an analysis of sales of each book in the series. I will stick my neck out and predict that the earlier volumes sold more in hardcover as well as paperback to individuals, the last two will have been bought by proportionally less individuals and more by libraries. Many of RJ's readers, who earlier would have given his WOT books pride of place on their bookshelf are getting disillusioned and falling back on the public library. You see Mr. J., we are hooked and we do want to know how the saga pans out, but we will not throw good money after bad. Wake up and smell the coffee please. The people criticizing you on this page are not fools, we are the same ones who praised your earlier work and who are saddened by the deterioration. Please stop taking us for granted - I'm assuming you do occasionally visit these feedback pages and care what your readers think."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"I never thought I would have anything bad to say about this series. I thoroughly enjoyed books 1-7 and was so blinded by Jordan's spell that I didn't notice how slow book 8 actually was. I've come this far, I HAVE to enjoy it, right?That brought me to book 9 with high hopes that the end was near and I had some mind blowing action to look forward to. Wrong. Instead, things have slowed to a painful, frustrating death crawl, leaving me praying for the end of the world. (Jordan's, that is.) Should a book cause actual physical pain? How can 700+ pages say so little? Absolutely EVERYTHING is described in intricate detail. IMO, it's an overkill. 6 women walk into a room and I have to be told each one's hair color, style, and facial expression, and what their wearing right down to the last thread in their undergarments. Once I've read it, I've forgotten it, it's just so unimportant.It has taken me months to read this and I'm not even finished yet. I still have 10 chapters and 200 pages to get through. I'm looking forward to the end for two reasons. a) I've heard the ending is amazing and actually gratifying. (and it damn well better be) b) It will finally be over. For now. I had to stop reading during the day because I kept falling asleep. I'm not being cute here. I literally had to fight to keep my eyes open. I agree with another reviewer that the book is like crack. You don't want it, but you're so invested in your addiction, you feel like you need it despite the side effects.I think I will take a very long hiatus from this series before I read book 10. I have other books I want to read and I just don't think I can swallow another volume of skirt smoothing. As others have said before me, this series is dead."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"The operative word for this book, along with the previous few and apparently the next one is... FINALLY. As in: when is Egwene FINALLY going to get to the White Tower to (hopefully) consolidate her power? And FINALLY Elayne lays claim to the throne of Andor, only to be beseiged by multiple plots and problems. Does any main character in this epic ever just DO anything? Obviously NOT, everything is extremely complicated with gobs of details, most of which should have been left out to move the plot along. Jordan should learn from the movie makers who have taken this art to new highs (or lows: DUNE, 2 hours, come on now).Thankfully, Jordon does include one significant event at the end of the book. That being, of course the cleansing of Saidin.I've got a great idea, in the future we can take the significant parts from books 6-10 and combine them into one smaller book. It will make Jordon look like the literary genius he was supposed to be after he wrote the first few of this series."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"As the series has progressed, Jordan has grown more and more fond of his own flowery descriptive style, at the expense of story and action. I frankly do not care to know the color of the piping on everyone's coat, or to live and relive sceens from various character's points of view! In this book, we visit every group of characters...and none of them move! Literally, except for Rand (and retineu), they are in the same place at the end that they started at the begining! Maybe the story has grown too complex, but frankly I should get half my money back because I didn't read every other paragraph."},{"Title":"Winter's Heart (The Wheel of Time, Book 9)","review":"Was Robert Jordan beaten by his mother? What else could possibly explain his treatment of women in these books? While the level of detail is impressive there is a lot of stuff that is just plain irrelevant.
