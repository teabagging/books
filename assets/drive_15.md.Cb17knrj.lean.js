As children they expressed little or no interest in food, except to eat what magically appeared on their plates. The recipes here are basic but they are quite tasty and easy to prepare. It is the basic theory that counts. For example, once you know how to prepare a stir fry, you can vary the taste by simply adding or exchanging various ingredients. There are, however, some staple, multi-purpose ingredients you will probably want to keep handy, on your kitchen shelf, at all times. If you are a more experienced chef, then this book will likely seem quite ho-hum and mundane to you, but for the novice who finds micro-waving a pre-cooked meal is an accomplishment in itself, then this book is for you. You will be suprised how simple it is to prepare a hearty, nutritious dinner from scratch. Basic stuff? Yes, but everyone has to start somewhere and for those with little or no experience, this is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"Pam Anderson, a former editor at the much-revered &quot;Cook's Illustrated,&quot; had a good idea with &quot;How to Cook Without a Book,&quot; that I believe just didn't quite pan out.The concept of &quot;instinctual&quot; cooking is appealing. Most of us remember the delicious meals our mother's and/or grandmother's whipped up without ever even glancing at a recipe. The problem is that the skills these women possessed were honed by years of experience--cooking three times per day for 30+ years--and usually instilled in them by their mother's and grandmother's in early childhood. The world has changed a lot since then and not only have our tastes vastly changed, but they've also expanded. Most of us regularly eat, and cook, many types of ethnic foods, as well as a host of &quot;healthy&quot; meals that would have baffled cooks in the 1930s and '40s.So, instead of &quot;teaching&quot; people to &quot;cook without a book,&quot; as Anderson's title promises, it focuses more on how to put a meal on the table for your family in about 30 minutes--a territory already well covered by dozens of other (more useful) cookbooks.In fact, the &quot;tips&quot; Anderson offers here are so basic as to be useless for almost anyone who knows anything about cooking (Hey, did you know that lettuce could be chopped instead of torn to save time? Or that vinegar and oil made a good salad dressing?) Anderson's advice is hardly revolutionary. And I just can't imagine anyone being that perplexed about how much lettuce needed, per person, per salad.Of course, this book might be nice for someone who literally doesn't even know how to boil water, or thinks opening a can is equal to preparing dinner. The advice and tips given aren't bad, just painfully basic. If your cooking skills are already past the &quot;heating up a Lean Cuisine in the microwave&quot; stage I doubt you'll find much here that's of use."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"Even though I have been cooking for many years at home, I still purchased this book because I tend to rely too much on recipes. I liked this book so well that I bought copies for both of my daughters, one is a new mother and the other HATES to cook. One just loves it. The other hasn't seen it yet as it is a Christmas gift. Yes, it is true that there are many recipes in the book but they are meant as examples. If one bothers to read the text one can learn the basic master recipe and get creative from there. It does take time to memorize them though, but don't give up. Practice makes perfect and they are worth it. The recipes are very tasty,quick to fix, and teach some very basic skills on which a beginner can build."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"If you are a cook who knows your way around the kitchen, then no, this is a simple, very basic book and not for you.However, if you are like me and was never taught even the very basic kitchen skills, then this book is invaluable in helping to create fast, tasty meals with a variety of simple flavors. Other reviewers are annoyed at the slight 'obvious' variations on some dishes, but as a beginning chef I /don't/ know what the best flavors of cheese and nuts - for example - are, to put in a polenta dish, and appreciate the help.I have made more recipes from this book in one week than most cookbooks I've had for years, and the results have been fabulous. If you want to save money, and enjoy better food than you can find at most restaurants - get this book."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"This is a wonderful book! While previous reviews claim that the book states the obvious (oil and vinegar make a good dressing), this book gives the correct formula for dressings, sauces, soups, omelettes, etc.While I have cooked for years, this book has renewed my confidence in experimenting myself, following her basic formulas. The truth is, most of us have a limited amount of time to cook during the week. This book is just for that - a quick way to use what you already have to serve delicious, healthy meals quickly. This is a sharp contrast to &quot;quick-cook&quot; books that either (1) have you use a jar of grape jelly and the microwave or are (2) quick only if you already have the heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil available.I attended a class taught by Ms. Anderson where she demonstrated her techniques from this book and found that she seems to have used her wealth of experience as a test kitchen chef and editor to reduce a lot of information down to these simple formulas and techniques.My meals from this book have turned out perfect every time - thank you Pam Anderson!"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"The irony of the title is that the ratio of editorial/descriptive text pages to recipe pages is pretty. There are a number of chapters, each with a general 2-3 page introduction and then 5-10 pages of recipies that can be modified to suit your taste.I think a much better investment is Mark Bittman's How to Cook Everything. It has just as much on the tips/techniques side (and I think better quality) and far more on the recipies (if you're interested in them)."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I love to cook, and I cook a LOT, but I've always been one of those cooks that needs a recipe in front of me for just about anything. I can turn out really complex, complicated dishes, but the recipes always gave me that feeling of 'okay...I'm doing this right.' Pam Anderson's \\"How to Cook Without a Book\\" helped me to change that. The book is about techniques, not recipes. She talks about how to cook in a certain way, her steam-saute method where oil and a bit of water are covered and heated with vegetables to first steam them then saute them after the cover is removed, for example, then gives you a few ideas about combinations of ingredients. You're turned loose to experiment at that point. I steam-saute frozen green beans with garlic and red pepper flakes at least a couple of times a week, now. I've made them for dinner parties of 40 people. I've even got my partner making them for himself when I'm not home. This is just one of the freeing experiences I've had with this book. It's given me the confidence to go out and start tweaking, substituting, and experimenting with other recipes, too. I've even bought this book as a gift for several friends trying to get into cooking themselves."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I bought this cookbook five weeks ago, and I haven't eaten out since because what I make at home now actually tastes better and has way more variety than what I can get in restaurants. This is not a book of recipes; it is a book of cooking techniques. So instead of you looking to see if you have all the ingredients you need to make the recipe you're looking at in some cookbook, this book teaches you how to recognize which cooking technique you need to use to make something that tastes good using the ingredients you just happen to have. Basically, once you learn the techniques, then you can go stare at the random food items in your cupboard or in your grocery store, find a couple that seem like they would taste good together, and know what technique to use to combine them to make a meal that is so good that you will choose to eat at home even if you can afford to eat out. You will really appreciate this training the next time you get snowed in by a blizzard and are forced to use up whatever you just happen to have left on hand in your cupboards.I found that learning to use techniques to cook instead of following recipes solved a lot of the problems I used to face. Now there are no long complicated lists of ingredients to assemble. There is no more frustration from buying fifteen different bizarre ingredients that I will use once and never use again because they were for an exotic dish that I didn't like once I made it and I can't find any other recipes that call for those same ingredients. There is no more irritation from finding out that I can't make a recipe I want to try because I have only five of the seven ingredients that it calls for. There are no more vegetables going to waste in my refrigerator because I only needed a small portion of the eggplant or whatever and didn't know what to do with the rest of it. Oh, and did I mention that using these techniques allows you to make just a little of something so that you're not forced to eat the same meal for both lunch and dinner three days in a row? And you can even get rid of your shelf full of cookbooks filled with endless recipes because you'll actually know how to cook once you've read \\"How to Cook Without a Book\\" and have practiced the techniques in it for a month or so.If this sounds too good to be true, I can only tell you that I am relating my personal experience. Those of you who grew up with a mother who knew how to cook and who cared enough to teach you how may or may not be as impressed with this book as I was. I cannot judge since I do not come from that background; however, I highly recommend this book based on my experience."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I love this book! I've only had it for a week and every day it has improved my cooking. From the effortless frittata that I made for Saturday morning breakfast to the quick roasted chicken that we just finished for Monday dinner, this book not only gives you great ideas but it makes cooking less stressful. It has liberated my chef within!"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"Of the 50 books in my cookbook collection, this is the one I pick up most often...by a long shot.

The pan sauce section is my favorite...you'll never get sick of eating chicken again."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I already own a bookshelf of cookbooks, but Pam Anderson's is truly unlike any other out there. It explains, in a concise manner, the basis for the primary forms of cooking (from scratch!) that we all love, but never cook for lack of time: those hearty soups, salads, sauces to go with that ever-present chicken, and how to expand your menu way beyond chicken, and so much more. Unbelievable, she shows us that we *can* cook these on a weeknight (most within 30 minutes).I love the concept behind this book because, while I enjoy cooking, I often don't have time for all of the recipes that are my family's favorites -- or at least I didn't think I did. This book teaches you that a soup, for example, is a few basic ingredients that you probably already have in your home, and that it can be prepared in 20 minutes! She shows you how this is true for a wide variety of meats, pasta dishes, appetizers, desserts, even stir-fry and pad thai dishes.While there are also example recipes for every category of food in the book, after reading it, you will be inspired to create your own variations, even if you never thought you could. In addition, there are tips on how to make most of this food sophisticated enough for a dinner party, including example menus.With the help of Pam Anderson's book, I now have the joy and the option of creating my own recipes, instead of constantly pulling a book from the shelf to find the answer to &quot;What's for dinner?&quot;It's easy to read, thoroughly enjoyable and best of all, the ideas presented will help end the feeling that cooking the nightly dinner is such a chore!"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"&quot;How to Cook without a Book&quot; is the cookbook that I have been hoping to find. It teaches you the mindset and skills neccesary to quickly prepare a healthy meal with what you've got in your fridge and pantry. The weekends are great for trying new recipes and new ingredients, but what do you do on Wednesday night at 6pm when you're tired and hungry and haven't yet given a thought to what you'll cook and whether you have all the ingredients?&quot;How to Cook without a Recipe&quot; teaches you a few simple techniques which can be used with a variety of ingredient combinations. For example, Ms. Anderson's saute techinique works for chicken, pork, fish, tofu, and more. So, if you have any of these on hand and a few seasonings, you've got your main dish.So far I've read a few sections of the book, and it has already improved my cooking. What the book boils down to is this: learn a few techniques, stock your pantry, make a weekly trip to the grocery store to buy whatever's in season or on sale, and you'll be able to put a &quot;real meal&quot; on the table anytime.Excellent for someone setting up a new house or apartment and for those who are tired of take-out and packaged instant meals. Would make a great gift for a college graduate or for a bride and/or groom-to-be."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"The overall lesson about cooking in this book is THE BEST OUT THERE. She tells you the truth. I can't imagine anyone not knowing what to cook for dinner if they had this book. It breaks everything down, gives you the big picture, so you realize what those recipes you've been following blindly were trying to do. It's true she has you get pre-made sauces and chicken broth (some Asian sauces should be bought pre-made anyway) and if you actually have time to make them you'll have to open up another book for those things if you're a beginner (who has time these days anyway?). On the other hand, I am so sick of reading cookbooks where the cook writes as if they are performing on stage, which has no relevance whatsoever to what I'm doing in the kitchen. This book doesn't waste your time, gets right down to business."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I am a cajun and thus was raised within a strong cooking tradition that emphasizes cooking skills as much among men as women (my father and two brothers are professional chefs, another is a pastry chef and still another is a seafood merchant). Although I too began in professional kitchens I am now a college instructor but remain an avid home cook (a little catering on the side) and own over 1500 cookbooks Though this book does not have the homestyle long cooking black pot dishes cajuns are famous for; the details of seasoning and other ingredient proportions offered in this book are so accurately delicious that this information would be of value to any cuisine!Even though I have an extensive cookbook library, I have never written a cookbook review. Why now? Because this is simply the best cookbook I've ever used! Within the stated limitations of the book (ie. quick , midweek night cooking for family; the kind all of us are forced to do.) this cookbook is without flaw. This is the only cookbook my wife and I keep on our kitchen prep table.Because Ms. Anderson(a former &quot;Cook's Illustrated&quot; magazine editor} has taken the trouble to have each recipe taste tested by a panel before finalizing the selection of the best recipe version (The &quot;Best Recipe&quot; is the title of a previous volume by Ms. Anderson and is also fabulous} success is guranteed. This research is her secret to success and something that you or I or even professional chefs simply will never have access to.I would call Ms. Anderson a professional cook rather than chef but this is to her advantage since she doesn't have to waste time on food presentation and plating technique. Really good professional chefs can be fine at feeding one (a single order) or an army (buffets and banquets) and so are often lousy cookbook authors for families (2, 4. or 6). But this is precisely where the professional cook comes in and Pam Anderson is simply the best.So what's in the book? Absolutely delicious quickly prepared dishes that take advantage of the best ingedients available today. I have tried most of the recipes in this book and every one was superb which has led me to revise many of my own tried and true recipes. There are delicious soups, frittatas, stir frys; pan grilled chicken supremes, beef steaks, pork tenderloin, fish and shellfish, and a huge variety of superb accompaning sauces, butters, and salsas, vegatables, salads, appetizers and more. While each dish is complete in itself, once a recipe is learned you can put the book aside; especially when cooking your own improvisations (eg. I use her basic frittata formula, since there's none better, to make cajun style crawfish, eggplant, or chicken liver flat omeletes in addition to using her great selection of frittata recipes).Another nice thing about the book is that it is just as useful for the accomplished cook (because of the extensive compilation of tasty fare) as the beginner (very clear instructions).I have often heard ethnic chefs refer to young American chefs as unrooted food &quot;bastardizers&quot;.That is they often take a classic recipe (perhaps 500 years old) from a well rooted ethnic cuisine and arrogantly attempt to &quot;improve&quot; it by whim; often destroying the recipes' very essence. Cajun cuisine has been almost completely bastardized outside of Cajun Louisiana ( eg. Emeril may or may not be a good cook but he's not cajun and not qualified to represent cajun cooking but is a god exampl of; but the food channel knows best. I know many genuine cajun chefs, who perfected their art long before cajun was even recognized, and yet are competely passed over by the celebrity chef gestapo). Even when a perfectly good dish is created using an ethnic recipe it is often &quot;bastardized&quot; in name. Bouillabase with black beans and sweet corn may or may not be tasty, but it's no longer honest bouillabase. So why call it that? Is it because the young chef has used some of the classic techniques employed in good seafood soup making in order to create his dish? A smart but dishonest chef.Ms. Anderson's recipes are very modern indeed but without any attempt to take simple yet tasty classic flavors and map them on to some contrived, forced and unnatural concoction. Any fusion in her recipes is simply an honest reflection of America's melting pot cuisine and are not vain attempts to &quot;bastardize&quot; by forcing conflicting flavors together. She doesn't call her delicious Pork Soup with Hominy and Peppers Pozole (her's has no hogs' head or feet). She doesn't need to. Ditto. her fabulous Gumbo Style Shrimp Soup (which doesn't have okra or dark roux) which she doesn't call Shrimp Gumbo. Her fast and tasty &quot;Chinese&quot; stir frys are named by ingredient not by the classic dishes they closely resemble. She doesn't need to, because her recipes are fast and fantastic American melting pot dishes that stand on their own, made with readily available ingredients with out having to find gumbo file powder and spend an hour making a dark roux or visiting the Oriental shop for obscure ingredients. If you do want to do these things (Saturday or Sunday perhaps) her recipes are perfectly adaptable.Because of the time and effort that go into her cookbooks (and I highly recomend any of the three) they are few and far between. Please Ms. Anderson just one more. If it's only half as good as this one I'd still give it five stars.I routinely give this remarkable cookbook as a gift and I have a spare.Get this cookbook and place it very near to where youcook and just see what a good or better cook you'll become.When I see flowery praise of this type I often wonder whether its' not written by a best freind or a publisher. I can assure the reader that my adulaton for this cookbook is completely honest and sincere. I have never met Pam Anderson or corresponded with her and I don't need a job."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I love this book. Some reviewers lament this style of book because it preaches simplicity and because the author actually uses canned broth. That's the point of this book! I like to cook and when I have a chance to pore over the cookbooks and make something really special, I do it. But in the general course of life, I needed somone to point to the things she points to in this book. First, everyone should learn to cook with what they have, not the other way around. Too many people shop for the ingredients to match the recipe rather than what looks good. Second, too many people rely on 'prepared foods'(frozen dinners, etc.) every night of the week because they are busy - but how hard is it to fire up a pan and saute some chicken? Once you get that far, a pan sauce is pretty easy work (and she has a lot of great ideas in that area). Finally, this is good food. No, you will not see a recipe for rabbit livers simmered in cognac, but is that what you really want to make and eat every day? If so, go elsewhere. If you want a book to give you confidence and direction in becoming a good home cook (and I mean better than most people remember their moms to be) then buy this book. If you think you will not have any 'gourmet' flair with a simple book like this, I believe you may be surprised. I was talking to someone about a recipe I was making one time, and they commented that 'when you start talking about sauces, you start talking about gourmet food.' That is certainly a wild overstatement, but the confidence you will build with saucing your entrees will certainly raise the bar above what most people are eating in their houses these days."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I became a fan of Ms Anderson's work(and her good taste) while she was an editor at Cook's Illustrated. Her good sense that she brought to that magazine was in full evidence throughout her last book,The Perfect Recipe. My family enjoyed many meals based on her recipes, which is more than I can say for many of the other cookbooks that I have purchased.Now comes her latest effort&quot;How toCook...&quot;.I have only had a few days to &quot;play&quot; with this book,but I am already pleased with the dishes that I have prepared.The Big Frittata with Sausage and Potatoes easily passed a difficult challenge-My four year old daughter. Seconds were requested. Better yet,the Sweet and Sour Pork With Peppers and Pineapple where eaten without complaint to the presence of hot red pepper flakes.There is hope!Anderson's style is such that she makes wannabe cooks like me at ease.This appears to be a book that will I will use time and again.

For this person a strategy is needed, and Pam Anderson's book offers that strategy. This is not a collection of fancy &quot;30 Minute Gourmet&quot; recipes; it is exactly the opposite. Anderson suggests that the home chef de cuisine learn a few core recipes that can be executed quickly and build off these with whatever ingredients happen to be on hand. It's an ambitious undertaking and one that requires the reader to have both good equipment and a solid base of culinary fundamentals. After all, if you don't know how to properly saut&eacute;, and don't have a good pan to do it in, you're not going to do real well with the saut&eacute; recipes. And if there's a weakness to the approach, that's it. Simplified core recipes put a lot of emphasis on both fundamental culinary technique and a well equipped and organized kitchen. Absent either of these, this method will not work for you. But if you really want to put the effort into moving away from someone else's recipes and unleash your own culinary creativity, this book is an excellent starting point."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I can't heap enough praise on this wonderful cookbook. It singlehandedly solved my personal cooking problems, and you can't ask for more than that.I think I was already a decent cook in the sense that I could get good results from good recipes. But as Anderson describes, I was not able to assemble something from ingredients on hand on short notice -- except for standbys such as spaghetti, tacos, chili and so forth. Another trait of mine got in the way of falling back on these: I want lots of variety. In fact, I would love to cook and eat something new almost every night of the year.I'm a freelance writer at the moment, but when I worked away from home I almost never cooked; I was too tired to grapple with these challenges. This book may be changing my life. Although I have plenty of time now, I don't want to spend every day combing through cookbooks AND going to the store for that one ingredient I don't have. I enjoy cooking outside of Anderson's formulas on weekends and some weeknights, but her book has provided me and my husband with easy ways to quickly make delicious meals with a relatively short list of staples that we now routinely shop for (most we already had on hand anyway). And variety is no longer an issue, as it's built in to this way of cooking.I can't recommend this book highly enough. It's perfect for beginning and experienced cooks, and for people who do and don't love cooking -- in short, for almost everyone."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"After I bought this cookbook, it sat on my shelf for a few months before I got around to looking through it.

Written in a friendly and conversational tone, Mrs. Anderson uses examples of her own life and cooking needs to show how she's created her techniques.Her book is full of common sense and fun in the kitchen. Does \\"How to Cook Without a Book\\" accomplish what it set out to do? It does that and a lot more. I can't say that I remembered a single rhyme, but I did find myself shopping without a list and easily whipping up meals with what I had on hand.To call this a cookbook is incorrect. Yes, it contains recipes but it's really much more than that. It's thought provoking. Eggs become a meal when turned into omelets and frittatas. Eggs for dinner? Why not? In the mood for something more than spaghetti but don't have a lot of time? \\"Quick Ravioli\\" and \\"Quick Lasagna\\" use wonton wrappers found in most grocery stores instead of pasta. Yes, it really works.I found this a very useful book that I can see myself referring to often. The concepts are so easy that even a novice cook should feel comfortable.

The pan sauces, in particular, are brilliant and a great launching pad for your own creativity. I only disagree with the use of spaghetti instead of Chinese noodles in the Lo Mein dishes.

It helps you make dinner on those night when you're starving, but have been too busy to go to the grocery store, so you don't have those 20 obsecure ingredients other recipes call for.This teaches you a method to cooking, and is a great beginning step for people like me who want to learn how to put our own spin on cooking and not have to follow a recipe exactly."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"What else need i say.... Pam expalins amny recipe mysteries in terms of formulas. It doens't matter which ingredients you are using as long as you follow the formula and the exceptions you will have an excellent meal. Her methods have taken some of the mystery our of recipe construction. She also details some excellent methods of cooking that I have yet to see elsewhere. Such as her steam/saute vegetable cooking method, and her method for cooking pasta. She enables me to cook a well round and delicious diner every night of the week in less tiem than it would take to make something out of a box! Pure Genius!"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"How to Cook Without a Book is an interesting volume and contains some useful information. Unfortunately, the book focuses more on recipes than on techniques. Rather than giving you tools to invent your own recipes, this book shows you how to make a few things (e.g. fritatta or salad) using different ingredients. In the end this was a good book, but I would not have bought it had I looked at it first."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"Overall, I was very disappointed in this book and am quite glad I didn't pay the cover price. I felt the author was trying to complete a high-school essay assignment for a required number of words.If I truly needed a 5-page methodology and exhaustive potential ingredient list for tossed salad, followed by an \\"all-purpose\\" recipe for tossed salad, and six pages of specific variations of tossed salad using the aforementioned potential ingredient list, I may have liked this book. The same theory applies in this book to the making of \\"all-purpose\\" soup, the cooking of \\"all-purpose\\" eggs, and the sauteeing or searing of \\"all-purpose\\" meat. An entire page explains how to bake a potato, and two pages tell you how to mash them. If you are an absolute novice, or if you're missing any basic techniques (you can't make tomato sauce at all, for example, or make rice without a boil-in bag) then by all means...this book will indeed help you out. But if my pantry were stocked per her recommendations, I'd be using my own tried and true recipes, and unexpected guests wouldn't be a big worry.A terrific book for someone wanting to learn basics, but it won't see frequent use at my house."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"This may be the book for beginners if they are into childish text.

However, it is a cookbook like all the rest in that it is explains how to cook. She organizes things well, just as Joy of Cooking does, or Moosewood Cookbook. I was ready to buy it until I read the tomato sauce recipe. She is right when she says make your own. But how can she exclude that tomatoes transform when simmered? That, yes, spaghetti sauce is a crowd pleaser, but not the one made in 10 minutes! So, it made me doubt all the recipes. And recipes are what is in there, with other thoughts ala Cooks magazine. So I give it 3 stars for cleverness and format, but did not buy it because of that HUGE omission, and that I already have a ton of recipes."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"There is one thing that every cookbook author can learn from How To Cook Without A Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know By Heart, by Pam Anderson (not the big-breasted one), and that is the art of the highly marketable title.For starters, this artful moniker really plays on the single gal's fears about never being able to put together nutritious, attractive, varied, affordable, and delicious meals for her future family every single night of the week. You want your kids to be armed with more than some simple carbohydrates when you send them off into the big bad world.So the plus side of this book is the title. That's where it ends. The big idea here is to help the reader become a non-cookbook-consulting cook by: a) teaching basic cooking techniques that are conducive to variation, and b) suggesting mnemonic devices for said cooking techniques. Sounds interesting so far, right?Well, the problem is that almost all the recipes rely on \\"canned low-sodium chicken broth\\", which I think is a bit of a weird ingredient. It's even included in the salad dressings. Other big hitters include: heavy cream, butter, and sour cream. Do people really eat like this? Regularly?Why not make the Easy Fruit Parfaits for a quick and sweet ending to your meal? Just take a tall glass, drop in a few spoonfuls of sour cream, then a few spoonfuls of brown sugar, and some berries. Repeat until the glass is filled.Crikey. Sour cream, brown sugar, and berries?!? Wouldn't it be just as easy to put the berries in yoghurt sweetened with a little squirt of Greek honey? Am I totally off base thinking that this sounds much more appetizing? Or, if calories are no object anyway, why not pick up some Baskin Robbins' Rocky Road on the way home from work? That's easy AND it's worth the internal havoc it will cause.Oh, and here's a sample mnemonic device that I can't not share, it's that good:\\"Cook tender vegetables with garlic and oil,Then toss in some pasta that's fresh from the boil.\\"Pure genius, right?

I found less than half of what I wanted. The recipes are good, but very simple and much of the book is just variations on these recipes. An example might be a salad with walnuts and gorgonzola...on the next page it might say, \\"rather than using walnuts, try pecans and bleu cheese\\" (I don't have the book in front of me so I can't give an example straight from the text; I've already given the book away). I was hoping for explanations of food science (e.g. it is difficult for meat to brown in an acidic environment) and techniques such as reducing and deglazing. I would have liked to see an explanation of the four different classifications of french sauces as well.

That's about all I've made from the book so far, but I still recommend it to people who don't really know where to start with cooking, but want to have a few things they know how to make."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I got this book because I was tired of eating frozen food or take out all the time, and the cookbooks I all had had recipes that were elaborate, hard to follow, or took a great deal of preparation. This book is *great.* Each chapter gives a simple description of a general process (sauteeing, searing, making pasta, omelettes, frittattas, etc.) followed by a few recipes that illustrate the process so you can try it out yourself. The processes described are simple, flexible, and can easily be adapted to use whatever you have in the fridge or freezer at the moment. Plus, the recipes are all *fast,* perfect for making quickly at the end of a long day. I've tried many recipes out of here and I've never had a bad one so far.

I've completely adopted Anderson's method of steam-sauteeing vegetables as the every-day standard in my kitchen. But the format of recipes within recipes (for which you have to refer to recipes on other pages, or in other sections) is annoying and something I never like in a cookbook.All of Anderson's books use this format, but her recipes are so good that it's worth the relatively minor nuisance. Still I had to drop a star off my review because of it."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"This cookbook is so great! Most cookbooks include a bunch of recipes that require you to go out and buy a bunch of super-specific ingredients.

As a busy mom of three, who is oh so tired of unwrapping her food, this book was the boost I needed. It is definitely not for an experienced cook, but if you are trying to learn, this is the way to go. Everything I have made so far has turned out so well my kids couldn't even find anything to complain about. Best of all, I haven't needed to run to the store for extra ingredients and we are finally able to stay away from fast food even on those busy nights.

This would be an EXCELLENT wedding or house-warming gift."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"When I moved overseas to a country with outstanding fresh produce and reliable meat and poultry--but no way to find the exotic or everything for a specific recipe--I discovered that I didn't really know how to cook. I knew how to follow a recipe. Without the &quot;right&quot; ingredients, I wasn't sure what to do. This book saved me from a year of limited menus and is my most prized cooking tool. What it does is explain how to just 'whip something up' using a simple technique, what you can substitute, how to create variations, and what will give you a meal of elegance and ease. You don't spend hours cooking and never open a jar of pasta sauce. I have loved everything I made in this book and I lost weight eating it, all because the food is tasty, modern, simple, fresh, and doesn't rely on overprepared foods. This book is so great that when I thought we might be evacuated from here, I carried it in my purse to be sure I got it out with me! That's quite the cookbook."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I am a mom of a 4 year old and a 1 year old who always ends up at the grocery store at 5pm trying to put together a dinner which most of the time turns out average. This book has changed that--it taught me how to cook all sorts of meat (which I always have in my freezer) in several different and easy ways. For example, I have never been able to cook boneless skinless chicken breasts to my satisfaction. I had pretty much given up on them, thinking of them as bland, dry, \\"diet\\" meat. Last night, for the first time, I sauteed them using the directions in the book, and I was amazed at the results. Delicious! The other methods in the book that I have used have also turned out wonderful food. This book does not have much shelf appeal, but don't let that put you off. The info will change your life (especially if you are an amateur cook, as I am)!"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"When I was growing up, I never learned how to cook, and I have the added problem of being a solo cook in a world which is not very friendly to solo cooks. It's very hard finding recipes that serve one or two--much less finding enough recipes that would make use of something I bought for another recipe. Then there was the blizzard where I couldn't go shopping--I had food, but I really struggled trying to put it together without a recipe. All I wanted was to find something that gave me a place to start so I could look at what I had and make something out of it.This books gives master menus--a foundation from which a meal can be put together. The author explains how each master meal works and then gives a number of examples to show how it could be varied. Obviously, they're basic, but it allows a lot of room for experimentation. A lot of times I don't know what my grocery store will have in the produce section until I get there--I've walked in planning to get zucchini, and none of them look good. This allows me to go to a plan B and try something new.But the best part is the master menus can easily be pared down to one or two servings--and without a lot of effort. That makes it easier for me to work with it.My only complaints are that it primarily focuses on dinner and ignores breakfast and lunch--a complaint I have about most cookbooks. And also that it didn't cover some obvious master menus, like for smoothies. Overall, a very good book for solo cooks."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I have gotten a lot of ideas from this book. The recipes are simple and easy to make. I have so many cook books that I rarely use because the recipes are too long and complicated for normal use. This book, however, is just the opposite. It is intended for making everyday meals, and the results have been very tasty. This book and Mark Bittman's &quot;How to Cook Everything&quot; are my most used cookbooks. Although these two books are not intended as low-fat or healthy cookbooks, I find it easy to reduce the fat in their recipes with good results."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"This is the best cookbook on my shelf. I use it regularly and have never been disappointed by a recipe. Tonight I seared a steak and my husband declared it the best steak he's had. My favorite recipe in the book so far is the ravioli (she has you use wonton wrappers) with her tomato sauce (it's so simple and good). I've also had success with her lasagne (she uses egg roll wrappers). Each section has a long description of how she came about a recipe with a detailed description of the method. Then she has the recipes (they are easy to read and well laid out) and variations of the recipe. Each recipe has a simple formula that people with better memories than me could memorize. One of my favorite recipe sections are the pan sauces. I've made the tomato-rosemary pan sauce with seared salmon a few times and loved it. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I'm very much a novice but I've cooked a number of times before. Most of my cooking is hit-and-miss; unfortunately for me, 50% of the time I have to torture myself with eating the leftovers of the not-so-good batch the rest of the week since I live alone. It always frustrated me because a recipe that was successful one week could be a disaster the next. What's more, my mom is a very good cook but I have never once seen her follow a recipe! I thought (mistakenly) that one has to have the 'cooking mojo' to be able to cook decent food and that I was one of the unfortunate mojo-less beings.After another unhappy kitchen incident, I had a revelation: more than inexperience, the number one thing I was lacking was technique. Though I own a number of very good cookbooks, they did not teach me anything about technique. How exactly should I saute? How should I sear chicken breast? In what order should I add in the vegetables and why? These kinds of things are probably obvious to the experienced cook are exactly what I needed. Following the instructions for the basic stir-fry recipe from How To Cook Without A Book, I was able to make stir-fry that was better than any I have attempted to date, and I am confident that I can pull of the same thing next time, maybe even better. It has also made me see recipes in a new light, as I now 'read' a recipe by concept instead of treating them as individual instructions.One of my gripes about cookbooks is that it takes an inordinate amount of time and money to gather together the couple dozen ingredients to make a dish (most of them I would use only once) and I always end up with a lot of odds and ends that find their way to the trash. With How To Cook Without A Book, I can now make a dish with the ingredients available from my fridge or the neareast vegetable stand. There are recipes, yes, but they are used to show the concept and technique behind the style of dish. Knowing the concepts and whys in cooking is important to me. With this knowledge, I feel I can spread my wings and try my own variations - I'm now working out an idea for a flavoring made with hoisin sauce since I find her Soy Sesame Sauce too salty for my taste.I love this cookbook but I'm shaving off a star because I think a few pictures (or good line drawings) of the techniques could help novice cooks understand the concepts better. The book has no pictures whatsoever and it's not so thick so I think the price is a bit too high. Also, I wish there was a section on steaming not just vegetables but also meats."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I use this book all the time and while yes, it is a cookbook, and it is strange for a book to tell you to cook without a book -- it is meant to teach basic easy to remember techniques for a wide range of foods. There are no fancy ingredient recipes just ways to cook stuff and then apply that same technique to other stuff.It is perfect for someone who knows a bit about cooking and wants to make quick meals that taste like more. It also invites you to experiment and play rather than make you adhere to a step by step recipe.Well, worth having right next to your stove!"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I am cooking challenged but this book has changed me in just a few short weeks!

This one is both. It's one of those cookbooks that I end up tabbing so I can go back for a refresher. The recipes are imaginative and do-able, and range from ambitious to embarrassingly easy (best example of this is the Warm White Bean Spread that takes about 30 seconds to make and tastes heavenly).I especially like the way the book is organized, which is by method. For example she goes through sautes (\\"If you've seen one saute, you've seen them all\\") with basic methods for sauteing various meats. Then she provides a basic method for pan sauces, followed by several variations that can be made using the basic method. If it sounds too dumbed down, think again - her recipes are delicious and make it possible to serve imaginative and delectable meals to my family even on weeknights.I always prefer photos, but in this case, the descriptions and then successful outcomes far outweigh that consideration.I first saw this book at a friend's house; I am guilty of sneaking peaks at bookshelves, trying to get an idea of what my good-cook friends are using. This one was food-stained and dog-eared, the best indicator of a well-used resource.

To do this though, you must maintain a well-stocked kitchen. Not all that costly considering the cost of eating out, and that food is a bargain today.According to the author, the way to cook without recipes is to know how to make a few dishes such as: Omelets, pasta, stir-fry, pot roast, steak, fish, port chops or pork loin. Take, for example, an entr&eacute;e of pot roast, potatoes and vegetables you make in a crockpot. The difference in each pot roast meal is the variation of ingredients you have on hand to create \\"different\\" meal each time. Switch to sweet potatoes, for example, or add different vegetables, herbs, flavorings, garnishes, plus original touches to an accompanying salad.The author points out that there probably is no mastery of this method of meal preparation. It's an on-going learning process. You begin by experimenting, develop a few entree dishes, then go from there.Among the items to have on hand in the pantry, refrigerator and freezer to make interesting variations are:An assortment of frozen vegetables in the freezer Herbs and spices: Basil, bay leaves, pepper, cinnamon, cloves, oregano, sage and thyme in the pantry In your refrigerator: gingerroot, garlic, onion, lemon, carrots, celery, green/red/yellow peppers, cabbage, limes. On your pantry shelf: chicken broth, beef broth, clam juice, cans of crushed and while tomatoes, canned tuna, canned clams, peanut butter, honey, jam/jelly, dried mushrooms, noodles, rice, polenta, Dijon mustard, assorted vinegars, soy sauce, canned beans, mayo, breadcrumbs, dried fruit, raisins, dried cranberries, black and green olives, assorted nuts, potatoes, yams, red potatoes.There's a whole chapter on salads with exotic ingredients ideas, including cheeses, fresh fruits, dried fruits, vegetables, and dressings.

Instead of the more expensive 'solution' of fast food (which is a decision I'm never happy with...), I can have a hot meal on the table - with plenty of options when we go 'meat free' around here.

Not so. The recipes the author covers, she covers well, with cute little rhymes to help cooks remember. However, I found the book far from comprehensive, and not systematic enough to use as a how-to book. Some sections are so basic that it's a waste to address them in a non-comprehensive text. (The whole first chapter is about tossed salad.)

I was excited to get it, especially given the glowing reviews here. I failed to consider that it made no claim to health conciousness. It's been frustrating to use this book because I love the idea and I'm sick of using recipes for everything--but a meal of salad, meat with sauce, and side dish made from this cookbook would include at least a quarter cup of added fat per serving! And that doesn't include the fat in meat, eggs, and cheese, all liberally used in these recipes. Yikes. She does include a lot of vegetables, which is great, but it would be helpful if Anderson gave some suggestions on lower fat approaches to these foods. Instead she says (for example) that using less than 3 tbsp of fat in pasta sauce will make it &quot;taste like warmed-up tomatoes&quot; and suggests that you add oil to soup if you are going to use reduced fat sausage."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I DO know how to cook very well!

I WANT TO EAT. NOW. I don't want 6 million choices! When I saw this book I laughed at the title. Then I looked through it. It's terrific! It makes everything so easy and simple. And it is delicious! In the three days since I got it, I have cooked two dinners, and both were terrific, fast, easy. And all the ingredients were already in my kitchen.

I have been cooking for over 12 years now, and have also amassed a large selection of cookbooks. I suppose I have been searching for &quot;my style&quot; in the kitchen. Well, it's right here in &quot;How to Cook Without a Book&quot;. My mother and my grandmother rarely used recipes in their fabulous cooking, which was really frustrating when I was learning to cook because they would tell me things like &quot;cook until it's done&quot;, or &quot;mix until it looks right&quot;. Pam does a super job of defining what &quot;right&quot; should be. I was really expecting a more rigid style considering her Cook's Illustrated background, but I was wrong--it really is a relaxed (but definitely not sloppy) method. Many of her techniques for time saving and short-cutting I learned through the process of many mistakes--I would have saved many hours in the kitchen if I had had this book years ago. But, I believe, that enhances my appreciation of her work because I know from experience that what she is saying works.

Rather than list a series of tasks, Anderson breaks down techniques. The first one I tried was sauteeing-- who knew fish filets could be so easy to cook like a French chef. I spent the next few weeks experimenting with different varieties of fish and variations on pan sauce. Then it was onto the art of searing, and I learned how to make a vinagrette-- before I knew it, I could count myself among the few who know and love cooking.Before this book, I had tried recipes and nothing ever clicked. In fact, nothing ever really came out very good. This book follows the idea 'if you give a man fish he will eat for a day if you teach a man to fish, he will eat for a lifetime' philosophy-- no more lean cuisine for this bachelor!The beauty is that, according to my father, in my mother's last year of life, she also learned to \\"be a gormet cook,\\" and judging from the number of post-it notes this book was a favorite reference.

Bravo, Pam Anderson!"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I realize I'm going to be raked across the coals for daring to review this book negatively, because it seems like everybody else loved it. Well. I didn't, and I'll explain my opinion. This is only my opinion.The book teaches you how to memorize basic cooking techniques by using cute, catchy mnemonic rhymes. For sauteing: \\"Add butter or oil, swirl it around, add spiced meat, cook until browned\\" -- stuff like that (not an exact quote, but you get the idea). It's not a bad idea, but it's obviously for beginners. If you didn't know how to put some oil in a pan, add a piece of meat, and leave it there until it browns, then you're a beginner. There's no question there, right? So it can be assumed that this book is aimed at beginning cooks. That's fine, and that's not my problem.My problem is that a lot of the other stuff in the book is totally worthless for a beginner. Actually, I ran across a bunch of information that's worthless for me -- and I've been cooking for fifteen years. I won't go over it chapter by chapter, but here's one example of what I mean.There's a recipe for making a quick cheese quesadilla. The instructions begin by stating to put a skillet onto high heat and wait until it begins to smoke. I don't know about you, but my skillets generally do not smoke when they're empty. I'd be pretty worried if an empty skillet suddenly began emitting puffs of smoke when placed onto the burner. I honestly don't understand what the author means here -- either she omitted the part about putting some oil or butter into the pan, or she intends for you to use a heavily seasoned cast iron skillet that hasn't been cleaned very well (which almost no beginner is going to own). Since she doesn't state either of those qualifiers, I really don't know how she expects an empty skillet to smoke. I do know that anyone unfamiliar with cooking is going to be waiting an awfully long time staring at a skillet on the burner, waiting for smoke that doesn't come, and assuming that they've done something wrong.Assuming that you own a magic skillet which begins smoking after a few moments, the recipe next states to place the flour tortilla into the skillet, quickly pile shredded cheese and other ingredients onto it, and cook until the bottom of the tortilla begins to brown nicely. That would be the bottom of the tortilla that's in the skillet, yes. You know, the one that's currently piled with cheese. Maybe your magic smoking skillet is also made of translucent glass so that you can tell when the bottom of the tortilla has begun to brown. For someone who ran a test kitchen for so long, \\"until the bottom begins to brown\\" is an incredibly poor way to instruct how long to cook something in a skillet!The entire book is full of similar examples. I can tell from reading the recipes that the author is an excellent cook, but she's very bad at explaining her techniques in a way that would allow somebody to follow along. I think she could benefit from taking an inexperienced cook into her test kitchen, giving them this book, and watching as they attempt to follow recipes that make no sense or instruct things that are physically impossible (gauging the browning of a tortilla whose bottom surface you can't see, etc). That way she'd realize when something needs to be explained in a different manner. It can be really tough to view a recipe from the eyes of someone who DOESN'T have the experience you do, who doesn't take certain techniques for granted.As I said, the recipes in here are excellent. It's the instructions and explanations that pull the book down. If you need a sing-song rhyme to remember how to dress a green salad, then you're not going to be able to follow 50% of what the book instructs. And it's a shame because you'll be missing out on some of the great foods this book has to offer."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"This book is far superior to all others in my large cookbook collection.

This book would NEVER have been purchased by me, as the cover is yuck and there are no photos (boring). Two friends were raving about this book, so despite it's appearance, I bought it.WOW! This is the very best cookbook I have...hands down. This is the Grandmother in the kitchen I never had. I did not grow up learning the basics of preparing a full meal. This books gives me the confidence in the kitchen that has turned me into a great cook.A word of advice: *Read* this book. I have many, many cookbooks and I usually skim through them, taking a recipe here and there. This book does indeed have recipies, but it is more of a \\"how to\\" manual. You remember, not only the recipe, but the technique to use over and over, even with different meals! For exapmple, she tells you how to pan-fry--anything. She begins the chapter with a concise explantation and tips that are very usful, and not necessary found in the body of the recipe.The essence of this book is that once you know how to cook, you can do anything. You will open your fridge and pantry with ease and whip up an amazing meal fit for an upscale restarant. (just always have chicken broth on hand. Pan sauces are AMAZING)The author recognizes that the modern household does not have time to put several hours into a nurishing meal and she gives great shortcuts. I can actually make a scrumptious baked chicken with roasted potatoes and carrots with an rosemary pan sauce in under an hour. And she gives ideas to use those leftovers.The section on a perfectly stocked pantry is the best I have found. I copied the (rather extensive) list to the grocery store and I now have (and use!) things I never thought I would, like toasted sesame oil,tahini, cumin and vaious oils and vinegaretts for the sauces.You will not be dissppointed.

If it wasn't in a can, in paper, or in plastic then it was too much work. I have struggled for many years with cookbook in hand trying to create meals. The basic underlying principles confounded me.After reading this book I have figured out what I needed to do. I have begun to write down my vegetarian ingredients, their uses, and next I'll work out the techniques that will vary and improve their flavors. That is what made this non-vegetarian book so very useful. I'm not liable to use many of the recipes provided, but the book simplified cooking so that I feel empowered. Cooking isn't mysterious or frightening anymore.There is another point I need to make. Although this book mostly mentions animal flesh as protein sources, the techniques are so easily explained that I have sauteed tofu, correctly, for the first time in too many years. The vegetarian/vegan cookbooks I've found never go into details about these things. I can make tofu from scratch, but I couldn't figure out how to properly saute it. (The tofu would require too much oil and become greasy, or stick to the non-stick pan.)This is a book that explains the basic underlying principles of cooking. For the fifth star, I would have liked to see some simple explanations of how to choose dishes that work together. I can now think about and work it on my own, but I think that would have given this book some extra weight and not just literally."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"Reading this book has liberated me.* No more hours of making menus and transcribing ingredients from recipes to shopping lists.* No more realizing with horror that a needed ingredient is out of stock at the grocery today.* No more dashing from stove to cookbook to see what I'm supposed to do next.Instead, I shop for what's fresh and appealing, coming home with yummy supplies for the meals that the season's freshest produce inspire.Just this week I came home with two totally new greens: Nira Grass and some sort of slender-stemmed, tiny-headed brocoli looking thing.

A few variations on the process are given in recipe form to help you get started, and then a bulleted reminders section at the end of the section gives just the highlights in case you need a review.Recognizing how little time most families have, the author focuses on simple preparations that can be made in half and hour or less for weeknight dining and that are comprised primarily of pantry/kitchen staples. If you're a gourmet foodie, you might cringe a little at the number of canned ingredients or substitutions like spaghetti instead of rice noodles for pad thai, but otherwise this book is right-on and poised to empower a lot of people to bring back home cooking and regain a sense of control over their kitchens and food budgets."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"This book is just as it says - a primer on American home cooking theory, and the hows and whys of different methods.

I have tried the cooking ahead approach(either a week or a month) and the grocery shopping alone can be overwhelming; then I tried the doctoring up convenience foods approach (always fast but can be expensive and taste like blah.)I always keep coming back to the intuitive approach to shopping and cooking. Run to the store, bBuy the ingredients that look good and are on sale, and cook for dinner whatever I have on hand into something quick and interesting. (I'm told this is more like a chef approach.) I've no time for propping open cookbooks, measuring, compiling huge lists from recipes then going to the store, and so forth.There are always leftover vegetables and meat to be used up, and I needed some fresh FLEXIBLE ideas on how to use up these leftovers. Before I read this book, my best dinners were always those that were from scratch but used up ingredients already on hand, that didn't really follow a recipe: pizzas, casseroles, quesadillas, omelets, sandwiches.This cookbook is great for a beginner cook or a busy cook. Even though I have been cooking for over 20 years, this was exactly what I needed. The ideas on searing and pan sauces was worth the price alone for this book.

Thanks Pam!"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"\`How to Cook Without a Book' by former \`Cooks Illustrated' executive editor, Pam Anderson promises to teach us all to cook the way our mothers and grandmothers cooked, from memory, without consulting a cookbook except for the most obscure pastry measurement. And, at that, they usually owned but one cookbook. I had high expectations from this book, but I was not surprised when it turned out to be just a little disappointing.The most illuminating statement in this book is yet another confirmation of Tom Colicchio's premise in his book \`How to Think Like a Chef', where he establishes the principle that chefs do not create recipes, then search for their ingredients to make the recipe; they look to see what they have on hand and create a recipe from these materials. This is why the Iron Chef premise is really a perfect exemplar of how chefs really work. Their source of inspiration may be what is good in the market or what they happen to have on hand in their walk-in. But, this is only half of the equation. Inspiration may arise from ingredients, but you need to know what to do with those ingredients. Presentation of methods for dealing with ingredients takes up the lion's share of the book.But getting back to the original premise, Anderson takes this premise to the logical, but not entirely satisfactory conclusion that one basis of cooking without a book is to have a well-stocked pantry, refrigerator, and freezer. While I am in the unusual position of having all the time I need to go to the market every day to shop for the day's meals, there was a time when I worked ten to twelve hours a day, and padded my larder with lots of staples such as pastas, beans, rice, canned vegetables, frozen meats, and the like. And, most of that stuff sat in the pantry until I threw it out. Stocking a pantry is a very good idea, but it should not be done from a list given to you by a cookbook author, no matter how good her credentials or how worthy her rationale is for the list. I have it on the authority of no less than Madhur Jaffrey that the best way to build a pantry is to add to it those things that are parts of dishes you know you will make on a regular basis. Thus, being from a Pennsylvania Dutch background, I always have canned sauerkraut, canned dried corn, hot bacon dressing, and chow chow on hand, even though none of these items ever appear in a recommended pantry list.A second weakness with Anderson's implementation of her program is that her rationale behind cooking without a book is done in order to save time. This means that many of the recipes in the book are either simple in themselves or simplified versions of classic long cooking dishes. My favorite example of this for both its strengths and its weaknesses is her recipe for lasagna, which is certainly fast, using wonton wrappers in place of traditional Italian lasagna noodles. Her method is so far removed from the original dish that she admits that it really must be served almost immediately after cooking. This is not the lasagna I know and love, which will stoutly stand by on the sideboard or the buffet line for hours and will gladly be refrigerated to serve again another day. All of this lasagna virtue is given up in order to get a faster dish. I would sooner eat an alternative, easier baked pasta dish than have to deal with this ersatz dish.The concern with cooking time leads the author to violate some of the most sacred maxims of cookery, such as the recommendation to cook a pound of pasta in at least four quarts of boiling water. Ms. Anderson states that it takes a fairly long time to bring four quarts of water to a boil, and that two quarts will do the job quite nicely. All this in spite of the fact that Rachael Ray makes pasta in three out of five episodes of '30 Minute Meals' by bringing four quarts of water to a boil and still finishes the pasta dish well within her allotted half-hour.All these concerns do not eliminate the value of this book in presenting a wide variety of cooking methods and how to plug in different ingredients to a common method to get interesting, new results. This is exactly what Mario Batali did, for example, when presented with a lobster in one of his Iron Chef appearances. Molto Mario simply made lobster saltimbocca, a dish usually made with veal or chicken. Ms. Anderson presents 21 different methods, plus all their variations. And, many of these methods contain some genuinely useful ideas, such as the recommendation to make an omelet dinner for four by making one large eight egg omelet and cutting it into quarters rather than either buying four omelet pans or turning out an omelet every five minutes. With all this good stuff, I still have reservations, as when Ms. Anderson lumps together Broccoli, Cabbage, Squash, and Potatoes in a single category, giving the impression that these four vegetables can be cooked in the same way in a pasta dish with \`firm vegetables'. This ignores another prime chef's skill in knowing the differences between ingredients and how to coax the very best out of each ingredient.Ms. Anderson's lesson is a very good one. I just think that while she may have given one alternative to people who have to cook and may not embrace the task, she has taken a lot of the fun and interest out of cooking for someone who relishes cooking. One may get the same lesson with fewer questionable shortcuts from either Colicchio or Alton Brown's \`I'm Only Here for the Food'.Recommended for good ideas and techniques, as long as you know the difference between the good and the bad ideas."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I got this book a few days ago and since then have stopped while reading it three times to consider how I could thank the author for such a wonderful book.

Along with this formula Pam Anderson includes ideas of exact ingredients we can use to make the dish delicious but what is most exciting for me is that is also leaves many choices available for me to be creative.

If you are on a limited budget (Stay-At-Home moms or large families), this book will be helpful in learning techniques, but most of her recipes call for 1 pound of meat per night for a family of four. She does include chapters on egg dishes as well as stir fry/lo mein which are economical. How to cook without a book is ideally for the cook who is pressed for time with an average food budget. A BIG bonus: Almost all of her recipes and meals are appealing to men (I haven't seen too many guys excited about eggs as a main course, but I'm sure they're out there somewhere!)"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"Saw the reviews here, and was pretty impressed. This book did not dissapoint: the food allows you to come home and make easy, tasty &quot;gourmet-like&quot; meals with what you have in mostly about 20-30 minutes. It's all about understanding the basics and improvising with what's in your kitchen. Pam Anderson has some really terrific recipes: highly recommend the Steamed/Sauteed Squast, the Parmesean Pepper Pilaf, and the Pasta with Veggies. My husband likes the fact that most of it only requires a pan or two. What a relief to drive home at the end of the day and know a good meal awaits, no matter what's in the pantry!"},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I have probably 50 or 60 cookbooks not including cooking magazines. This cookbook is far and away the best one I own. As much as I know about cooking, this really teaches the basics. My only reservation is the shortcuts for the desserts. Either do desserts right or buy a half gallon of ice cream at the store. Also, some of the recipes use more butter or oil than I think is necessary so use your judgment in knowing when to cut back. It's a must have for the beginner and the experienced."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"The title is interesting ... but what does it mean? Less cookbooks ... maybe. More confidence ... yes. More creativity ... definitely so! We all have a certain number of dishes that we cook often, perhaps often enough that we tend to get bored with them, even though they taste good. By providing the reasoning and guidelines behind why certain recipes are good and work well, the author supports the reader in experimenting within wise boundaries. (Since we know what the recipe takes to make it work, just use the foundations and have fun from there. It also encourages the reader (at least it did for me) to walk away from the &quot;precise measurements&quot; that plague many other cookbooks and concentrate instead on flavors and tastes."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"As soon as I read a review of this book...I knew it was for me!

My family loves the Sauteed Boneless Pork Chops (cut from a boneless pork loin) with Orange-Dijon Pan Sauce with Rosemary.The author covers everything from salads to side dishes to quick deserts. All of the chapters are fabulous, but I've personally gotten the most out of those dedicated to meat, chicken, and fish.This book is wonderful and I'd recommend it as a starting point for novices as well as experienced cooks.

After trying the saute and pan sauce methods with the ingredients I had on hand, I was sold on her approach and had to buy the book!I consider myself to be a fairly adventurous cook, but I'm also partial to quick recipes that don't require numerous or exotic ingredients. Pam provides a wonderful &quot;theme and variations&quot; style, and most of her recipe suggestions require only a handful of ingredients. She lays out the chapters based on techniques (saute, sear) rather than main ingredients (meat, fish, chicken), which will help me master the techniques more quickly and stop relying on recipes as much. I'd like to saute, but don't have pork or chicken on hand? Use fish! And I can vary the same meat with dozens of pan sauces and relishes - the combinations are endless. Last night we had a delectable Sauteed Tilapia with Mustard-Cream Sauce, along with a Crisp Potato Cake. Tonight perhaps we'll have Seared Marlin Steaks with Horseradish Pan Sauce and Orzo with Lemon and Parsley. I can't wait to try the Lo Mein, Stir Fry, Quick Ravioli, and Supper Soup techniques, as well as the Tossed Salads and Steam/Sauteed Vegetables. So many possibilities!I'm done paging through cookbooks to find the one recipe for which I have all the ingredients. With this book on my shelf, I can buy any available fresh and seasonal ingredients and know that I'll be able to put together a fast, healthy, and nutritious meal without a problem.

This is a great book for learning important basic techniques.I didn't like all of the recipes I saw, but the IDEAS are right. And keeping broth and frozen spinach on hand is a good thing--I always do that myself. Wonton skins are useful as well, but I don't agree with a no-bake lasagna.

I already have a bunch of recipe books, so I was looking to get into something that teaches how to cook. I was looking for something that got more into techniques. This book is not that book - it's a basic text that is a waste of time for anyone who has spent any time in the kitchen.This would be a good book for someone who has never cooked before and severely lacks imagination. One of the first chapters deals with salads - as if you need a cook book to make a salad as opposed to walking through the produce aisle and grabbing things that you like to put in salads. But this books puts this out there as if you would have never thought of putting tomatoes and romaine lettuce together in a big bowl - or would never have thought to use olive oil and vinegar as a dressing.Elements of cooking and Ratio have more information in their introduction than this book has in its entirety. Save your money - unless you're fifteen years old, never cooked and have no imagination -- this book is a waste of time.My humble opinion."},{"Title":"How to Cook Without a Book: Recipes and Techniques Every Cook Should Know by Heart","review":"I mean, come on. Look at the title. It's too ironic to look at without laughing. And Cat Cora hadn't even writtenCooking From the Hipyet; if there's anything that describes this book better than its own title, it's Cora's title.It's not a bad book by any stretch of the imagination. As it happens, it borrows a technique that's been used very successfully by cooking teachers for years, the \\"master recipe\\", whereby the writer throws out a recipe that demonstrates a general principle and then presents similar recipes as variations on a theme. This approach was developed to a high art by Julia Child in particular (The Way to Cookuses master recipes almost exclusively); Escoffier relied on it heavily, possibly the only way to make hisGuide Culinaireof a manageable size; and the technique is the backbone of a great many Chinese restaurants and breakfast restaurants, where the key ingredients go together like Legos. (Oddly enough, this is not necessarily a hallmark of Anderson's alma mater, Cook's Illustrated; their nitpicky approach to dishes, while phenomenally successful, limits their ability to present master-variation recipes.)So ultimately, where this book fails is that it promises something that it makes no sense to deliver. Improvisational cooking is certainly a useful skill, and it has quite the romance to it. But ultimately, lacking a good cooking teacher over your shoulder at all times, there's no real way to do it except to practice and study; Anderson's slightly-fuzzy, grossly mistitled book is only a first step. In my cooking life, I've never felt the need to learn to cook instinctually; I can do it for certain things, but nine times out of ten it's something I've learned to do by rote. And I tweak it sometimes, just like this book tells its readers to do. But this book wants you to believe that you can learn to fly solo. I have never done that -- I have always had a book or two around to serve as a quick reference -- and I don't think I can reasonably expect anyone that is able to read to do so.What is in here is good. The teaching technique is well-tested and sound, and you can certainly learn to cook or refine your techniques using this. And there are a lot of creative recipes for sauces and the like in here. The section at the beginning on how to stock a well-prepared kitchen is valuable, if not exactly hard to find in other books, and will get you a pantry that can get you out of the weeds in short order. If that's all this book wanted to be, it would be a solid four-star book.

I was there when it was written\\"The four Pevensie children - Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - have come into the countryside to live with The Professor, away from the war. While there, Lucy discovers an old wardrobe that leads to a magical world.I Liked:I find myself at a loss figuring out what I want to say about this book. I've never been as fond of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" as I've been of \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", but it certainly isn't a bad book.The story is clever and unique. At the time, not many fantasy stories existed for children, and this book definitely transports you to a world much different than ours. I love how it is populated with mythological creatures like fauns, nymphs and centaurs, but also has talking animals (which Disney almost owns exclusive rights to), and not just your \\"typical\\" talking animals, like cats and dogs, but animals like beavers (beavers?! That wouldn't have been my first choice) and lions.Another clever addition was the treachery of Edmund. Children in books tend to come off as almost insanely perfect and unable to err, and even this book doesn't avoid it 100% as Lucy, Peter, and Susan do have near-perfect attributes. But Edmund's deception, greed, and subsequent guilt do make things more realistic and show redemption. Plus, it keeps our bad guys from being painfully bad.I Didn't Like:What's always bugged me about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was the heavy-handed Christian allegory/symbolism/whatever-you-call-it. I consider myself a religious person, and yet the message is still too heavy-handed to me and makes me feel I am being bludgeoned with a brick. There were some things that weren't bad (Edmund's redemption), but the obvious parallels to Christian ideology, again, made me cringe.Similarly, I found a lot of the characters to be very simplistic and easily drawn out. I realize this is a children's novel, but still, it would have been nice had Lucy not been so obviously perfect (it could have made the \\"Who is lying?\\" bit between Lucy and Edmund's stories of Narnia more interesting) and had Peter and Susan had more character beyond \\"caring, older siblings\\".I also wasn't fond at all of the lack of participation of the girls in particular and the children in general. Lucy finds the land of Narnia, so she gets some brownie points, but after that, her purpose is nothing. Peter fights a battle and that is it. Susan is the worst as she does nothing that couldn't have been done by one of her other siblings. Honestly, the only person that does anything in the course of the novel is Edmund, and even that is only mess things up. The children themselves do nothing; only their presence in Narnia dictates any action, and that is because of a painfully written poem/prophecy. I understand that Lewis was going for an allegory of sorts between Narnia and our world in Christian terms and that our characters are children and can't be miniature Rambos and Rocky's, but when none of our characters really do much, it makes the whole story feel a little pointless.Also, I know this book was published in 1952, but I hated how Susan and Lucy were purposefully cut out of the fight (\\"Wars aren't for girls\\" - but they aren't for little boys, either) and the prejudice to non-humans (Mr. Beaver says that the White Witch is bad because she isn't human but is pretending to be human and those kinds of people can't be trusted...WTF?!). Maybe if Susan and Lucy had more of a role, then I wouldn't complain.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:Absolutely nothing.While no where near as creepy as Uncle Andrew towards Polly in The Magician's Nephew, the White Witch does act pretty cozy to Edmund.There is an epic battle; a major character dies.Overall:While enjoyable to read, I did find myself growing bored, irritated, or embarrassed while reading this book. I would have preferred a book less overt about its theme and message, and one that spent more time building characters and making them important. However, this book does ignite a spark of imagination and creativity, and I think children would enjoy it worlds more than a jaded adult like me.Brought to you by:*C.S.

During World War II, four siblings are sent from London to a house in the country, where they are drawn into a magical world ruled by an evil witch.Here, Lewis introduces the reader to a charming fantasy world populated with creatures drawn from Norse and Greek mythology. This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia.

Lewis wrote this volume first, in 1950, but he later said that The Magician's Nephew, written in 1955, should be considered the first book in his seven book Narnia series. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe occurs when the main character of The Magician's Nephew is an old man, a very wise professor, who lives in a very large house.Four children, siblings, two brothers and two sisters, are sent out of London to the professor's house in the countryside to escape the bombs dropped by the German air force during World War II. They discover a wardrobe that turns out to be a portal leading to the magical land of Narnia.Narnia is under the control of a wicked witch who is a descendant of Adam and the demon Lilith. She has covered all of Narnia with cold weather and snow, with no Christmas for a hundred years. Aslan the lion, the God figure, the creator of Narnia, has been absent from Narnia ever since the wicked witch took control. The citizens of Narnia look forward to his return to save them from the evil. This reminds readers of the popular idea that a messiah will come and help create an ideal world.There is a prophecy in Narnia that if four humans come to Narnia, two males and two females, Aslan will return. The four siblings are present; however, one of the two boys has been seduced by the witch. Nevertheless, the prophecy begins to be fulfilled, Father Christmas appears. He gives everyone gifts. He gives the three children instruments of war.How they fought? What did the lion do? What happened to the witch? What happened to the fourth child? Did all four children return home? These are questions that the rest of the book answers."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This allegorical book, supposedly aimed at children, provided Mr. Lewis with a wonderful medium to deliver a Christian message to readers of all ages. He casts the perennial contest between good and evil as a secret adventure of four displaced children in a land frozen under the control of a wily wicked witchy ruler. While good prevails, it does not come without struggle and sacrifice. Along the way the Lion of Judah acquires a new name and important lessons of loyalty and courage are learned.I really like books that are inspiring, thought-provoking, and fun. It makes me wonder what is in the back of all my closets! This book makes a great gift for young people that they will treasure throughout life. Another Christian fantasy book I like, aimed at a somewhat older audience, isARROWS THROUGH TIME: A Time Travel Tale of Adventure, Courage, and Faith."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"For those of you who are unfamiliar with C. S. Lewis's works and stances on life and faith, I suggest you check out Mere Christianity, which is perhaps the best book ever written on the fundamentals of Christianity. Narnia is also one of the greatest Fantasy series to tackle faith, as it is filled with Biblical symbolisms. Lewis noted that kids often picked up on the symbolisms more than adults, so we gotta show those youngsters that we can still think creativelyStory overview:---------------Peter (13), Susan (12), Edmund (10) and Lucy (8), are evacuated from London to escape the effects of WW2. They go to the home of Professor Digory Kirke, who owns a huge country house and lives with his housekeeper, Mrs MacReady.Lucy discovers that a mysterious wardrobe is actually a portal to another world called Narnia. She meets a talking faun named Tumnus and learns of the White Witch, who made it always winter but never Christmas. No one believes Lucy on her return, but one day Edmund and her end up in Narnia after hiding in the wardrobe while playing hide-and-seek. Edmund is deceived by the White Witch and betrays his siblings once they all find their way to the world of Narnia.Meeting up with the Beaver family, the children learn about the fate of Tumnus and the goings on in Narnia. They find out about a prophecy and Aslan (The Great Lion), who is said to be on the move. They eventually meet up with him, and when Edmund is rescued, the White Witch demands his return. According to the ancient law (the \\"Deep magic\\") she has the right to do so, but instead of handing over Edmund, Aslan takes his place to die for the boy's guilt. This isn't the end of the Great Lion, as a final battle takes place and the prophecy is fulfilled.My thoughts:-------------When I was little, my mother read me this story and I absolutely loved it. Unlike some of the other books my mother had read, I still like this one as much today as I did back then. Ironically, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is one of the books in this series I liked the least, but it still marks the beginning of a wonderful magical world, and a journey that every kid should experience.

There are many reasons why you should buy the book itself. The plot is rich and full of details (however if you read The Magician's Nephew first, much of the plot will be spoiled). The illustrations are absolutely wonderful. Also (though this is a reason why you should buy the 1950 one), having it in hardcover and textured really holds the book together, so you can expect to get many years out of it, if it has already lasted 59. This is the order in which you should read the books: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and his Boy, The Magician's Newphew, and the Last Battle.

The main characters of Narnia are Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund. The author is C.S. Lewis. C.S. Lewis was very descriptive in describing the characters which made them believable. For example, when the author described the kids being scared of the beavers. The beavers seamed real.My favorite part of the book is when Edmund went into the witch's castle. I liked this scene because it was very spooky. It was spooky because there was a lion that appeared to be real but was really made of stone. Then Edmund saw a wolf which he thought was stone but was in fact real. I rate this book 9 out of 10."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"C. S.

This is great to take on a trip, to listen while in the car. You are never too old to hear it again and again. Michael York is fantastic as the reader for the audio. He really brings the story to life in a very real way."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"*****I was happy to hold a hardcover with Pauline Baynes' illustrations.

If you have some free time and want adventure, this book is great and will satisfy your need."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) is a children's fantasy novel, the first and best-known in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. During World War II, four siblings are sent from London to a house in the country, where they are drawn into a magical world ruled by an evil witch.Here, Lewis introduces the reader to a charming fantasy world populated with creatures drawn from Norse and Greek mythology. This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia. Yes, The Magician's Nephew comes first chronologically, but it is here that Lewis makes his introductions."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"During the German blitz of London in WWII, four siblings are sent to the English countryside for safekeeping by an eccentric professor and his stodgy servants. Left with nothing to do besides play and get into trouble, Lucy, the youngest, gets into a wardrobe and finds a passageway to the magical world of Narnia. It is there that she meets a certain Mr. Tumnus, a nice enough chap who just happens to be a \\"Faun\\", or what I would call a satyr. At first Tumnus seems to be very friendly and invites Lucy back to his home for tea. It is there that he reveals that he is supposed to capture any humans he finds and report them to the White Witch, the self-appointed ruler of Narnia who has entrapped the land in endless winter. When he goes against the Witch's orders he is taken prisoner and taken to her castle. Lucy, along with Susan, Peter, and Edmund, set out to rescue the Faun, and in the process becomes agents of prophecy who may have the power to overthrow the wicked White Witch. They're not alone. Aslan, the god-like lion that created Narnia, has also returned to lead the fight against the black magic that threatens to extinguish all goodness. But the kids never counted on one of their own blood turning against them.Since they came out around the same time and the two authors were such good friends, one cannot help but compare the Narnia books to the Lord of the Rings sequence. And let me tell you, Lewis's work seems pale in comparison to Tolkien's. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe never quite makes it to epic status. There are too few characters, the world seems landlocked and hyperfocused, and you never get the sense that the book is part of a larger tapestry. Instead of world-building for all eternity, Lewis did just enough to frame his story. Nothing more. Nothing less. I just don't feel that the work has a solid mythology behind it.I also didn't feel very connected to the characters. They all seemed distant, cold, and at times very snobbish, in a way that only the English can be. Instead of warm-blooded real life characters, the four kids were more like anonymous cut-outs from fairy tales. Yes, Edmund was a little backstabber, and Lucy was the curious one, but beyond that, I never got a feel for who these people really were.I will say this. I liked the book ok. It was a nice diversion, but I just never connected fully with it. I definitely do not rate it as a classic. It seemed more like a work produced in the 19th century than the 20th, and perhaps that was Lewis's intention. It just didn't work for me. I will definitely continue to read the series though."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis are great children's books. They are easy to read and interesting. In The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, it starts out with Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter having to go live with their uncle because of the war and air raids from Germany. One day while playing hide and seek in the house, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and finds herself in another world; Narnia. She meets a fawn and becomes friends with him. He warns Lucy of the White Witch warning her of her power. When Lucy returns to her world, her siblings don't believe her but later on all hide in the wardrobe and walk into Narnia. Edmund betrays his siblings and sides with the White Witch, who makes it always winter, but never Christmas. They run around, following Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, trying to hide from the White Witch while trying to meet Aslan, the lion at the Stone Table. Aslan talks to Edmund and settles for him to never betray them again. The queen does not want the children to be in Narnia because of the prophecy that says that four people will take over Narnia and overthrow the queen. There is a battle over Narnia between the children and the Witch. The children win and become the rulers of Narnia.Unlike most books it is interesting from the beginning, and keeps you interested. I usually don't like fantasy fiction books, but this is a good one. There are adventures involved, which can get children into a book. I didn't get the characters mixed up as I usually do in a book. The story is descriptive enough to get a picture in your head but doesn't go on for three pages about the scenery.I read this book when I was in about 6th grade, and honestly I enjoyed it more now as a teenager because I understood more of it. I would not usually pick up a book for fun and read it, but I would recommend this book to readers because it is simple and to the point, and interesting. I have the sequels and may read those to find out what happens next in Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Set early in World War II, four children are evacuated from their home in London, which is being bombed by the German airforce and rockets. They are sent to the country residence of a wise old professor. There Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund find that they have \`fallen on their feet' as the house and its grounds are delightful. Most amazing of all (of all the things they discover, that is), one room contains a wardrobe which may allow entry to a land called Narnia, a land of myth made alive, full of creatures of legend, and ruled by a wicked queen whose magic makes it always winter. The talking beasts have taken sides, fearful or greedy ones like the wolves have turned bad and sided with the witch. But many who seem weaker remain loyal to the memory of before the witch's rule and to the true ruler of Narnia who is Aslan the great lion. And now the coming of the four children sets in motion the fulfilment of an old prophecy which gives hope to the true Narnians, and puts fear into the heart of the witch. If the four children take all four thrones that wait empty in the castle of Cair Paravel, they will become the kings and queens of Narnia, and the witch will be thrown down. So there will be war in Narnia too.How can four children who have escaped from one terror hope to win against a clever and cruel witch of such power? All their courage and all their strength is required, and the help of all are willing to aid them. They will need weapons magical and weapons plain. Even the sheer power of Aslan cannot be used to simply destroy the witch as it becomes clear that the magic by which he made Narnia follows the laws of deep magic, which are part of the nature of Aslan himself. Even he must obey his own nature, which in Narnia governs everything as the laws are a part of the existence of the land itself. Now the witch, for all her cleverness, does not understand magic as well as she imagines, and in her haste to capture and kill Edmund and prevent the prophecy coming true, she makes a bargain of which no-one can see where it will lead except Aslan himself.This was written first of the seven in the Narnia series and overall it is best read first. It is the easiest to read, and a five-year old can understand the story quite well if read out by an adult. It is probably best to read \`Prince Caspian' next in the series as it was written second, and all four children appear in this story. \`The Magician's Nephew' was written sixth in the series, and it explains how Narnia was created, and is a superb story. But none of Peter, Susan, Lucy, or Edmund appear in it as it is before their time. Also, the language in it is somewhat harder than that in \`Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe'.The Narnia books are not allegories, this is the wrong word for them. In an allegory, each character, and often each place, stands for one other thing. The names of these characters almost always give away what they stand for. A good (in fact the best) example of an allegory is \`The Pilgrim's Progress' by John Bunyan, where there are characters called \`Christian' and \`Hope' and \`Mr Worldly Wise', and places names like \`Vanity Fair' and \`The Slough of Despond'. There are many others, the Greek legends, Aesop's Fables, and fairy stories often work like this. Narnia stories are magical, mythical, parallel world stories but not allegory. The characters are living characters in their own right, they do not stand \`one-for-one' as things or symbols. The stories do contain symbols and meanings, but then so do all stories, or they would not be called stories. The other thing you cannot call the characters is metaphors, they live and breath and develop in their own world. All language is metaphorical. The sentence \`I see what you mean', is metaphorical. A blind man can \`see what you mean', it does not take eyes to \`see' meaning. So, what are the Narnia books? They are a \`thought experiment' in a magical world. All stories are thought experiments, or they would not be called stories. The only question is, what type?C.S. Lewis was a Christian, was converted around the age of thirty, and he knew what stories appealed to the non-Christian as well as the Christian. He was exceptionally clever, even for an Oxford don and Cambridge professor. He knew how to appeal to \`hearts and minds'. That is why these stories are so popular, they ring so true. It is easy to be attracted to the goodness of the good characters in them whoever you are and whenever you are in life's journey. The \`good dreams' which the ancient Greeks captured in their myths and legends attracted him, and that is why they reappear here. The things they did not understand well are all overshadowed in the light of a greater myth, the myth of Narnia. What the Greeks saw, in part and broken up, is seen here - brighter and more full of life. More of the good, better woven together. Because we have greater light, it does not mean that they did not do as well as they could with the light they had.It is hard to create really exciting good characters in books, often the bad characters are more exciting--many books of magical tales have dynamic villians and wishy-washy cardboard good guys (it is not so hard to think of some). C. S. Lewis is one of the greats, and the mark of it is that his good characters really are."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I didn't read this book when I was younger, but I enjoyed it very much! I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie and I just fell in love with the characters. It was a pretty quick read and the ending was spectacular. Highly recommended~"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, The Witcha and The WardrobeBy:C.S. LewisReviewed by:R.AjocPeriod: 1The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best book that Clive Staples Lewis has created. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is about Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund in their guardians home because of war in thier homeland. One day as their playing hide and seek, Lucy hides in a giant wardrobe and stumbles into a mysterious land that her friend, Mr. Tumnus calls Narnia. Lucy is very astonished that she has found this new fantasy world inside of her guardian, Professor Kirke. Lucy tries to tell everyone yet no one believes anything that lucy says. Then Edmund, the bratty one in the family happens to also find Narnia, Edmund being the brat that he is tells everyone, and no one believes him. Then all of them go into the wardrobe for the first time and nothing happenes, then tries later thier in the snowy world of Narnia, and they all see Mr. Tumnus, as sneaky Edmund runs off with the white witch. Now the others Lucy, Susan, and Peter must find the White Witch and defeat her with the mighty lion, Aslan.The whole plot of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is to start of the real beggining of The Chronicles of Narnia. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is my favorite book. C.S. Lewis starts off the great fantasy world, Narnia with a great hit. Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe has already been created into a movie. The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is my favorite book because it features many scenes while you read where you can just sink into and get lost in, especially the part during the war.This book is a very good book, although I am not a very big fan of fantasy books but Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best fantasy book I have ever read and probably the one and only best book in the series. This book is special because of the way you feel as you read it, it is as if your actually in the fantasy world of Narnia as your reading, like your running right behind Aslan as you run, or like your on flying on a dragon, such as on Dragon Rider. The Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe is one of the best fantasy books to have hit book shelves.My favorite part of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is during the end when there is a big battle for who will win the land of Narnia The White Witch or Aslan, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. This part took alot of imagination, and it really helps you picture the war in your head. As Aslan revivies from the brutal killing ceremony from The White Witch Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Edmund are surprised to see that Aslan is still alive. This part of the story showed that you can never die, your body may die but your soul lives on. Aslan's role in this part of the story is very strong, you can feel that C.S. Lewis is trying to send you messages in a fantasy book, while your using your imagination and thinking of how the story is going on in your head."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"*The Chronicles of Narnia* is perhaps the best-loved series of all time. It is loved by not just children, but men and women of all ages. I have grown up since I was eleven years old with these beloved stories, and they, along with CS Lewis' other writings that I discovered as an adult, have had an immeasurable impact on my life.Indeed, I feel almost shy about writing a review of any of these books, but I will try to do so. We will start with the first review about the first book, *The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe*. I am going to be reviewing these in publishing order, not chronological order.Most everyone knows the base story. Probably many know it better than their own country's history. Many children are sent into the English countryside to escape the air raids over London by the German *Luftwaffe* during World War II. Among these are four siblings, the Pevensies. They are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They are extremely fortunate to end up in the house of a wealthy Professor.Once at the house, first Lucy, then Edmund, and eventually all four of the children, wind up in the enchanted land of Narnia. Really, (as shall be revealed in later books) it is a completely other dimension/universe from our own. The country of Narnia in this other world is ruled by a tyrant, the White Witch Jadis, who is determined to kill the children to thwart a prophecy that states that when four humans, two boys and two girls, sit on the thrones in the castle of Cair Paravel, it will mean the end of her tyranny and her life.Along the way, many adventures are had, and many lessons are learned. Edmund betrays them, and is repentant later on. He is redeemed from his stain of betrayal by Aslan the Lion, Who leads the children and the Narnians to triumph over the Witch and her forces.The novel is not just an example of superb storytelling, but also of wit, description, and wonderful use of the English language. The subtle jokes and historical references are enjoyable, and lead to the audience actually *thinking* about what they are reading. The descriptions and elegant use of language is absolutely captivating. The audience is transported directly into the story, and can almost see and smell what the characters do, and eat the foods along with them. What I mean by the masterful use of the English language is how Lewis was not overly \\"high-minded\\" in his words and descriptions. He was elegant without seeming snooty. This is not always easy to do, and Lewis did it quite well.All of these ideas are well-known about the book, but there is even more to glean from the work. To be sure, the most important element in the story is the symbolic truth of Christ, and His atoning death on the Cross for our sins via the story of Aslan giving His life in place of Edmund the traitor. Lewis once stated how culture in the West has become too comfortable and familiar with the Scriptures, and thus they have lost much of their impact on us. When we are moved by the story of Aslan dying for Edmund (and rising in the end), or even of any sacrificial character in other stories (whether they rise like Gandalf, or stay dead), it is really the truth of the Scriptures touching our hearts.There are many other areas that I could examine, but I will focus on one more that I think reviewers do not focus on enough. This area deals with heroism and the modern definition and view (a very *Christian* view), that would have been familiar to Lewis given his studies of literature and various periods of history, including the so-called \\"Dark Ages\\".I do not know for certain what Lewis thought beyond what he has said, and I heartily disdain putting words in an author's mouth. I have always hated that people say what an author thinks, especially if they don't know what the author thinks, or if their statements of the author's intents actually *contradicts* the author's beliefs.The above disclaimer is to serve as a notice that I can not guarantee what I am venturing is correct about CS Lewis' intentions. But I will try to gauge his idea of a hero, because it is important for us to consider how even in this area, the Bible impacted our culture and Lewis' story. In the history of the West and of America in particular, there is a falsehood that many erroneously believe. This is that the culture we all embrace comes from the Greco-Roman heritage of the West. This is pure bunk. To be sure, the love of learning and the importance of the Law were gleaned from the Greco-Roman history, but the moral and philosophical underpinnings that have made the West more vibrant, and more ready to use knowledge to better ourselves and others, than any other civilization in history are the result of the Christian Faith.What this has to do with the idea of heroism is that the gods and heroes in Greek mythology were vile and cruel creatures. They were murderous and petty, and took obscene delight in hurting and torturing people. The idea of the hero as the strongest one who exerts his will on others is the Greco-Roman idea of the hero. The idea was changed and altered as Christianity became the dominant force in the West.Really, the early concept embraced by the Church is identical, except that the obvious change had started in the morality of the hero. The hero was called on to do good in honor of God. This was due to the Church taking the knightly orders under it's control, in order to put an end to indiscriminate killings for \\"glory\\" that many of the supposed \\"heroes\\" pursued.Eventually, a Reformation and Enlightenment came and went, and the \\"hero\\" changed. Now the hero was expected to act as the Lord Jesus Christ acted. Sacrifice for the sake of others is what marks a true hero. This is what is special about Aslan the Lion, and even Edmund as well. Aslan sacrifices his life for Edmund, and via the prophecy, *all of Narnia itself*. Edmund sacrifices himself to save his fellow Narnians and his family when he destroys the Witch's wand, leaving himself open to attack.This sacrificial hero is important to our history, and it is one we are fast losing. Lewis has helped us to revive this great ideal and this great Truth. Indeed, many other concepts and Truths are buried in LWW, as in they are in the rest of the Narnia books. For helping to teach, and ingrain them in the minds of many men and women for nearly sixty years, we owe a massive debt to Lewis.This book inaugurates a series that has many \\"hidden\\" nuggets of wisdom and moral ideals that we would all do well to notice and embrace. It is also a frollicking good story. Please pick up this book and the others, you will *NOT* regret it.Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite books. When I was a child, I enjoyed it for the action and story, but as I got older, really started to grasp between the lines. CS Lewis is definitely an amazing author and his entire Narnia set is a classic and a must for anyone's collection."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Out of all the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" books, the first published is also one of the strongest of the series; The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.This is a fantasy book, about a land called Narnia, where all sorts of imaginary creatures live; mythological creatures, magical beasts, talking animals and so forth. Four children enter it through a magical door in a wardrobe, and are soon drawn into a sort of power play between the supernatural lion Aslan, and the White Witch Jadis, who's been claiming the right to rule Narnia for many years; turning dissenters to stone. By the numbers, it's clear that Aslan is more powerful, but the Witch is clever, and knows many tricks. It's the type of story we've heard a number of times before, and if you don't care for allegory, you can skip to the last two paragraphs now.In the past, I've said that Narnia is mainly more protestant than Catholic, but I may need to re-evaluate that, because the symbolism in this book is positively sacramental in nature at many points. When mice nibble ropes off of Aslan as he lies on a stone table, there's a eucharistic image to be seen there, of eating the body of Christ on an altar (since Aslan is clearly Jesus in lion form.) On top of this, the sacrament of confession is nearly mentioned. After being rescued, Edmund spends time talking to Aslan in private, and afterwards, everyone is told that there's no need to \\"talk about what is past.\\" A discussion with the savior in a private place, and the forgiveness of sins? What else could it be, but reconciliation?I also think it's interesting that the oldest boy, and the one who's clearly the group's leader, is named Peter. This aspect of the bible; the primacy of Saint Peter among the apostles, is only rarely admitted outside of the Catholic Church, and their king and queenship would seem to be an allegory for both heaven, and the church.Apart from this, the book's storyline seems to be a clear allegory of the passion and death of Our Lord, with Aslan as Jesus, and the White Witch standing in for Satan. Lucy and Susan are the holy women. Still, some of the roles aren't as easy to fit in as all that. Edmund seems to have aspects of both Saint Peter (betraying and being forgiven) and Judas (selling people out for a promised reward.) However, neither role is really precise, which may be for the best. It gives the story a flavor of originality, which it might not have had otherwise.In particular, this book's main premise; of a \\"Deep Magic,\\" which even Aslan must never break is perhaps the clearest allegory of all; representing something that most modern people want to ignore; Natural Law. Too many people want to just wander off and do their own thing, and forget that even if the law allows them to do certain things, the natural law, and the final judge are still there, and they can still run afowl of them. Even God's will for our salvation only has so much leeway when it comes to transgressions of the natural law, and that's one thing that Lewis gets absolutely right.However, there's also one point near the very end, where I sort of winced as well. It's a few pages into the last chapter, when everyone is seated on thrones. Aslan uses the words \\"Once a king or queen of Narnia, always a king or queen.\\"Not only does this prove to be false later in the series, but the phrase itself sounds dangerously like \\"once saved, always saved,\\" a belief held by many protestant denominations, but not by the Catholic Church. Still, it would have been worse if it had got beyond just being a simple phrase.As a book of fiction, it's entertaining, but more if you know your myths. It's good for children, and unlike most books in the series, has a strong, frightening villain, with a major role in the plot, which only makes the rest of the story that much more exciting. It has some weak points with respect to pure storytelling style, but not much more so than most children's books.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe may be the best fictional storybook out there for Christian children. It's fun, exciting and packed with the sentiments of the faith. I highly reccomend it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This book is very fascinating.

Also people who like mysterious action movies would also like this book because it keeps you on your toes and there are wars and many conflicts. I would definitely recommend this book for other readers."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"My wife and I started reading to my daughter when she was still a baby, and have made that a common practice throughout each of her first five years. This is the first \\"real book\\" -- i.e., a book that couldn't be read easily in one sitting -- that my daughter and I have shared. It was a really great first.I never read The Chronicles of Narnia as a child, nor had them read to me. While the first few chapters held my daughter's attention, I wasn't exactly impressed. I thought the writing was a bit clumsy, a little too heavy on 1940s British vernacular. I also thought the characters -- the children at this point -- were poorly developed. However, once the kids are in Narnia \\"for good,\\" the entire tone of the book changes, as does the writing quality. Particularly, the scenes near the end are very well-written, exciting, and evoke a lot of emotion. My daughter would always want two chapters before bedtime, and as the book drew to a close, I'd want to read her a third or fourth!We are now reading Prince Caspian, which I'm told is really the second book in the series (although the books have been reordered after the fact, so that even The Lion, The Witch and, the Wardrobe is no longer Book 1), and we plan to go through the whole series. Many people consider the Chronicles series to be some of the greatest books ever written -- adults, I'm talking about. I don't think I agree with that at all, as I don't think I'd really care to read them on my own. However, as an experience to share with my daughter, the books are excellent: Good enough, rich enough with symbolism to keep my attention and interest, and magical enough to keep her excited and wanting to read."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I adore these books.

All in all its a good read and a classic that nobody should ever miss out on."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The four Pevensie orphans Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are evacuated to the enormous country house of Professor Kirke. When Lucy, during a game of hide and seek, finds a big wardrobe in an empty room, she decides to use it as her hiding place. To her big surprise she notices behind the fur coats at the back of the closet a spot of white snow. The world behind the wardrobe turns out to be the wonderfully strange world of Narnia. At first her friends do not believe what she has discovered, but it won't take long before the others are face to face with the faun, Mr. Tumnus, the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a real treat for anyone who likes simple, but not less exciting fantasy. The power behind this book is that it brings the story without too much need to moralize. There is certainly some moral lesson behind what is happening, certainly when considering the actions of Edmund, but it never reaches the level of the Victorian Alice in Wonderland or the Wizard of Oz. Of course this book dates from the 50's and is written in an era that differs much from Victorian times, still it strongly reverbs the explorative nature of those times. The colorful characters are brought to life in a dreamlike setting that is bursting of opportunities for the six sequels that will follow this book. The humor is omnipresent, but certainly is at its best when the narrator intervenes with his commentary. Again a wink to Victorian novels. If you want to be engulfed in a wonderful and not too complex world, then The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a good start."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Ok so I'm one of those people that saw the movie first.

This is the main reason I just couldn't stick with it.My reason for 4 stars and not less, it was a great movie and it takes a great book to make a great movie. I'd suggest this to all readers, it's fast and was fairly easy to read. But don't watch the movie first."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I had no idea this was a prequel to a series until my senior year of high school. One of these days I'll have the time to read the rest of them, but I read this one in high school, being familiar with the 1979 cartoon version.This was a fantastic book written in a colorful way. It doesn't have illustrations and doesn't need them. Those with good imaginations can easily picture the world of Narnia and get a real feel for all the wonderful characters inside."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I put the series in my TBR pile when it dawned on me that I'd never read them. My kids have, and I'd read this one aloud to them several times, but it seemed like a cultural thing I was missing out on, so in they went. The Lemony Snicket books are in there, too.I have no idea what to say about The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe that hasn't been said. I don't even know how I feel about it, because the story's so very familiar. There's the heavy-handed Christian allegory, I suppose, which doesn't take much to uncover. And there's really not a lot of depth to it, nor are the characters all that well-developed.But it is, after all, a children's story, a fast-moving tale of adventure and imagination, and Good vs. Evil. Hopefully, I'll have more to say on the subsequent books, which are new to me.One aside: reading this always brings to mind my daughter's kindergarten best friend, who maintained that she did have a doorway to Narnia in her bedroom closet. This frustrated my realist daughter no end, because she couldn't convince her friend that it was just a story."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Few reading experiences are richer and more delightful than taking another trip into Narnia, especially when doing so via the mysterious wardrobe. C.S. Lewis's enchanting fairy tale is warm, beautiful, and inspiring with every read. I have personally read it four times in my adult life. (I never read it as a child.) And I could probably read it at least forty more times.In this story Lewis enables the reader to step into the shoes of Peter, Edmund, Susan, or Lucy -- whichever character you find is most like you, or whichever one has the tightest grip on you. Things like childhood fancy and fun, sibling rivalry, betrayal, sacrifice, and redemption all play crucial roles in this tale. And it's presented in such a way that a child and adult alike can both learn and understand.Many readers intrigued by the Gospel allegory the book is so famous for will not be disappointed. But many may be disappointed by the allusion to Adam having a wife before Eve named Lilith. This may be a turn-off to some, and I will not defend Mr. Lewis in this area. But I will say that it is a story and should never take the place of the Word of God. Parents and educators would do well to keep this in mind should the matter come up.In other words, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is not a book about theology or a commentary on the Bible. But it is a fantastic example of what happens when the major themes of the Scriptures are mixed with classic fairy-tale telling and quality children's literature."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of four children that stumble into a wardrobe... the magical door to another world.

After good conquers evil they grow up there and become kings and queens of the land until one day they stumble back into the magic wardrobe to find themselves back on the same day they left many years before.

It is an excellent read for young ones as well as adults. There's plenty of epic adventure, with a storyline of no dull moments.

There were also funny scenes that any audience can appreciate. This was a very good book."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is one of the very few books I can truly say I will read over again. It is very well written, never short of any details, and I couldn't wait to see what happened each time. It kept my interest throughout the enitre book.It is quite easy to imagine Aslan, the four children, the beavers, the white witch, and all the characters. And each character has a distinct personality. You learn to adore Lucy and Susan, and you learn how brave Peter is, and you can't help but to dislike Edmund. And I kind of wish Edmund wouldn't have gone to the witch, but every detail of the book is important. There is a lesson to be learned about sacrifice, understanding, and love. Aslan is the forefront of those lessons in this book.In my opinion, the book was written perfectly. It got all kinds of feelings and emotions from me. I do recommend this book for yourself and your young reader.And if you haven't seen the movie yet, definitely read the book first.Thanks."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I never encountered Lewis's books as a child in the 50s and was glad to be spurred to read this one recently for a children's book discussion group. I was a little disappointed with it, after hearing about it for so many years. The language isn't great, and the boy/girl roles seemed so conventional--dated anyway. One scene in the book is fantastic, however; it's the one of Aslan's crucifixion and resurrection, metaphorically disguised.Take Me With You When You Go"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is a wonderful novel. CS Lewis tells a tale of love and redemption in the land of Narnia. The four Pevensie children wander through a wardrobe into the winterland of Narnia, and discover that the curse of the Witch has made for perpetual winter. And younger brother Edmund is seduced by the power of the witch.But the Pevensie children, along with their faithful friends, turn to Aslan, Lord of the Wood for help. Aslan ends up dying for Edmund's sin of betrayal, but he comes back to life to conquer the evil witch and her army.For the most part, if you've seen the film, you'll see that it did a pretty good job of following the novel, with a few exceptions. It is an allegory of the redemption Christ won for us on the cross and of his victory over Satan, the witch of this world.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"C.S. Lewis writes an inspiring tale of four young children who stumble upon a wardrobe that leads to a magical land called Narnia. Lucy, the youngest, is the first to find Narnia, and while she is there, she befriends a fawn named Thomas. Thomas tells her of the evil ice queen who cast a horrible spell that made it constantly winter without Christmas in Narnia until two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam arrive to save the land. Complications arise when Edmund is bribed and betrayed by the evil ice queen who promises that he will become prince if he gives the location of his other siblings. The other three young children and eventually Edmund decide to help Narnia, and they begin a dangerous yet exciting fight against the evil ice queen. The story is filled with memorable and inspiring characters especially Aslan, the true and righteous ruler of Narnia. The novel is incredibly moving, and C.S. Lewis delivers a meaningful message to his readers. It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and I recommend that everyone read this beautiful story."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeBy:C. S. LewisReviewed by:M. LinPeriod:P. 6The eternal winter of Narnia, set by the witch, abruptly stops when Aslan the lion returns to aid it. In order to return the season of spring, two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve must be crowned the kings and queens of Narnia at the Cair Paravel of the 4 thrones. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, the 4 brothers and sisters must leave their home in London to escape the air-raids of war. Brought to a mysteriously large mansion, the children wander throught it finding an enormous wardrobe in which they enter to find a lamp post in the middle of the frozen Narnia. Lucy befriends a faun named Mr. Tumnus who saves Lucy's life, but is captured by the Queen. Edmund betrays the party when the witch offers him sweets and tells all his secrets that could endanger his family. Discovering the truth that the witch is not the true queen of Narnia, the children try to find Aslan and be taken to the throne to become the kings and queens. Aslan later saves Edmund ,but the witch claims that according to the \\"Deep Magic,\\" every traitor belongs to her and everything that belongs to her, she has a right to kill. Aslan sacrifices himself to save Edmund and is brought back to life according to the \\"Deeper Magic,\\" saying that if someone else is killed in place of a traitor,he is brought back. The witch is defeated by Aslan and the children grow up as Kings and queens of Narnia. When they return to the lamp post, the find their way back through the wardrobe and return to the mansion as children again.What I liked about the book was that it was creative and full of hooks that pull you in. Narnia is locked up in winter, but the story is so intriguing that it pulls you all the way to the key. You journy with Aslan. \\"Peter held the door closed but did not shut it; for he remembered as every sensible person does, that you should never never shut yourself up in a wardrobe.\\" The book keeps on repeating this line in the begining and even though it isn't very important, it somehow hooks you in and then you really start enjoying what happens in Narnia and how it makes you want to be in the adventure with them. The land is magical in the human world as it is in Narnia because it had the wardrobe in it and it seem as though something magical was driveing the children into Narnia.Lucy is my favorite character because she is pure and innocent. She plays fair and is always honest and when Mr.Tumnus was captured, she tried her best to try to help him because he saved her life. \\"We can't just go home, not after this. It is on my account that the poor Faun has got into this trouble...We simply must rescue him.\\" All of this showed Lucy's kind nature and caring heart.My favorite part of the book is when the four children are at the Beaver's house/dam to eat dinner. The description of the food makes my mouth water. I love the food and it always makes me hungry. The author does a long description of the dinner and how it smells, taste, and what they eat. Potatoes, fish, bread, and butter just made me feel weak and the loving detail didn't help. It isn't a very important part but it was my favorite part out of the book."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I grew up reading The Chronicles of Narnia and these books are a part of who I am.

They are fascinated with the mansion that they move in to, and decide to do some exploring inside. In one of the rooms, they notice an old Wardrobe, and everyone except Lucy move on to the other rooms. Lucy, being most inquisitive, decides to open the wardrobe and step inside, not knowing that she is entering another world. Seeing all the wonderment of the mew world and meeting a new friend, she comes back to tell the others. Initially, they don't believe her, but once day, they all enter the wardrobe and into the World of Narnia. However, Mr. Tumnus, Lucy's friend has been made a prisoner by the evil witch of Narnia and it is up to the children to save Mr. Tumnus and make the land a happy place again.This was a delightful book to read. The simple language will make both adults and children enjoy the story.

It is a fantasy book about two brothers and two sisters who find another world call Narnia through the back of their wardrobe.Edmund, one of the children, is an evil and greedy character. Peter is a brave and courageous boy. Susan is also brave. Lucy is the main character. She does cry a lot but is also courageous.The main characters of Narnia are Aslan, the King of Narnia, who is also a lion, the White Witch of Narnia who thinks she is the Queen of Narnia, and Maugrim, the White Witch's secret, chief of police. Mr. Tumnus, the fawn, helps the good characters on their journey.The beginning of the book takes place in the home of the children.

The fight is to get Narnia back from the evil, White Witch.Aslan was banished from Narnia by the White Witch. He comes back to Narnia to get his rightful place and meets the children. Together they fight the Witch.If you like fantasy stories and books that have a lot of description and similes, I think you should read \\"The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe\\".

My son, not quite five years old, listened to the story of how Aslan the Lion allowed himself to be killed in the place of others and then rose from the dead. I then asked him, 'Who else did that?' My son then smiled and said, quite of his own accord, 'Jesus.' That is the power and the value of C.S. Lewis's storytelling.

This magical world led them to many adventures in a magical place called Narnia. I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in less than 1 week and that was the fastest i read a book because it was so interesting and captivating. This is now 1 of my favorite books. I recommend that others read this book and like it as i did to. I enjoyed reading this because it was so captivating. My favorite character is Aslan. Aslan is very courageous, and caring to others. My second favorite character is Lucy. Lucy was the first to enter Narnia. At the end, Lucy was named something very special. My least favorite character is the White Witch. She was my least favrite because she is evil. She also turned things to stone. She was truly an evil witch. My second least favorite character is Edmund, at the beginning. He lied and could have gotten his brother and sisters killed.Edmund became a better person in the end. My favorite part was when Aslan's army were battling the White Witch's army. I also liked when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were given a special position in Narnia My least favorite part was when Edmund entered the wardrobe. When he entered Narnia he met the White Witch. Edmund decided to betray his brother and sisters and take them to the White Witch. Then when he got out of Narnia he lied and said he had never been there. I enjoyed The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I would recommend it to anyone who has an imagination. I liked it because it had vivid details and it was imaginative. It was also full of great characters kids can relate to. Since the characters were kids our age and the setting was an imaginary place it made it more fun to read.

When Lucy and Edmund came out of Narnia, Lucy told Edmund to tell the others about Narnia, but he said that Lucy was making it up. So, Lucy gets mad at him. One day a lady came to the house to show people the huge house. When the kids hide from the lady they hide in the wardrobe and then walk into the land of Narnia.

While the kids were looking for him they went to the stone table and meet Aslan (the lion). When Aslan came everything turned into spring. Then Aslan helped the kids find Edmund and get him back from the Witch. But in order to do that Aslan had to sacrifice his life and the Witch kills him. But Aslan came back to life and let out a big ROAR! Lucy and Susan hopped on his back and road all the way back to town.

The authors name is C.S. Lewis. I give it 4 stars.I gave it this amount of stars because the book is packed with very many details such as: Aslan was a big lion with a large gold main and huge paws. I also enjoyed how Aslan was raised from the dead and the stone table breaks. That is just like the bible. Aslan was sacrificed to save Edmond and Jesus died to save everyone. They were both then raised from the dead. They conquered the bad guy and good prevailed. They then went away. It really had me on the edge of my seat when the White Witch took over Edmond and tried to kill all of the other \\"Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve\\". She also turned all of the people or animals that crossed her into stone. She thought that she was the queen of Narnia but she was really and evil dictator that wanted to take over Narnia.My favorite part of the book is the battle. I thought it was very cool how Susan (one of the four kids, Peter, Edmond, Susan, and Lucy) shot an arrow at a pheonix and it lit on fire and made a wall of fire to prevent the Witch from getting to them. It really stunned me that the polar bears swung their heads and it took out the entire wall of fire! Then Aslan showed up with an entire new part of their army. They went to the witches house and \\"destoned\\" them all. In the end....I would also recommend any other books writen by this author because he is an amazing writer.

But what the children didn't know is that there were many adventures ahead of them to be explored in this white winter land.As I read this book, it kept my interest because the writing is fluent and intriguing. The book includes vivid verbs such as, vanishing, stooped, and swish. As well, C. S. Lewis uses great adjectives, like filthy, sulkily, and dreadful. C.S. writes so descriptively that it paints a picture in your mind. The book is also packed with excitement and adventure. There are suspenseful parts where you just can't put down the book. There are battles, there are creatures being turned into stones, and there are kidnappings.Over all, this is a very intriguing book that keeps you involved in exhilarating adventure.

When Lucy comes out however, she tells her siblings what had happened, but no time has gone by. At first no one believes her, but Edmund decides to go check the wardrobe anyways. When Edmund gets into the land of Narnia he meets the White Witch and she gives him magical Turkish delight that makes him want more and more. The queen promises that if he brings his other siblings then he will get as much Turkish delight he desires. After many times not believing Lucy the siblings decide to try to look in the wardrobe again. This time on the other hand, the land of Narnia is there! They all decide to go to Mr. Tumnus, the fawn's house. When they reach his house they find out that he was captured and thrown in jail for fraternizing with humans (Lucy). After they get out of the house the children see a little beaver and it tells them to follow him. The beaver ends up bringing them to a small dam. The beaver then tells the children the story about The White Witch and Narnia. Before the story of Narnia and The White Witch was over, Edmund had already gone to The White Witch's house and told her the story about Azlan coming back. When the other siblings find out that Edmund is gone, they realized that he must have betrayed them and they left the dam with the Beavers. The Beavers found out that Azlan is already in Narnia and he is waiting for Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy at the Stone Table. When they reach the Stone Table they see Azlan, but they went without Edmund. Azlan then told the children that the prophecy could not be fulfilled unless they had Edmund too. So, the children and Azlan's army go to where they were holding Edmund and freed him. After Edmund realized what he has done he is back on the good side. Then the children and Azlan's army prepared for one of the fiercest battles ever. Then Azlan called his army and he started one of the greatest wars ever. In the end, Azlan won and The White Witch was killed. Then Edmund, Peter, Lucy, and Susan all became queens and kings of Narnia.I liked this book because of many things. One reason that made me like this book is that C.S. Lewis has a magical ability to give you a marvelous description of what is happening and where the characters are. There is one sentence that I really thought made me feel as if I was one of the characters and I was actually there and that is, \\"And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry) you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.\\" That really made me picture a thought of a beaver dam with a marvelous food fragrance coming out of a small chimney. I also enjoyed the book because C.S. Lewis just knows how to hook you into the book.My favorite part of the book was when the kids were in the Beavers' house. This was my favorite part of the story because C.S. Lewis gives a description about the food that the Beavers' had prepared for dinner. When C.S. Lewis wrote about fish I just wanted to get my hands on some fish. Usually I do not like fish, but C.S. Lewis' description made it sound very tasty and mouth-watering."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is a timeless, priceless tale that I love with all my heart. I like how it has caritors you love and carictors you know are very, very evil. It also takes something from the bibal. There is a scene where the lion is torched so that he can take a sin from a young boy. He of course comes back. There are of course other scene I would love to tell you all about but that would ruin the story. so I tell you go and read it because this is one of the best books I have ever read.[and I'm really not kidding.] So what are you waiting for GO AND READ!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Four children are sent to live away from home during a war, and stumble upon much more than they had anticipated.While playing a game of hide-and-seek, the youngest girl, Lucy, hides in a wardrobe. What seems like the perfect hiding place eventually turns into a wonderful, mythical land filled with all sorts of strange beasts and talking animals. There are centaurs, giants, and fauns; some animals I can't even really imagine.Upon her return from the fantasy world, nobody believes her story. In fact, nobody noticed she was gone. In the alternate world of Narnia, time is not related to time as we know it.Eventually, her brother Edmund (who I hated from nearly the first mention of his name) follows her through the wardrobe. The plot thickens when Ed meets up with the White Witch. She befriends him because of her fear for a prophecy that four children of Adam and Eve leading to her downfall.From there, the story seamlessly follows the four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, as they travel through Narnia. They learn that Lucy's friend, a faun named Mr. Tumnus, has been taken captive by the White Witch. While Lucy feels compelled to help, the others are not all that interested; except Edmund, who is interested because of the pact he made with the White Witch to deliver all four children to her castle.Edmund betrays his family and goes the Witch. What follows is an epic tale of the struggle between good and evil, ubiquitous Christian allegory, and the inevitable happy ending.There are shocks, surprises, twists, and laughs. Perhaps the most important aspect of the story is the great leader Aslan, who is pure, and represents all that is wonderful (a not-so-subtle representation of Jesus). It's not overbearing as some would assume, but it's definitely there. Aslan teaches, nurtures, chastises, and leads. He gives selflessly, and fights for all that is pure and just.The story is easy to read, allowing the reader to imagine, to become involved with the story. You'll immediately love certain characters and take sides.I highly recommend this book to fans of fiction, and anyone who wants to read a great story. It's a wonderful book that transcends age and genre."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"When we read this in for our Book Group it was difficult to find a good list of discussion questions. Here is the list I compiled from questions I found on the internet. I hope this helps your book group!1) Many of Narnia's fantastical creatures are personified; name some of them. Which human qualities are most celebrated? Which are not?2) Elements of fantasy and real life are intermingled in the worlds of Narnia and \\"reality\\". What makes these worlds different from each other?3) Although they are children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy have very distinct personalities. By portraying them the way he did, what messages might Lewis have been sending to children about human behavior.4) Each of the children undergoes some changes throughout the course of the novel. Discuss how these changes impact their characters.5) Symbolism is quite prevalent in this book. Discuss what Narnia and Aslan symbolize and how their portrayals shape Lewis's message. Who or what else is symbolic? How?6) In agreeing to sacrifice himself in Edmund's place without divulging to the White Witch theat he could return, Aslan might be considered somewhat deceitful. What other variances are there on the traditional definitions of good and evil?10) Aslan sternly reminds Peter to cleand his sword after he kills Maugrim. Why was cleaning his sword so important?7) When Lucy tries to minister to her wounded brother, Aslan hurries her along to tend to others. Does the theme of the greater food vs. the individual arise elsewhere in the story? What other themes arise?8) The Pevensie children leave London during World War II because the city they live in is being bombed. Yet Narnia they fought in a war. Do you find this ironic? -Talk about this.11) In Chapter 10 the children meet Father Christmas. How is he like the traditional image of Santa Clause? How is he different? What does he seem to represent?9) Notice the titles of Mr. Timnus' books. Do any of them strike you as strange or humorous? Why?12) The children are each given a gift by Father Christmas. Whose gift would you most like to have? Which do you think is most useful? Elaborate.13) In Chapter 7 the children hear about Aslan for the first time. Describe how each of them feels when they first hear about him. Why do you suppose they react so differently?14) Some readers think that there are parallels to the liberation of the stone statues in Chapter 16. They point to passages like Matt. 27: 52-54; Eph. 4:7-10. Do you see any similarities?15) In Chapter 17 the children (as adults) go after the White Stag. What do you think it represents in the story?16) Do you think it's an accident that the children return to England when they do? Why, or why not?17) Discuss the relationship of time in Narnia to the time in the children's world. How does it work for the children to grow into adults in Narnia, then returned to children in England?18) In the beginning the children have trouble with Lucy's claims that she has been to Narnia. What does the Professor say about this? How does he apply logic to this situation?19) Throughout the book there is a paradox about Aslan, which the Beavers describe as \\"good and terrible\\". Compare what they say about Aslan with what is said about God in the Bible.20) Aslan tells Mr. Beaver (p.137) \\"All names will soon be restored to their proper owners. In the meantime we will not dispute about noises. Speculate on what he might mean by this.21) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, was written as a children's book. Do you think we, as adults, have something to gain from reading it as well?"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The \\"see inside this book\\" is not accurate at all!

I am sending it back."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"So that's the main point. Yes, Aslan is Jesus. And this book has an agenda. Actually, all of Lewis's books have an agenda. It is a religious agenda, and the story does kind of get bogged down in it. So this book is actually perfect if you yourself are religious and are looking to share it with your kid, but I was not looking for religion and when I found it I was sort of disappointed. Why couldn't Aslan just be Aslan? Why did Lewis have to go and bring Jesus into the picture?That being said, this story is lovely minus all the religious stuff. It tells the story of four children who walk through a wardrobe and find themselves in a fantastical new land, filled with fauns and witches and whispering trees. Aslan, by the way, is the lion who is the mysterious ruler of this place called Narnia. He has not been seen for many years, and subsequently, the evil witch has imposed winter on the Narnians for one hundred years. The story ran through my head nicely, and it was actually a good fantasy book. The metaphor behind it was just slightly disconcerting in its blatantness.If you're an adult and you loved the Chronicles of Narnia, read The Magician by Lev Grossman. It's an adult fantasy, and it is GREAT."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I've read this book two times and it hasn't gotten old at all.

The setting of this book is mainly in an imaginary, magical, fantasy world named as Narnia. But the secondary setting (which is also link to it from reality) is an old house belonged to an old professor, which is in the heart of a country (probably England) fairly close to a railway station and a post office. The main conflict of the book is similar to the classical good-against-bad guy plot, which in this case, is our 4 main characters, a lion, and the forces of justice against the white witch, and her forces of evil. But among the story, there are also emotion, excitement, a slow reveal of the plot that can get any reader going and going, and also a little amount of horror. The protagonists of the story are 4 children: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. And there is also a lion that plays a critical role, Aslan, which is also mentioned in the last book. The antagonist is the white witch, who causes a lot of trouble. The basic outline is that first Lucy discovers Narnia in a wardrobe, meets a friend there (a Faun). Then runs back to reality, but her friends wouldn't believe her, especially Edmund, who was a snide boy, and teased Lucy for who him believed as make-believe. And then Lucy started to feel distress, and then a day afterwards, they played hide-and-seek again. And Lucy ventured into Narnia again through the wardrobe Edmund also went, but gets really evil under taunting of the white-witch. So then afterwards, the 4 all got into Narnia, and they started to discover danger, and they then got into the whole fight by meeting the beavers, which then Edmund betrayed them and joined the white witch, then Aslan came, and fighting occurred between the white witch. And finally Edmund came back to them, and after victory, the 4 of them got crowned, and at the very end, they all returned to reality and that's it. Now if I was to compare this book with another book written by C.S. Lewis (The Magician's Nephew), I would say this book is more vivacious, exciting, and detailed. While the other book is quite similar with it's magical transition into fantasy, significant, positive changes brought by Aslan, fighting, and there's also a witch and children involved. This book is, in a way, quite similar to the movie of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". There are also children, a witch, and magical, and unbelievable companions similar to talking animals in \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\" (such as the iron-man, etc.) In my opinion, the best parts of book was when Lucy first met the Faun, it's vivid description really collaborates with the cover, and when Edmund first met the white witch, as there was a lot of tensity, the beaver's home as it gives a book a warm side, and finally I think the war, as that was kind of like the major blockbuster scene in the novel. This book would absolutely captivate readers that love magic, fantasy, and a bit of fairy-tale conflict and story build-up. And in general, I think anyone, especially children, would love this book, as it was very popular and fancied in the past and even the present."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Although Anthony Z. thought it was only OK, all the other kids in Room 35 who read it gave it 5 stars.

A vast war, a hideous queen, talking animals, a never-ending winter, and a mysterious prophecy. That is what C.S Lewis brings to life in his masterpiece, The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe. He winds all of these supernatural events into one captivating tale, which is absolutely unbelievable.The magic all begins when four young children, Peter, Susan, Lucy, and their mischievous brother Edmund, discover a thrilling new land inside of a wardrobe called Narnia! Yet, the only problem is the White Witch is attempting to take over Narnia, by casting a spell over the entire land, and she plans to kill Aslan (the real king) in the process. It may sound like a short, typical story, but there are many, many more details. For instance, how Lucy meets a friendly faun (half goat, half man) and quickly befriends him. As soon as the other siblings enter the world of Narnia, they learn that the faun was taken captive (along with Edmund, but that appears later on). Oh, and when the children discover some talking beavers, they also discover a mystifying prophecy. And then how the White Witch's wolves (lead by the wolf Maugrim) soon find the beavers and the children, but luckily they do overcome the wolves. And did I mention a harsh, epic battle comes up between the Queen's Minotaurs and trolls, and Aslan's fauns and centaurs? Well, that happens too! Join the four children on their glorious adventure in the world on the other side of the wardrobe.However, sometimes a book's moral is more important than its events, and the moral in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is that if you stay positive, cheerful, and if you forgive those who disobeyed you, you will always succeed. For example, Edmund ran away to the White Witches abode, and she took him captive, yet when he returned his brother and sisters forgave him.All in all, this book was a numinous fairy tale, which has every thing to do with family, loyalty, and absolute excellence. C.S. Lewis did it again, with his work of art, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. But, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was not his only masterpiece. He also wrote more books, all part of the series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia,\\" including The Magician's Nephew, The Horse and His Boy, Prince Caspian, and many more!!Read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and discover the magical land of Narnia!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The lion, the witch, and the wardrobeI'd like to introduce this book to you! I recommend this book because it's easy to read and understand. It's also the best book ever because it's about a magical place called Narnia. Well one day peters, Susan's, Lucy's, and Edmond's dad goes off to war and they are sent to a professor's house. Once they got there they get all settled then they play hide and seek. But Lucy found a wardrobe and went in it. Lucy has just found the magical land called Narnia.Well since you know about the book lets talk about the theme. In this book the theme is pretty much the same. It's magical. It's magical because Lucy finds Narnia in a wardrobe. The witch can make hot coco and Turkish delight with a flick. She can also freeze people. But the lion can unfreeze people with a blow of his breath. Now don't you think that's magical? Well I do.Now let's talk about the characters. First of all you would do the same thing as them. Well Lucy explores Narnia and talks to strange animals. Edmond talks to the witch and takes hot coco and Turkish delight from her. Peter not believing in Narnia but later becomes a king of the magical world. Then you have Susan who becomes a Queen of Narnia, but also helps the lion live. Now wouldn't you have done the same thing as them? Well I would have.Well now let's talk about what Narnia looks like. Well Narnia is a very wintry place. It has a lot of snow and it's very cold. It's also very icy. Well that's because there is a big river between Narnia and Aslam. Aslam is where the lion lives. That place is a very springy place. It's grassy and very warm. And it's very beautiful there just like Narnia.Well that's about it, one more thing though. Over all I hope you enjoy and like this book as much as I did. You feel like your there and it puts a great picture in your mind. This is the best book ever and you will find out why after reading it. Well that's it. So I'm out of here!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Lucy is the first child to go through the wardrobe to Narnia, but the other children(Peter, Edmund, and Susan) are soon to follow. The Narnia they find is locked in winter,under the spell of the White Witch. Edmund is captured, so the children, along withAslan, must save him, and the whole of Narnia. I would recommend this book to anyone.This book, along with the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia series teaches verygood morals (the book was written by a Sunday school teacher). One of the morals itteaches is forgiveness. Peter and the others could have given up on Edmund forbetraying them, but they forgive him. And, the book teaches bravery, as was displayedthroughout the entire book, especially by Aslan.The religion implied in this book is very obvious. In the book, Lewis has madeAslan their god. In the book, Aslan came back to save Narnia, as the Christian \\"god\\" issaid will do. And, Aslan is very powerful, as we might expect a god to be.The Aslan character in this book is very interesting. As stated above, it is obviousthat Lewis has made him the god of Narnia. But, though he rises back, he dies forEdmund, who had betrayed the others.This book is good for anyone looking to read a good fiction. It was very exciting,and kept me reading. Also, many Christians would enjoy reading this book, to see all ofthe religion that is in the book. This was a very good book, along with the rest of theChronicles of Narnia series.-Bill L"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a wonderful, symbolizing story by C.S. Lewis. It deserves five stars with its greatly written story that keeps you turning pages one after another. The book can be classified as a wonderful fiction classic. The story is told by a narrator and without him/her telling the story, then we wouldn't get the full effect of the book that draws us into the characters. Lewisshows enthusiasm even through a narrator. He shows how other universes may exist a little bit closer than we may think.An entire story starts with one simple action: the turn of a wardrobe handle. When Lucy Pevensie opens a wardrobe door all she expects to find is a few hangers with coats, little did she know that she was totally wrong. She finds herself entering the world of Narnia: a world of magic and talking animals. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is set in Narnia; a world where a witch rules over the entire world, making it always winter and never Christmas. This is all because of the White Witch who will rule over Narnia until four children sit in the thrones at Cair Paravel. Most of the story happens because Lucy's brother Edmund betrays the family. Without this betrayal, the whole journey throughout Narnia would have been an easy and quick one. You should definitely read this book, no matter how old you are."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"One day Lucy Pevensie, accidentally, discovers a magic wardrobe-like portal into the magical land of Narnia. She meets a faun named Tumnus who kindly lets Lucy go after he tells her he intended on capturing her and giving her to the White Witch. Lucy then takes Edmund into Narnia with her where she loses Edmund who is put in a trance by the White Witch with magic Turkish delight. It makes him do anything to get another Turkish delight from her so he promises he'll bring his siblings: Peter, Lucy, and Susan to see her. Lucy and Edmund then meet up and leave Narnia. Then one day when the siblings are hiding from the housekeeper all four children enter Narnia together and decide to Tumnuse's house but find that the White Witch has arrested him from Mr. Beaver. They then join with Mr. Beaver to meet Aslan at the Stone Table the next day, but notice Edmund is gone. This is because Edmund has left to warn the White Witch about Aslan and Mr. Beaver's plan. Soon the Witch finds where Susan, Aslan, his followers, Peter, and Lucy are hiding, Aslan warns them in time so they see Aslan get tortured to death and stay with his dead body \`til morning where they see it is gone. Also they find the Stone Table broken in half. Then they see him and know he has risen from the dead. They all then fly to the Witch's castle. Peter's army is exhausted, but Aslan makes quick work of the Witch and Peter and his army finish off the followers of the Witch. Then everyone forgives Edmund and they become kings and Queens of Narnia for years. Finally they promise to return and leave through the wardrobe.One thing I liked about The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is that things are not always going well for the heroes. For instance, until the end Edmund is a follower of the Witch because he ate the Turkish delight. Another example at a point the only two together is Susan and Lucy. Peter took an army with him to go to fight the Witch and again Edmund was with the Witch. Even though he rises from the dead, Susan and Lucy watch Aslan get tortured to death. From this you can tell that the heroes' journey wasn't easy.Another interesting thing about this book was that there were a variety of characters. Like Tumnus the generous villain or the Witch the straight up villain.Edmund plays the good guy gone bad. Peter is the chosen one because he happens to be the oldest and the one Santa Claus gives the mystic sword. Aslan is the god-like character that is immortal never beaten or dead. As you can see there are characters of every kind in this story.I liked the whole setting, Narnia. I thought it was the perfect portrayal of a fantasy like world. You got talking beavers, flying lions, and an ice witch with a wand that turns things into stone and enchanted Turkish delights. Not to mention the way you travel to Narnia is through a magical wardrobe. Sounds as fantasy as it gets to me.Overall I think C.S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia: the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe was a very good book because I like to read books where the impossible happen. This book is definitely impossible in the world we know and reality. I recommend this book to all fantasy readers because you won't know what could happen on the next page."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This book was great and it had a good theme. It made me feel good inside and made me feel like I could relate myself to the story and I could picture myself in the kids positions.

You should read this book and you will see how awesome it is. This book will make you want to read the other Chronicles of Narnia books"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I must admit that the title \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is not what compelled me to read this book. It seemed a bit too childish for me. I am familiar with some of Lewis's other work, but this is my first trip to Narnia. In preparation for the upcoming movie, I decided to make my first visit to Narnia.Four Children staying in a mostly empty house can give rise to numerous potential adventures. When a passage in a wardrobe closet leads to another world, a strange adventure is available to the children. Narnia, where it is always been winter since the white witch became queen, has been awaiting the fulfillment of a prophecy. When the four children arrive in fulfillment of the prophecy, they meet the mighty lion Aslan. The great strength of this lion can only originate from one source than allows the witch to ultimately be conquered and the four children to reign as kings and queens of Narnia.While this book is short and simplistic, the adventure has more than enough depth to capture the adult reader's attention. While books with fauns and talking animals are normally not on my reading list, I have a great appreciation for this book. There is certainly a reason this book has been treasured for more than fifty years and across generations of families."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"That is all I can say about thiis book.

As far as I can tell, Lewis never instructed his publisher to reorder the series, he merely mentioned casually in a letter that it would be okay to read them chronologically. That hardly constitutes a statement of \\"the original wishes of the author,\\" as HarperCollins claims.The editors at HarperCollins seem to think that the children for whom these books were intended are so unintelligent that they would get too confused if they were to read them in the order in which Lewis wrote them. Never mind the fact that millions of children have thoroughly enjoyed them in the their original order for half a century.Next thing you know, HarperCollins will be reordering the chapters in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey because modern readers must be too stupid to follow them as they have been read for over two thousand years.If you are new to the Chronicles of Narnia, do yourself a favor: get a permanent marker, blackout the numbers on your books, and re-renumber them back to their original order:1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe2) Prince Caspian3) The Voyage of the Dawn Treader4) The Silver Chair5) The Horse and His Boy6) The Magician's Nephew7) The Last Battle"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia is one of the supreme treasures of all English literature--a wonder in childhood, at coming of age, in adulthood, and in old age. It is also a bringer of hope and a force for good in a world where despair and evil are present and need resisting. It is one of the best gifts you can give a child, a friend, or yourself.You should definitely note, however, that the publisher of this and some other recent editions has made a moronic and despicable decision to change the order in which Lewis intended the books in the series to be read. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" is the first book in The Chronicles, and the way Lewis intended his readers to first encounter Narnia. \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" the next-to-last book in the series as Lewis wrote it, is a sort of flashback in Narnia's history, and the events related in it take place earlier than those in \\"LWW\\" in a chronological sense. IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ \\"THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE\\" FIRST, AND TO READ \\"THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW\\" SIXTH, AS LEWIS INTENDED. CHANGING THE ORDER CHANGES THE WHOLE TONE AND ATMOSPHERE OF THE STORY FOR THE WORSE. Don't let the delusion of the publisher's staff that they somehow outrank C.S. Lewis in literary and artistic judgment rob you of the best possible experiencing of this masterpiece--READ LWW FIRST!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This was one of the first in a myriad of novels that I first explored in the infancy of my interests in literature. I enjoyed reading this book at the prepubescent stage of my life because the children in the book were reminiscent of contemporary children but they exhibited aspects of children coping with a terrible situation, such as war and they sough escape through the wardrobe. The novel began in war-torn times and created a wonderful dream world to alleviate the pain of reality.The fascinating part of the novel that takes you away from the terrible reality is that the animals in the book talk and are presented with real human emotions. Somehow animals explain emotion turmoil and loss in life when the people characters were lackluster and stoic. Soon the children gradually grow up through their contact with animals in the dreamscape of their imagination. Narnia is a place where issues that are difficult to grapple with in reality are skillfully explained and dealt with in the imaginative and creative world of a child's mind."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"How much do I love this book. I recently revisited it and had the experience of reading it out loud to my nephew (7) and niece (5). I hadn't read it for quite a few years and, although I still know the story well, there were parts of the book that had faded with the passing of time and were brought back to life with the re-reading of the book, as tends to happen.For instance - I'd completely forgotten the feeling of complete joy and wonder when Aslan bounds over the wall of the Queen's courtyard and begins to breathe life back into the statues there. I'd forgotten good old Rumblebuffin and how much he made me laugh. I'd forgotten that, in spite of what the movies do, the battle scene was fleeting and over so quickly because the focus of this book is not on the grim trials of war but rather on the redemption of the living creatures spoken of.While reading through the story and watching my niece and nephew sink into despair at Aslan's death I felt again the pang of sorrow I felt as a child. After we'd finished the chapter my nephew looked at the title of the next, being \\"The Triumph of the Witch\\" and he gasped in shock. \\"But, she doesn't win.. does she, Aunt?\\" he asked.He learned quickly that in spite of her best efforts.. in this beautiful, wonderful story.. of course evil does not win.

Being that I began my journey into the world of fantasy with reading the Harry Potter books, I did not grow up with The Chronicles of Narnia like many of us have.After seeing the movie version of this book, I decided to read these books in chronological order (starting with \\"The Magicians Nephew\\"), and my first journey in Narnia was a pleasant one. When I picked up the second issue of The Chronicles of Narnia, the renowned classic \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" I was interested to see if it lived up to the constant praise it received.Again I insist, this book is very enjoyable-- it is not, in my mind, worthy of being called a classic. Narnia is a refreshing world that is beautifully described... when Lewis takes the time TO describe it, that is. This book could have easily spanned 300 or more pages, but instead it is crammed into 189 pages, which do not have enough room for the words needed to thoroughly describe the beautiful world of Narnia. The characters suffer as well, for we hardly get to know any of them or their motivations, and the climatic battle of Aslan's army against the White Witch's lasts for only about one page! This may be the only time this sentence will ever apply, but the MOVIE has a great amount more detail then the book, and allows you to get to know the characters much better.However, I am not saying this is a bad book. While Lewis's use of the word \\"presently\\" becomes so often that it grows to be annoying, this book is thoroughly enjoyable and I plan to keep reading The Chronicles of Narnia in hopes to one day have the whole collection. I definitely do recommend this book, but I also warn the readers not to expect a classic like Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings.While I don't enjoy Lord of the Rings as much as Harry Potter, I see why it is a classic, from the beautifully descriptive writing to the twisting plot, but \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" falls short of this. One last time, I will restate that while this book doesn't live up to the hype, it is ENJOYABLE and makes the reader smile often.PS: It is a great story to be read aloud!!6/10"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"the lion, the witch, and the wardrobe is a wonderfull adventure story, but also a sad story .

Though the wrapping paper of the gift that Lewis gave us in \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is itself quite nice (an approach fully and wonderfully informed by early to mid twentieth century British life), it is the gift inside of the wrapping that is the true source of the book's power. Neither unnecessarily subtle nor offensively overbearing, the Christian allegory that Lewis unfolds is strong enough to be apparent to one accustomed to Christian narrative and imagery while not so blunt as to take away from the reading experience of one without such a frame of reference.

The story is about 4 kids named Lucy, Peter, Susan and Edmond. They all get sent away because of the war that's happening in there home town. So then they get sent away and they have to stay with a professor. A couple of days later Lucy found a wordrobe in an empty room. When she saw it she went inside and found a....Edmond, and Lucy are trying really hard not to get captured byThe theme of this book is survival. Peter, Susan, the White Witch. In a part of this story Asland is sacrificing himself for Edmond. During the war Peter and his army is fighting the White Witches army.The characters in THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WORDROBE are easy to relate to. The characters are easy to relate to because Edmond doesn't really fit in anywhere. Every time Susan is trying really hard to be smart. Peter just wants stuff to happen and let it be over with. Lucy is the one who cares about anything either it's a person or an animal and she would never lie about anything.The settings of this book are places that would take you everywhere. One of the settings is the White Witches castle. Another one is the professor's house. The Beaver's house and Mr. Tumbnas's house was also a setting in the book. The biggest setting of all is Narnia.Overall I recommend that this book can be read by anyone who loves reading. Everyone should read this book because it's the best book ever. When the author describes the characters it feels like you already know them. The most exciting parts are the settings because the author describes it like you are already there. I also recommend that if you like adventure books then you would really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia the Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeThe Chronicles of Narnia by: C.S. Lewis is an excellent but easy, read chapter book. I recommend this book to people of all ages because they can either read it by themselves or get it read to them. People who like adventure type books and chapters that leave you thinking, then this book is the book for you. Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter, the main characters, get sent to a far away home because of the London war. Later Lucy finds a wardrobe that leads to a secret place. In this secret place there is a White Witch that makes it always winter. Lucy, Susan, and Peter have to get to the Stone Table to meet Aslan to fight the White Witch, to try and get their brother back.Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan made the Chronicles of Narnia very interesting because the characters were detailed by the author and he told a lot about them. Peter is the oldest and he tries to keep everybody together and try to help them. Susan is the second oldest. She helps Peter take care of Lucy and Edmund too. Lucy is the youngest. She is very cute and funny. Edmund is the next youngest. He tends to boss Lucy around. The characters all turn out to help each other in the end.Next, the theme of the book helped bring the characters together to fight the White Witch. The characters went through a lot of change of the different worlds, seasons, and the people who the characters had to live with. The book was terrific because of the theme of the book.The Chronicles of Narnia the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a different type of book which made the setting tell a lot about what happened where. The book is in a different world so it makes you think in a different way. The wardrobe is wooden and filled with fur coats. The woods were filled with animals that are mostly in a fantasy book. The time frame is the present and in about one to two days. The author describes the book so much and well that it looks like the time frame is in weeks.Therefore I believe that this book is all about change. The characters go through different changes during the book. The characters are different then other characters in other books because all of the animals in the book talk. The setting describes where they are all of the time very well. Every one of those things helps make this novel very splended."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the WardrobeIn the book The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S.

Which is called Narnia and along the way one meats a lady that has strange powers. The kids have to save Narnia the Lady doesn't want them too so she try's to kill them. I recommend the book The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe for all ages because it has adventure, action pack, and funny.The four main characters of the story are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. One statement about the characters is. Peter is the oldest and he is trying to be the leader but he finds out it is hard work. Susan is the seconded oldest she is trying to be the smartest and trying to keep the family together. Edmund is trouble but he wants to do good. Lucy is showing faith, Loyalty, trust to her friends and family.The theme of the book was based on power. The main power was between Aslan and the White Witch. Alsan was the true ruler of Narnia. The White Witch was the flase Queen of Narnia. The main struggle was who was going to rule Narnia.The setting started in London and was almost destroyed by war. When thet moved to the country and was untouched by war. When they were in Narnia it was beautiful but was going to be soon toched by war.In conclusion, I feel like I Was there. It made me think about how the kids felt when they were gone from home. Every page you turn has some sort of adventure in it.

Then I found a out the movie was coming out. My brother mentioned something to me about the meaning behind the book. This is to share Jesus Christ, and show what he did in many different ways. Aslan is supposed to represent Jesus Christ as some might know. Then other people are supposed to represent different things. It shows Aslan dying for the sins the prince made, then raising from the dead. Sound familiar to someone? There were also tons more metaphors relating to christianity. Like the evil witch representing the devil in some parts. First of all, the which is always taunting the lion(Jesus Christ). Also the queen tempting the prince into things like turkish delite, over the love for eachother. Those are just some of the ways i believe the book relates. There are many other things you can get out of the book. If you didn't know some of this, then don't hold back from reading your child the book, because of some of the relations.

The story is about four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) who take a tremendous journey into a mystical country called Narnia.After stumbling into a wardrobe in an old professor's house (where they were sent because of a war) they came upon the snowy country of Narnia. While in Narnia they come across a talking beaver, in fact every animal in Narnia can talk. The beaver invites the children to his house for dinner.During the dinner the beaver talks to them about the White Witch and how she makes it always winter but never Christmas. He also talks to them about how evil she is and how she thinks she's queen but really isn't. One of the other things that he talked about was that she turned everyone that disagreed with her to stone.One of the most interesting things that the beaver talked about was Aslan. Aslan is a powerful lion that is rightfully king and he had just returned from a very long journey. He also talked about the prophecy. The prophecy states that when four humans sit in the four thrones peace will be restored.It turned out that Edmund had been in Narnia before and had met the White Witch. It also turned out that the White Witch had him under a spell. Because he was under a spell he left the beaver's house when nobody was looking and set off for the witch's house.After many days the three other children met Aslan and told him that Edmund was missing. Aslan went to go get Edmund but the only way he could was to sacrifice his life. Aslan knew that the only way to restore peace to Narnia so he was killed. The next day was a huge war, good against evil.If you want o know what happens in the war, to Edmund, and to Aslan, you're going to half to read the book yourself.

The setting of this book is mainly in an imaginary, magical, fantasy world named as Narnia. But the secondary setting (which is also link to it from reality) is an old house belonged to an old professor, which is in the heart of a country (probably England) fairly close to a railway station and a post office. The main conflict of the book is similar to the classical good-against-bad guy plot, which in this case, is our 4 main characters, a lion, and the forces of justice against the white witch, and her forces of evil. But among the story, there are also emotion, excitement, a slow reveal of the plot that can get any reader going and going, and also a little amount of horror. The protagonists of the story are 4 children: Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy. And there is also a lion that plays a critical role, Aslan, which is also mentioned in the last book. The antagonist is the white witch, who causes a lot of trouble. The basic outline is that first Lucy discovers Narnia in a wardrobe, meets a friend there (a Faun). Then runs back to reality, but her friends wouldn't believe her, especially Edmund, who was a snide boy, and teased Lucy for who him believed as make-believe. And then Lucy started to feel distress, and then a day afterwards, they played hide-and-seek again. And Lucy ventured into Narnia again through the wardrobe Edmund also went, but gets really evil under taunting of the white-witch. So then afterwards, the 4 all got into Narnia, and they started to discover danger, and they then got into the whole fight by meeting the beavers, which then Edmund betrayed them and joined the white witch, then Aslan came, and fighting occurred between the white witch. And finally Edmund came back to them, and after victory, the 4 of them got crowned, and at the very end, they all returned to reality and that's it. Now if I was to compare this book with another book written by C.S. Lewis (The Magician's Nephew), I would say this book is more vivacious, exciting, and detailed. While the other book is quite similar with it's magical transition into fantasy, significant, positive changes brought by Aslan, fighting, and there's also a witch and children involved. This book is, in a way, quite similar to the movie of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\". There are also children, a witch, and magical, and unbelievable companions similar to talking animals in \\"The Lion, the witch, and the wardrobe\\" (such as the iron-man, etc.) In my opinion, the best parts of book was when Lucy first met the Faun, it's vivid description really collaborates with the cover, and when Edmund first met the white witch, as there was a lot of tensity, the beaver's home as it gives a book a warm side, and finally I think the war, as that was kind of like the major blockbuster scene in the novel. This book would absolutely captivate readers that love magic, fantasy, and a bit of fairy-tale conflict and story build-up. And in general, I think anyone, especially children, would love this book, as it was very popular and fancied in the past and even the present."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The lion the witch and the warcrobe is a wonderful book.

It is like Lord of the Rings meets Alison and Wanderland.The book begins with four borhters and sisters. who leave london in World War 2 to go and stay with an old perfessor. While exploring the house they found a magical wordrobe. They wander into the magical place called Narnia. while in Narnia the met weird charecters that could talk. The stange things helped them get away from the evil witch. then a lion comes named Aslan who is the only one who can defeet the evil witch. Aslan was my favorite charecter because he was good,nice,and,when he fights he uses his mind not his strenght. With the help of Aslan the kids defeet the witch and become the kings and queens of Narnia. IU like this book because the author made it feel like the charercters come alive and I could see it in my head, for example my favorite scene was when Aslan turned all the statues back in to animals. It describes the process like a paper catching on fire,and I could see the process in my head.While the book starts out slow,it is worth the effert to keep on reading.

They were sent to an old professor's house because of the air raids in London. On one cold, rainy day, the children decided to explore the house. The came into a rather empty room, only filled with a very large wardrobe. They saw that nothing of interest was there, so they left, except for Lucy. She wanted to open the door to the wardrobe and stepped inside. What she found inside was not just the back of the wardrobe but an entire wood all covered in snow. While walking a little through the forest, she met a faun named Mr. Tumnus. He brought her to a den in which he was about to turn her in to the white which, who was making all of Narnia, the world Lucy had came in, winter with no Christmas. Mr. Tumnus realized he had to let her go and help her escape. When she returned to the wardrobe, it wasn't even a second after she had left. One other day, the children decided to play hide-and-seek. Lucy went almost directly to the wardrobe room. Just as she stepped in, Edmund saw her go in and decided to follow and tease her, when he found himself also in Narnia. There he met the White Witch. He gave him some food and drink and told him to bring his siblings to her house. When the White Witch left, Lucy found Edmund and they both went back to the wardrobe room. When Lucy told Peter and Susan that Edmund had gotten in too, Edmund said that he had been playing and pretending with Lucy. The house in which the professor lives in, is one of those houses in which many sightseers came to look at. One day, a whole group of them were there with Mrs. Macready. So all the children went into the wardrobe room and hid in the wardrobe and backed up until all the children ended up in Narnia. They had decided to go visit Mr. Tumnus when they found his house had been destroyed and Mr. Tumnus pulled off to prison. Outside, they saw Mr. Beaver who led them to his home on a frozen river. There Mrs. Beaver and Mr. Beaver told the four children the entire prophecy, when suddenly they had realized that Edmund had gone. Mr. Beaver said they had to leave right away for Aslan at the stone table because the White Witch had gotten Edmund to betray them. At the Stone Table, Aslan and his entire army had gotten ready for a great war. Aslan sent a party of centaurs to chase after a wolf at their camp. This wolf lead them to the White Witch's camp and they were able to bring back Edmund. A couple of days later, their armies clashed. Aslan had went to the White Witch's Castle to revive all those that she had turned to stone. With those extra reinforcements they were able to win the battle. Peter was crowned high king, and Susan, Edmund, and Lucy became king and queens.I really enjoyed this book because it was almost impossible to put down. The description made it feel like you were actually there and could feel what they were feeling and experience what they were experiencing. For example, this sentence made me feel like a picture was elaborately painted in my mind,\\"And out in the middle, and partly on top of the dam was a funny little house shaped rather like an enormous beehive and from a hole in the roof smoke was going up, so that when you saw it (especially if you were hungry)you at once thought of cooking and became hungrier than you were before.\\" That made me feel probably just as those Pevensie children felt when they saw it.There was nothing in general about this book that I didn't enjoy. Nothing except in one moment when Edmund lied that he hadn't been in Narnia. I felt extremely sorry for Lucy. If I were her I probably would have shouted at Edmund for lying and being beastly. Despite that one moment, the story was really great. The best moment was probably when Aslan revived the lion. The description was just beautiful. \\"Then a tiny streak of gold began to run along his white marble back-then the color seemed to lick all over him as the flame lick all over a bit of paper-then, while his hindquearters were still obviously stone, the lion shook his mane and all the heavy, stone folds ripple into living hair.\\" Reading that description was just impossible to describe with words."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"THIS BOOK WAS VERY ADVENTURES WHEN FOUR KIDS PETER,EDMUND,SUSAN,AND LUCY FIND THE MAGICAL LAND OF NARNIA.ESPESILY WHEN ASLAN {GOD} CAME AND THEN EVERY GOOD PERSON FELT CONFIDENT OF DEFETING THE WHITE WHITCH.LUCY WAS AMAZED TO FIND MR.TUMNUS.THEN EDMUND FOUND THE WHITE WHITCH AND HAD ENCHANTED TURKISH DELIGHT WHICH HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO HAVE SOME MORE.THEN THE WHITE WHITCH TOLD HIM HE COULD HAVE SOME MORE AFTER HE BRINGS HER HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO HER.AFTER HUGE BATTLES THEY FINALY KILL HER AND ARE NAMED KING AND QUEEN OF NARNIA."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Although I have only read two NARNIA books, (LION &amp; MIGACIAN'S NEPHEW), I am sure LION is (one of?) Narnia's best.(It), even though (it was) written before MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, fills in the holes from the prequel, as well as creating a new vivid and enchantingly entertaining story of it's own.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A MAGICAL STORY, HERE'S YOUR SERIES!The order the plubisher put them in after Lewis wrote them is as follows, although I'm not sure I spelled everything correctly:#1 THE MIGACIAN'S NEPHEW #2 THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE #3 THE HORSE AND HIS BOY #4 PRINCE CASPAN #5 THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER #6 THE SILVER CHAIR #7 THE LAST BATTLEThe star charecter of the books, I can tell, is easily Aslan, and his bravery in LION was stunning! LION is a true favorite, a treasure, and a classic.I believe the easiest way to read them all is by buying THE COMPLETE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA (a 500+ page book including the full text of ALL SEVEN Narnia novels), or by buying the boxed set (either in hardcover of paperback.) Either way, enjoy LION and the rest of the series!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I read this in three days. The fastest I've ever read a book I think. Of course, I didn't have much else to do though, so that might be a factor.Still, the book was very enjoyable, especially since I'm not into all of this mythological stuff. I especially like the lamp-post at the end of the world concept.This book is very descriptive, which I guess is an essential element to the success of a book. It gives you a sense that the author is actually there and just reporting what happens. He mentions everything, even how one of the kids during a long journey watches a beaver's feet plod along through the snow, as if in a trance. Minor details like that seem to confirm the author was really there. Great for fiction. I think the Harry Potter books are like that too.I hope this isn't a spoiler, but this book has Santa Claus in it, which I personally thought was kind of lame, but oh well.This isn't my favorite book ever, but it's fun to read. I don't think I'll get the other Narnia books, but I've got nothing against them. They're good stuff. I only got this book because I recognized the book cover. I believe I saw it when I was a little kid. These books must have been popular for the past 50 years. I think Mel Gibson is due to make this particular book into a movie this Christmas, but I'm not sure.I used to think books were always better than movies, because seeing a movie every week cost a lot more than reading books for a hobby. Now I'm not so sure. This one cost me seven bucks, and I finished it in less than a week. Now I think good books are good, and good movies are good, but neither books or movies are better overall.I've noticed that my reviews have been getting poor ratings as of late, so I don't think I'll write as many now. I'll have to find something more productive. Like reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland again. That's a great book to read by the way.

Read the book to find out"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is undoubtedly one of the most influential works in the history of juvenile literature - timeless and delightful for all ages.There is, however, no small amount of confusion about the literary type of the book. Time and again, it is referred to as a \\"Christian allegory,\\" a tag with which C.S. Lewis would not have been happy. As he explains in some of his essays and letters, an allegory is a work in which immaterial realities are represented by imaginary physical objects. For example, the immaterial faculty of Reason may be allegorically represented by someone we call Lady Reason. This Lady - because Reason is clear, undefiled, swift, cold, hard, and sharp like a sword - we could picture as a \\"sun-bright virgin clad in complete steel,\\" riding on a horse \\"with a sword naked in her hand.\\" This, C.S. Lewis has actually done in his only allegorical work, \\"The Pigrim's Regress,\\" from which the example of Lady Reason is taken.Is \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe,\\" then, an allegory? After all, C.S. Lewis loved allegorical literature, and it is obvious that elements of his Christianity flowed into the Narnian storyline, such as the concepts of Incarnation and Redemption.Were C.S. Lewis alive, I think he would be very glad if I could transfer to the readers his view that the book is NOT an allegory. C.S. Lewis did not say to himself, \\"Let us represent Jesus as He really is in our world by a Lion in Narnia.\\" His original inspiration was much less theological than that - nothing more than a mental picture. Long before he became a Christian, he had a picture in his head of a faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. Decades went past, until one day he said to himself, \\"Let's try to make a story about it.\\" At first he had very little idea how the story would go. \\"But then suddenly,\\" he later wrote, \\"Aslan came bounding into it,\\" and \\"once he was there he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.\\"I believe I am right that some people will now think, \\"But aren't the Chronicles of Narnia Christian at all? Doesn't Aslan die and rise again like Jesus did? Isn't that a representation of the Christian faith? If that isn't an allegory, what on earth is it?\\"Well, C.S. Lewis called the Chronicles a \\"supposition.\\" He wrote the books by saying, \\"Let us suppose such and such were true and then imagine what would happen.\\" At first this supposition did not even contain a Christian element, but after Aslan had \\"bounded into\\" Narnia, Lewis said, \\"Let us suppose that reality contained different parallel worlds, and that in one of them the Son of God, as He became Man in our world, became a Lion there, and then imagine what would happen.\\"Now this supposition has a definite Christian element in it; the Christian element is in fact essential to it. But that does not make it an allegory. As we have seen, an allegory is trying to describe a (mostly immaterial) fact in our world by means of a picture, such as Reason being pictured as a sun-bright virgin clad in steel. Aslan, however, does not represent the immaterial God in the same way in which Lady Reason represents Reason. He is the result of a supposition. Granted the supposition, he and all the characters and events in Narnia would have been a physical reality no less than Jesus' death in first-century Palestine. Narnia is thus an imaginary world existing in its own right, having grown out of a Christian supposition, but not being an allegory of Christianity. To put it differently, Aslan is Jesus in another world; he is not an allegory of Jesus in our world.I would encourage those who still cannot see the difference to read Lewis's \\"Pilgrim's Regress.\\" Putting it side-by-side with the Chronicles of Narnia should make the distinction plain.But no matter whether you agree with Lewis's view on the question of allegory, no book shelf is complete without \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\"--or the other Narnian books, for that matter. One can read them again, and again, and again.- Jacob Schriftman, Author ofThe Crack Beneath the Worldsand Other Books"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"We heard this book on tape, and my kids absolutely loved it! We were sorry when it was over, and wanted to hear more. We often sat in the car still listening even when we were done driving.

My first grade teacher Ms. Enderlin read the book aloud to my class. Each day she had a reading time after the noon recess. Ms. Enderlin opened the book, Lucy opened the wardrobe, and I opened my eyes to a whole new type of story. That was over twenty years ago.A young girl named Lucy attempts to hide in an old wardrobe and inadvertently discovers a portal to an entirely different world -- the land of Narnia. After her initial visit to this land of speaking beasts and a tyrannical witch, Lucy decides to return with her three siblings Edmund, Susan, and Peter. In Narnia, Edmund falls to the seductive beauty of evil. Lucy, Susan, and Peter strive to save their corrupted brother and defeat the White Witch who has enslaved the talking beasts.\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" offers a fantastic opportunity to expose young readers to fantasy literature. Parents who are looking for something to read with their children will especially enjoy this book and the others in the series. Lewis writes with a distinctly conversational tone that lends itself to being read aloud. Though geared primarily for children (grade school age), the Narnia books will be equally appreciated by adult readers."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"It has been several years since I last read this book. I recall having to read this book as an assignment in Elementary school. C.S. Lewis has an amazing ability to bring back childhood memories. This is an age old struggle of good versus bad. A great buy!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"C.S. Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe is interesting yet very confusing.

Will they follow the mighty and wise Aslan or fall into temptation from the White Witch?The book is a fantasy/adventure, set in England around the 1950's. One thing the author did in this book that I liked was he used forshadowing toward the beginning which really maked the book more interesting along the way. He also used outstanding detail to describe the look and feel of Narnia: so realistic that even though you know it's a fantasy, it feels real, as if you're there with the kids. He also uses a very 'real' tone, like the author is having a conversation with you about the story. This book is the second book of a seven book series.I particularly didn't enjoy the book, simply because it isn't \\"my type of book\\", but if you are someone who loves fantasy, adventure, suspense and some action, you'll be hooked!

It wasn't the first, and it certainly wasn't the last, but it was the best. It just pulls you in, and you can't get out. Once you start, you will probably end up reading half of it in one sitting. From the first page, you are totaly envelloped in Narnia. You forget completely about the outside world. Once you read it, it becomes the book by which all others will be judged for the rest of your days. And trust me, its very hard to beat. I would reccomend it to ANYONE, whether they like fantasy or not, it is truly a study in good writing (the understatement of the 21st century). The religious undertones and the author's subtlty of sugestion leave the upmost room for interpretation. Getting others to read it will undoubtedly lead to endless discussions about the significance of Aslan an a god-like leader, or of the so obvious, yet hidden play between good and evil. Be warned.

Edmond, Peter, Lucy and Susan travel into a wardrobe, hiding from the professor. While in the wardrobe they suddenly are in a world of wonderful beauty, from crystal white snow and strange creatures to centaurs and talking beavers. This thrilling book takes you away to a new land not yet discovered my mankind. The daughters and sons of Adam and Eve will face trials, hardships, and fight the all time battle against the White Witch.This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is adventurous.

If you read this book you will want to read the whole series."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I usually greatly dislike fantasy but I really thought that this novel, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" was interesting. The introduction of this novel was also one of the parts I thought it was interesting because of how the main character enters another part of the world and found that she had a gift. This novel is also interesting to me mainly because there are many specific details while talking about the animated characters appearance. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" are similar and different in some ways from the book, \\"The Hatchet\\" (Adventure Genre). The difference between the books is that, \\"The Hatchet\\" is a book where there is no magical land, and Narnia has. Instead of using magic like the White Witch does in Narnia, the teenager in, \\"Hatchet\\" gets his resources manually, not magically. Like all fantasy books and adventure books, the protagonists usually find that the have a specialty or a gift. I recommend this book, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" to people who likes magical places, and magical powers. People who read this novel should also like the genre, fantasy with characters that do not exist in real life. I do not recommend this book to people who are not into magical powers, or magical places."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"C.S. Lewis, the author, calls the book I have read The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe. This book is about 4 young children whose names are Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy who stumbles into a mysterious world called Narnia. This world is found in an old wardrobe in their house. How they discovered this pace was when Lucy and her other brothers and sisters were playing hide and go seek and Lucy decided to hide in this old wardrobe they had found. She stared to move back into it and she noticed that there was no back to it. She kept on moving farther and farther into the wardrobe and still she could not find the wall. She started to feel weird about this until she saw a light. She ran towards the light and it was actually a lamppost. She had also noticed that there was snow on the ground and that she was in the middle of a forest! She could not believe her own eyes. Then a creature that had a body of a man and a goat came up to her and it started to talk to her. It invited her to his home. His house was a cave but it had a fireplace and candles and stuff like that. The creature told Lucy all about Narnia. Then after the creature was done she had decided to return home. When she got back home threw the wardrobe she told her brothers and sisters. They did not believe her. She got upset because they all thought she was lying. Then Edmund went into the wardrobe to see if she was telling the truth. What did Edmund see? Was Narnia really there? Was Lucy making all this up? Here are just some questions that the book gives you and the only way to find out more about it is that you will just have to read it!I liked The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe a lot. I think this book was exciting to read because of how everything was so unique of what any other stuff I have read. I also liked it because there were fights in it. I could not really feel like I was in the book because some of the descriptions were not very clear as some other books I have read. Also the characters were not really that well detailed. The main conflict did interest me, even if I could not feel like I was not in the book, because I liked the idea of how some one was trying to take back his kingdom and I also liked it because there was a couple of really cool battles in it. I thought the characters did not seem that realistic because the author did not describe the characters as well because he pretty much just gave basic information about each one of them. I thought the books' ending was satisfying but the author seemed to me like he was trying to rush the ending. The ending didn't really make sense but besides that I think the book was good though.I think the author had a voice in a more little childish sort of voice. Like he would not give away the cool parts like heads being chopped off. The author did use a very large vocabulary but he did include monsters that I have never heard of like something called a wraith. I thought the author had absolutely no uniqueness to his writing but I think he made a very unique plot. Some unique characteristics of his writing is that he would say stuff like \\" I can not tell you any more of how these creatures looked like because they would be to hideous for the readers.\\" I thought the dialogue in this book was okay compared to other books I have read. I think this book was more set to younger people, so that's why the dialogue is not very good to me because its it kind of immature to me. I think this author did a really good job with the plot but needs to work on more description, but over all I thought the book was very unique.I think this book is an all right book. I think this book is more for younger people around 12 and younger. This book is a very easy read. Also this book is good for boys and girls. Finally I would rate this book an 8 out of 10.The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is a a pretty good book. I admit that I have read better books but this is a good book if you are looking for a easy and a pretty fast read. I personally think this book is more set for younger kids maybe around the age of 10. I liked this book because of how unique it was. It was unique because of all the different types of monsters it had like trolls, wraiths, goblins, centaurs, and much more. I also liked this book because it was really easy to understand. Finally I liked this book because it did have a few good fighting scenes like the battle with Peter against a wolf captain. This book deserves an 8 out of 10 because of how its really unique but it is also set for younger kids."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"It thought this book was a very good book.

So then they get sent away and they have to stay with a professor. A couple of days later Lucy found a wordrobe in an empty room. When she saw it she went inside and found a....The theme of this book is survival. Peter, Susan, Edmond, and Lucy are trying really hard not to get captured by the White Witch. In a part of this story Asland is sacrificing himself for Edmond. During the war Peter and his army is fighting the White Witches army.The characters in THE LION THE WITCH AND THE WORDROBE are easy to relate to. The characters are easy to relate to because Edmond doesn't really fit in anywhere. Every time Susan is trying really hard to be smart. Peter just wants stuff to happen and let it be over with. Lucy is the one who cares about anything either it's a person or an animal and she would never lie about anything.The settings of this book are places that would take you everywhere. One of the settings is the White Witches castle. Another one is the professor's house. The Beaver's house and Mr. Tumbnas's house was also a setting in the book. The biggest setting of all is Narnia.Overall I recommend that this book can be read by anyone who loves reading. Everyone should read this book because it's the best book ever. When the author describes the characters it feels like you already know them. The most exciting parts are the settings because the author describes it like you are already there.

Lewis wrote in the Chronicles of Narnia series in the early 1950's. The story is of the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. The children are sent into the country during the bombing raids on London in World War II. The children arrive at the estate of the eccentric Professor Kirke. On a rainy day with nothing to do the children decide to play a game of hide and seek.

In Narnia she meets the faun, Mr. Tumnus who tells her of the White Witches magical enchantment over Narnia and of the prophecy of Cair Parivel/Aslan's return which will bring the reign of the White Witch to its end. This is as far as I am going to go in giving away the plot of the book. This book is Number 2 in the series the Chronicles of Narnia. I would suggest when reading the books to read them in the order which Lewis wrote them. This story will delight both young and old alike. It is a classic to read over and over again with your family."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy think that they will get away with all sorts of mischief when they are sent away to the country during the London air-raids, where they will stay with an elderly Professor, and his assortment of household help, in a dilapidated old mansion. But not one of the four children could have ever imagined that they would be transported to a strange, faraway land known as Narnia. Lucy is the first to discover the strange place, when she looks into a wardrobe, and is quickly walking through ankle-deep snow, and cavorting with a Faun named Tumnus. When she returns from her journey, she is shocked to find that her older siblings think she is making up lies, and even more shocked to find that Edmund - who discovers Narnia and the White Witch at a later time - lies when his siblings question about his journey there. But when all four children find their way to the strange land, and find that Lucy's friend, Tumnus, has been seized by the White Witch, the four children believe that it is their duty to rescue him, and quickly find themselves immersed in adventure, statues, talking animals, a great lion, and a battle.I have heard about THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA for years, and while I saw the BBC version of THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE years ago, I never read the book. That is, until I heard about the new Disney film being created from this book. I found that from page one I was deeply immersed in this story, and interested to find what would happen to Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy - all very enjoyable characters, by the way. C.S. Lewis weaves an enchanting story that will keep readers enamored for hours, as they accompany the four youngsters on their adventures through the mystical land of Narnia. A fascinating story that will enchant readers of all ages - especially those who accompanied Alice through the looking glass in Lewis Carroll's ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND.Erika SoroccoBook Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspaper"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I first encountered C.S.Lewis when 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was read aloud to my class, over the period of a term, by our teacher in 1969 when I was eight years old. Of course I, like millions of other children over the past fifty years, did not recognise the Christian parable. To us it was just a story. But now, as a forty-four year old man and a C.S.Lewis devotee, I am of course aware of it's intended 'other meaning'.However, that aside, I think back to 1969, and can clearly remember as a child, how I and my classmates received it as 'just a story'. We were absolutely enchanted. Whenever the weekly lesson started during which our teacher would read a chapter or two from the book, I remember, as she began, having butterflies in my stomach. Throughout my childhood no other literary work ever came so close to literally giving me a glimpse of magic. Although we were unaware of it's christian meaning I believe, in hindsight, that what so captivated us was indeed it's deep spirituality which reached out, through the storyline and the characters involved, and entered our very souls. I do not think it is inappropriate of me to suggest (even accounting for my partisan leanings of being a huge Lewis fan) that, whilst such literature is available, a childhood that is allowed to pass without being given a similar such glimpse of something so fundamentally enchanting, has been deprived of something very important."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This c.d. was a complete life saver on our summer driving/camping holiday.

The reason I gave it only 3 stars is there are several pages in the story where the ink must have been running short on the printer because some of the words are difficult to make out. Also, the book boards are covered with paper not cloth and the pages are glued not sewn. The Chronicles of Narnia have such a huge following.

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one.

Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun.

They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"A long time ago, four children found a magical world beyond (what they thought was) an ordinary wardrobe. This magical world led them to many adventures in a magical place called Narnia. I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in less than three hours because it was so interesting and captivating. this is now my favorite book. After I read The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, I bought the other books in the series. I recommend that others do too. I enjoyed reading this book and then the Magician's Nephew. My favorite character is Aslan. Aslan is a lion that comes to save Narnia from the White Witch. Aslan is very courageous. My second favorite character is Lucy. Lucy was the first to enter Narnia. At the end, Lucy was named Queen Lucy the Valiant. My least favorite character is the White Witch. She made Narnia always winter but never Christmas. She also turned things to stone. She was truly an evil witch. My second least favorite character is Edmund, at the beginning. He lied and could have gotten his brother and sisters killed.Edmund became a better person in the end. My favorite part was when Aslan's army were battling the White Witch's army. I also liked when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy were crowned Kings and Queens. Peter was crowned King Peter the Magnificent. Susan was crowned Queen Susan the Gentle. Edmund was crowned King Edmund the Just, and Lucy was crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant. My least favorite part was when Edmund entered the wardrobe. When he entered Narnia he met the White Witch. Edmund decided to betray his brother and sisters and take them to the White Witch. Then when he got out of Narnia he lied and said he had never been there. I enjoyed The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. I would recommend it to anyone who has an imagination. I also recommend the other books in this series."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950) is a children's fantasy novel, the first and best-known in C. S. Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia. During World War II, four siblings are sent from London to a house in the country, where they are drawn into a magical world ruled by an evil witch.Here, Lewis introduces the reader to a charming fantasy world populated with creatures drawn from Norse and Greek mythology. This kind of world will be instantly familiar to fantasy readers of all ages, as Lewis, one of the cornerstones of the modern high fantasy genre, has inspired a great deal of imitation (and, let's be honest, some outright cribbing).Lewis's narration is perfect for the children's genre: it is full of quaint homey details and little assurances to the reader (he also speeds through what would otherwise be graphic or horrific scenes). Additionally, Lewis does a nice job giving all four siblings the broad strokes of distinct personalities in such a short book.While The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is not an allegory in the strict sense of the word, it does contain a great deal of strong and rather unmistakable Christian imagery. The most apparent such imagery centers around Aslan, who is an obvious Christ figure, and whose fate parallels Christ's Passion. Indeed, while Aslan debuts rather late in the book, he dominates the story, which is, at its core, all about what Aslan is doing rather than what the children are doing.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a delightful read and a wonderful initiation to the world of Narnia. Yes, The Magician's Nephew comes first chronologically, but it is here that Lewis makes his introductions."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the first of the seven Chronicles of Narnia by unequaled English author C.S. Lewis. These books are able to accomplish something that few other books in all of literature have been able to achieve. They are able to be at once great and entertaining literature as well as insightful and profound theology. They are fun and inspiring. Tolkien, Lewis's model McDonald, and a few others achieve some variation of it, but none quite like Lewis.The story unfolds with the four Pevensie children being sent to live with an eccentric old professor in the country, in order to be out of London during the bombing. The house turns out to be as interesting as the professor, and soon the kids find their way to an alternate world where some of the animals can talk and fairy-tales come to life. Not just the fun characters, either, but witches as well, in fact one has the land of Narnia under a spell where it's \\"always winter but never Christmas\\". The kids become the focal point for a classic good versus evil struggle, but with heavy though never pedantic theological lessons. And the king of Narnia, the lion who is the son of the Emperor-over-the-Sea, is just fantastic. Highly, highly recommended for kids and adults."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"\\"...a book worth reading ONLY in childhood is not worth reading even then.\\" ~C.S. LewisOne of the best things about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is that it has an inspiring and thought-provoking quality that appeals to children and adults equally. Various undertones of the story keep on dazzling and blossoming in reader's mind with every page they read, with every time they re-read this book.Through Narnia-world the great battle between good and evil is shown as a part of maturing any child into adulthood, into a worthy person. The characters of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are complex and flawed, which makes them only more realistic. The allegorical Christian values bring a special meaning to the story, giving it a true fairy-tale flavor.This story is as powerful and moving as it is charming. Giving away the plot of the book is spoiling the pleasure of reading. And this book is definitely worth reading.Julia ShpakAuthor of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\". Available on Amazon."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I teach this novel to fifth graders and loved having an audio rendition of the novel that included a differentiation of the readers voice to indicate the character speaking. Highly recommend this audio cd."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"In my humble opinion, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is the finest children's story of the past century. The story contains both enormously imaginative touches combined with childlike simplicity, and the solid yet uncomplex prose belies a story of great sophistication. It also is a story intended for children, yet so respectful of their intelligence that adults can read it with equal appreciation.There should be absolutely no controversy about where this novel should come in the seven-novel sequence that comprises The Chronicle of Narnia: it is the first, and it is required to be the first both by the quality of the novel and by the way it fits into the overall structure of the series. Shifting it from the first spot in the series to the second is quite possibly the worst publishing decision of which I am aware. The justification for the change is exceedingly weak. A child wrote Lewis saying that in their opinion the series should be read beginning with THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW, which tells, among other things, of the creation of Narnia. Therefore, they felt that THE MAGICIAN'S NEPHEW should be the first and THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE second, with a subsequent reordering of the other books to reflect the chronology of Narnia instead of the kids that discover Narnia. Lewis replied that he agreed, and this agreement is used as the excuse to reorder the books. I have two huge problems with this. First, my guess is that Lewis was, as a wise adult will often do, affirming the child rather than stating his conviction that the books should be reordered. Second, even if Lewis did think the books should be reordered, it is not clear that he actually would have authorized it actually being done, nor that he would have resisted the efforts of any decent publisher to point out to him that reordering was a dreadful idea. Why? Because what is so magical about the original ordering of the series is that it focuses on the extremely subjective experience of the discovery of Narnia by children. The original order maintains a chronology based on its exploration and discovery by children and in reading the books that is going to be the concern of any child or childlike adult in reading the story. Who cares about the narrative from the standpoint of Narnia when the far greater concern is the narrative from the standpoint of children? A lesser but still pertinent criticism of the reordering is that it places one of the weakest novels in the sequence in the first position. When I first read the series, THE MAGICIAN'S NEWPHEW was, along with THE SILVER CHAIR and A HORSE AND HIS BOY, the weakest stories in the sequence. Why put your worst foot forward? The Narnia books are about to be made into a series of feature films by the Disney studios, and they have quite correctly decided to film the books in the original and correct order.As noted initially, THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE is a nearly perfect story. The manner in which the children first discover Narnia, by entering it through the back of an ordinary wardrobe, is the most exciting entrance into a magical land at least since THE WIZARD OF OZ and probably ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS. What they discover is a land under the worst of all possible curses: it is always winter, but never gets to be Christmas. The land is temporarily ruled by a beautiful but evil witch who entices children with Turkish Delight. As literature it is all so delightfully perfect, and one marvels that an enormously literate Oxford don could have written it, though perhaps not so surprising when remembering that another Oxford professor, the mathematician and logician Rev. Charles L. Dodgson, wrote ALICE IN WONDERLAND under the pseudonym of Lewis Carroll.Of course, Narnia isn't really ruled by the witch, but by a magnificent, enormous lion by the name of Aslan, who, as we are often reminded, is not a tame lion. Anyone reading Narnia will instant recognize a host of parallels between Aslan and Jesus, known as the Lion of Judah, but Lewis cautioned that no one should imagine Aslan a mere Christ figure: he is Lewis's conception of what Christ would have been like had he been incarnated into a magical land called Narnia as a great lion. During the course of the book Lewis retells the story of the death and resurrection of Christ through the character of Aslan, yet he ever gets to the point of preaching or dogmatism. A very close friend of mine, raised Jewish, was aware of the Christ overtones of the story, yet still declared that it was her favorite book as a child.This is also one of the books with the largest potential audience of which I know. I first read and loved it in college, but elementary school children can delight in reading it, and even younger children can love having it read to them. And it would take a pretty somber and sober adult to not be seduced by its beautiful simplicity. Absolutely no one should deny themselves the joys of exploring Narnia, but make sure you start your tour with this book and not another."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"There are a very few treasures in this world that never lose their magic. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of them. It has been almost twenty years since I first read this book, and I still get goose bumps. It's not one of the deepest or most poetic pieces of literature, but it is truly one of the most magical. \\"Magical\\" is really the word to describe this enchanting novel. It's very, very simplistic as it works its powers on the child imagination. A wardrobe that is a door into a magic realm that needs to be saved from eternal winter. Even after many readings and many years, I still feel the beauty and the darkness of the book. I still get a little freaked out by the paranoia of the trees listening in. And I still feel the incredible power and joy of the melting snows. C.S. Lewis' masterpiece is deceptively simple. He takes the ordinary and turns it into pure magic. He plays with the child's imagination. He creates darkness in simplicity. The simplicity is enchanting rather than dull. The characters are fantastic and utterly charmingly enchanting, from the brat and betrayer Edmund (my favorite) to the kind goodness of Lucy to the sympathetic and conflicted Mr. Tumnus the faun to the frightening and awe-inspiring Aslan and the White Witch. The simple and allegorical story of saving Narnia through sacrifice and redemption isn't really the point. The point is the magic of it all. One of my all time favorite books. One of the books that formed my imagination and my brain. Grade: A+"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"After reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe for the first time at age 31, I sat and asked myself what I really thought of it. I think one of the main things that I felt was disappointment. Not in the book itself, but mainly with myself for not reading it when I was much younger. I truly enjoyed the tale that Lewis has woven, but I think that a lot of the magic is lost by reading it for the first time as an adult.The story itself is solid and I enjoy the narrative tone of it and the references back to the reader by the author as he tells his tale. As an adult, I did notice a fair amount of simplicity in the writing (I'm used to reading novels with much more detail) but not in a negative way. Overly wordy and descriptive narrative can sometimes undermine the smooth flow of a simple story line, and that might have been the case here had Lewis gotten too detailed.I am looking forward to continuing my maiden voyage into Narnia and am eagerly waiting to see what adventures lie ahead."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I read this book as a teenager, learning of Lewis from my passion for Tolkien. The book totally fascinated me then, and made me hungry for more. I remember reading a few more of the books in the series, and though I enjoyed them, I never did find the original magic in them that this one inspired. I lost one of the books or two and never completed the series, but years later I returned to it in order to read them to my step-son, and now I'm very glad to have read the whole series in it's entirity.First off, this and the first book are absolutely the best ones. This time we started with the first book, which I think is named \\"The Magician's Nephew,\\" and I daresay that as an adult I enjoyed it even MORE than \\"Wardrobe.\\" The origins of the breach into Narnia and the original sin that freed the witch were fascinating to me.But returning to \\"Wardrobe\\" was a true delight. Now that I can better digest the symbolism and glean more from the story with the added info learned from \\"Nephew,\\" the book claimed a new tantalizing power over me. My step-son enjoyed it immensely, and couldn't wait to have another chapter read to him each night for bedtime.As an adult I am now able to better appreciate Lewis's incredible talent for character developement and symbolism, as well as his strong imagination and elegant writing style. The rest of the books were also great, and I'm happy to have finally gotten around to reading them all. Certainly the least in the \\"Narnia\\" series is far and above the vast majority of children's chapter books. But for me, the first two are by far the best, approaching the status of even 'The Hobbit,\\" and from me that is saying worlds.J. Lyon LaydenThe Other Side of Yore"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This Review is for the HarperCollins hardcover edition of \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\". This printing uses the original text from the British edition of the book, rather than include the changes that C.S. Lewis made prior to the publication of the American edition.In 1950, C. S. Lewis's first book of The Chronicles of Narnia, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was published. This book would later be considered the 2nd in the series' internal chronology. If you are coming to this book after seeing the movie version as I did, you will find that it is aimed at a younger audience. This book serves well as an introduction to the fantasy genre for young readers. At a little under 200 pages, it is a fairly quick read. In 2001, it was nominated for the Retro Hugo for novels published in the year 1950.The story is about four children (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie) who are sent out of London during World War II to the English midlands to keep them safe. There they stay in a Professor's large house. While exploring the house, they find a room with just a single Wardrobe in it, which Lucy soon finds sometimes acts as a doorway to Narnia.The other children don't believe her at first, but later when trying to hide from the housekeeper they are all find themselves in the mystical land of Narnia. They find that Narnia is in a perpetual winter without Christmas, caused by the White Witch who claims to be the Queen of Narnia. They soon learn that they are prophesized to bring an end to the evil of the White Witch, and they learn of Aslan, a great lion and leader who has returned to the land and who is the true King of Narnia.Much has been written of the use of Christian themes which run through the story. Some of them are quite obvious, such as the references to the sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, and the winters without Christmas. Others are a bit more subtle such as the betrayal, death, and resurrection stories. Lewis also drew on other mythology though, such as Norse and Greek in some of the creatures which inhabit Narnia. In any event, the Christian themes are not too heavy handed, and the book can easily be enjoyed by readers of any faith for what it is, a fantasy.The overall result is a fun light read for young readers. As the age of the reader goes up, the amount of enjoyment will undoubtedly go down, as this story lacks the detail and texture which can be found in Lewis's contemporary's work \\"The Hobbit\\" by J. R. R. Tolkien. There are also some rather odd passages in the book, such as references to problems with Edmund which had never been discussed earlier and an inconsistency with regards to repeated travels to Narnia. These flaws are minor though, and this work is deservedly considered a classic."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis are great children's books. They are easy to read and interesting. In The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe, it starts out with Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter having to go live with their uncle because of the war and air raids from Germany. One day while playing hide and seek in the house, Lucy hides in a wardrobe and finds herself in another world; Narnia. She meets a fawn and becomes friends with him. He warns Lucy of the White Witch warning her of her power. When Lucy returns to her world, her siblings don't believe her but later on all hide in the wardrobe and walk into Narnia. Edmund betrays his siblings and sides with the White Witch, who makes it always winter, but never Christmas. They run around, following Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, trying to hide from the White Witch while trying to meet Aslan, the lion at the Stone Table. Aslan talks to Edmund and settles for him to never betray them again. The queen does not want the children to be in Narnia because of the prophecy that says that four people will take over Narnia and overthrow the queen. There is a battle over Narnia between the children and the Witch. The children win and become the rulers of Narnia.Unlike most books it is interesting from the beginning, and keeps you interested. I usually don't like fantasy fiction books, but this is a good one. There are adventures involved, which can get children into a book. I didn't get the characters mixed up as I usually do in a book. The story is descriptive enough to get a picture in your head but doesn't go on for three pages about the scenery.I read this book when I was in about 6th grade, and honestly I enjoyed it more now as a teenager because I understood more of it. I would not usually pick up a book for fun and read it, but I would recommend this book to readers because it is simple and to the point, and interesting.

Peter, the oldest, Susan, the second oldest, Edmund, the second youngest, and Lucy, the youngest were all sent to a country house to live with professor Kirke, during the war.They went to live in a humongous old mansion, where only an old professor and his maid, Mrs. Macready. One day, they were playing hide and seek, when Lucy, the youngest, found a spare room, empty like many other rooms in the house. The only difference was that this was not a completely empty room, but there was a wardrobe in it, and as soon as she entered the room, she was astonished with the wardrobe, there was something different about it. It was an old wardrobe with many drawings on it, and she thought it was a very beautiful wardrobe. They were still playing hide and seek, so, she hid inside the wardrobe, and she kept on going further in, until she thought to herself, \\"this must be a simply enormous wardrobe!\\" She had been walking through coats which didnt let her see what was in front of her, but she felt something cold under her feet, and wet. Soon, there were no more coats, instead, there were branches of trees on her face. She was shocked when she saw that she was in the middle of a wood and it was winter.

This book is worth the read at any age. The story is compelling and dramatic. The characters are rich and possess real human dignity. The subtlety and suspense make the book an easy and fast read, yet impossible to forget.Unlike most children's literature, The Chronicles of Narnia--and The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe in particular--treat both the children and adults with respect and grace. The children are young and sometimes impatient, but brave and decent. The adults are respectful and thoughtful, not dismissive or clueless.Lewis' Christianity is clear from start to finish, but this book is not preaching; neither is the content forced.

My favorite part of this book was when Peter, Susan, Lucy, and Mrs. & Mr. Beaver entered the Stone Table and met Aslan, a lion that is the King of Narnia. I think the characters are believable because they all had a special part in the story's plot. Father Chrismas's part was to give Peter, Susan, and Lucy their tools. Lucy helped the wounded with her cordial that was made by the fire flowers on the top of the mountain, Peter and Edmund were knights that had a sword and a shield to protect them in battle, and Susan had the ability to use a bow and arrows for protection and a horn. The horn was used for thinking about something good to help her when she blows it and that thing she thinks about comes or appears. The ending was happy: the kids helped Narnia by defeating the Witch and her army that was trying to take over the magical place. I recommend you to read this book that is full of fantasy and magic."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"At the time of the publication of C.S. Lewis's The Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe the world was still in the early stages of recovery from the largest, most devastating, and most costly known war to mankind at the time, 1950. WWII was truly a battle of good verses evil, and good prevails. What exactly C.S. Lewis's experiences were during the war are unknown to me however, I venture to say that he knew about the evils mankind was capable of and also knew of the good man was capable of. He lived in Europe at this time and had first hand experience in the dealings of daily life during war. It appears that in this book Lewis is clearly writing about his experiences, but to the extent that his allegories are based on direct or indirect experiences aren't completely clear to me. What is clear is he wrote of his beliefs, his own faith, and how they came to be questioned and ultimately restored through the writing of this story.These themes of good versus evil, loyalty, prudence and faith become evident as the story unfolds. Truth be told there are numerous themes that apply to this story. The theme of maturation could be applied; you see the children are dependant on adults in the beginning of the story for their well-being. Then they pass though the stage of trust versus mistrust, questioning the very existence of Narnia, and arrive at the stage of innovation versus guilt. During this stage they figure out how to solve problems and over come difficulties on their own. You see them take control over their destiny, as they become the rulers of Narnia. This can be applied to the people of Germany, who so susceptible and dependent on their government after World War I that they crave a solution, that is then brought to them in the form of a new charismatic leader who promises them not only a rebuilt life, but that they, the people of Germany, will be come the rulers of the world. This is similar to Edmond's plight in the story. Themes of unselfishness and selflessness are all throughout the story and example of this is the role of Mr. Tunnis who knows that he will be stoned if the witch finds out that he did not do as she wished, which was to notify her that a daughter of Eve had entered Narnia. He still decided to go against her wishes and sacrificed himself for the safety of the Lucy. This selflessness is also seen in the beginnings of the Third Reich by those who were willing to give up their new found sustained lives, their comfortable economic conditions that their leader had provided, to grow, expand, and protect the safety of their country. These citizens, these soldiers also conformed to the requirements of their government out of fear, much like Mr. Tunnis. They too wanted their lives to change realizing that their world was becoming increasingly irrational. They continued to support their government despite of this, out of fear, out of conformity, and out of a sense of obligation.While undoubtedly there is a strong undertone of the religious beliefs of the author, as a student and of history and sociology I found myself continually drawn to the similarities of Narnia and the German town of Dachau. The people who lived in this town did not support the Third Reich and were proud to not be active participants in the dealings of the government, having heard rumors of the deeds that went against their own beliefs of humanity and dignity. Like the children who heard Lucy's description of Narnia, they did not believe that this was happening in their back yard. They instead chose to believe the reassurances of the government they did not support. Their understanding, their belief system did not support the stories that they were being told, just as the other children could not comprehend the stories that Lucy was telling them. Instead they chose to believe the lie they were told by the very government they did not support, because it was more in line with their understanding of human nature. Lucy was said to have never had lied, and therefore is someone they should believe, leaving the reader to assume that Edmund's character is a little more questionable, yet they more readily accepted his response over hers.As the battle of good versus evil ravaged the world in the 1940s, it also ravaged Narnia. The fight over the existence of Utopia, and whether it could exist in the simultaneous presence of pure evil and pure good, played out as much in the minds of the citizens of Dachau and as it did in the world of the characters in the story, as the conflicting stories of reality blended together so that truth and fiction could not be defined.At the end of World War II the citizens of the town of Dachau were first told, then shown what had been going on in their own backyard, allowing them to see first hand what their acceptance allowed. They had readily accepted the assurances of people they knew and believed to be untrustworthy, and as a result not only allowed, but played an active role in supporting the evil that they had tried to not be part of. They had not actively stopped evil, and instead, through their own complacency, played a crucial role in sustaining it. This realization led many of them to collapse, and unable to return to the place they had been proud to call home. The journey they had been on during the time of the war gave them prosperity, but at the end, the realization of the horror in what they had done, made it clear that they had come full circle, back to the devastation and self-defeat they had prior to the rise of the Third Reich. They had chosen to follow the White Queen. It was as if time had not passed, that any success they had enjoyed during that time period was gone, yet they held the memories and awareness of the years in between. Only now those good memories were all tainted.Similarly, as the children in Narnia began to grow and reach levels of success and accomplishment, they soon returned to the beginning. They recognized the signs that they were getting back to where they started, as they chased the stag, saw the familiar lamppost, but instead of stopping and remembering, they continued forward, ignoring the signs they were given. Soon after they too found themselves back at the beginning, as if time had not moved forward. They were back at the school, back through the wardrobe, back as children. But they returned with the memories of the time they spent in Narnia, where pure good lived side by side with pure evil, and how these powers initially fought for them. Having accepted the protection of Aslan to watch over them, protecting them as they maneuvered the balance of good and evil, they now had a deeper sense of understanding of themselves, a deeper sense of faith and awareness of their purpose in life."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The wardrobe made from the wood of the Narnian apple tree planted in a garden on earth and brought down in its old age by some storm is going to be the door to Narnia in the old and magnificent mansion or maybe castle where four kids, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, have taken refuge away from the bombing of London by the Germans in 1940.Lucy first goes through the door and spends a few hours there having tea with the faun Tumnus.

One of my favorite illustrators, by far. I grew up with my mother's collection of Hague illustrated books, and I will always associate his pictures with my mental image of Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books, even if it is a children's book. It is very good and it will keep your interest. A young girl finds a magical wardrobe that takes that little girl to a place called Narnia. Later, her brothers and sister finds out about that mysterious place and then the story goes on to an adventure that just never stops."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is probably one of the most popular fantasy books out there, especially for the younger set. When the movie came out (which I also loved) it just furthered the popularity of this series. While it can be read as a stand alone, I recommend reading the complete series for the full richness and history that is contained for the world of Narnia.When Lucky, Edmund, Peter, and Susan have to go to the countryside to escape the air raids and war, they stay with a kindly professor at his rather large house. There is plenty to explore, and it is on a rainy day that Lucy finds a magical doorway to another world, inside the wardrobe in a spare room. She quickly makes a friend in a faun and learns of the evil White Witch who fancies herself Queen of Narnia. The other children don't believe her about her adventures though, and this is even worse for her when Edmund comes through too but lies about it to the other children. Finally and quite by accident they all make it to Narnia and learn that they have been expected. Aslan, the great lion, wants to see them and they set out to meet him and help him with his fight against the White Witch. However, they experience a setback when Edmund defects to the witch's side and they feel sure that he is lost to them.The characters, despite this being a short book, are very well done. I love Lucy and think she is charming and sweet. Peter is rather noble and distant, and Edmund of course is a complete brat in the beginning of the book without hardly any redeeming qualities. The other characters are quite nice as well and it is easy to see that Aslan has a regal bearing.The writing is great and definitely the most appropriate for kids (adults might find the story a little rushed) and while there are battles there is not extreme violence in this book. In fact, the only thing I found offensive was Father Christmas saying women shouldn't fight in wars, but that could just be the small bit of feminist in me. There are Christian tones, but they aren't strong in voice and are rather just a background to the story itself. It is read more as a fantasy novel, and highly appropriate that way.I love the series and especially this book and read it over and over. I don't think I could ever tire of it. With all the fantasy novels out there, this is definitely one that should be read.The Lion The Witch and The WardrobeCopyright 1950206 pages (and my edition had black and white pictures as well)Review by M.

In the beginning, the four children come to the professor's house to stay until the war is over. They are exploring the house one day, and Lucy goes into a wardrobe, thus into Narnia. In Narnia, she meets Mr. Tumnus, a friendly faun who wants a free Narnia. He explains the White Witch making ever-lasting winter in Narnia. In the middle of the book, the rest of them enter Narnia, war breaks, they meet Aslan, the lion, who saves Edmund, who had gone to the White Witch, who \\"killed\\" Aslan on the Stone Table. Near the end, Aslan kills the White Witch, and the children are Kings and Queens in Narnia, when they accidentally leave back through the wardrobe.People who like fantasies such as talking animals would like this book because it has a lot of them.From this book, I learned that dictators do not always use power wisely, so you can not trust anyone completely, even if they do seem kind and thoughtful."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I read The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis and I enjoyed it very much. In the begging the kids (Lucy, Peter, Susan, and Edmund) live with their mom but they moved to live with the professer because of air-rids. At the professers house Lucy finds a wardrobe witch takes you to a place called Naira. When all the kids get there they meet the Beavers. In the middle the Beavers tell the four about Asland, a powerful lion who is on their side, and the horrible witch who is not on their side and who wants to take over Naira. Then Edmund sunk out over to the witch's house. Then the Beavers take the kids over to meet Asland, and he saves Edmund. In the end Asland dies for Edmund and the war begins. Then Asland comes alive again and Naira wins the war. After the four are crowned kings and queens they finally go back through the wardrobe to the professers house they are kids again.The themes for this book is always believe in your family. Two ways that they showed this in the book is that Susan, Peter, and Edmund, at first do not bevible Lucy when she first finds the wardrobe, and when they are hiding from the house keeper they go in the wardrobe they all find Naria.The second theme is that you should bevble even if others do not. In the book they show this because when Lucy first comes out of the wardrobe the others do not beveled her, and Susan, peter, and Edmund do not bevible Lucy about the wardrobe.The recommendion for this book is for people who like fantasy stories, or made up creatures and figure.

Lewis was a genius and wrote many powerful, thoughtful books. I am just thankful that he set out to try his hand at children's books, because in Narnia we have been left with something that is truly special."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This book is a fantasy about a land called Narnia. Four English school children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy Pevensie enter the world of Narnia through a magical wardrobe while playing a game of hide and go seek. The four children are in this magical land to help the golden lion, Aslan, to defeat the White Witch. The White Witch has used her magic and cursed the land of Narnia with everlasting winter without Christmas. Throughout the book, the children meet many magical characters and animals. The children are forced to fight a war against the Witch and defeat her, which changes the land back to its original beauty and removes all curses she had on Narnia. The children became the Kings and Queens of Narnia for many years in Narnia time. However when they went on a hunt for a white stag, the children stumble upon the lamppost that they had found the first time they entered Narnia. The children wander in the forest near the lamppost and they fall out of the wardrobe that they had entered many years ago. On the other hand, the children were no longer adults as they were in Narnia, it was the same time, same day, and the children were in their same clothes that they were wearing when they wandered through the wardrobe and found Narnia.This is a high quality book in the fantasy genre. Most of the characters are fictional, yet the heroes of the story are children. There is more than one set of literary elements within this story. Each adventure in this book has its own problem, yet there is always one main problem. The language and style of this book is of English literature and some of the wording is different than the English used today. This book also has a different style. The children embark on an adventure to a magical land and find that they are the children of Adam and Eve. To them that is not important, however to the Narnians it means a great battle is to be had. There are a few illustrations through this book in black and white, however they do not tell a story within themselves. The story is told through the printed words. The illustrations are to give a glimpse of the Narnians or land in which the chapters are focusing on. The strength of this book is the high level of fantasy and adventure. The only concern for this book with lower readers is the names and the old English language used throughout the story. The reading level for this book is middle grades starting in fourth to eighth. In the classroom this book can be used as a beautiful example of fantasy. In the classroom, a way to see what the students are visualizing while reading is have the students complete a ten minute quick draw (Yopp & Yopp, 2006). The students can also predict the ending of the story, or even the ending to a chapter. The students can also journal about which character they would like to be use examples in the book to support why they choose that character. Also, the students could journal on the last quote from the professor, \\"But the professor was right it was only the beginning of the adventures of Narnia\\" in which the students could extend what they think this predicts for readers (Lewis, 1950, p.206). Lastly, the students could create a comparison chart and compare the fantasy in the story and reality (Harvey & Goudvis, 2007). The only concern for this book is the violence during the war and the fighting being discussed in the classroom."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"First book printed, second book chronologically.I began re-reading the Narnia series after coming across a beautiful boxed set of all seven novels. Mainly this was out of nostalgia, as these were favourites when I was young, and I was interested to see how they held up as adults. I found them all to be written very clearly with provocative descriptive prose, and narrative that often draws the reader immediately into the story.This is, of course, the most recognisable title of the series as well as being the first written/published. Most readers will pick up the book hoping for a written account of the events in the recent film, or perhaps the BBC drama series if your memory goes back that far! For the most part the events are the same, although elements are extracted and expanded upon in the films making the novel a little pale in comparison.It is not however lacking in terms of character or charm, and is an alluring tale that sucks the reader in instantly despite the intrusion of the narrator at times. The protagonists, places and events are described straight-forwardly with insightful touches that enhances the specific element that brings the scenes to life.

Some might find it better for you to read this, but I didn't.Overall, I think you will find this book very pleasing to read. It's a warm and freezing cold story to read.

After reading The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe what a shame it has been to not have read them before. My wife and I saw a trailer for the upcoming \`Chronicles' movie by Disney, Prince Caspian. We both thought it looked interesting and decided we should watch the first movie being The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe before seeing Prince Caspian. After reading some of the reviews of the book I decided it would be worth the time to actually read each of the books before seeing the corresponding movie which brings me to the place of reading The Lion... this weekend. Books are almost always better than their corresponding movies and I think it's important, if possible, to read the books first so your imagination can take over and you are not placing the faces and voices of the movie characters into the reading realm.

I know there's a lot of arguments concerning what order the books should be read in: chronological order or as they were published. Well, I have to say that C.S. Lewis published them in the order he meant for us to read the books so start with LWW. What a wonderful imagination this man had and how fortunate for us readers that he put his creativity to good use and put his thoughts down on paper.

I don't follow a Judeo-Christian path, personally, and I have no problem reading this; it's not at all preachy, or so obviously Christian that it reads like a rewritten Bible story or something. So, regardless of your own religious affiliation (or if you aren't religious at all), The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent choice if you want to sit down for a couple of hours for a fun, light story of magic and adventure...\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger:herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion,The Witch, and The Wardrobe is a very exciting book in which four children step into the land of Narnia through a wardrobe by magic. Narnia is enslaved by the White Witch,a witch who can produce endless winters with no Christmas,turn things into stone,make things look like what they aren't,and do a few other tricks. Just when almost all hope is lost, Aslan, the lion, returns to Narnia and leads the Narnian army against the White Witch's army in a war that will decide the fate of Narnia.My two favorite charactars are Aslan and the White Witch because they're the rulers of Narnia and bitter enemies. I like the book because of the highly detailed story and pictures. I love it,and you will probably like it too. If you like mystery books,it's not a mystery book.

LewisOne of the best things about \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is that it has an inspiring and thought-provoking quality that appeals to children and adults equally. Various undertones of the story keep on dazzling and blossoming in reader's mind with every page they read, with every time they re-read this book.Through Narnia-world the great battle between good and evil is shown as a part of maturing any child into adulthood, into a worthy person. The characters of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are complex and flawed, which makes them only more realistic. The allegorical Christian values bring a special meaning to the story, giving it a true fairy-tale flavor.This story is as powerful and moving as it is charming. Giving away the plot of the book is spoiling the pleasure of reading. And this book is definitely worth reading.Julia ShpakAuthor of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

My best friend Mark introduced them to me; he truly believed Narnia existed, and come to think of it, how do we know it doesn't? Even now in my 40s, I just don't think the overt symbolism matters much. For me and many others, these books represent a time in our lives when we could willingly suspend our disbelief easily, readily, wholeheartedly. Isn't it sad that, as we age, we often seem to lose that flexibility, that openness?"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I am a big fan of \\"Lord of the Rings\\", as well as \\"Harry Potter\\", so it seemed only natural that I should also read C.S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". I am somewhat embarrassed to say that I never read them as a child, but then again I stem from the third world, where these occurrences are not unusual. After watching the movie, I decided to give the book a try. At first I was unsure where to start the series, as there is still a debate as to which order the books should be read in, but I went with the first book in the series that was published, as this made the most sense to me.I am so very glad that I picked up \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\"! The book is actually tiny - less than 200 pages, with illustrations - but packed full of adventure. Most people are familiar with plot, but for those fellow \\"third-world-ers\\" I will rehash some of it. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are four siblings in the WWII England, who get sent to a kindly professor's house in the country to be safe from the German air-raids. They are amazed by the size of the house, and decide to explore it on rainy days. During one of those days Lucy, the youngest sibling, entered a room that contained only a wardrobe. Upon entering the wardrobe, behind the coats, Lucy encountered a different world, with snow and woods and a lamp post.Lucy ended up meeting a Faun called Mr. Tumnus - a half man, half goat, who introduced Lucy to Narnia, the world that she entered, a world ruled by a White Witch, who called herself the Queen of Narnia. Of course, the one true King is Aslan, the giant talking Lion, who is planning on returning to Narnia and bring Christmas and then spring and summer back with him. In order to do this, Aslan needs to fill the four thrones in the castle currently occupied by the White Witch. The four thrones can only be occupied by humans, as foretold by a prophecy.Lucy returned to her world via the same wardrobe. On a different day, while trying to escape the grumpy housekeeper and a group of tourists going around the professor's house, all four siblings hide in the wardrobe. Not believing Lucy's Narnia story before, the siblings are surprised and apologetic when they, too, end up in Narnia. Deferring to Lucy as a way of apology, all the siblings go with Lucy to meet Mr. Tumnus. They are all surprised to see Mr. Tumnus missing and his place raided, as they find out that Mr. Tumnus was arrested by the White Witch for abetting humans.The White Witch found out about Mr. Tumnus' nefarious activities through Edmund, who entered Narnia on his own while one day looking for Lucy. Edmund met the White Witch, who gave him Turkish Delight. The food was enchanted, and Edmund wanted more of it. The White Witch promised Edmund rooms full of Turkish Delight if he brought his siblings with him the next time he was in Narnia.This is just the beginning. The children end up meeting Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, who help them go to Aslan, while Edmund (believing the White Witch was not that bad), escaped to the castle, where he got imprisoned by the White Witch, who then took Edmund on a harrowing journey of looking for Peter, Susan and Lucy. But the snow is already melting, and the spring is coming, so the Witch needs to hurry, as the prophecy is about to be fulfilled, which would mean the death of the Witch.Ah, this book was such a pleasure to read! Lewis wrote this book as a story for his god-daughter Lucy, and at first intended the story to be just that - a story and not a series. The book is written very simply - one can easily imagine the author telling it to a bunch of kids, adding asides for dramatic effect or as a way of explanation. Although the book is written in a very simple language, its plot is actually quite complicated and covers amazingly well developed characters in such a short span.Lewis, who was a good friend of Tolkien, was truly a master of the genre, as this children's book is so well loved by adults, as it has themes that can translate to any age. \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is also the simplest of all the books in the series, as far as language is concerned, as it was obviously originally intended for a very specific and small audience. I am very glad that the book found a larger audience than that. The book is wonderful in that it teaches courage, loyalty, forgiveness, strength, endurance and sacrifice, among other things, while immersing the reader in a plot in which they cheer and sit at the edge of their seat. The illustrations propel the reader into the world of Narnia, and illuminate all that our adult imagination might have forgotten.All in all, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is a fantastic children's fantasy book, that would be very hard to match, and that, one can safely say, serves as a basis and a starting point for all fantasy writers of today. And well it should, as Lewis was one of the masters, and \\"The Lion...\\" was just one taste. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"When I was in 3rd grade, I was read this book. I didn't really pay much attention.

That's me all right. I liked the characters a lot. Lewis has a big imagination. When Edmund betrayed his friends, I was so mad at him. I loved this book a lot.

Now she's about to have a baby of her own and I am about to get the chance to redeem myself by graciously and most willingly introducing her child to the wonder and magic of Narnia. This book is essential reading for all those adults who wish to rediscover and reawaken their imagination. And all you kids out there!

They were sent away from their home in London to live with an old professor because of the air-raids in the war. The professor had strict rules about the house such as what not to do and where you shouldn't go. While they were at his house they decided to play hide and go seek in the house. When the youngest child Lucy decided to hide in one of the forbidden rooms, which had nothing but a large figure with a sheet over it. Lucy wanted to see what it was so she took off the sheet to find a beautiful wardrobe laying there in front of her. She decided to hide inside of it and when she opened it she found something amazing inside of the wardrobe.Which is what leads to the whole adventure of the four children.The Lion, The Witch, and The wardrobe is a great book for people who love fantasy or Lord of The Rings.

I had no expectations for this book, so luckily, I have not been let down in one form or another. I am not fond of mystical/fantasy books, and I could not get caught up within this world of Narnia. I found the action to be lacking, as it was described in short paragraphs, rather than shown, and I did not see any point to it. It is written very juvenilely, so it is easy to read.

The story follows Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy as they plunge into the world of Narnia. Digory from The Magician's Nephew makes an appearance, but he is now known as Professor Kirke. Of course, the White Witch also reappears as does Aslan. If you have read The Magician's Nephew you know how the wardrobe came to be.The Pevensie's are great characters. I actually liked them more than the characters in the previous book. Edmund did annoy me at times, but I think he was supposed to be like that since he did betray his siblings. Great story from beginning to end.I thought The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was a fun book to read. There is a lot of symbolism in this book that relates to Christianity.

How Susan and Lucy felt about Aslan's death is similar to how we face the death of Christ.

The reading wlill be finished yet the joy and warmth it brings us could never leave us."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" was the first and most celebrated book of C.S. Lewis popular children's fantasy series \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\". It is not the first of the series chronologically, but the second, and although there is much debate over whether one should read the books in the order that they were written or the order in which they take place, I cast my vote for order of writing or publication, with \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" first. The books refer to one another, which makes reading them in order of publication seem more natural -and more desirable, as it also prevents too much from being revealed too soon. The mysteries of the back-story help sustain readers' interests, which might otherwise wane, for the duration of 7 books.\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is a fairy tale about brave and honorable children in a magical land. Four siblings -Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy- are sent to the country home of a kindly old Professor to escape the London air raids during World War II. One day Lucy, the youngest, steps into a big old wardrobe, lured by the cuddly fur coats hanging inside. Stepping farther and farther into the wardrobe, past where the back of it should be, Lucy finds herself in a snow-covered forest in a strange land called Narnia, where human children are a rarity. She returns to the house full of excitement, but her brothers and sister don't believer her incredible story. But when all 4 youngsters pile into the wardrobe, trying to evade the housekeeper Mrs. Macready, they are transported to Narnia and find themselves key figures in a fight to free Narnia from the oppressive reign of the White Witch.When I read \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" as a child, I found it too simplistic. Reading the book again as an adult, I realize that the problem was that I was too old. I discovered \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" when I was about 10 years old and already captivated by the more sophisticated Tolkien fantasy books. \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" are written in a rudimentary style with two-dimensional characters. \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" seems hastily constructed with awkward dialogue and long passages dedicated to insignificant scenes while major events are made incidental. (Lewis' writing style improved in subsequent books.) These books are fairy tales intended for young children. The difficulty is that they are probably too young to read them. But if your kids like to be read to, \\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" are an good choice. I've never met a child who didn't like to hear stories of children who are important, independent, and take control of their own lives. Biblical allegory and morality plays notwithstanding, I think that is why Narnia appeals to children."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This Item was described as hard back It was not. I sent it back. I got a full refund. The book is good reading. I would recommend it. If you don't mind paperback buy it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This had more charm than I remember from 4th grade, but I still take issue with a few plot points. \\"Ha ha, I win because of deep magic that no one had heard of until I mentioned it just now!\\" \\"Oh, yeah, well, ha ha, I win because of even deeper magic that no one had heard of until I mentioned it just now!\\" It's almost like Aslan and the White Witch are playing Calvinball. I realize Lewis needed these kinds of plot devices to make the allegory work, but would it have killed Lewis to throw in a little foreshadowing? He foreshadowed other things. It was within his power.The saddest thing about this for me is that there's a nice little adventure story buried under the deus ex machina plot mechanisms. At least there could have been. Perhaps a different author would have sent the characters to find their accoutrement (Peter's sword, Lucy's cordial, Susan's bow--which she never used, I'd like to point out). But Lewis decided to play the Santa Clause card, because... well... I have no idea. I had to keep reminding myself that this was only a children's book, and perhaps it would have been more dramatic if it had been written with an older audience in mind. The moments of narrative tension evaporate quickly. Most of the crucial battle takes place off-screen. The only characters with any development at all are Lucy and Edmund. Peter's supposed to be the hero, but he barely has any screen time. And I realize it was written in the 50's, but is it necessary to constantly break the 4th wall?Oh, and can I take a moment to complain about the professor? I can only assume that he's a Mary Sue for Lewis, and yet he's this jolly, one-dimensional deified beacon of anti-intellectualism. GRR!!!Okay, I've griped. LWW is at least fun and imaginative. And while the main machinations of the plot are transparent allegories for Christianity, they're at least not oppressive. The story is allowed to breathe a little underneath them and develop its own personality. I rather liked that the book has a sense of awe and wonder about itself, and while I can criticize it for being far too brief for its scope, I can just as easily criticize J.R.R. Tolkien for the pointless ramble that is the first six chapters or so of The Fellowship of the Ring. It was a different time and new genre, nobody knew what they were doing. LWW is mercifully short, colorful, engaging, and very accessible, for all its foibles. I guess that makes Lewis the anti-Tolkien, now that I think about it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I'm 21 years old and I picked this book up because I had never read it as a child and wanted to read it before I saw the movie. It is a very short book and I am pretty sure I read the book in less time then it took me to watch the movie. Most younger readers will not have a problem with this one and it is entertaining enough to keep them reading until the end.The story seemed kind choppy to me and there was very little character development. However, this is only the first of the chronicles of narnia and I've heard the the other books are better and since they involve the same characters there is bound to be more development. I think I might have just been to old when I read this book.If you're looking to get your young reader into novels then this might be a good introduction. Then they can continue with the rest of the series. If you're looking for something entertaining for your 14+ year old, this isn't it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the WardrobeBy C.S. LewisHarperTrophyIn a room of the Professor's house stands a wardrobe of coats and something more, something that was destined to be discovered by teh youngest of four children, Lucy Pevensie, while exploring the house. Lucy and her siblings, Peter, Susan, and Edmund, explore the land inside the wardrobe; the land of Narnia, frozen in eternal winter by the White Witch, a land that is waiting to be set free as the prophecy says. However, after over 100 years of winter, the creatures have lost almost all hope, but the return of the Great Lion, Aslan, and the appearence of the four children causes a great change, a betrayal, a great sacrifice, and a great war thast will decide the future of Narnia and all of its creatures.The four Pevensies are very curious children. Little did they know, they had a huge part in the freedom of Narnia. Their arrival signaled the return of Aslan, the end of winter, and the beginning of spring. Peter is the oldest of the four, then Susan, Edmund, and at last Lucy. Peter tries to act like their father (who was probably sent out to war) while Susan tries to act like their mother (who is back at their home in London). Edmund is greedy and even betrayed his siblings to the witch for power that wasn't real. Lucy is very curious and truthful. She has never told a lie. Although the first impression of Aslan is terrifying, this lion is quite gentle, kind, caring, and brave. He is greater that any other lion in Narnia. He has a lovely golden mane and great, royal, solemn, overwhlming eyes. Aslan was there before the dawn of time (this is a fact that will save his life). The Great Lion is the enemy of Jadis, the White Witch. The White Witch is the last Queen of Charn. Jadis has had Narnia under her control for over 100 years. She is as white as snow and has a very red mouth. The White Witch wears a golden crown on the top of her head and carries a long straight, golden wand in her right hand. This witch has a heart as cold as ice and turns creatures to stone with her golden wand. She is truly the evil creature of the story.This story is very magical and curious. I think this because in the story, Lucy discovers the wardrobe out of plain curiosity and the story gets more curious as you read on. I would also describe this story as magical because it is about a fictional world of fantasy. This book has a fantasy genre. I like this genre because is this book, there is a lot of mystical events which helps good triumph over evil. I recommend this book to children in grades three through five. It is truly a wonderful book, but I think that it is too easy for sixth and seventh graders. Third grade is mostly whne children start reading short chapter books a lot and fifth grade is when children usually stop reading short chapter books and start reading longer books. However, if you are a kid at heart and love a good story, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This book is fiction and was written in 1950. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is about two boys and two girls named Susan, Lucy, Peter, and Edmund. These four children were taken away from there home because of the war. They were taken to another house where they lived with a professor. The main part of the story takes place in Narnia.In Narnia there was an evil queen she was called the White Witch. She would make it snow all year but there was no Christmas. And if she saw someone that was happy she would turn them into stone. The most exciting part of the book for me was the battle between Aslan's army and the White Witch's army. What I liked about the book was that it tells you four kids could save a whole world. The book had a great ending it turned out that Susan, Lucy, Edmund, and Peter became the new kings and queens and Narnia was finally in peace."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe is an awsome book!

I am not a fan of fantasy but this book was a cute book...CS Lewis has yet to let me down."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Any child or adult would sit up straight to hear the story of the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe from start to finish. Mr. Lewis had the talent of capturing readers' attention especially children's then grasping their interest throughout a whole story. This tale is drolly told right through the entire book. It is a gripping adventure taken by four siblings who are actually eagerly anticipated by beings in another world. There are entities of rivalry, greed, betray, merriment, kindness, magic, and triumph for each person's enjoyment. Although the end is too fantastic that amnesia or giddiness might have been the cause for the four children's forgetfulness of their origin, the immensely entertaining technique of narration overcomes the poor conclusion."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The story, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, features four children displaced from their home in London due to violence of WWII to a remote country cottage. Upon arriving to their caretaker's cottage they explored the odd rooms and furniture. To eliminate their boredom, they decided to play hide-and-go-seed. This is when the youngest, Lucy, hides in the wardrobe and stumbles across the land called Narnia. The snowy land of Narnia is filled with all types of little creatures like fauns, dwarfs, and beavers, but the land of Narnia also has one White Witch, who calls herself the Queen of Narnia.The four children don't realize that they are the ones who can stop the White Witch and save Narnia from the Winter Wonderland that the witch has cast upon it. With the help of a lion named Aslan they over throw the witch and Narnia has all different seasons all over again. All of the animals live in peace and harmony after the reign of the White Witch is over.This story is written for one who enjoys adventure and likes to have fun. On a scale from 1-5 I would rate it a 4 because it's one of those books that you can't put down once you start to read it. It's a children's book even though some adults enjoy reading it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"If you are familiar with Lewis' non-fiction writings (Mere Christianity, etc.) were all that Lewis had written he would have left a wonderful legacy. However, Lewis has a large library of fictional works as well.'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' is my only my second piece of Lewis fiction (the other being 'The Screwtape Letters') and I found it to be a quick, enjoyable read. The characters are likeable but sketchy, but that is understandable considering that he intended it to be a fairy tale. How much character development is there in a fairy tale?Christian themes are very strong throughout the book, but the story can be read without any previous study into Christianity. If you are unsure of the themes or want to make sure that you are not missing any, I would recommend that you pick up any of the half-dozen or more companion study guides that Amazon offers."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Lewis is amazing in many respects, one of the reasons is his ability to adapt to his audience that he is writing to. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is an amazing extension of who Lewis was. The book itself is seamless and flows from beginning to end. Lewis creates characters that are real and fun, leaving you able to become involved with the story.Aslan is a great hero, evoking a strong and protective, just and right lion who is the people's champion. Throw in the evil white witch and some naive Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve and you have a tale worth reading. The ending is very clever (especially since Lewis foreshadowed it) as Aslan brings an army to the battlefield.Don't get me wrong. Lewis says it in his opening acknowledgment. This is a fairy tale meant for children, or for an adult willing to sit down and enjoy a fairy tale, for that is what it is. Don't mistake this for a full blown fantasy series and book. The descriptions are short and concise, the characters are black and white, and the outcome is fun. That being said, there is no reason why this book, or series, cannot be enjoyed by an adult. I would recommend this book to everyone, especially to be read before the movie."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"C.S. Lewis really did a great job in creating a world known as Narnia. A little background on Narnia: Narnia is a place stuck in a winter that is never ending, it is \\"ruled\\" by the White Witch. There is only winter and no Christmas. There are many, many creatures in the land of Narnia.The book starts when 4 kids are shipped to a professors mansion during the times of WWII. They are told not to disturb the professor. They pretty much have the huge house to themselves, so there is much mischief that they can get into. Well Lucy, the youngest of the 4 one day stumbles upon a wardrobe. She enters into it, but there is not a back to the wardrobe and it leads to Narnia. She meets a creature called a Faun. He is actually a creature that is supposed to be telling the White Witch that a human entered Narnia.She gets back and her brothers and sisters don't believe her. Nevertheless later in the book they all end up in Narnia, and are stunned that Lucy had been telling the truth the whole time.The meet many creatures along the way. They meet with a Beaver and his wife and they are told of the White Witch, Aslan (a lion who the White Witch fears), and the prophecy that they would be fulfilling.Well one of the four, Edmund takes off after the White Witches palace, because they had meet before and she gave him something to eat.Aslan ends up putting down his life for Edmund after he supposedly betrays the White Witch. This is a parallel to Jesus Christ. Many other Christian thems take place after this, and I don't want to reveal them for they are amazing.Note that this book is highly recommended by me. It has a ton of Christian themes, and it takes you to a fantasy land that is amazing to me. You should definitely get this book, it's for all ages!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This magical story has amazing mythical creatures.

Lewis, teaches biblical messages through a dramatic and intriguing plot. It all begins in WWII when a mother sends her four children off to the country to live with a professor for safety. The children were very curious and often spent hours playing hide and go seek, which lead to them discovering many new rooms and parts of the mansion. One day the youngest girl, Lucy, hid in a coat wardrobe. She walked to the very back of the closet where she revealed a new land. It was snowing and right away she discovered an odd creature. Lucy eventually went back through the wardrobe and tried to explain her discoveries to her brothers and sisters but none of them believed her. Finally Lucy was given the opportunity to prove her tale and her siblings peter, Edmund and Susan followed. Once they all entered the land they were told by a creature named Tumnus that the queen would want to kill them if she ever found them. This is because they were human and threatened her power. The rest of the novel is a biblical parallel to basics tenants of Christianity. The good and evil were always at war and at one point the Lion was slain. He rose from the dead and was able to overthrow evil. This is directly related to what the bible teaches. I believe this a great story. At a young age it has a fascinating plot with magical creatures and a powerful ending. At a more mature age is has vast symbolism that still allows for an easy read, without lacking in complexity. I think the characters in the new land are remotely bizarre but I enjoyed that if left me wondering about their personality because it lacks the usual stereotypes that are often placed on everyday characters. I couldn't tell whether the character was sympathetic or an antagonistic until I kept reading. Overall I highly suggest reading this book. When the final page is read it will leave you thinking. It's a quick read with deep meaning."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"For my book I read the Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe.

Lewis, and the theme is never give up on a good cause. The story's about a family of four young Londoners being sent away by their parents to the countryside mansion of a professor to escape the German bombing of London. Soon after arriving at the mansion,Lucy (one of the children) discovers a magical wardrobe that leads to a place called Narnia. She convinces the other three (Edmund, Susan, and Peter) to come with her, and from there their adventures start. The story begins at the Professor's mansion. While exploring the mansion during a Hide-and Seek game, Lucy finds a spare room with a wardrobe in it. She goes into it, finds another world, (Narnia) and meets Mr. Tumnus, a faun who lives in Narnia. After leaving Narnia, she goes back to the real world and after a lot of trouble, convinces the others to come, too. Upon arrival, they learn that there's an evil witch controlling Narnia with eternal winter, and that she's ransacked Mr. Tumnus's house because she let Lucy escape. They make their way to a beaver dam, and learn from Mr. and Mrs. Beaver that the true king of Narnia, a lion named Aslan, has returned to depose the White Witch and restore spring. With the beavers, they set out to reach Aslan. they learn that a prophecy says that they four must fill the four thrones at a castle called Cair Paravel and rule Narnia, but all four must be there and they need Aslan's help to depose the white witch. That's more, Edmund had already seen the \\"Queen\\" and snuck away from the beaver's dam to alert her. He quickly realizes his bad choice, and wants to reunite with his siblings. Will they reunite with each other and Aslan to depose the Witch? You'll have to read to find out.Here's a quick description of what I thought of the book: It is quite interesting; always moving around so that the plot is always front center, but the plot is never stagnant or boring."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is the second best of the narnia books i like the horse and his boy a little better.but i still think this is better than others but this is even with the voyage of the dawn treader.Caleb A.

Lewis pioneered a new kind of fantasy when he wrote \\"The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- the kind where people from our world somehow get swept into another one. It's old stuff now, but Lewis was among the first to attempt such a thing. Because of its originality, and despite some rather hamhanded allegory, it remains a charmingly written, classic story.To avoid the threat of bombings in London, the four Pevensie kids are sent to stay with a wealthy, eccentric professor in the country. But strange things start to happen when Lucy finds a wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek -- when she climbs in, she finds a snowy woodland and a friendly faun. Her siblings don't believe her... until peevish Edmund also ventures through, and encounters the beautiful but evil White Witch.Soon all four are wandering through the snowy land of Narnia, encountering mythical creatures and talking animals. They also find that the four of them are at the center of a prophecy that will lead to the return of lion-messiah Aslan, and the downfall of the White Witch. But things don't go according to plan when Edmund defects to the Witch's side...How many fantasy stories are written about kids who crawl through a hedge, wander through a door or pick up a magical object, and immediately are swept off into a medieval land? Lots. And they owe a debt of gratitude to C.S. Lewis, theologian, author, and drinking buddy of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" author J.R.R. Tolkien.C.S. Lewis' story is, despite being set during World War II, very 19th-century in tone -- very charming, conversational and full of little details. He populates it with a mishmash of mythic creatures such as dryads, fauns, and talking beavers. The one flaw? Lewis gets quite hamhanded with his Christian allegory, such as Aslan's resurrection. However, he has a very good plot and charming characters to balance it out.Those characters deftly avoid being cutesy, especially by virtue of the malicious Edmund, who slowly has a change of heart after falling in with the evil Witch. He's a much more enjoyable character than his noble brother Peter, just because he's so real. And as a counterbalance, there's Lewis's sweet-natured Lucy -- which was also the name of Lewis' granddaughter.Complex characters and still-fresh stories give \\"The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" -- which is soon to be released as a major movie -- a special ambience. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"We all know this story, and how exciting and stirring it is. But hearing this dramatic and well-produced reading adds a wholly new dimension to the overall experience. The inspired choice of Michael York allows the story to unfold before your very eyes, as he paces his voice comfortably enough to make you follow along and be excited at the same time. The reading may take a long time, but York never sinks into a monotonous tone, and he also gives each character personality and depth. Particularly tellig is his satanic characterisation of the White Witch. He also avoids the tendency to make the children sound too cue or whiney. To sum everything up, this reading will be sure to capture the hearts and imaginations of anyone who listens to it, and will surely be prized highly in any Narnia lover's collection and also by those who have never heard of the Narnia stories."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is a story by C.S. Lewis, and it is the second book in a series of seven books. I feel this book is good to read for any age level from third grade to adult.Narnia is a fantasy about four children of various ages who must leave their home because of air raids. The four children have to go live in a large house with a professor in the country to keep them safe from the war. While the four children are exploring the large house they find a wardrobe in an empty room. When the children look inside the wardrobe they discover a passageway into a magical land called Narnia. In Narnia the four children are swept into one adventure after another while they try to destroy the evil White Witch so that spring will return to Narnia.Narnia is a wonderful, imaginative story that I highly recommend to children and adults of all ages. I loved all the adventure in this book and the magical creatures that they meet. I thought the children were vivid, believable characters, and I think you will find yourself cheering them on throughout their adventures. I feel that anyone who takes the time to read this book will find the ending extremely satisfying and will probably want to jump right into the third book of the Narnia series.In conclusion I give this book four stars. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars was because it was slowly paced near the beginning of the story."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the beginning of theland of Narnia for readers here in our world. The name itself evokessymbols that mean almost as much in our culture as Dorothy, the Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow.Reading this book is a lovely gift to make to your children, or to yourself. Lewis draws powerfully on our childhood desire to find ourselves in a fantasy land. The story of Peter, Susan, Lucy and Edmund being transported into Narnia makes all of think of our own childhoods in a powerful way.And from that power, Lewis can draw on the naivite and newness of children to approach faith and love and the values that accompany them. We see the very basic sin of Edmund as he betrays his siblings for just one more piece of Turkish Delight. And, so movingly, we witness his forgiveness and the love of the Lion for this one boy.Lewis disagreed with the term &quot;allegory&quot; being applied to his Narnia tales. He felt that an allegory provides tangibility to intangible values and he felt his Narnia stories deal with things that are real in our world already. He wanted to show how people might come to God if they didn't have all the baggage and preconception that &quot;our world&quot; loads on top of religious feeling.No matter how much you're reading into this book, it's a piece of magic and not to be missed. Reading it to a child will give it an even stronger place in the life of that person. Not many things mean as much to me as thoughts of the Lantern, Mr. Tumnus, the Stone Table and Lucy. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was read to me as a child and it will always be a dear, dear book to me."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Having a story that is as well rounded and deeply plotted as this, especially when we're talking about a children's story, is a feat indeed. In this respect, and in many others, C.S. Lewis as done a remarkably excellent job. The Christian morals and principles that it teaches are an excellent addition to the story, and reflect greatly off of the man who wove this story into being. Aside from being very good literature, children should also read it for the lessons that it teaches. Perseverance in the face of fear, trust in God, and love for those around you.Sadly, as so many have pointed out, few children get to experience the emotional vividness, and compelling plot line of this fairytale now a days. In addition to &quot;The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;, there are six other books in the &quot;Tales of Narnia&quot; series. My advice to parents is to read all of these to your children, or, if your kids are old enough, have them read them on their own. Everybody should read the series at least one time, and if you haven't, your missing a great piece of American literature.It's still amazing to me that all of these thoughts and concepts came from one man's head, and that through the God given gift of words, C.S. Lewis changed the lives of millions."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"*The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* begins the enchanting series of Narnia books as, in a game of hide and seek, intrepid Lucy stumbles through a wardrobe and into Narnia -- a delightful world of dryads and fauns and dwarves and animals that talk. Lucy finds, however, that as things stand, Narnia is a land of perpetual winter ruled over by an evil witch. Worse, even though it's always winter, it's never Christmas (note allegorical material beginning to rise to the surface). Lucy must return to her house, convince her brothers (especially the aptly named Peter) and sister that Narnia actually exists, and, with the help of Aslan, the great lion, defeat the witch and bring spring back to the land. She has her work cut out for her.As readers, so do many of us. For in this most delicate and charming and gemlike of books, C.S. Lewis has planted as heavy-handed an allegory as anything Edmund Spenser wrote in *The Faerie Queene*. Lucy, as her name denotes, brings &quot;light&quot; to Narnia and England. Aslan is Christ. Narnia is the postlapsarian world. Aslan (Christ) must, according to the rules of the Emperor-over-the-sea (God), die so that Lucy's brother, Edmund, (the sinner) can be saved (Saved). After his death, Aslan comes back to life (is resurrected) and defeats the witch (temptation/the devil). Through the spilling of his blood (Blood) all of Narnia is renewed (finds grace). If your religious beliefs compell you to point this not-so-deep meaning out to your own children, then do so, but please don't spread the word. When teaching this book in a college-level course on Children's Literature, I have too many times seen the years of joy this book has given my students quenched by my Outing Of The Allegory. This quenching is nondenominational.What I write now would not bring joy to C.S. Lewis, but the true miracle of the Narnia series, to this reviewer, lies in its astonishing ability to survive its own allegory. On the literal level, these books are marvelous: they are invigorating, heady, filled with heroism and magic, great deeds and quests. They should not be missed by children of any faith. My two sons love the series, and, frankly, as far as the hidden meaning is concerned, I dread the day that they are finally old enough to ask about it, and I am weak enough to tell."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy have been sent to live with a professor in the country during the London air-raids. While exploring the large house, Lucy finds that the wardrobe in the spare room transports her to the magical land of Narnia. The country is under the spell of a terrible witch who has made it always winter but never Christmas. At first, her siblings don't believe her, but soon they, too, find themselves in this new country. With danger around every turn, they must survive treachery to join Aslan the lion in the fight to free Narnia and break the spell.I read this book for the first time in third grade, and it holds up just as well today. The pace of the writing is a bit slow, but the adventure is sure to hook readers. Lewis creates a wonderful fanciful world that is lots of fun to visit. This is the first I read and still my favorite. There's something about this book that captures the wonder of finding a new, magical world that the other books don't have.Lewis also created just the right spell for his land to horrify kids and to a lesser extend adults. The idea of always having winter and all it brings but never getting to celebrate Christmas is too awful to mention.A brief word about book order. When I read this book, it was considered the first in the series. Now, some people have put the books in chronological order, making it the second. While I fell that reading them in the original order is the best approach, it really doesn't matter that much. Nothing about the other books is spoiled here since this was the first one written, but not much about this book is spoiled if you read them in the order events occur.Narnia is one of several classic kids' series about mythical countries and is still my favorite. It's perfect for anyone wanting to leave our world behind for a touch of fantasy."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"EXCELLENT!

Four orphans, Edmund, Susan, Lucy, Peter are adopted by an old scientist. Little did they know they were moving to a mansion, and didn't know what they were getting themselves into. The four children then started playing games inside the house and stumbled across a massive wardrobe. Inside was a magical place called Narnia.C.S. Lewis put this fantasy together spectacularly. In Narnia there is evil, such as the White Witch, who creates many conflicts throughout the book. There is also something to stop the evil, and that would be Aslan the Lion and the four orphans Lucy, Edmund, Peter, and Susan. A conflict that really frightened me is when Aslan the Lion was close to death. He was captured by the White Witch, and was murdered on a stone alter. I was surprised what happened to Aslan the Lion after he was murdered.C.S. Lewis did an awesome job writing this novel. In my opinion this is the best fantasy I have ever read.

Somewhere in which only you can help save everyone in the name of righteousness? This is what happens to Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy in The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.The four siblings are sent away from their home because of a raging war. Living in a professor's house, they are given many strictly enforced rules by an employee of the professor. While playing a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy, the youngest of the siblings hides in a wardrobe. To her surprise and amazement, she has found a country all her own, Narnia.When Peter, Susan and Edmund journey into Narnia along with Lucy, they discover that she is telling the truth and that they are the key to a prophecy. But, Edmund goes missing and they have to fight a battle to not only get Edmund back, but to save Narnia.Whenever C.S. Lewis is describing settings, I can easily picture the icy castles, the beaver's dam and the frozen lake. One particular quote that sticks out in my mind as a good example is:\\"There, a beautiful sight met their eyes. The sun was setting behind their backs, that meant that they whole country below them lay in the evening light--- forests and hills and valleys, and winding away like a silver snake, the lower part of the great river.\\"The 189-page book is a fantastic read for fantasy-lovers.

Lewis wrote in his Chronicles of Narnia series. Even though \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" occurs first chronologically (and is now listed as #1 in most sets), this book is a much better introduction to the land of talking animals and, more importantly, to Aslan. Though children from our world are the main characters in this (and other) Narnia stories, the true hero is Aslan, The Great Lion and Son of the Emperor-Over-the-Sea.Though this is written as a fairytale for children it follows C. S. Lewis's philosophy that, \\"A children's story that can only be enjoyed by children is not a good children's story in the slightest.\\" Aslan is clearly a Christ character and each book, besides being a fun fantasy story, explores a different aspect of His character. This book reveals Aslan as Redeemer."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is a wonderful audio edition of The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, perfect for car trips. However, if you are planning to read along with in the book, this is not the audio cd to purchase."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"You know, I can't help but question whether a book like this would be published today. There's a lot of telling, not so much showing, a lot of action is skimmed over and it's very obviously a religious allegory (not that that would make it ineligible for publication). I couldn't help but think that as I read it but at the same time I couldn't help but think just how magical the story actually is.Compare the circumstances to other works now and you don't have all that much that is original but then, back in 1950, this was the epitome of original. There was nothing else like this story except for facetious fairy tales that carried very little depth. This was the basis for portals and other worlds and magical creatures that authors today either consciously or subconsciously pull from for their own stories. So no, it's not original today but it is the very reason it's not original today, because it was so original and magical then that it was bound to spurn derivatives.This is a classic fairy tale despite the obvious Jesus references (if I could find that YouTube video, I'll post it, with Aslan as Jesus). It's light and airy and the kind that, obviously without me saying it, will stand the test of time for many more years to come. The children are eternally relatable , their wishes are forever there in the reader, to escape to a magic land and become king or queen. There's nothing in there that couldn't appeal to anyone, at any time, reading it.When comparing this book to something like Stardust by Neil Gaiman, I think the voice of Narnia just stands out. This was Lewis's voice. He was born to write these types of fantastical stories in the style of an age-old fairy tale. While Gaiman's idea for Stardust was on the level of awesome, the voice just wasn't right. There was a sort of force there, a trying too hard. I use Gaiman as an example because (aside from the fact that I can't think of any other authors that have tried to write like this) he's a magnificent writer and writes amazing stories. Stardust was an experiment for him, not his usual voice so it's not chalked up to him not being able to write. That old timey style voice of fairy story telling is bestowed only on a select few. Lewis was one of those few.These stories are capable of transcending time with ease and are written in such a way that they'll never go out of style. Sure, you'd have to be either really damn good or someone of Gaiman's status in the publishing industry to get something like this published now, and even then there's no guarantee of equivalence, but it doesn't erase the fact that Narnia was published, does exist and will continue to exist for generations. There is a classicism about these stories that just can't be erased and just can't be mimicked unless you've been bestowed with the voice to do it.Yes, there is so much that could be expanded on in Narnia but what's already there on the pages is amazing. Perhaps it is because it's the epitome of a fairy tale and someone who's much more critical than I can might be able to see how empty of a plate it might be but to me, there's just enough there to trust the reader. It's not bogged down in worldbuilding infodumping or unimportant backstory or research masturbation on the part of the author. All that's there is what's important to the story at hand, and nothing else. It goes from point to point seamlessly and with little to no fat and, for me anyway, makes the experience of the read that much more enjoyable.The world misses fairy tales like this, in all their simplicity but I don't think there can be much more than what there is now without an inundation which would only devalue what's already available. Let's hope the world never has to know what it's like to live without Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Okay, I finally got around to reading one of the most famous children's fantasies series ever done. Depending on who you talk to, this is actually the second book in the series if you read it by topic, but Lewis wrote this one first, dedicating it to his goddaughter Lucy Barfield. While perusing the Large Print editions of fiction in my local library, I was very pleased to discover this entire series by Lewis, and it is the illustrated version to boot! (Illustrations are b&w; line sketches by Pauline Baynes, much like the illustrated edition of the classic Wind in the Willows). The text of the book runs about 44,000 words so it is not a lengthy or deep read. It is intended for young children, possibly to be read to them. But this entire series is also an allegorical tale of Christianity, not just a simple fairy tale.In the first book of the series (thematically speaking), Lewis tells of creation, when he relates how The Magician's Nephew plays a part in the creation of the world of Narnia. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is therefore a children's tale about triumph over evil, about the Christ and his redemption and the kingdom of God restored back to faithful believers, and the defeat of Satan. The gospel in a juvenile nutshell, to be exact. In the subsequent books of the series, Lewis deals with fulfilling our destiny with God's plan for our life (The Horse and His Boy); joy in the midst of tempest, with Christ as our conqueror (Prince Caspian); how we can be influenced by a future eternity if our hearts are set toward heaven (The Voyage of the Dawn Treader); a victorious hope against death with our resurrection (The Silver Chair); and the coming Armageddon and return of Jesus Christ and the new heaven and earth (The Last Battle). This all makes compelling reading, when you consider the hopelessness and misdirected avenues taken in sagas such as the Lord of the Rings and the Harry Potter series, which are sword and sorcery without any redeeming values.The story is very simple. Four children, Peter, Lucy, Susan and Edmund, all brothers and sisters, are sent away to a safe house in the English countryside to avoid the WW2 blitz in London. A friendly Professor takes them in. they explore the huge and strange house they are in and accidentally discover a magical passageway into a frozen world full of odd creatures. Lucy first falls through the doors of a wardrobe in one of the rooms, and discovers the world of Narnia. The others follow soon thereafter, and are soon involved in the mystery of this place. They get to meet Aslan, the lion king of Narnia, who has returned to reclaim his kingdom from the wicked White Witch. A sacrifice is made and a battle or two is fought, and Narnia is saved. This is plainly the good vs evil of the gospel accounts of the Christian Bible.Aslan (surely the original \`lion king') is a type of Christ, right up to his sacrificial death at the hands of the witch (Satan). Lewis wastes no time about fine details but carries his young characters right along briskly from scene to scene. I was a bit put off by the appearance of the character of Father Christmas and his reindeer and sleigh and gifts (a type of Santa) but at least Lewis had the courtesy to have this jolly guy praise the king (Aslan) as the real power of giving and love and joy. The entire story is chock-block full of Christian typology, in spite of many critics thinking otherwise. Lewis was perhaps the last century's best and most loved Christian apologist, and he has given the world of youth something very moralistic and divine to sink their teeth into here.I have no doubt that I will read the others sometime. I was prompted to read this one now because there is a very recent movie release based on this particular book, and I want to see it as well. The movie versions of the world of Narnia which were done before were effective in their day, including an animated TV series. The British are experts at this sort of thing. There are even Bible study courses using the characters in this enduring book series. The website ChristianityToday.com offers a lot of help in that direction. Walden Media, a division of Walt Disney Pictures, has produced the latest version of this story in full feature mode, and it is directed by Andrew Adamson, who also directed the previously successful and popular movies Shrek and Shrek II. While the movie audiences of the world seem to be on a quest for mythological escapism at the theaters, there isn't a great deal there of intelligent design or of upright moral teachings. This is a refreshing difference, and the old saying that \\"the book is usually better\\" is still very true in this age of computer-generated images and highly paid actors.I have never been a fan of science fantasy or any of the plethora of sword & sorcery literature out there - I've rarely seen the sense of it all. But if good themes and morals can be portrayed in an entertaining and different way, I will pay attention. While Tolkein's Lord of the Ring series bored me to no end (movies included) and while Harry Potter or the Wizard of Oz or the uncounted TV series which barf out those constant and stilted tales of witches and ghosts and phantom warriors and occultic happenstances, a series like this, composed by someone I personally consider to be the most capable writer in the English languange of the past century, is a treat in every way. An older child-centered adventure that is slow but more appealing is The Princess and the Goblin by George Macdonald, who was an important influence on Lewis."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a great book for people of all ages. The adventure begins when Lucy finds a magical wardrobe that takes her, her two brothers and sister into Narnia, a land full of magic, fun, and adventure."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the WardrobeA good book is the type of book that will keep the reader's attention and keep them wanting to read more of that book or author. The story in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a very interesting story. It's interesting because it's a story about this magic land inside of a coat closet, so it get you think about how Narnia got in a closet. The story is age-appropriate, and it would appeal to the kids because it is a Fantasy and Adventure story. That type of age group loves stories that have adventure. The book is very well written and easy to understand; C.S. Lewis is a good author. It is easy to conclude from the title and formation of the book that it has something to do with a lion, a witch and a wardrobe.The theme of the story is that good will triumph over evil and that you have got to have trust in people. Yes the theme is worth conveying to children to let them know that good will overpower evil with the right tools and attitude. The theme is moralistic and it may be a little overly moralistic to some people because of the religious connection. In my opinion the theme is not overly moralistic.The plot of the story is very well constructed. It introduces you to the land of Narnia, and sets each piece of the story in the right spot at the right time. It's not a confusing plot, it's a very easy plot to follow. The plot of the story is original and fresh, but the believable part is a little hard. You have to try and really work to believe kids have the power to save a whole magical land. All the characters, especially Lucy, seem really convincing and credible. They all grow from the experience in different ways, some grow in imagination and some in trust, and all four kids are changed by going to the land of Narnia.This is a very good story for all ages to read; it has the important elements of a great story, the laughter and the tears. You learn from this book really fast who is good and who is not. It has symbolism to reading that is really subtle, but if you pay attention, you will pick up on it. I like the book because of the air of mystery with what is in the wardrobe and at first only one of the kids, Lucy, believes in Narnia. It is a really good book that all kids need to read. You will like it; it is one of my favorites.Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (Chronicles of Narnia S.)"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"How can you not love The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe?

So do you want to read a great adventurous book? If you do then The Chronicles of Narnia is the right book for you. There are four kids [peter (oldest), Susan, Edmond, and Lucy (youngest)] who have to leave their home in London because there are air raids. So they have to get on a train and go to a place far away from their home. They go to a house in the country where a professor lives and the professor has a house keeper. When the kid's get there the house keeper makes many rules for them and the most important rule that the house keeper made sure they heard was \\"don't bother the professor!\\" While they were playing one day they find a magical wardrobe that leads to a mystery land called Narnia, while in Narnia siblings have to learn to trust and believe in them selves and in others in order to get through Narnia. Ultimately Edmond is tricked by the white witch and leaves his brother and sisters. They must rescue him, but how can three kids defeat a powerful and mystical witch?The Chronicles of Narnia is a book for everyone. It has a great adventure and once you start reading it you're hooked. The whole book is basically a rising action as each page gets better. It also has some action and a little magic. It has a lot of different creatures. With a very creative story, this book is fiction and fantasy.The Chronicles of Narnia is really similar to the movie version of The Chronicles of Narnia. The book just has a lot more description than the movie. For example: in the book they tell the setting everywhere and when they get to the beavers house they describe everything and in the movie they just show the house while they are walking into it. They both make a good picture in your mind. They both have the same characters.There are no weaknesses and nothing I didn't like about the Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe. The book makes you wonder what is going to happen next, example there is never a slow boring part. The book is always moving and it feels like you are moving with it or in it. It is great all the way to the end. In conclusion this book will blow your mind. A never ending adventure that takes you with it. Full of action waiting to happen, when you pick it up and start reading it you won't want to put it down.

Fiction is not my cup of tea, but if there is anyone who could give me a taste for it, C.S. Lewis would be the one. Several years ago I read Lewis' classic, Mere Christianity, and I have had a growing interest in reading his fictional piece, The Screwtape Letters. I decided to read roughly a chapter a night to my girls who have seen both the BBC and Disney versions of the movie. It was a little difficult for Grace, my four year old, to always follow the story, but Rose, my seven year old, enjoyed hearing about the secret land beyond the wardrobe. Upon completion of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, both Rose and Grace have expressed on one more than one occasion their disappointment that I am not continuing on with Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia, the second of seven books in The Chronicles of Narnia series.

I mention this fact since many readers have access to the seven Narnia books and may wish to read \\"Nephew\\" first. Of course I am assuming you are reading these comments BEFORE you read the books!In any event \\"Wardrobe\\" introduced us to the Pevensie children Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy.

LewisReview by Cameron J. HumpherysIn this marvelous book by C.S. Lewis, The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe, the settings are the Professor's house and Narnia. Narnia is a magical land where animals can talk and an evil Witch who thinks she'sQueen made it forever winter but never Christmas.The main characters in this book are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. These four siblings along with Aslan, a great lion with great powers, work to help free Narnia from the oppressive Witch, who has ruled by fear for a long time.When Aslan gave himself up to die instead of Edmund to appease a deep magic he activated an even deeper magic which kept him alive. Aslan being alive and the Witch not knowing it made it so that he could un-freeze those that the Witch had turned to stone. Leading the people who were once frozen into battle, they gained the upper hand and defeated the Witch.My favorite part of the story is when the four children are crowned as Kings and Queens of Narnia. The reason I like that part is that the Witch is dead and there isn't a care in the world and the children are happy. People should read this book because it is an action packed adventure and a great read.One person I think changed during the story is Edmund. The reason why I think Edmund changed is that at the beginning of the story he is spiteful. One example of his spitefulness is when he saw Narnia and said, \\"I was just playing with Lucy nothing really happened.\\" But at the end of the story he is kind and good. An example of his goodness is when he breaks the Witch's wand."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I purchased this book to introduce two middle school girls to this classic child's literature.

I know people are always weary to pick up a book that has a religious theme to it but C.S. Lewis is enjoyable no matter what you choose to believe.During WWII, Peter, Edmund, Susan, and Lucy Pevensie have to leave London and their mother as they seek refuge in the English countryside with Digory Kirke. The children amuse themselves by exploring and playing games; one day, Lucy steps into a wardrobe and into Narnia, a magical land where she meets Tumnus, a friendly faun, who invites her to him home and tells her about the evil White Witch.When she returns to the real world, Peter, Edmund, and Susan believe she's lying; Edmund, however, goes into the wardrobe and enters Narnia. He has the misfortune of meeting the White Witch who bribes him with Turkish Delight and encourages him to bring Peter and his sisters back with him.While trying to hide from a group of visitors, the four Pevensie children pile into the wardrobe and step back into Narnia; Lucy leads them to Tumnus' house but finds that he has been taken by the White Witch. From then on, the children meet friends, battle the power of evil temptation, and search for the true King of Narnia: Aslan.This story is unlike anything I've ever read before. I couldn't help but admire the brilliant way Lewis wove together so many stories yet made it uniquely his own. Making a trip into Narnia is something everyone should do and your first step is The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Like JACK AND THE BEANSTALK, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, HARRY POTTER, THE WIZARD OF OZ and so many other children's stories that have entered the realm of literature classics, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE begins with the discovery of an obscure gateway into another land. Peter, Susan, and Edmund Pevensie, children living with their uncle in a sprawling country house in the English countryside believe their youngest sister's stories of her visit to an enchanted winterbound land ruled by an evil white witch to be the product of an overheated imagination. For no other reason than to humour her and to prove her story wrong, they skeptically follow her into a dark, musty wardrobe. To their great surprise, they find they have all walked through a magical portal into the country known as Narnia.On the surface, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE is a simple children's allegory with characters drawn from a deep well of literary predecessors including English folk tales and Norse and Greek mythology - talking animals, Mr and Mrs Beaver, Father Christmas, dwarves and giants, fauns, unicorns and centaurs, dryads, sentient trees, a snarling, frightful wolf who is the henchman of the evil white queen, black magic, and a great lion called Aslan who mysteriously returns from an extended absence to help Narnia's beleaguered subjects release the magical grip of a never-ending bleak, icy winter and allow the return of the much longed for beauty and warmth of spring and summer.But, at a deeper level, CS Lewis is well known for his Christian references and this story is no exception. Virtually any adult reader will recognize Aslan's heroic self-sacrifice to save Edmund's life and his return from death atop the witch's Stone Table as a clear symbolic allusion to Christ's crucifixion for the redemption of earth's sinners and his resurrection from the dead. While some readers may disagree, I found the allusions considerably less than subtle. While they were entirely obvious, almost painfully so, they were also, perhaps paradoxically, unobtusive and neither pedantic nor sermonizing. As a result, readers of any faith (or lack thereof) will be able to accept and enjoy the symbolism or simply ignore it and focus on the charm of the story as it might be seen from a child's point of view.The obvious overriding theme is good versus evil and, as is the case with most children's stories, good will out. The ending, not unexpectedly, is a suitably happy one that will satisfy a child reader or perhaps a youngster who is happily listening to a parent reading the story over several nights before bedtime. Highly recommended.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story, and a great film!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"C.S. Lewis has conjured a world that millions have adored with incredible creatures(far more than the Lord of the Rings has). The one thing that I'm fed up with is people comparing this to Christian beliefs. It's not that I'm unchristian but I think that this makes people believe that only christians can read the book. Anyone can read the books because though it can be viewed as a tale that instills christian faith its really just a fantasy story at heart. Even C.S. Lewis himself said that Narnia was not supposed to be a direct comparison with christianity. So please enjoy the book or go see the new movie and please don't get religion involved with it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I can't even begin to say how many times I've read \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" or the other books in the Narnia series. I grew up reading these books time and again, and each journey into this imaginary land is as fresh and exciting as the first journey there.\\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is a very simple fairy story at first glance: four children who have been squired to the English countryside to escape the London bombings during WWII find an entrance into a magical world through a wardrobe door. Yet underneath the surface, much is at work, as Lewis weaves myths and faith into a spellbinding adventure. When Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy enter Narnia, it is under the spell of the evil White Witch who can only be defeated when Aslan returns and the prophecy (which involves them) is fulfilled.For those only familiar with the writings that C.S. Lewis has done on religion and Christian apologetics, the notion of him writing a children's book must seem strange. Yet Lewis' first love was the myths and fairy stories that he devoured as a child, and Narnia is full of those creatures that sprang to life in his dreams. Lewis and his friend J.R.R. Tolkien were once under the impression that if they wanted to read the sort of stories that they liked, they would have to be the ones to write them. How many adventures they have taken readers on, and will continue to do so for generations to come."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Having been a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings for a long time, I picked up a book by J.R.R. Tolkien's friend, C.S. Lewis. I wasn't sure if I wanted to read LWW first, as it was the first published, or to begin with The Magician's Nephew, as Lewis himself had said he preferred as the opening novel in the Chronicles. Although this is the only Chronicle I've read so far, I'm glad I started with The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.From the moment Lucy explores the back of her makeshift hiding place and begins to find trees and snow on the ground and the famous lamppost, being completely free of the knowledge of how Narnia originated lets the reader experience the same wonder and amazement that the characters feel. I was entranced by the mystery of the land and its inhabitants. I don't think I would've felt the same way if I had prior knowledge of Aslan, Jadis, or the history of Narnia.The story itself reads very quickly and is sparse with details in areas, such as the battle at the end, but it allows the reader to fill in with their own imaginations whatever is not outright told to them by the author. Anyone who loves visiting fantastic worlds, such as Middle-Earth or Hogwarts, I heartily recommmend this book."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"... of Michael York.

The young reader noticed that the books were published out of order as far as the Narnian time line goes with the creation of Narnia occuring in \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (the sixth book published). In the letter, the child asked which order the books should be read in. Lewis replied that it was really up to the reader, but he prefered them chronologically within the Narnian world which places \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" first. SO it is up to the reader whether you want to read them in the new order (approved by the author) or their publication order. Either way you do it, \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" occurs at the same time \\"The Lion and the Witch and the wardrobe\\" occurs. I read them both ways, and LW&W is a better \\"first book\\" because it's more action oriented than MN. It was more interesting for me as a young reader to go back in time and read about the creation of one of my favorite fantasy worlds...every reader might not agree (obviously the publishers and the Lewis family don't). Enjoy them either way!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is, of course, loved by millions as a classic, and it truly deserves its distinction. Rarely will any reader of any genre find a story so moving and entertaining and so enlightening. I can't recommend anything more highly than this little volume.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is the story of Lucy, Edmund, Susan, and Peter who wander through an old wardrobe into the magical world of Narnia. What follows is their adventure as they team with a nation of talking animals and other magical creatures versus the evil powers in the kingdom. The novel climaxes with one extraordinary act of love which tears through the kingdom and changes everything and everyone after.The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is such a successful novel. It does serve as a wonderfully powerful read. The book also enlightens the reader with its commentary Christian symbolism on the nature of love. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a classic, and I really think that it is just now coming into what may be its most popular period. The world is pleading for some type of meaning, and here, Lewis is willing to offer it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Unlike most of the rest of the world, I never read this series as a kid. With the movie coming out, I thought I would take a look as an adult. While the story is nice and there are some fantasy elements that would be appealing to kids, it seems odd to me to compare this book to epics like Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, principally because there is just not much there. The story is short and simple, the battles barely rate a couple of sentences of description, there is a bit of repetition, and the characters are fairly simply drawn. Don't get me wrong: I have no problem with the allegorical message or the story for what it is, but is is more akin to A Wrinkle in Time in terms of depth and detail than it is to Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter. Thus, it is more likely to be appealing to younger kids than to those able to tackle more extensive and more complex reading material. YA readers who like Narnia might also like Jean Rabe's The Finest Creation."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"When four English siblings (Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy) are sent to the country to avoid the air raids in London, they find a secret passageway in a wardrobe that leads them to an imaginary land called Narnia. Here the four young children meet a few interesting characters: Tumnus the Faun, a half-goat/half-man that befriends Lucy when she's lost; the Beaver family who help the children elude the White Witch and her dangerous allies; and, lastly, the White Witch herself, who has laid claim over Narnia with her year-round winter spell and her self-proclaimed title: \\"Queen of Narnia\\". She is also the one who lures Edmund to her side with endless supplies of Turkish Delight and subtle hints of him becoming King.During their adventures, the four children ultimately meet Aslan, the rightful king of Narnia who has returned, at last, to reclaim his land from the evil queen. Together they--along with the help of several other mystical beings--aim to defeat the White Witch and return Narnia to its original state and ownership.After reading \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", you'll definitely want to read the following books in this series: \\"Prince Caspian\\" (#2), \\"The Voyage of the 'Dawn Treader'\\" (#3), \\"The Silver Chair\\" (#4), \\"The Horse and His Boy\\" (#5), \\"The Magician's Nephew\\" (#6), and \\"The Last Battle\\" (#7). Although \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" is geared for children age 8 to 12, I consider it appropriate for all ages and encourage everyone to read it.I received the entire Narnia collection from one of my aunts when I was a kid, either for my birthday or some other holiday--I don't remember. Anyway, this book/series has been one of my all-time favorites ever since. It's a wonderful fantasy meant for children, but will inspire adults as well. Highly recommended. It also makes a wonderful gift. ;)There are some Christian undertones in this book, such as the terms \\"Daughter of Eve\\" and \\"Son of Adam\\" for humans in Narnia, as well as Aslan's sacrifice for Edmund; however, I don't really regard The Chronicles of Narnia as a religious series. You can expect a wholesome story, but not to worry--it isn't preachy or overly self-righteous.Several years after it was published, \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was made into a TV series in the late 60s, which I never saw because I wasn't born yet. Plus it only aired in the UK. About ten years later, in 1979 (the year I was born), a cartoon movie was made, but I didn't see that one either. The only movie I vaguely recall watching was the 1988 movie starring Richard Dempsey, Sophie Cook, Jonathan R. Scott, and Sophie Wilcox. I remember that even then I wasn't too impressed with it, not as much as I was with the book.So, for those who love children's fantasies, or are just C. S. Lewis fans, then I highly recommend this book and series. It's well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"While this is not my favorite book in the Chronicles of Narnia, it still merits five stars and is an excellent book. Few authors can capture the imagination like C. S. Lewis was able to do, and I doubt that many will ever be able to again. This book is unbelievable, yet believable. Extraordinary and impossible things happen, yet Lewis describes things like the meal set before them at the Beaver's Dam so eloquently and vividly, it makes you seem as if you were there, and when you realize you are not, you are suddenly very hungry and wishing you had some fresh fish just caught from the icy river.In addition to being a fantastic story, it contains a point, something which many modern fictional stories fail to do. In this book, C. S. Lewis lays out the crucifixion and Ressurection of Christ, except in Narnia Christ is not a man, but a lion, and not named Jesus, but Aslan. The power and majesty of the Great Lion impresses one while reading, yet his kindness and love shine through no weaker. Lewis does an amazing job of presenting to us the Christ of another world, and I cannot imagine anyone doing a much better job of it.If you have seen the recent movie which models itself after this book, you have seen but a shadow of the real thing. The book is thousands of times better than either the PBS version or the new release. The new release managed to take the focus off of Aslan and put it instead on the children by talking about how the hope that the children have brought has ended the winter, whereas in the book, it was Aslan's power which did it (among numerous other changes to this effect). The movie both lowers Aslan and the importance of the death and ressurection of Aslan, and I think that it fails to capture the real essense of this work. The real thing is so much better, it is well worth the time required to read it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I've read this book two or three times and it is always great. C.S. Lewis's writing is very original and friendly. The pictures are very nice and the story itself is exciting and entertaining. There are obvious allusions to the story of Jesus, but I like to think of it just as a lovely little story that really everyone can have their own interpretation to. P.S. If you think that this book is just for children, you probably aren't the type of person who would like it anyway."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I'd rate this six stars if I could!

There Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy find their way through the back of a wardrobe into the magic land of Narnia. Lucy is the first one that discovers the fantasyland of Narnia and met there Mr. Tumnus, a faun who explained how Narnia was controled by the White Witch who has cursed the land with eternal winter. These kids knew that the Witch had to be fought so that Narnia could return into its normal state.When the four of them went into the magic land of Narnia, Edmund was being controled by the witch. He made a deal with the White Witch, since he didn't know the witch wanted to turn him and the others into stone so that they could from part of her stone statues collection. the deal was that if he bring the others to her castle by the next day, he was going to become and turned into King of Narnia, which wasn't true at all.then they assist Aslan the great golden lion to triumph over the witch and in a blink of an eye all their lives changed."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I feel that any parent who would not encourage their child to read C.S. Lewis' &quot;Chronicles of Narnia&quot; should be charged with neglect. Even though these stories are a kiddie version of the &quot;Bible&quot;, where Jesus of Nazareth is replaced by a lion, they are fun to read and bring out the goodness in everyone. These books also show, not just children but anyone who reads them, that people can be swayed by evil, but that everyone can be true at heart. These action adventures have had a lasting impression on me. Yes, I understood that C.S. Lewis was just covering up Christianity with a lion's mane, but I have not let that affect my relegious views in any way. I did take the lessons of kindness and forgiveness to heart however. Even though my nephew was only a year old this past Christmas, I bought him the whole set of the &quot;Narnia Chronicles&quot;, hoping that someday he will find joy in them like I did."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I would never give any book a 10, unless it captured my heart time and time again, this book deserves it.

It makes my day bright and gay to read about such happy adventures that the four children have together. At least it's much better than reading about the misfortune in Jonsboro, Arkansas or about some gangs shooting at one another, etc. The Chronicles of Narnia are a wonderful collection to pass down from generation to generation.

Presently, I am looking for information as I am composing a project on Clive Staple Lewis and the Narnia books. I have encouraged all of my friends to get wrapped up in them and they indeed have; and have all thanked me. There are so many great sites with amazing things. I never look at any of the pictures of the characters, since I do not want the way I have created them with my imagination to be replaced by an artist's point of view (no offense). In conclusion, I would like to say that I think everyone should be swept into Narnia, no matter what age they might be, they will all find the books (especially 'The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe') fascinating and delightful.

There are little lessons in morality, religion, history, and undeniable fantasy wrapped in a story sure to please. I read this book again and again and from the moment Lucy steps through the wardrobe door and pushes her way back through what seems and impossibly large wardrobe, through fur coat after coat, and finally into the forest, hearing the snow crunch beneath her feet, I was hooked.

I think there is a lot more feeling of things being explained at the right times if the books are read in the order C S Lewis intended them to be read in, but whatever order they're in, they all still give an incredible feeling of magic waiting just round the corner. Even though I'm old enough now to see the the religious allegory in the book, I'd really rather not.It's a clever way of explaining Christianity to children, but for me seeing it as a religious allegory takes a little of the wonder away from it.

Read this book."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"When I was in junior high school, my teacher introduced me to the Chronicles of Narnia and she seemed very enthusiastic about it. So I tried it and found it a bit wordy for my liking. But I read on anyway and I became quite interested in the mythical world of Narnia, which is just like Oz, only with fabulous creatures and beasts. And I had seen the children's picture books featuring the noble lion, Aslan and the fearless children as well as remembering the animated show I saw on the TV years ago - so right now I am falling into love all over again! Now I just can't wait to re-read the remarkable tale of bestiary as soon as I can get my hands on a copy! One thing that really puzzles me, though - how come the very first book, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is reprinted as the second book???!!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE has become one of the best-known children's books in the world. The most known of C.S. Lewis's CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, it tells the story of how Peter, Susan, Edmud, and especially Lucy helped Aslan rid his world of Narnia of the White Witch. This story, with it's sweetness and simplness, is the true best of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA, a golden classic, telling a story that led up to Narnia's Golden Age! The descriptions are wonderful and the charecters are so lively....

They are playing Hide-and-Seek one day, when Lucy hid in the wardrobe she expected to hit the back. She ended up in a whole new world. There is an evil witch trying to take control of Narnia. The four children embark on an exciting quest to stop the witch and save Narnia.I enjoyed this book for many reasons, but also there were some parts that were a little annoying. Some of the good things about this book are that the fantasy world Narniaseems very realistic. The characters are also very believable, they have human-like characteristics. The characters are animals, that talk and act just like humans. Some of the annoying things that are in this book are: the way C. S. switches between characters it some times confuses me. Also I didn't understand all of the words used.All in all, if you enjoy fantasy, different worlds, and adventure you'll love this book!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I had initially heard about the book &quot;The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe&quot; as it was staged as a play. Back then, I had absolutely no idea what the Chronicles of Narnia were, and why my theology teacher had been mentioning it as a recommended read. Upon reading it, you would initially say that it is a beautifully worded work of prose. Dare I say I had thought it to be a children's book, but upon finishing it, I had to change my view. This is no ordinary book, and in my opinion, it is C.S. Lewis' way of teaching his grandchildren how life is, and what is in store for each and everyone of us. Definitely a good book."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The book is a cool book about 4 kids, and they go into a wardrobe.

The main characters were Edmund, Lucy, Peter, Susan, White Witch, and Aslan the lion. I thought it was cool how Lucy just went into the wardrobe and found a magical place called Naria. It was awfully cruel of the faun Mr. Tumnus to be working for the White Witch although it was cool how he told the truth about it. I did not like it when the other children didn't believe Lucy, but then Edmund found it and the White Witch and he thought she was the Queen of Naria. It was weird though when she made a hot drink and turkish delight out of snow and something in a bottle. I love though the way the beavers let the four children come in to their house that was so kind of them. It was cool how they let the children even eat dinner with them. It was sad though about how Mr. Tumnus the guy faun that Lucy met got taken away by the police. The when the spell started to break I cheered up. But then something happened to the children which I must not say. And there is also much more which I must not say."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a book about a group of kids, a mysterious new world, a kind hearted lion and a evil witch. The children find a wardrobe of which they can enter into a whole other world. This world is Narnia. In Narnia, the evil witch made it winter all year \`round with no Christmas. The children soon find out that they are the only humans and the animals can talk. Also they find out that they can stay in Narnia as long as they want and they wont lose any time on earth. The children and Aslan, the lion save Narnia become kings and queens and rule Narnia for many years with out ever losing a second of earth time.My favorite part of the book is the great big war between good and evil when the children find out that Aslan (even though he sacrificed himself to save them) came back to life and they fight side by side animal and human fighting for a common ground. The witch has great big ugly beasts on her side but Aslans army is far more cunning then these barbarians. Together, they defeat evil and rule the land of Narnia.I have read many fantasy books in my life and this one is not my favorite to say the least. If you want a quick read this is the book for you but if you want a book that will keep you reading for months I suggest the Shannara series by Terry Brooks. This was a good book but it could have been better. Overall this book has me satisfied and I will probably read the rest of the chronicles of Narnia series.

It was very exciting. It always had action in the book. It had a very great and fascanating plot. I loved how they walked into a different world. It was cool when all the characters were in the book.It was the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Have you ever imagined being sent away to someone's house, that has a secret that no one knows but you? The house in The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe had a secret , which only Peter, Susan,Edmund, and Lucy knows. Once they went through the wardrobe in the house,their adventures would begin in the land called Narnia, and their lives will change.I love this book, because it tells about Lucy trying to save her friend Tumnus. It tells about the wonderful adventures she had with her friends, Peter, Susan, and Edmund and the great dangers they faced in Narnia. I also liked the little rhymes that describes Aslan, the great lion.I wish that this book would be longer and the adventures of Narnia would countinue in this book.I recommend this book for people who like adventure stories, because this book is filled with adventures.My favorite part is when the dwarf made Edmond a prisoner and used a whip to threaten him to go faster. If the White Witch ( a terrible witch) that calls herself queen of Narnia wants Edmond to go faster, the dwarf whips him until he goes faster.My other favorite part is when Edmond got tricked into bringing Peter, Susan and Lucy to her because she wants to turn Edmond and his friends into stone. They are smart and she doesn't want them to break the White Witch's spell. The spell is a spell that will keep Narnia always in a winter season.On the map, I think it is a little confusing because it doesn't show the place where Peter, Susan, Edmond, and Lucy came through the Wardrobe to Narnia, but the story is exciting."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"World War II rages but in the country, the Pevensies (Peter,Susan, Edmund, Lucy), four children find their way into the greatestplace they have ever seen-Narnia.

Aslan, the Lion who created and has protected Narnia since it's beginning must come once again and free the land from evil. The classic tale of Fantasy, The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is indeed C.S. Lewis' most imaginative pieces of work. A popular book that has been around for decades, anyone can enjoy it. It leads you into a land you will never want to leave and tells a wonderful story. It starts the Chronicles of Narnia but stands alone as possibly the very best of all of them. It starts the whole adventure through Narnia. This is one of those books that you really can't put down once you start reading it.

With so many unknowns in this world of magic and talking creatures, many things can go wrong!This book has amazing creativity and imagination. It shows that through all of the unreal witches, lions, and even worlds! In the same sense it is also relatable and funny. The final great thing about this book is all of the dialogue and descriptive writing. It also has great word choice. Some of the great words are groping, overjoyed, mysterious, and many more.

I know you will love it as much as I do!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I grew up attending a private, Christian school and I was convinced that I had heard this story, and read it, enough times. I finally picked the book back up and was surprised how much I had forgotten and how many things I never picked up on before.This is a great book for all ages. For children, the story of Christ is presented in such a way that is easy to relate with and understand. For adults, C.S. Lewis has insights about who God is and how He relates to the world that will open your mind and heart. Using metaphor as a means to describe who God really is has fallen out of use, but it is a tool that can sneak around the most guarded defenses and penetrate souls better than any other.As I started the series again this time, I realized that the death and resurrection story would start the series. Many fantasy series contain this element, but normally as the climax to the series. Lewis includes it at the beginning. I don't know why he wrote the series this way, but I suspect it is because it reflects our own lives. The first thing we must learn about is Christ and his death and resurrection and saving power. Then we learn how God moved in the world before Christ, after Christ, and how He is moving now in our own lives. For that reason, even though I'm not done with the series yet, I like how Lewis starts with this story.One of my favorite quotes is from this book, and it was great to read it in the full context again.\\"He'll be coming and going. One day you'll see him and another you won't. He doesn't like being tied down-and of course he has other countries to attend to. It's quite all right. He'll often drop in. Only you mustn't press him. He's wild, you know. Not like a tame lion.\\"This is well worth reading again if you have not read it recently, no matter your age. It is a short, quick read and won't take you long at all to finish, but will stay with you long after you are done."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I loved it couldn\`t put it down. 8 stars.

Even though this is the second book in a series of seven, it can be read without reading the The Magicians Nephew, which is a magnificent book also.

In this book, that is not so bad."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Allegory, fantasy, fairy tale--THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE works on the audience of children as a story, and extends its reach into the adult crowd with its unmistakable parallels to the story of Jesus Christ. C.S. Lewis wrote this--second chronologically in the series but the first written--for kids, but embedded within the tale is an allegory rich enough for the hardened academic, or theologian.The story of Peter, Susan, Edmund, and (especially) Lucy begins as the youngest of these children finds a gateway to Narnia, a magical world imperiled and imprisoned by a terrible witch. Only by fulfilling a prophecy and through the sacrifice of the great lion Aslan can the world be saved. Along the way, the reader will meet magical creatures, fight epic battles, endure unbearable betrayal, and witness the rebirth of a world. Returning through the other side of the wardrobe is like waking up from a dream (or, in the words of Tolkien's Frodo, \\"like falling asleep again\\").Along the way, Lewis also throws in a cameo appearance by Father Christmas--a real mistake, as this seems to allow trappings, or mythology, from the real world to shatter the whole invention of his own. It's a quibble, but it's also the reason why I can't give the book five stars.(This review posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire book \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"If you've never read a 'Chronicles of Narnia' book, you'll be surprised at what a quick read this is! Despite all the talk about 'Christian allegory' and other 'symbolism' that adults have tried to inject into Lewis' writing, the Narnia series, particularly this volume, is intended for kids above all else. The influences on 'Harry Potter' and other modern fantasy series are apparent. While Lewis' writing may lack a certain amount of polish in his descriptions, he manages to convey a lot of information in a relatively brief space, while leaving a lot to the reader's imagination. The four children are instantly likable(well, most of them are), and the various fantasy characters actually add something to the story than just comic relief.I'd never read this book til now, and wish I'd picked it up years earlier!Having read a bit about the other books in the series, I'm not sure if I'll continue. I found that 'Lion...' reached a logical ending point, and Lewis took the characters about as far as they could go. But 'Lion...' is best enjoyed as it was originally written; a nice fantasy story that will capture the attention of kids and grown-ups!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Four siblings--Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy, are staying clear of the war in England by staying in a huge old house in the country with an old professor. As they are left alone most of the time, the children are free to wander and explore the huge house. One day while exploring, Lucy steps into a wardrobe, and walks into another world, the world of Narnia. There she finds that she is not in the wardrobe anymore but is instead in a forest of trees, covered in snow. She meets a faun and spends the afternoon having tea with him. The faun confides that a wicked queen rules the land, making it always wintertime and never Christmas, and that he has sworn to bring any humans he finds directly to her. There is a prophesy that someday four humans will come to sit in the thrones of the castle and that the queen will be defeated. Lucy convinces the faun to let her go, though.When Lucy returns to her sister and brothers, none of them believes that she has really been anywhere, and she is very upset. Soon afterward, Edmund follows her into the wardrobe and is shocked to discover that his sister was telling the truth. Unable to find her in Narnia, though, he meets the wicked queen who charms him and makes him promise to bring her his brother and sisters.Soon afterward, all four children find themselves caught in Narnia. Peter and Susan and Lucy are eager to meet Aslan, the great lion who is said to be coming near to end the eternal winter. But Edmund sneaks off to announce the presence of his siblings to the queen. Peter, Susan and Lucy are now in trouble. Will they be able to avoid being taken by the queen? Will they help their brother come over to the side of good?I liked the descriptions of Narnia and the way things worked there. It's a great mythology. I also liked Aslan's character and the ways he handled problems that came up. I thought that Edmund's turnaround seemed too easy, though. He semed to slip from one side to the other with no effort. I also didn't like that the story of the children growing up happened too quickly, without incident. The end of the book went by much too quickly."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is one of the top ten best books I have ever read. To me it seemed as if the story was alive.C.S.Lewis is a gifted writer; some books are just plain boring, but not C.S.Lewis's books. He starts the book a little dead but soon the story comes alive. His books are so exciting. I stood up late reading it sometimes. I felt as if I was apart of the story. With all the action and excitement the story grabbed me like a mother does to her child. If mom had not sent me to bed I would have most likely read the whole book in one night.There were so many exciting scenes that barley any of them were boring. The scenes were so realistic that you could almost see a movie when you read. One of my favorite scenes was when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy spoke medieval, it was funny.Reading this book made me think. It made me think that even fake characters could seem real. It also reminded me of games and movies I have seen where just a simple person turned into a hero."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I never read this as a child. I had no idea what I was missing until I read this story several months ago. Better late than never. I can't wait to share this wonderful book with my grandchildren. From an adult's perspective the symbolism is profound. I'm so glad I took the time to read this classic. I look forward to reading the other tales of Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"People frequently make the mistake of considering any book that is about children, is written in a style accessible to children, or that has a narrative voice that is speaking as to children a &quot;children's book&quot;, and dismissing it as irrelevant to adults. When they do so, they often miss out on some of the most enjoyable reading experiences available. This book, and the others in this series, fall into that category, just as do &quot;The Hobbit&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkein, &quot;Peter Pan&quot;, by James Barrie, and &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through The Looking Glass&quot; by Lewis Carroll, among others.This book is a delightful story, even if as a non-Christian I did find the Christian symbolism a bit heavy-handed. (The blood-sacrifice and ressurrection of the character intended as a Christ-figure was a bit much.) But even so, and in spite of a couple of minor quibbles, this book still was unquestionably a five-star delight. For those who don't have my level of discomfort with Christian symbology, it should be even more enjoyable. Certainly, if you have children, they should enjoy this story, but even if you don't, don't fail to read it for yourself. It's well worth the attention of an adult."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"When C.S.Lewis wrote the Chronicles of Narnia, this was the first tale that he produced and not \\"The Magician's Nephew\\". There is a problem with ordering the books other than in the way that Lewis published them primarily due to the fact that the mystery of Narnia is better revealed when you read the books in this way. The reader is meant to \\"discover\\" Narnia as the children in Lewis' classic tales do.What makes these books so powerful is not necessarily the message of Christian Dogma that Lewis spent his life analyzing and lecturing on, but the incredible gift of story telling that Lewis possessed. Lewis had the ability to make the people, places, and things that he wrote about come alive and leap off the page. While reading about the fine feast served at the last stop before reaching the end of the world (in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader)one can almost taste it. One can almost see the heavy smoke curling down out of Puddleglum's pipe in \\"The Silver Chair\\", or feel as if you are actually taking tea with Tumnus in \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\".I view the Chronicles of Narnia as classics of Children's Literature and something that should be apart of the reading list of any child as they reach the fourth or fifth grade. Even adults will find them to be facinating reading. Of all the works that Lewis produced fiction or non-fiction, I feel that these are the works that he will be best remembered for."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardobe is a very good book.

This book is second in a series called &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, which happens to be one of the only children's stories written by C.S. Lewis. Lewis was famous for his Christian writings, which holds evident is this book for he relates to the story of Jesus Christ throughout it's entire theme. This is done through the symbolism of many of the characters (Alsan to Jesus; the White Witch to Satan) and themes (good vs. evil). These observations may not be evident to children, but it makes an excellent reading for them and adults alike. Aside from the symbolism, the story is timeless and magical as it lets a child's imagination wander and sparks the child within us."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I read this book when I was about six and I have loved it so much that I have read it about eight times. This book has been a great wonderful escape to a whole new world full of fantasy each time I read it. I am a sixteen year old girl that has loved this book for as long as I can remember. I always wanted to have the same great adventures that the four children had in Narnia. This book is highly recommended for children and adults alike. I intend to read the book many more times to come. It is a book that never seizes to capture my imagination."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is a book I read a number of years ago and I still pick it up every now and then. Lewis' story is a classic tale that transports the reader into its pages. I can clearly remember the days when I would climb into my own wardrobe hoping to hear the crunching of snow under my feet, or see the faint glow of a lamp-post in the distance. [admittedly this was only ten years ago!] I recommend the 'Narnia' series to anyone of any age group. 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' was one of my very favourites, as was 'The Voyage of the Dawntreader'. I hope others who buy this book will get as much enjoyment from it and the rest of the series as I did."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I have read this book a few times before, but this time, I have come to notice new things that I had never seen before, which truly showed the brilliance of Lewis in weaving the reality of life in a fantasy story. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe continues from The Magician's Nephew where the wardrobe that Digory (who became the Professor) made a wardrobe out of the tree he had planted from the core of the Apple (which was used to heal Digory's mother) from Narnia. Aslan, the Lion, is the parallel of Jesus Christ, and the With parallels Satan. In this, shows the epic struggle to save the life of Edmund who had become a traitor.One area that jumped out was the parallels between sin and the Turkish Delight that Edmund ate. When the witch asked what Edmund wanted, he told her that he wanted Turkish Delight, and that desire for Turkish Delight was already in Edmund, just like the sinful nature of human beings. The Witch just fed the sinful nature, and it was written of the enchanted Turkish Delight that \\"anyone who had tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go one eating it till they killed themselves.\\" When we feed our sinful nature, we would keep craving for more, even though we feel the ill effects of it (like Edmund did), and soon become enslaved to it that we could even consume it till it kills us. This is one of the profound truths that Lewis was communicating through the story.Also, the way Edmund reacted is so much like that of one who did not know the Savior, like how he had reasoned that the Witch was not so bad and the others may actually be the enemy, but all the time being enslaved to the need to have more Turkish Delight. The bondage was so strong that the taste of a good and decent meal was not satisfactory, as his mind kept thinking of the Turkish Delight. Also, when the 4 children were told of Aslan, Peter, Susan and Lucy felt positive things, but Edmund felt \\"a sensation of mysterious horror.\\" In light of the sin that Edmund had committed, being in the presence of Aslan would send a fear because of the reality of judgment for one's sin.Another area that was brilliant reveals our mind set towards the spiritual (for this case the world of Narnia) where Peter and Susan did not belive Lucy even though she was the honest one. The discourse with the Professor was a similar logic that can be applied to Jesus Christ, that if Jesus is telling the truth, then He is God, and if not, He is either a lunatic or a liar. Historically, He was not called a lunatic or a liar, so Jesus has to be God!This is a story brilliantly written, and I would likely pick it up some years from now to have a read again and see what gems Lewis had hidden in his writings."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Hi. ...I am here to talk about The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.This is the beginning of the book to start you off. It is about Susan, Lucy, Peter and Edmund. They all have to move because of World War II to their grandpa&#65533;s house. He is a professor. When they get there, they decide to look around and they come across a wardrobe. Lucy decides to go in, and when she reaches her arm through, she feels a pine tree. She goes through and enters Narnia. She meets Mr. Tumnus, a fawn. He brings her back to his house and cozies her up and she falls asleep. When she wakes up, Mr. Tumnus is crying because he was working for the bad white witch. That&#65533;s all I will tell you about the beginning of the book.You meet lots of other characters like Aslam, the lion. He is practically the main character and he almost dies. At the end there is a big war, but I can&#65533;t tell you who wins. You&#65533;ll have to read it for yourself. The book is so adventurous and exciting.Now I am going to tell you how good this book is. I would grade this book a nine out of ten stars. Twelve out of twelve people I asked said it was an awesome book. Matt (my friend) says that the war that takes place at the end of the book was the best part. It is a fabulous book so read it and I guarantee you will like it. I would also recommend reading the first book called The Magician&#65533;s Nephew because it goes along with the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.So I told you a little about the book. So long and I hope you will read this book and if you do, I hope you enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I read this book when I was a small boy just discovering the wonder of books, it is one of the reasons why i still read books today. As such it has special meaning to me and I could not resist reviewing it. The story is about a group of children who discover a secret magical land where they can be heroes, accessable through a wardrobe. Some people may be a bit put off by the references to the religious undertones of these books, It would be a tragedy if some where put off reading these because of this. I for one was completely unaware of the christian undertones and just read it for the great story it is. The book has stood the test of time and to me is a classic. The one thing I regret is that I do not have children (so far!) to give books like this to, so if you do, don't miss the chance."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Because it is so spectacular, I'm choosing The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe to be the first book I review here at Amazon. I first fell in love with this story (and the subsequent volumes in the series) when my fifth-grade teacher read it to our class. Though it has been more than a decade since, this book has remained one of my all-time favorite works of literature, and I try to reread it once a year. It has an enchanting effect on the heart, mind and soul that never diminishes.The novel features four British children: Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy (Sons of Adam and Daughters of Eve) who discover a magical world hidden behind fur coats in a wardrobe. In &quot;Narnia&quot;, they encounter an endless parade of fantastic characters and events that aid them in their quest to free the land of Narnia from the spell of the White Witch. She makes winter a permanent season and turns those who oppose her into stone. The most prominent Narnians are the talking animals, but especially the lion Aslan who, with the children's help, must return spring and benevolent rule to the land.On a more analytical note, I find it fascinating how C.S. Lewis uses allegory to loosely bridge his fictional world with well-known themes and stories from the Bible. You can most easily recognize this in the ever-present battle between good and evil and the symbolic representation of Christ's Resurrection in the guise of Aslan's death and revival on the Stone Table. Which fulfills an &quot;even deeper magic from before the dawn of time.&quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a modern classic that should be included in EVERYONE'S library. It will leave you completely satisfied, but at the same time craving more (which can be found in the other six volumes of the Chronicles of Narnia series). Oh, to sit and rule at Cair Paravel while munching on Turkish Delight!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The first of C.S. Lewis' beloved Chronicles of Narnia, \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" is an exciting, emotionally-charged, truly magical story. Filled with beautiful imagery, exciting battles, and heroic sacrifice, the story is a truly mesmerizing work of fiction. Most people have read it when they were very young. However, I didn't read it until recently, at the age of 21. But for me, and possibly others, it took me back to my childhood, when you believed in the magical, and the unseen. That's where the book's power lies. For the young, it is fantastical and new, while for the adults, it takes us back to our younger days.This is a fantastic story that is rightfully called one of the greatest fantasty stories of all time.Grade: A+"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I usually greatly dislike fantasy but I really thought that this novel, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" was interesting. The introduction of this novel was also one of the parts I thought it was interesting because of how the main character enters another part of the world and found that she had a gift. This novel is also interesting to me mainly because there are many specific details while talking about the animated characters appearance. \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" are similar and different in some ways from the book, \\"The Hatchet\\" (Adventure Genre). The difference between the books is that, \\"The Hatchet\\" is a book where there is no magical land, and Narnia has. Instead of using magic like the White Witch does in Narnia, the teenager in, \\"Hatchet\\" gets his resources manually, not magically. Like all fantasy books and adventure books, the protagonists usually find that the have a specialty or a gift. I recommend this book, \\"The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe\\" to people who likes magical places, and magical powers. People who read this novel should also like the genre, fantasy with characters that do not exist in real life. I do not recommend this book to people who are not into magical powers, or magical places."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"One of the miracles of C.S. Lewis is that he is able to incorporate a sense of the mystical and magical with the form of the world in a Christian framework without either aspect becoming forced or stilted. The stories that Lewis has crafted in the Chronicles of Narnia stand on their own as good storytelling even without the underpinning of Christian imagery - they are strong tales, kin in many ways to the Lord of the Rings cycle, which makes sense, given the friendship and professional relationship of Lewis with Tolkein.This particular text, 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', is the second installment in the overall Narnia series, but each story is able to stand on its own. This is a story that almost begins with 'once upon a time...' It is a good story for children of all ages (including 40-year-old children like me). The story begins in the dark days of the London blitz, with the children being sent away for their protection. This was common for people in all social classes, from the royal family on down, to send the children out to the countryside for the duration of the war - when Lewis was writing and publishing the Narnia books, this experience would have been fresh in the minds of the readers. Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are the family children sent to stay with old Professor and his less-than-amiable housekeeper; it comes as no surprise that the children hope to escape from this as much as from the bombs in London, and escape they did.Lucy found it first - the portal to Narnia, in the back of the wardrobe in the special room. Then Edmund (though he would lie about it), and then all four make the journey into Narnia, where they discover themselves to be the likely heirs of a prophetic chain of events freeing the land from the evil of the wintery White Witch, who was then styling herself as the Queen of Narnia. In fact, the real king of Narnia was Aslan, a majestic lion full of power and grace, whose soul was as pure as any child's hope for the future.The Christian images would seem familiar to any liturgical churchgoer, but the there are also other symbols that fit beyond the religious that tap into deeper longings - evil here is not a hot place, but a frozen place, where the emotions are cold and sharp. The lesser creatures are the virtuous ones, and the children lead the way to the redemption of all. The battle of good and evil takes place in epic form, fitting many forms of heroic tales. The lion Aslan stands for the Christ figure, but can also conjure images of the lion of England - Peter's shield with a red lion makes him both the stand-in for the first of the apostles as well as a perfect casting for St. George. Other parallels abound.The children themselves live a good life in Narnia, but eventually return to their English countryside encampment, with spirits and hopefulness renewed.This is a tale of extraordinary power, and one that stays with the reader for a long time. Long before Harry Potter, there was Narnia - a tale that is not only fun and riveting, but also one with a strong moral lens that includes not only power, but the giving up of power; not only victory, but also forgiveness and sacrifice. Revenge is an emotion that is defeated here, and good triumphs at the last.A grand story!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Throughout my teenage years, I was thoroughly entranced by J.R.R. Tolkein's masterful LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy and Terry Brooks' exciting SHANNARA series and the brilliant works of Stephen R. Lawhead. But, for some reason, I missed out on C.S. Lewis. I had been told this was a children's book.And then, when I was 17 and going on Summer vacation, I picked up THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE on a lark and began to read it. I couldn't put it down. I literally read it in one sitting, one night. The next day, I rushed out and bought as many of the rest of the NARNIA series as I could find. Sadly, the bookstore in the resort town where I was staying did not have the last two titles. I was desperate! I ordered those titles and put a rush on it. Over the next four days, I read the next four books in the series and kept calling the bookstore to see if my order had come in. At the last second, as I finished book 5 in the series, the final two books arrived, and I devoured them.Since then, I've read THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE many times. Recently, I re-discovered this handsome new edition and enjoyed the story all over again. Is it a children's book? Yes. But it is so much more than that. Many adults and scholars with great learning have had their lives profoundly affected by reading this book. Why?Of course, it is beautifully written by one of the true masters of English literature. The story is captivating--the magical land of Narnia and its mysterious inhabitants are portrayed vividly for us by Lewis. The characters, both the main children and the Narnian creatures, are colorful and entertaining. The \\"good guys\\" are sympathetic and brave, if flawed. There is tremendous humor. And pathos.Aslan the Lion is majestic and awe-inspiring. And the villians here are really villians...the icy witch and her evil minions are truly hateful.Beyond all of that is a powerful and subtle allegory about some of the deeper truths of life that are amazingly compelling and moving. Perhaps more than one reader has had to dab a few tears from their eyes at certain points.It may sound like hype, but I truly believe that everyone should read this book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This superb adaptation by Amanda Benjamin of the C. S. Lewis children's classic is available as stand alone book (hardback and paperback) and book and cassette recording read by Nickolas Grace. Birmingham's true-to-life illustrations complement the narrative magnificently and, dare I say it, will stand the test of time equally as well as have the beloved original illustrations by Pauline Baynes. Amanda Benjamin's adaptation of the original story is faithful to the narrative of C. S. Lewis' story. It neither avoids nor sugar-coats the treachery of Edmund, nor the grim event of Aslan's sacrifice. Though not an abrigement, the narrative maintains the joy and thrills and mysterious wonder of the cherished Lewis story.I've 'road tested' this lovely book with my own young niece and nephew (aged 8 and 10) and have had as much enjoyment seeing their excitement and happiness as I got when I first read the story at 11.A first class Christmas or birthday present for any child who enjoys reading, listening to a good story or appreciates beautiful artwork."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is the second volume (chronologically) in The Chronicles of Narnia (after The Magician's Nephew, before The Horse and His Boy; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Last Battle).This book takes place during World War II, many years after the events of The Magician's Nephew, and tells the story of four young siblings, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. They are exploring the big house of an old Professor (which I'm guessig is Digory from the first book) where they've been sent during the air-raids, when Lucy enters the old wardrobe in en empty room upstairs to hide in it.Only this wardrobe is actually a direct passage to the world of Narnia, and Lucy finds herself in a forest on a snowy night, the only light that of a lamppost. There she meets a Faun named Tumnus, who is indeed very amazed to meet a legendary Human, an invites her to tea. In the cozy warmth of his home, he tells her of the evil White Witch, who is turning everyone who opposes her to stone, and whose spell on Narnia makes it always winter and never Christmas.When Lucy finally gets out of the wood and then out of the wardrobe again, no time has actually passed, and of course, when she tells her story to her brothers and sister, none of them believes her. Edmund in particular likes to make fun of her.On another, rainy day, when they're all playing hide-and-seek in the huge mansion, Edmund decides to hide in the wardrobe and he too finds himself in Narnia. But instead of the Faun, he meets the White Witch, who lures him with Turkish Delight (his favourite sweets) and by making him believe that he can become King if he brings her his brother and sisters.The book then tells the adventures of the four kids in Narnia, meeting a friendly couple of talking badgers and all kinds of other fantastic animals and creatures, among then the powerful Lion King Aslan, and helping them save the world from the evil usurper Queen.Reading the series in the chronological order rather than in the publication order, I found that The Magician's Nephew was actually a kind of spoiler for The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. I think that I would have been more enchanted, amazed and curious about the world of Narnia if I hadn't read all about its creation in the first book. I would have wondered about the lamppost, for example (and it would have been nice to read about the Lion's song later). Knowing about it in advance, I'm sure I found it a tad duller, because I wasn't discovering it at the same time as the kids. This is a nice story, and I know it's a Classic, but I must say it's not as captivating as I thought it would be.I advise you read it in the publication order: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe; Prince Caspian; The Voyage of the Dawn Treader; The Silver Chair; The Horse and His Boy; The Magicians Nephew; The Last Battle."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The dearly loved chronicles of Narnia has always held a wonderful place in my heart, from the time it was read to me by my first grade teacher. Each time I pass a wardrobe, I often wonder what mysteries are on the other side. Will a faun lead me to a new and great adventure? And when I see I lion I think of the magnificence of Aslan with his piercing eyes and mighty roar.For those who have not read this book, you must be ready for something that is more than just a beautiful story about children, the magical land of Narnia, a wicked witch, and an &quot;untamed Lion&quot; named Aslan, whose very name brings joy to the heart of all who hear it. It is also an allegory of Christ and His Love for all, the Great Lion of Judah who is kind, loving, but, indeed, never a tame God!I have spoken to people who have read this book as a child and did not know that this level was present in the books; that's ok, because you can read it again as an adult and see how Lewis, in his inimitable way, can beautifully weave a story of suffering and grace, loss and celebration.For children, it is a book that will give them a love of reading, of imagination and joy.

I knew that a movie version of this book was coming out and I wanted to see it. My brother, a big, big fan of Chronicles of Narnia, made me read the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe before seeing the movie. I read it grudgingly because I was in the middle of reading another book but I figured it was a short book so it wouldn't take long. By the second chapter, I fell in love with the book! It's so good and very well written. The Pevensie children are very likeable and you really do care for them. You feel bad for Edmund when he's being mistreated by the White Witch. Speaking of the White Witch, this book has one of the best villains of all time. It's a refreshing break from the very cliche persona of a villain; having black clothes, black hair, dark face, being mean right off the bat, and those kinds of things. This villain had white clothes (hence the name WHITE Witch), had a light face, and starting off being \\"nice\\". Aslan is also a great character. This book really started me on a Narnia craze. I now have all seven books, the movie, and I can't wait for the next movie to come out.

Lewis and the Chronicles of Narnia. I had heard of the series but never read it, and it's only now as an adult that I have picked up \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\". I knew a little going in; there was a magical land known as Narnia, it featured a lion, and somehow a wardrobe was invovled.The book centers around four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They have been sent away from London to escape the air raids of World War II and are staying at a professor's house in the country. While exploring the mansion one day, the youngest, Lucy, comes across an old cupboard that houses coats. Opening it up to hide in, she discovers that, rather than being an ordinary wardrobe, it is a gateway to a magical land called Narnia. There are many interesting creatures, from unicorns to giants, centaurs and dwarves. Sadly, Narnia has been put under a spell by an evil witch who has made it winter all the time - but never Christmas. The land is waiting to be freed, and freedom can only happen with a war against the witch and those on her side.Lucy eventually makes it back to the professor's house and quickly tells her siblings what she has seen. They don't believe her, even when Edmund accompanies her into the wardrobe on another adventure in the land. There, he is met and falls under the witch's spell. Eventually, all four siblings enter the magical land, where they participate in a battle to rid Narnia of the witch and restore Aslan as ruler of all.I've read commentary that the Chronicles of Narnia is a very religious series, and coming from a Christian perspective, I can agree. Aslan is definitely representative of Jesus Christ, and aspects of the story mimic biblical events. But this is something I was looking for as I was reading; if I hadn't been aware of it, I may not have made the connection. And, while this book isn't as vivid as, say, Harry Potter, it is still a great tale.Overall, while I was less than thrilled with \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", I can see the appeal to children. I am going to delve into the rest of the series to see what it's about; after all, it's a fast read and an interesting one at that."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The chronicles of Narnia is a book written by C.S. Lewis. The genre of this book is an adventure book. The name of the book comes from four young children's lives in a somewhat parallel universe as ours. I would say that the theme of the book is loyalty to your family. I enjoyed this story very much. It was a constant page turner for me. Every new page was sort of a new adventure for me and the characters alike. The story is written in a 3rd person point of view where the author not only tells of the story but talks to the reader as well. I enjoy this much more than a regular third person point of view. The authors voice to me sounds like an older man sitting by a fireplace telling you of this story that he came up with the previous night and was energetic to tell us. \\" There shining in the sunrise, larger than they had seen him before, shaking his mane ( for it had apparently grown again) stood Aslan himself.\\" This is a quote from the book in which the author adds his own little thoughts, as if he were really telling us what was happening.The setting of the story takes place in a fictional world called Narnia. It is world filled with magic and mystical beings and talking animals. It is very much like the world we live in today with exception technology and regular humans. The writer makes you feel like your in the story. He does not use a lot of the seeing sense but much more of the others such as cold, harsh. hard, and pale. Narnia is mostly covered in snow and ice due to the Witch's rule. However there are parts of the land that are not affected. The parts that have not been affected by the cold is where her evil power has not yet reached.The main characters of the story are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy; going from oldest to youngest. Then there is of course the lion Aslan and the evil White Witch; the Queen of Narnia. You also have Mr. and Mrs. Beaver and a faun named Mr. Tumnus. Mr. Lewis put a good deal of detail into each of his characters, even the non important ones. As I said in the first paragraph the theme is about loyalty to your family, Edmund, the second youngest of the four, dishonored his siblings and almost got them killed by a the Witch's police wolves.The story is essentially about the four children going into a magical wardrobe and ending up in a world called Narnia ruled by the Evil Witch. The kids are in danger and a very powerful lion comes and saves all of Narnia with the children from the Queen and restores balance among the Narnian world."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"\\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe\\" illustrates the great sacrifice of Jesus Christ in assuming our penalty for our sins. Even though fanciful, it becomes a very moving account of giving of one's self for the benefit of others. C.S Lewis is a master author in the Christian faith."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia children's series is an excellent read not only for children and young adults, but for anyone who is fascinated with adventure, magic, mystery, friendship, and action. The first book in the series, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, is a wonderful tale of four siblings who live during WWII. The four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy find themselves living with their Uncle whom they have never met. While playing an innocent game of hide and seek, Lucy, the youngest of the four stumbles into a magical wardrobe. The wardrobe enters into a place called Narnia where it is never Christmas and always winter, animals talk, and an evil witch rules over the land. Lucy, her older sister and her two older brothers will enter Narnia and be known to the animals and magical people as the \\"sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve. The four learn that they have entered a world where evil has thrived and good has been forgotten. Until, they hear of a savior, a king, a lion named Aslan. The four must save the kingdom, fight evil and restore good.This first book is only the beginning of many adventures the four children will have in the land of Narnia. My promise is that if you read the first book, you will be hooked! C.S. Lewis again, has done a fantastic job in capturing magic, spiritual undertones and morals into a classic children's book series. You will NOT be disappointed! Enjoy:)"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I remember reading stories by C.S. Lewis when I was a kid and loving them. I started reading the series with my grandson and am just as enthralled today as I was back then. Every child should read The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. It's a classic that never gets old!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I love how C.S. Lewis posits the trilemma of Mere Christianity, perhaps C.S. Lewis's most famous apologetic work, to also support the idea that Narnia exists.Lucy must either be a liar, mad, or telling the truth that Narnia is real in the same way that in Mere Christianity Lewis posits that Jesus must be Lord, liar or lunatic. Clearly, there are more possibilities than these with regard to Jesus, lest we believe every fantasy our children tell us.This writing is very much secretly evangelistic, but probably not in a way most people would expect. I feel when an evangelist presents me with the Jesus story, and declares something like that Jesus must be Lord, liar or lunatic, it is not Jesus whom I am passing judgment upon, but the witness of a fairytale presented to me. It is thus not Jesus that must be Lord, liar or lunatic, but the person or author that presents Jesus to me that is probably liar, lunatic or telling the truth. But, as I believe happens in the case of the Jesus story, most people that believe in fairy tales are just honestly mistaken about their tale. That is, they are neither telling the truth, lying, or insane, but that they are just plain honestly mistaken. When someone tells me that if I don't believe in a fairytale, such that my soul depends on it in order to escape eternal punishment, I won't sell my soul to believe in Jesus anymore than I would subscribe to the idea that Narnia is a real place. Strangely, C.S. Lewis seems to support that idea as upright, such that entering the fantastic world of Jesus and Christianity, even if it be lies, is still ideal to the alternative of denying Christian religious fantasies.Of course, Jesus was a real person, but anything beyond that is anyone's guess, and as mysterious as Narnia itself. Three major religions have three stories about Jesus that are very much in conflict. Christianity says that Jesus is Lord. Judaism says that Jesus was the antichrist. And, Islam says that Jesus was the humblest prophet, but not as great as Mohammed. Therefore, what is to be made of this man's story is anybody's guess. Absurdly, most Christians say that this decision is central going to either heaven or hell in the afterlife. That much I am unable to accept."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Just re-read this last week to my boys (4 and 6), and what a relief it is to read something that's been written with real care and a sense of style.

As the teacher passed the books out to us I thought it was just going to be another one of those boring books that we have to read for school. When I opened that book and started reading I couldn't put it down. It was just so facinating. My teacher said there was so many symbolic things in the book relating to the authors Chrisianity. For the people who don't know what I'm talking about. The Lion, Aslan, is represented as God.I thought this book was really good. Better than good. It was just like one of those books that you wished you were in. Like 'Eden' as they would say."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I remember back when I was in second grade and I read The Loin The Witch and the Wardrobe. I wasn't really used to something this long but I immeaditally fell in love with it. The Story of Lucy, Peter, Susan and Edmund is an imaginative adventure of Narnia. WHen Lucy finds a door into another world called Narnia she befriends a faun and enjoys herself very much. But no one will believe her! ANd when she convinces then to come they find them self traveling to find Aslan, the great lion, and running from the white witch's powerful wrath. I'm 15 now and going to be a softmore and I still love this book. Everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is the best known of the Narnia novels and it is a true classic. Although I personally didn't enjoy The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe as much as I enjoyed the Magician's Nephew,it was still a high quality read. The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe starts with the now grown up Digory Kirke,who has become Professor Kirke,taking 4 siblings into his house in a time of war. One of the siblings first discovers way into Narnia through the wardrobe Professor Kirke made out of Narnian wood at the end of the Magician's Nephew. Eventually,all 4 of the siblings find their way into Narnia and the story really begins. The plot is graver and the tone grimmer than the Magician's Nephew. In this book the 4 siblings find Narnia an unhappy land annd will also find themselves in real danger. The adventure is about how the siblings,with the help of Aslan,put things right in the land of Narnia. There are two things I particulary like about the Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe. 1st,The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe makes the Magician's Nephew an even stronger story than it was to begib with because of connections between the stories. There were many times while reading The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe that I found myself saying \\"Oh,yeah,because in the Magician's Nephew................. Much like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows made Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince a stronger story,so too The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe made the Magician's Nephew a stronger story. Now we've got a strong series going. I also loved the fact that the people that got into Narnia from \\"our world\\" in The Lion,the Witch,and the Wardrobe were different humans than the ones in the Magician's Nephew. I love how Lewis expanded his base of characters with this book. One last thing is that I LOVED the \\"gifts\\" part. (Can't say more than gifts,it'd require a big spoiler.) The biggest waekness of The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is that the physical appearance of Peter,Susan,Edmund,and Lucy is never described so you have to guess. (I now think of the characters from the movie when I think about what they would look like.) The Lion,the Witch and the Wardrobe is a masterfully crafted tale about the adventures of the Pevinse children in Narnia and is surely 5 star material."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I thought this book was unbelievable.

This book is even read by many adults, because of the magic that C.S Lewis's pencil wrote. They might not be thick books. But that doesnt make a book good at any means. What makes a book good is detail, and that is exactly what C.S. Lewis did. All hail Aslan!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"[Throughout the years, I have written a number of reviews that have never been published online on Amazon. These writings comprise two types of reviews: unfinished reviews, abandoned during various stages of composition, and completed reviews that for life reasons were never posted. Of the later type, back in September 2001 I wrote a cache of work, a full sixteen reviews of several different C. S. Lewis books which have never been released. I am publishing these reviews now for the first time, over a decade after they were initially written. Mike London 10-3-2012]\\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", to be quite honest, is my least favorite of the Narnia books. While it is the most well known book in the Narnia series and seems to receive the most adaptations, for this reader it is also the weakest. While my personal prejudice against the book may seem unjustified, I will go into detail on why it is this book does the least of all the books for me. However, do not think that I despise the book. Some of the individual scenes are my favorite in the series, including the meeting of Tumnas and Lucy and much of the actual world of Narnia. The scene with the professor stands out as well, as do others, including Edmond and the scene with the White Witch and her devilish Turkish Delight.The chief fault I have with this is the overly explicit Christianity in this book. The Chronicles represent very fundamental Christian faerie tales, and generally Lewis embodies Christianity with a very good story. For me, however, \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" ceases to be good story and just mere allegory. I think of the Chronicles as something of magic themselves, and the spell of the series are the excellent stories that also have great Christian truths. The death of Aslan for the sake of Edmond totally ruins this spell for me. Again, this is personal taste.To best describe what I'm talking about, I will give you my personal view on why the series itself is good. Lewis, while always writing from the Christian standpoint, keeps first and foremost the story in mind. Christianity underlies it all, but the most important element is the story itself. Readers do not like to be preached at. If you tell a good story that has exhibits various elements of Christianity as its theme but keep the story original, that is a good faerie tale. Here, Lewis starts that and then stops that at the end and has Aslan die for Edmond. It would have been fine had the parallel not been so blatantly obvious. For me, it makes me lose focus of the story and concentrate on the Christianity solely. Still, it's like Lewis decides to make it very explicit what he is talking about instead of sticking to the less obvious.Another element that alienates this book from me is the inclusion of Father Christmas. I cannot specifically put my finger on it, but for some reason he does not sit well with me. We have this beautiful new world of Narnia, and here it's always winter and never Christmas. Why would they have Christmas in the first place? Again, I understand Father Christmas can represent the Holy Spirit, etc, and put it on the level that children will definitely relate too, but even when I was little I had an immediate dislike to this inclusion in the story.While the slain god myth is an essential archetype, it just does not work for me in this story. I would have rather Lewis come up with a more ingenuity and have a different way for Aslan to redeem him. How is the ultimate question. But he did do this with Eustace in \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\". While that may seem to be a rather harsh reaction to the opening book of the Narnia series, it was my initial reaction, and when rereading it, I am still of this opinion. Again, I recognize this is personal taste, and \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" is certainly deserving of its acclaim.For myself, the explicit Christianity ruins the otherwise flawless faerie tale atmosphere Lewis creates in this tale. Lewis does not violate my own personal aesthetics of endowing a story with Christianity without making the story seem bogged down with Christian elements in the series again with the exception of \\"Dawn Treader:. Every other story in the series the Christian themes but does not, in the end, breaking the spell of the faerie tale. It just feels like in LWW he starts preaching at us. But what do I know. It is probably the most popular of the seven books.\\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", a book I very dearly love, only breaks the spell at the very end and only as part of a comment from Aslan to the children. While certainly Christianity (i.e., a relationship with God) is the most important thing, for myself it brings down the story when Lewis has Aslan say that he brought the children to Narnia so that they may know him better in their own world. I guess it is meant to give hope to the children reading it that they will one day know Aslan, and it is certainly a worthy inclusion for the book, but I still feel, when I read it, that that is a little to explicit for me. The story ceases to be story and becomes just regular Christian doctrine, and while certainly we need Christian doctrine a story should be, first and foremost, a story. However, Lewis's intent besides the story was to win souls to Christ, and if Narnia help does that, then ultimately that is more important than trivial literary concerns.You can tell this is the first one he wrote and that originally there was no thought of a series. There are several contradictions in between this and \\"The Magician's Nephew\\", which include the ancestry of the White Witch and the belief that there have been no human beings in this world. Originally Lewis tried to stay true to this premise but Roger Lancelyn Green told him cut this long scene between a ploughman and his wife in another world and Lewis took his advice and instead went with this concepts. Another case of this not being originally intended as a series is when asked about the story from Coriakin's book, Lucy is spoken of in the present tense, indicating she is still alive. Even Prince Caspian adheres to the original concept of the idea that there were no humans in Narnia at the beginning. Another element that, although working in the self-contained book that Lewis originally meant LWW to be, seems rather awkward to this reader is the professor. He is never named in LWW, but is so in MN. Father Christmas doesn't seem to fit either.This passage from \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\" where White Witch is demanding the life of Edmund because he has betrayed the children and Aslan to the White Witch is one of Lewis's most overt allusions to Christianity in the series. Aslan makes the sacrifice. This also illustrates the fact that evil was not there in the beginning. The White Witch did not know the great magic from before the world's foundation. There were rules and ordinances that were not made known to the angels. Pride also blinds, because when Satan fell, he thought the crucifixition would truly solve the problem with Christ and his ministries. Jadis also thought this as well, that she would triumph in the end. Both were proud and glorified in their evil. Their belief is placed in the wrong deity.Lewis uses the colour white in the cold, wintery sense rather than white symbolising purity. The White Witch has put Narnia in a spell, freezing Aslan's land into a continuos winter than cannot be broken until two kings and two queens from the human race come to seat at Cair Paravel. The white is sickening and represents the cruelty. Ironically, Lewis reckons her colour as that of salt, which precisely what she is not. Salt is a natural preservative and adds flavour to the food, but the White Witch only ruins and destroys and perverts. Jadis, who also appears in \\"The Silver Chair\\", uses the natural colour perverts it into the evil. Green often has been associated with the spring time. In \\"The Silver Chair\\", we find her as the Green Lady. She directs the children and Puddleglum to the giants of Harfang. Here, she appears to be a rather mysterious woman, but she shows her true colours in the Underworld. Jadis, just as she used the white as a perverted colour, here she uses green in her underground kingdom, because here that colour will never come. Spring cannot come to the Underworld, and if her plans would go through, she, like she did in Charn, would destory the world. Green, that vibrant colour of life, is chosen by her to mock spring.Although the winter is an unnatural one, the attitude the characters show for it is part of the pathetic fallacy. From Wikipedia: \\"The pathetic fallacy is the treatment of inanimate objects as if they had human feelings, thought, or sensations. The word 'pathetic' in this use is related to 'pathos' or 'empathy' (capability of feeling), and is not pejorative. In the discussion of literature, the pathetic fallacy is similar to personification.\\" When spring comes to Narnia, they all rejoice for the characters feel so much happier now that the winter is lifting. This also occurs in The Silver Chair with Scrubb and Pole. Jill thinks of the edge as being horrible simply because it is high, which is quite an odd attitude to take. If, by your very nature, you are skilled in mathematics and another person is not and they say. You are black or white or yellow or whatever, this colour has nothing to do with what you are like as a person. If the water is cold and someone says they love water when it is cold because it is so good, but it is bad when it is hot, that is pathetic fallacy. Cliffs are not bad or good - they're just cliffs and that is all.Although a worthwhile book, as I've explained I like the other Narnia novels much better than this one. Tolkien likewise did not like this book for many of the same reasons. He once wrote to a correspondent George Sayer, saying \\"It is sad that 'Narnia' and all that part of C.S.L.'s work should remain outside the range of my sympathy, as much of my work was outside his.\\" Tolkien thought the mixture of various fairy tale motifs quite absurd. Obviously the reading public has adored these books, and they are established literary classics, so if you haven't read LWW, give it a chance. You may have a completely different view than myself and just love the work. For myself, the other Narnia novels are so much better...------------------------------[This is a brief paper I wrote about how Lewis imparted truth to his characters and am including the text here as bonus content to the review proper:]Lewis has his characters experience truth in a number of ways. The five works this essay will look at are \\"The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe\\", \\"Prince Caspian\\", \\"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader\\", \\"The Silver Chair\\", and \\"The Last Battle\\". Not all of the truth the characters encounter are what the characters wanted.In the first book, LWW, we have Edmond who has become a traitor. Edmond does not wish to believe that the Witch is bad, because she can supply his fix. This is one of the biggest truths that Lewis imparts to his young readers: addiction blinds you to the point of where your only god is the addiction itself and you will do anything it takes to get whatever you are addicted too. Edmond is a classic case of addiction, and if this were a work for adults it would have been quite appropriate to make his addiction drugs. When the Beavers are discussing Aslan, Edmond does not like the conversation. He feels this could pose a threat to getting his fix of Turkish Delight. Like drugs, this addiction ruins ordinary pleasures, and Lewis says at the beginning of Chapter IX that memories of bad magic food spoils the taste of regular food. He is so focused on his addictions that Edmond no longer cares about real life, and he will do anything possible to get it, even selling out his brother and sisters to the White Witch, which in everyday life could be a man who will let his family go hungry or will not pay the rent because he cannot get his cocain if he takes care of the basic needs of his family. Even in this degraded state of mind, Edmond gets a realisation of the cruelty of the White Witch, for what he craves the most she will not give him. For truth to come to Edmond, he must accept this terrible fact of his being a traitor and Aslan must die for him. Aslan and Edmond have a talk afterward, which, although we are not told what is said, Lewis does tell us that Edmond never forgot that conversation and he is truly a changed boy.In Prince Caspian, Lewis gives us another boy who is struggling to discover truth. Caspian learns from his Nurse that there is an older Narnia where Talking Animals lived and there were dwarfs and tree and water people and various creatures who claimed Narnia has their home. His Uncle Miraz, however, denies this and sends his nurse away to be replaced by a Dr. Cornelius, who, as it turns out, is a half-breed of dwarf and man. It is notable that he is the only named example of interbreeding, although, according to Ford, Caspian's nurse may also have dwarf blood in her. Caspian must decide which \\"truth\\" he will believe, and because of his relatively good sense he chooses to belief the stories about Old Narnia. This ties into Lewis's theme about the longing for the truth. I highly doubt that, if a person is on Aslan's side (although Caspian is not to begin with), he/she will long for something in a deep spiritual sense and it not be the truth. Lewis talks of this in his Pilgrim's Regress, and it is God's prime instrument in conversion. People long for something true, and unless they are deceived by Satan, they will find their answer in Jesus Christ. It is also important to note the relationship between Dr. Cornelius and Prince Caspian. God wants to use you to help awake and feed that desire for God in someone else's life, and that is why He tells us to go make disciples of men. One reason Lewis chose Dr. Cornelius as a half-breed is to illustrate we are not to perfection yet, but we are progressing toward it, and also one reason the dwarfs intermarried was so the were not killed. Sometimes, as Christians, we cannot be open about our religion but must seek God to know who we should share it with. Of course, this does not apply to America yet, for we have tremendous religious freedom. As the world progresses, however, I fear that will change. Once you discover truth, then you are accountable to that truth and must help fight for it, which Prince Caspian does, and then becomes King Caspian.Eustace Scrubb also encounters truth for the first time. Much of the first half of the novel Eustace is a perfect ass.Jill also encounters truth in The Silver Chair. At the opening of the novel, she learns the appropriate ways to approach God, and these ways are not Satanic, as the dark magic she suggested to Eustace as a method of getting into Narnia was. She also learns in that opening scene with her and Aslan more of the nature of God. You cannot put God in a box, and Aslan will make no promises to her what he will do, but she does not doubt his word when the Lion tells her that there is no other stream. Throughout there rest of the novel Jill learns that no matter what God says, you must do as he asks, even if it seems that you will be killed or seriously harmed or seemingly impossible, and she also learns that, through the giants of Harfang, God will take care of you even if you err, but there will be unnecessary complications if you do not do it his way.Perhaps the most interesting of all, and certainly rather an anomaly as mostly the examples given are good characters becoming better, but in The Last Battle we have one of the central bad guys learn that there really are supernatural forces, even though he did not believe in them. Farsight, the Eagle, notices that Rishda Tarkaan is very surprised about what is in the stable and of Shift's destruction. His discovery of the truth, however, is horrific. Tash, the god he has called on but does not believe, has come to gather his lawful prey, and Rishda is shocked that Tash even exists. Lewis uses this character to illustrate to his readers that you should be careful in what type of belief system you invoke, for the worship of Tash was a cultural practice that Rishda practice not in belief but because it the culture, and he really does not believe in anything.These are some examples of the numerous ways in which truth comes to Narnian characters.*(These reviews covered all seven books of \\"The Chronciles of Narnia\\", the three novels of \\"The Space Trilogy\\", \\"The Abolition of Man\\", \\"The Four Loves\\", \\"A Preface to Paradise Lost\\", a revised version of my 2000 review of \\"Till We Have Faces\\", \\"Surprised By Joy\\", and \\"The Screwtape Letters\\"."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This classic is an enjoyable read. My dyslexic students are motivated to read it. So I am rereading it. I sure enjoy having it on the Kindle so when I am waiting I can easily access it."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The story itself is fascinating, and the movie does the book justice, which is rare, most movies leave so much out. This book is the hero's journeyThe Hero's Journey: Joseph Campbell on His Life and Work (The Collected Works of Joseph Campbell). Some would say this is for children. Well, ok, I read it in high school, actually all of the Narnia books. But it has deeper layers of meaning. The 4 children are the 4 directions, and the four alchemical elements, and Jung's 4 archetypes, from which we get Meyers Briggs. It's a good story, with good characters. It's a masterpiece of its genre."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"My father used to read me and my siblings this book while we were little. Everyone got to be one of the charchters in the story. I was Edmund (although I'm a girl). While reading this book I kept pretending that my family was in the story. I was able to say to my siblings \\"That's you,\\" or \\"You're that one,\\" I enjoyed connecting to this book since it was quite similar to my family.The thing I didn't like about this book was the lack of connection between this book and the Magician's Nephew. The tree that Jadis was afraid of, wasn't in the book. However, the lamp post was. I think Aslan should have said something about the beginning of Narnia, Digory, or Polly from the other book.Overall, I wasn't able to give this book five stars because it didn't appeal to me as much as other books like Harry Potter did. (That's my absolute favorite book.) I think the story line is excellent."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This book is great for kids to read from about Grade 3 and above.

Other than that oversight, a really good read."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Although this was the first Narnia book published, it is the second in the series. It is about four siblings who get sent to a big house in the country during the war. Their names are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. This house was owned by an old professer. One day they were playing hide-and-seek and Lucy decides to hide in a wardrobe. She finds that the wardrobe has no back. She walks through and finds herself in the land of Narnia where it is always Winter and never Christmas. She befriends a fawn an he tells her that Narnia was taken over by the White Witch Jadis, and that it is she who turned Narnia into winter. It is she who turns those who do not follow her into stone. The White Witch is completely evil. Lucy finds her way back and tells her siblings. They don't believe her but soon all four find themselves in Narnia, waging a war against the White Witch with Aslan the Lion by their side.As is true for all the Narnia books, this book is straight-forward with excellent characters and plot. It is a quick read, but you will want to read it over and over again. With all the hype of Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings nowadays, Narnia should become more popular spawning live-action movies and plastic lunch boxes.

I only spent $.01 on the book! I think it is ironic that the shipping cost more than the book, but it was a lot cheaper than driving across the country to get it. I love books. For me, books are a life source. I was going to rate this a 5 star purchase, but I wasn't fully satisfied. When I bought the book, the discription said it was in excellent condition. Well, I was not pleased to find that there was writing in the cover and on the page sides. Plus, and I don't understand why, the company put a sticker on the cover that tore as I was trying to remove it. You see, I collect books. The set that this book belongs to is now complete, however, this book is slightly damaged and now defaced. I am happy about having it, but I would have liked it to be free of writing and stickers. Overall, the company who sent me the book is very professional and quick to reply. They were friendly, and I didn't have to wait too long for the book. I believe I got it in like 4 or 5 days.

Now that I think about it, it was decades ago, and those were the days of punch cards. I hated computers because of that; what a lousy interface that was; but I didn't hate the punch card operators ... I presumed they were all attractive young women working their way through college and I wanted to meet all of them. Bemoan the hormones. One of the things I hated most then was that there was no debug code. Every time I made a mistake, all I got back from the computer was a whole-page goofy-faced image of Alfred E. Newman with the phrase printed below saying \\"What Me Wonder\\". I'm supposed to fix my code and that's the only clue I get? But I digress.Why do I mention all of this? Because some stupid Alfred E. Newman computer programmer type at Amazon.com decided I should review an audio book CD that I obviously didn't buy for myself (because they took my credit card number and I'm pretty sure that young kids who are interested in these stories don't have credit cards) -- I bought it for a grandchild for Pete's sake. I think it's up to her to do the review, but I'm pretty sure she didn't listen to it yet and for all I know she may never listen to it. Besides, if she does, and by the time she does, Amazon.com's hour glass will have run out and I wont be allowed to review the CD. So ... I think the CD is probably great, and I sort of presented it as a birthday gift while winking at the mother because she should make sure that her husband (my son) should spend some of his personal time with her every night listening to part of it (dispensed gradually over a period of days). He doesn't spend reading time with her now because all she has is printed matter to read and that's a little fatiguing for my son. To give him a break, that's not because it's difficult for him to read; rather, it's because he reads at a level far exceeding the level most people are accustomed to, and especially what children are accustomed to. So this CD is a win-win for everybody: my son isn't fatigued; my granddaughter gets exposed to great literature; and the two of them spend some quality time with each other.Now if you want more than 4 stars, you're going go have to ask my granddaughter. I gave it four because I imagined it's great. Only her imagination will know for sure, and I wont know until I speak with her at Christmas time. If it gets my son to spend more time with his daughter then the CD is great no matter whatever other measure is applied.

But these spiritual truths are conveyed more by Biblical allusions than by rigid allegory.\\"This statement is absolutely correct. While I was reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, it sounded like I was reading the bible. Aslan, symbolizes God, and the White Witch symbolizes Satin. When Aslan gets stabbed at the Stone Table, it is symbolizing Jesus dying on the cross, and when the lion comes back to life, it is symbolizing the Resurrection.C.S Lewis' use of symbolism does not make The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe a better story. Some people may think that symbolism makes it good, I think it makes it worse. If a person wanted to read about that, they could just read the bible. C.S Lewis should have incorporated more of his own ideas into the storyline.There are a lot of good things going for this book.

For example, Aslan, the lion, is Jesus, and the Witch is Satan. The story is perfect for children because through the course of the novel, the character Edmund discovers that being on the side of good is better than turning to evil.

It is centered around four children who, while staying as guests at an old mansion, walk through a wardrobe and find themselves in a completely different world. There, they have many adventures and get involved in a great conflict between an evil witch, who is oppressing the land with an eternal winter, and the good king Aslan, who comes back to his country after a long absence to fight the witch's evil works. Anyone with a church or Sunday-school background should quickly recognize the Christian elements in this story, and I think it is safe for young children to read.

Lewis's The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a fantastic book that combines great story telling and charming style while engrossing readers in an intriguing mythical world. Though it is numbered as book two in The Chronicles of Narnia series, C.S. Lewis wrote it first and therefore meant it to be read before book one, for it introduces the world of Narnia and launches readers on the beginning of an exciting journey leaving you wanting more. Though the style of writing and almost non-existent use of difficult vocabulary ostensibly targets the book toward a younger audience, fans of all ages can enjoy this timeless classic, and perhaps older audiences will grasp the deeper underlying message.The book begins with the four Pevensie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy, being sent to live in a mansion with a fabulously rich, mysterious, and old professor because of the German air raids in London during World War II. While the four kids explore the house, Lucy, the youngest, first stumbles upon the doorway to the world of Narnia-an ancient and gigantic wardrobe. Eventually, all the children go through the wardrobe together, and they begin their adventures in Narnia. It is there we see two distinct sides of good and evil: the White Witch and her minions and those for Aslan the lion. The White Witch has spread an ethereal winter that has lasted for over one hundred years, and it is only the coming of Aslan that this winter spell can be broken and the White Witch defeated.C.S. Lewis brings a wealth of intriguing and interesting characters into his book. Upon meeting the characters of Narnia-mostly various animals-you become automatically attached to them. There are by no means \\"fuzzy little cute things\\" you would expect a children's book to have, but noble, smart, wise, and humanlike. Animal lovers of all sorts will enjoy this book that much more, as will mythical creature buffs. C.S. Lewis also brings in centaurs, unicorns, dryads, and naiads among others into the story, along with numerous evil creatures such as wraiths, ogres, and many other things that I will not mention here.The plot of the book is engaging and relentless. I found it almost impossible to put down the novel at the end of each chapter, a cruel but effective ploy to grasp the reader's attention throughout the book. The first initial peeks into Narnia leaves you wanting more, and upon permanently entering there, you are just as eager as the four children to explore and find out more about the strange, mysterious, but beautiful new world.I highly recommend this book to any fan of fiction. Readers will never forget the magic of entering into the world of Narnia for the first time and the wonder that it instills. This book incorporates everything that an epic novel should have. It successfully pulls you into a magical world that is totally believable, provides engaging characters and events, and captivates big and small audiences from start to finish. There is no doubt that children and adults alike will enjoy this book, and just like the Pevensie children, will leave Narnia hoping only to come back again."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Lion the Witch and the wardrobe is a book about four kids in the 1940's. The youngest sibling, Lucy, finds a wardrobe that houses a magical land that was cast under a spell by the Evil White Witch. With the help of Aslan the lion and Lucy's 3 brothers and sisters, Peter, Mary, and Edmund they must return the magical land of Narnia to the way it originally was.The most exciting part of the book was during the climax. During the climax there are fights and celebrations. During the fighting Aslan leads his magical army into battle with the four children by his side. Mary and Peter are able to fight with their gifts from St. Nick, Peter had recieved a sword and sheild while Mary had a bow and quiver. Lucy acted as a nurse for all the wounded soldiers. Towards the end of the book Aslan prevails and the four children are crowned Kings and Queens. Finally, after many years later they find the wardrobe and return to their house they were at in the 1940's a few seconds from which the originally left that house to go to Narnia.The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe is an amasing book, that is why I recommend it. The action through the climax is enough to get any action lover to read it. Even people who like fairy tales will love the ending. The book will also help younger children know that not everyone is as good as they think they are. It can also help other people think that their might be other livible worlds out there"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"A PR man recently lamented that the movie of \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" was not being sold with the pitch, \\"See the Bible come alive!\\" But while Christian elements appear in various guises throughout C. S. Lewis's \\"Chronicles\\" you may search both Testaments, the Apocrypha, and the wealth of extracanonical writings BC and AD and find nothing about Narnia.This first installment was published in 1950 with the subtitle \\"A Story for Children,\\" and in his dedication Lewis calls it a \\"fairy tale\\": it is set during World War II, when many London children were sent away in hopes of finding safe in the countryside. In addition to the usual fairy tale contingent of a wicked witch of great powers, trolls and ogres and werewolves, Lewis has added the naiads and dryads, fauns and centaurs from Greek and Latin myth, as befits a classics professor, plus Father Christmas. When Aslan, the great Lion, is first mentioned one-third of the way through, his status as a Christ figure will be unmistakable---to any adult. But how many children of eight or ten---the premium age to enter Narnia---will recognize allusions to the Agony in the Garden, or interpret the sacrifice of Aslan at the Stone Table by the White Witch as the Crucifixion, or his return as the Resurrection? (The \\"Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time\\" plus \\"Deeper Magic from Before the Dawn of Time\\" are tough doctrinal nuts to crack at a young age; I never understood them at the time, and now their arbitrary nature---to provide a rationale for the plot---rather sticks out.) Aslan's trials and triumphs are much sweeter than the Passion Story, which is shot through with a larger sadder view of human nature and destiny.The vivid pacing and emotional charge of Lewis's narrative bears all before it: one is swept along. What one recalls in after-years are images from high fantasy: the lamppost visible from the depths of the wardrobe, which shows one is leaving this world for Narnia; the Dwarf handing Edward the Witch's steaming tempting brew; her castleful of stone creatures being turned back to flesh by Aslan's breath. This is due in no small part to Pauline Baynes's witty, elegant, endearing illustrations, which are as much a part of Narnia as Tenniel's are of Wonderland and the Looking-Glass World, or Louise Fitzhugh's of Harriet the Spy's beat.\\"The Chronicles of Narnia\\" bear the imprint of the time when they were written, and the author who wrote them, as every book does; but where Harry Potter finds most of his adherents in readers near his own age, and Tolkien's Middle Earth calls out to young and middle-aged and old alike, for what they can bring to it, Lewis was right---these are stories for children. As I reread them today, I see the boy I was when I first read them; for as an adult one can revisit, reappraise, and criticize, but one cannot recapture Narnia."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"This is probably my favorite book in the Narnia series, because I did read it first in the series as a child and it stuck with me. What always gets me, for some reason, is when the character Edmund indulges in some enchanted Turkish Delight. One of my favorite parts in the book, maybe because of my sweet tooth.This novel features Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy as they go through a magic wardrobe and enter Narnia, caught in an eternal frost. The children in turn encounter fauns, a witch as icy as the environment she has created, and a golden lion, not to mention talking beavers, giants, and Father Christmas. Edmund learns important lessons in the ethics of betrayal, or lack thereof, so to speak. Peter, Susan, and Lucy all find courage within themselves through battle and the wise words of Aslan, the golden lion.The Christian allegory in this book is somewhat stronger than in the others, due to the death and resurrection of Aslan, but as a semi-Kabbalist/former Christian/former semi-Wiccan, I have to say I do know about religion and this scence is more magic at work than the power of a god or gods. So, whatever religion you are, just be open-minded while reading this novel, and I think you will be able to see it for the extraordinarily crafted fantasy it truly is.See you after I read the next novel, for those following my review trail !"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Four kids find a magical world called Narnia.

My favorite character is Lucy because she is the most caring and honest one in my opinion.The scene that meant something to me was the scene with the witch, the lion and the witch's friends at the Stone table, I can't tell you why or it will spoil the book.This book is adventurous and a great book to read at anytime."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are siblings who have been sent to the country to escape the air raids of World War II.

They discover a spare room that is completely empty with a large wardrobe. Peter, Susan, and Edmund leave the room, but Lucy stays behind to look inside the wardrobe. Lucy steps inside the enormous closet to find a snowy wood at the back of it. Eventually she meets a faun, a creature that is half goat and half man. The faun, Tamnus lives in a strange land, Narnia where the White Witch has cast a spell so that it is always winter. He asks Lucy if she is a Daughter of Eve, if she is a human girl. Lucy is confused. Tumnus invites her for tea and plays his flute. Lucy feels like she is in a dream. The faun tells her that she cannot go home, but she begs him. Tumnus walks Lucy back to the lamppost at the border between Narnia and the wardrobe door, and they say farewell.On the next rainy day, the children play a game of hide and seek. Lucy wants to check and see if the wardrobe really is empty. Edmund sees Lucy vanishing into the wardrobe. He follows her into the wardrobe, but once inside he finds himself in Narnia.

I think that anybody who likes reading interesting books will like this particular one. I also recently saw the movie and I was totally blown away! I thought that it was going to be boring. It ended up being really interesting. I think that it's better than the book. Other people say it vice versa. But I guess other people have different opinions. Anybody can love/like it!!!

I just loved its plot and storyline. The characters were well developed and you could relate to them, as I am very close to the main character's age. And it is also so addicting written, that after reading the first sentence you won't want to stop!This book is about 4 brothers and sisters who find a magical wardrobe that bring them to a magical world of Narnia. But Narnia is under the evil rule of the White witch. So now the children must go along with a army of talking animals, spirits, and trees, along with the leader of Narnia, Aslan the lion, to defeat the White Witch.I just love C.S Lewis's style of writing. It lays everything you need to know on the paper, straightforwardly enough so any child can understand it, but beautifully enough so any critic will praise it. This book is truly a masterpiece.I recommend this book to any fantasy book lovers, and any Lloyd Alexander fan will love this book!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Chronicles of Narnia are unique from any other book I've read, considering every time I reread them I get a different opinion.The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is technically the one that started them all, if you read them in the correct order, against the publishers' intentions. It's not the best, but really is the most memorable. Here you are introduced to the four Pevensie children- Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. Lucy, the youngest, ventures into a wardrobe at her eccentric relative's house and finds herself in a different world- Narnia, home of the evil White Witch and the mythical Lion Aslan.Nowadays you could dismiss this book as one-dimensional and predictable- yes, good triumphs over evil, there's a bit of forgiven betrayal, and a child's dream comes true. But Narnia is completely unique, because it was CS Lewis that came up with this other world idea, and it was from his Narnia books that all the others were spun off of.Narnia reads like a fairytale. Lucy is sweet, Susan is mature, Peter is a warrior, Edmund is an oddball that goes through random personalities changes. Aslan is faultless, the Witch is cruel. But all that is where the magic comes from. Somehow these characters all work and are believable and readable. You are surprised and hooked till the end.Despite Lewis's awkward dialogue, his obvious love for the word \\"presently\\" and dragging descriptions, these books are classics, to be read over and over. As I've said, every time you read them you understand a bit more."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"Ages 12 and up.

This book deals with courage in many different ways as Peter (the eldest of the four)overcomes many obstacles throughout the course of this magical novel."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"The Chronicles of NarniaThe Lion, The Witch, and The WardrobeZach ThomassonThe book that I read for the fourth quarter project is called The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. It was written by C.S. Lewis, who has written many great books.The book is mainly about four kids who live in England at the time of World War II. Their mother sends them off to an estate to live with someone while the war is going on. Since the day they got there was raining, they went to go and play hide-and-go seek. Lucy, who was the youngest, went to this secret room with a magical wardrobe in it. She went inside it and kept going back until she found she was in a forest. This magical place was called Narnia. Then she saw a light post and met a faun, which was a mixture of two animals. The faun took her back to his place to have tea and to kidnap her. But this faun was good so instead of kidnapping her, he took her back to the light post so she could get home. Then Edmund, who was her brother, followed her into the forest. But he went the wrong way and met up with the evil White Witch. He told them about his family and went back home. One time they were playing and they heard footsteps so they went to the wardrobe room. they went in and found themselves in a snowy forest. When they saw talking beavers, they went to the beaver's house for dinner. When they were talking, Edmund snuck out and went to the White Witches house. She took him prisoner because he didn't bring his family with him. So the rest of the book is about them finding Edmund and getting into a big war against the White Witch. And of course they win the war.The four main characters are Peter who is the oldest, Susan who is the second oldest, Edmund who is the third oldest, and Lucy who is the youngest. Peter is a smart guy and despises his brother because of his attitude toward all of them. Susan is very smart knows how to solve problems between her family. Edmund you can almost say is very bad. He acts like that because he is afraid that his dad will die in the war. Lucy is a person with many freckles and a nice personality.I think the theme of this book is good vs. evil. In the war it is the axis powers who are evil vs. the allied powers who were the good. The when they reach Narnia, it is the White Witch who is evil and Aslan the mighty lion and his side that is good.I really liked this book for many reasons. One it is filled with adventure and is just a great book. Two it has many different characters that seem very cool. Three the good guys win and the four children become the kings and queens of Narnia. I think you should read this book too."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"A world of fantasy that leads the reader to the victory of good over evil, C.S. Lewis has written an enjoyable children's story that allures to the Christian religion. Four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy are sent to live with a professor in a huge old house. Inside a wardrobe in one of the many rooms is a passageway to the world of Narnia where mythical creatures live alongside the mundane animals. However, in Narnia the White Witch has placed a spell on the land so that it is \\"always winter and never Christmas.\\" The four children travel with friendly beavers to meet Aslan, the great lion who can defeat the White Witch. He leads them to fight the Witch's allies to restore the beauty and goodness of Narnia.The events and characters in the novel take everyone back to childhood dreams of unicorns, talking animals, and glorious victories. The reader becomes captivated by the plight of the four children and their quest to save Narnia. The children are alluring because of their innocence. The clear line between good and evil aids the flow and understanding of the story. The imagery describing Aslan captivates the reader, creating a mysterious character who is kind yet fearsome and who cares for all the people. This imagery draws the reader to love Aslan just as much as the children love him. The clear distinction between the awesome goodness of Aslan and the evil treachery of the Witch fuels the reader's desire to learn of Narnia's fate. The fate of the creatures the White Witch has turned to stone also keeps the reader on the edge of his or her seat. The reader wishes to keep reading because of the foreshadowing of a great battle and the prophecy that the children will ascend to the throne of the Castle Paravel and defeat the Witch.The sentences seem awkward at time, but this is due to Lewis' writing style. He writes as if he is talking, relaying the story to a group of children. The wording is simplistic and there are quite a few moments where he recaps the story or explains mundane actions. This style is ideal for children because the explanatory comments help children to better understand the story, and it helps adults to remember what occurred earlier in the novel. C.S. Lewis switches between a narrative of the Witch's actions and Aslan's actions throughout the middle section of the novel. Lewis will break one story at a climax point and return to the other which causes the reader to continue in order to discover the answers to the questions in the last chapter.C.S. Lewis continuously alludes to the Bible, making the story a great study for Christian groups. The name Peter connects the apostle, the head of the Church, to the boy whom Aslan trusts to head the battle against the evil White Witch. Edmund, the youngest boy is related to Judas. Edmund meets the White Witch and is taken in by her magic. Just as Judas was enchanted by the allure of money, Edmund betrays the whereabouts of his siblings and Aslan while under the spell of the White Witch. However, Aslan frees Edmund. Edmund repents and is forgiven, just as Judas would have been had he not killed himself. Also, the many prophesies throughout the novel allure to the prophesies in the Old Testament about Jesus' life and death. The connections continue, but would give away the rest of the story.Lewis' novel is a great read for all people because of its adventure and mystery. The courageous children's fight to save Narnia is a childhood dream come true. All will fall in love with this novel. It is not just a book for Christians, but it is a book for all longing for adventure in mystical lands."},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"My book talk is on a book called Narnia the lion,the witch,and the wardrobe.It was written by c.s lewis and it was eventually made into a movie it is about these 4 kids Lucy,Susan,Edmund,and Peter,Anyway they all go through this wardrobe and land in a magical world called Narnia.They meet an evil witch and a very good hearted lion called aslan.It is one of the best adventure books I have ever read,it also has alot of fantasy with alot of magical animals that can,like talk!.If you like alot of adventure and fantasy this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"C.S.

Lewis has been the most breath taking book I've ever read. Although this book is at a 5th grade level in my opinion it is enjoyable for all ages! There are many unusual characters. The key characters are Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy who are brothers and sisters, Aslan, and many more. Peter is the oldest and happens to be bossy to his younger siblings. Susan is ladylike and Edmund is rude and mean. You will find in this book Edmund lies to many people. Lucy, on the other hand, is kind and thoughtful. The king of Narina, whose known as Aslan, is powerful and kind to people who are kind to him. Many, many more characters are included.In the beginning of this book the setting is in England and then it wanders off to Narina. The adventure starts when Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy move in with Professor. Lucy soon discovers Narina in a wardrobe during her attempt to hide while playing Hide-and-seek. Lucy tells her siblings about her discovery but no one believes her. Finally they go in the wardrobe and find out that Lucy is telling the truth. Then they meet extraordinary beavers who are husband and wife. These beavers built an amazing house in the kingdom of Narina. What's so different special about them? You'll have to read the book or see the movie to find out the truth. Something tragic happens to Aslan! Also something amazing happens to Lucy and her siblings. In this story the White Witch wants to keep the humans so she can be the Queen of Narina. Do you want to know who the White Witch is? Too bad you'll have to read the book.The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis was a fast read. This is so because I got so interested in it that it took me two days to read. I loved it. Not everyone like fantsay but this tale is not like Harry Potter, not at all. Even my teacher likes it. Not everyone likes Harry Potter but maybe everyone will like The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe.

I remember searching through all the cupboards in the house looking for a Narnia and being severely disappointed when I was unsuccessful. I decided that the only place where wonderful, magical things happened was in England. Only in England could characters like the White Witch, Aslan and Lucy, Susan, Peter and Edmund have exciting, magical adventures. Even now at 27, I still have this child-like fantasy that England is a magical place filled with the possibility of adventure and excitement. This wonderful book is enjoyable for all ages.

It is an absolutely gorgeous book--imaginative and beautiful, with a very moral center. It is a Christian allegory. I'm not a Christian, but I can appreciate the skill and the depth of feeling Lewis has for his subject. Aslan the lion is a wonderful character. He is gentle and kind, but can also be fierce and fatal when the situation calls for it. The children are believable--they are basically good at heart, but are certainly not perfect, and Edmund is extremely trying. I'm so glad I re-read this! The first time I heard the story was in fourth grade. Every child in my class was rapt with attention when our teacher read this to us. There is one part of the book where everyone in class put their heads down and cried. Then, the next day, when we heard the next chapter, everyone in class laughed and smiled with relief and joy (everyone who has read this book will know what part I'm writing about!)

Thus, I went into this series wondering whether this series, purportedly written for children, would appeal to my supposedly &quot;adult&quot; sensibilities. I needn't have worried. As most of the rest of the world seems to know already, the books are absolutely charming for readers of any age group...at least, for readers who still have a sense of wonder about them. I am writing this mini-review in &quot;The Lion&quot; section of Amazon rather than the &quot;Magician's Nephew&quot; section because I absolutely agree with the other readers who maintain that the original order of the books is the right and proper order in which to read them. The surprises that come and are explained in &quot;The Magician's Nephew,&quot; for example, are absolutely delightful when read as Book 6; as Book 1, they have little resonance or meaning. By all means ignore the new a! nd &quot;improved&quot; order that the dolts at Harper Collins have imposed. These are some of the best fantasy works that I've ever read, and it's a little embarrassing that I waited so long to discover them. I think my personal favorite of the series is &quot;The Voyage of the Dawntreader,&quot; but each book has so many exciting and memorable events and characters.

Great ideas and story too I recommend it to anyone who likes a good book"},{"Title":"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe: A Story for Children","review":"I recently read The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe as a senior in high school, having not read it before. I found this book was a great fantasy and a book I could read with ease. I felt that C.S. Lewis came up with a very interesting plot that most readers can enjoy. I loved the setting descriptions, the characters, and overall plot. However, I feel this book suits a younger audience. The simple diction and context made the book seem of lower level reading, certainly not of my age group.There is a definite religious theme throughout the book that C.S. Lewis is trying to get across to his readers. He uses the Christian faith and Jesus Christ constantly throughout the book. He uses the main characters to represent religious figures in the bible. Aslan represents Jesus Christ in which Aslan dies and rises from the dead. The White Witch symbolizes Satan with her evil ways and treatment of the animals and people. The children: Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy represent Jesus' disciples as the follow and love Aslan who represents Jesus Christ. Some might find this use of religion as an annoyance, but being a Christ follower, I actually liked these references and loved the connection that was portrayed between the characters in the book and the biblical figures of the bible.Overall, I really enjoyed reading this book, despite it being a little too young for my liking.

Bernard Lewis writes about anti-Semitism in his areas of expertise (the Arab world, the Moslem world, the Middle East) as one would write about an illness, a particularly ugly kind of illness. He is like a compassionate physician called to observe and diagnose a patient who has been infected with a horrible disease that is consuming his (or her) body and soul. As a non-Jew and an immigrant in the United States, I have often encountered Arabs who mistake me for someone who will share their hatred of Jews, simply because we share the immigrant experience in the US. This has happened in far too many occasions to be considered unimportant. The vast majority of Arabs that I've met in eleven years in this country, have assumed (correctly) that I have a Christian education, and (incorrectly) that I have been infected by the anti-Jewish syndrome that has, tragically, been most evident in Christian societies for two thousand years. Bernard Lewis' book has helped me understand this bothersome fact of life in my dealings with Arabs for the last eleven years. It was in part this book what provoked Edward Said's reaction against, and verbal abuse of, Bernard Lewis, and this, in turn, made me interested in the work of Edward Said. I have read now several of Professor Lewis' works and several collected articles by Edward Said, and I cannot find validity in the passionate, but flimsy arguments that Said puts forward to attack Lewis, like claiming that the latter has no knowledge of -or intentionally ignores- the problems of the Middle East in which many of Lewis' examples of anti-Semitism take place. If anyone reads two books by Bernard Lewis, it must become clear that the man understands his subject. So, &quot;Semites and Anti-Semites&quot; is a must-read for those who want to see patterns of hatred in order to fight against them. It also showed me two totally different authors, with a completely different set of ethics: on the one hand, Lewis is serious, methodical, and compassionate of both the victims and the hatemongers. On the other, Said has been unmasked recently in &quot;Commentary&quot;, in an article by Justus Weiner, as someone who lied about his past to &quot;make up&quot; a biography as a Palestinian refugee. &quot;Semites and Anti-Semites&quot; deals exactly with this kind of people."},{"Title":"Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice","review":"In the wake of September 11, a lot of Americans are only starting to wake up to something known to anyone who has read this book: the Arab world has succeeded Nazi Germany as the global epicenter of annihilationist anti-Semitism.Bernard Lewis' book was written well in advance of the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and it makes essential background reading into the bizarre theorizing that is so replete in the Arab world.Lewis writes carefully and with sympathy for his subjects, and he is careful to draw a line between criticism of Israel and outright bigotry. Still, his inquiry finds that far too many newspapers and intellectuals in this region are willing to embrace medieval libels and Nazi tracts in their efforts to explain away the perseverance of Israel.Anyone who holds universal tolerance as a cardinal value - regardless of their stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict - should read this book carefully. Unless the world shines the light of truth on the recesses of paranoia and hatred lurking in the Arab world, we will be certain of seeing many more Osama bin Ladens"},{"Title":"Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice","review":"The most important thing I learned about this book is that Arab anti-Semitism, although not eternal, precedes the current war. Before the Holocuast, the mufti of Jerusalem urged the Nazis to engage in a \\"Holy War\\" against world Jewry, to accomplish the \\"final solution\\" to the Jewish problem everywhere. (p. 147, 1986 edition). In 1945, 130 Jews were massacred in Libya and 82 more in Aden (p. 205). In 1964, the state-controlled Egyptian press claimed that John Wilkes Booth was Jewish and \\"armed by the Zionist organization\\" (p. 214). In the 1970s, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia claimed that Jews practice the ritual murder of Christian and Muslim children (p. 194)These facts disprove the claim of another reviewer that \\"Far from being intent on annihilating the Jews, the Arab world is hostile towards Israel's brutal occupation of the Palestinians.\\" Before I read Lewis's book, I too thought Arab anti-Semitism must have arisen from the recent Israel-Palestinian wars. But as the above-quoted examples (and many others cited by Lewis) show, Arabs were massacring Jews, supporting Nazis and fomenting Jew hatred before Israel even was formed in 1948, let alone before Israel took over the \\"occupied terrorities\\" in 1967.Another reviewer complained about the \\"racist\\" Israeli Law of Return. The Law of Return has nothing to do with race: it allows Jews from around the world to live in Israel -- not just white European Jews, but Jews from the Arab countries (who, according to Lewis at least, comprised a majority of Israelis as of 1986) and black Jews from Ethiopia."},{"Title":"Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice","review":"I have studied European anti-semitism for years and recently began following the Arab media, with its plentiful dose of Muslim anti-semitism. The parallels between the two were so striking that I knew there had to be some sort of connection. A lot of Muslim anti-semitism is literally a carbon copy of medieval Christian polemics, even when it produces absurd results. (For example, a Palestinian sermon recently declared that \\"The Talmud blasphemes about Muhammed.\\" Medieval Christian anti-semites often claimed that the Talmud blasphemed against Jesus, but that was at least plausible; Muhammed, on the other hand, was born several hundred years after the Talmud was written.) I knew there had to be an explanation, but I didn't know what it was until I read this book. The historical connection that Lewis provides (backed up with lots of evidence) seems obvious to me now that I have read it.As for the reviewer who claims that Lewis is a bigot... he heaps praise on all Lewis's criticism of Western anti-semitism and on his accurate depiction of the relatively better life Jews used to have in the East, but everything Lewis says about current Arab anti-semitism and Israel is rejected. I hardly know where to start in addressing his points.Lewis does not downplay the Sabra and Shatilla massacres; he merely points out that it wasn't the Israelis who commited the massacres, that similar massacres were happening every couple of months during that era in Lebanese history, and that the news coverage basically ignored those facts. (Even today, Palestinians attempted to sue Sharon for not foreseeing and preventing the massacres, but haven't bothered to sue the Lebanese Christians who actually planned and committed them.)Even the fact that Lewis says the Palestinians were \\"compelled\\" to leave is not exactly biased toward Israel, since there is a strong historical debate about whether they were compelled to leave or whether they fled the warfare as thousands of refugees do during every war. (And I have no idea where he gets the number of \\"thousands\\" of people being murdered, unless he considers every Arab soldier who died during the 1948 war to have been the victim of a murder.)The idea that the Holocaust was unique, while certainly debatable, is hardly \\"scandalous.\\" And the calm depiction of the fact that Israel didn't personally try to prevent the Armenian genocide -- during a time when Israel didn't even exist, and the Jews in Palestine were struggling to survive under the Ottoman Empire -- as \\"racist\\" takes one's breath away. Can I assume that this reviewer considers the entire book moot, since the Arab world is _already_ racist merely for not trying to help the Jews during the Holocaust? And can I assume that since he appears to feel that Jewish nationalism is racist, he feels the same way about all other forms of nationalism -- including Palestinian nationalism?Incidentally, Lewis's statement about the Armenian genocide in France, while certainly insensitive, was made in the context of explaining the Turkish point of view. In his earlier book on Turkey, he called the Armenian genocide a \\"holocaust.\\""},{"Title":"Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice","review":"This is a book about Arab anti-semitism (of course Arabs can be anti-semites, because, duh, anti-semitism is a particular form of hatred directed at JEWS, not speakers of all Semitic languages... Akkadians that published the blood libel and translations of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion would be -- you guessed it -- anti-semites).The discussion of Arab anti-semitism is preceded by a thorough laying of foundations, consisting of chapters discussing the history of the term \\"semitic\\", the history of semitic-speaking peoples, the history of the Jews, and the rise of Zionism. Anti-semitism proper is then chronicled, beginning with the 1648 uprising of the Ukrainian Cossacks and following through to contemporary Arab expressions.Anti-semitism is not, of course, just disliking or being rude to Jews. It's a form of hatred that characterizes Jews as being uniquely and cosmically evil, and that relies on the repetition of certain core tropes: the Jews drink blood, the Jews conspire to take over the world, blah blah.What Lewis argues is that, while this sort of treatment of the Jews is commonplace in contemporary Arab media, Arab anti-Semitism is a recent innovation, coming into existence over the last half-century. Medieval Arabs stereotyped Jews as well, but merely as cowardly, and some medieval Arab accounts of Mohammed's victories over his Jewish contemporaries paint the Jews as \\"tragic\\" figures and accord them \\"dignity\\" in their defeat. Medieval Arab treatment of Jews was, Lewis argues, in the middle of the Bell curve -- both the best and the worst treatment of Jews was to be found in the Christian West.Until now. The rise of the state of Israel has seen a simultaneous explosion of anti-Semitic writing, ranting and posturing in the Arab states. This book, written well before September 11, 2001, is now more relevant than ever as a guide to understanding the crazed rhetoric flowing around the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as well as the more general muddled meeting of the Arab world and the West."},{"Title":"Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice","review":"Lewis writes a persuasive and detailed account of the rise of anti-Semitism in the Arab world. He credits its emergence to European influences, charts the collaboration between Arab nationalism and Nazism and the disturbing proliferation of anti-Semitic tracts following 1948. This is a well-written, powerful book which must be read in order to understand why the Middle East conflict has gone on so long."},{"Title":"Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice","review":"This book is essential reading for anyone who wants to comprehend the deep passions underlying the Mid-East conflict. In this very readable volume, subtitled &quot;An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice&quot;, Bernard Lewis explains how and why hatred of Jews as Jews now inflames the Arab World. First published in 1987 and reissued with a new Afterword in 1999, the book is as timely as tomorrow. In light of subsequent events, the last chapter, &quot;The New Anti-Semitism&quot;, and the Afterword are especially chilling."},{"Title":"Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice","review":"Where else can you discover that statues of A. Hitler stand in the public squares of countries such as Syria and Iraq? With unusual clarity and driving narrative power, Lewis uncovers the stark anti-semitism that lays coiled like a sick snake in the stomach of Islam. His wealth of detail is breathtaking and his honesty is never in question. He approaches the frightening facts of 50 years of Arab anti-semitism with bold clarity and intellectual honesty. One comes away from this book with the sick impression that virtually every thought and news article published in the middle east has some tinge of anti-semitism in it. Along with Seven Days of War, an essential book on the middle east. Stark frightening anti-semitism derived straight from the Nazis, an historical connection which Lewis also chronicles. EXCELLENT TEN STARS IF I COULD."},{"Title":"Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice","review":"The bout of Jew-hate that convulsed Europe until the fall of Hitler was in effect an episode, a long-lived but ultimately futile piece of social pathology dependent not on any positive religion - though Bernard Lewis' opening remarks tend to argue otherwise - but rather on a socio-cultural convulsion due to various kinds of cultural maladjustment (among which I would place very high an unconscious desire to neutralize or destroy the Christian religion by striking at its ancestor). In its essentials, I believe it was an episode and no more. Except for the lunatic fringe, it and all its products have been consigned to the dustbin of culture history, and, but for the horror of what arose from them, the PROTOCOLS OF THE ELDERS OF ZION and such things would be a subject for jokes.In the Arab world, however, what was a craze - and never without opponents; at no point was the wave of so-called anti-Semitism ever without opponents in the West - has become the consensus; and shows signs of embedding itself into the culture too deep to be removed. What is worse, it has been accepted with no discussion, debate or serious opposition. Debate in Arab culture is difficult - due mainly to the tyrannical natures of most states, that makes it difficult to engage in unperturbed opposition of views which may well have official backing - but not impossible; and many things do in fact get debated with earnest intelligence. The legend of the evil Jew, however, is not one of these things: practically no Muslim voice of any importance has challenged it; and even if anyone did, they would be wasting their time, since Arab and Muslim public opinion simply would not listen. The Arab and Muslim world has eaten, swallowed and digested the sin of the West; metabolised the worst of our social pathologies, as though there was anything to gain by doing so.The excuse for this, of course, is the rise of the State of Israel; but, quite apart from the fact that the new Arab Anti-Semitism (and yes, I know it is a contradiction in terms) has actually made the Arabs less capable of understanding and dealing with their enemy (witness the widespread conspiracy theory that the Israeli troops and aircraft during the Six Days' War were in fact led and manned by Americans), I think this is to some extent a pretext. Arabs had been flirting with German philosophies, with totalitarianism and racism, well before the foundation of the Jewish State - the root of the Baath party, founded in the thirties, is in a typically Fascist mixture of nationalism and socialism leavened with a mystique of group love. These phenomena arose from the failure of the Arab nation to deal with the modern world, and their embedding in the Arab psyche, with their corollary of conspiracy theory, simply diminishes further their ability to do so. Conspiracy theory is not a way, however pathological, to deal with the complexities of the real world; it is a way to deny them.This horrendous process is documented in quite intolerable detail in this excellent book, and God knows there is enough to be said about it. Bernard Lewis shows himself, if anything, too fair to the Arabs. Perhaps the most frightening feature is the calm, even polite way in which the most vicious drivel is spouted with no understanding either of its odiousness or of its sheer ignorance; what one might call the innocence of evil. This is a deeply troubling book, not only for what it says about any future possibility of peace with Israel, but for the more basic issue of the Arab attitude to a world they perceive as hostile, ranged against them, existing in a monstrous conspiracy to crush and destroy them. It cannot be healthy for one of the great nations of the world to live in a state of permanent fear and hatred."},{"Title":"Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice","review":"Violence is often linked to propaganda, incitement, and biased perceptions of others. That is why I think Lewis was right to begin his book by giving an example of a bomb that was exploded in 1980 in Paris, at a synagogue. As Lewis explains, the French Prime Minister said, \\"They aimed at the Jews and they hit innocent Frenchmen.\\" Now that is clearly not the way he meant to say it. But the implication that to some extent, many French people view the Jews as neither French nor innocent is worth investigating.Lewis starts by explaining some fundamentals: who the Jews were and are, where they lived in the past and live now, what Zionism was and is, and who the Hebrew-speakers were and are. He then explains the a little of the history of European antisemitism, or Jew-hatred, over the past few centuries. After that, there is a discussion of Muslim relations with Jews.This background material allows us to understand a major point Lewis makes: that the close relationship between Germany and the Arab leadership that developed between \\"1933 and 1945 was due not to a German attempt to win over the Arabs but to a series of Arab approaches to the Germans.\\"This leads to an explanation of the way most Arabs use the word \\"Nazi\\" today. They don't mean by it \\"antisemite.\\" Such an equivalence would make some Arabs applaud the Nazis while it could make others sympathize with the Jewish victims of the Nazis. Instead, the term is used as a term of general abuse, so that it can be applied to Jews.Lewis then discusses the Arab war first against Zionism and then against the Jews in general. He shows that many Arabs are outraged at the success of the Jews, who had been a traditionally oppressed minority. And some view the existence of Israel as unjust. But even these views are insufficient to explain the many Arab writers who devote plenty of time and effort to reiterate European antisemitic propaganda and distribute it worldwide. Such efforts are so manifestly counterproductive to everyone, Arabs included, that Lewis feels it is appropriate to see what motivates them. And here, Lewis makes a final point: Israel and Zionism are being judged largely not on what they are but on a caricature of what they are that is provided by wild and arbitrary accusations against them.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Semites and Anti-Semites: An Inquiry into Conflict and Prejudice","review":"This is not so much an academic study as it is a biased piece of propaganda, carefully selecting and presenting what will suit the author's political bent.

Joseph and Matthew lost their parents to murder and Joseph lost two close friends to murder, yet there didn't seem to be much emotion. Maybe Ms. Perry tried to tell too many stories within one story. In reviewing the book, it's hard to pin point exactly why I didn't like this book. I would skip this series and read the Pitt series."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"When Arthur Conan Doyle killed off Sherlock Holmes in 1893, the whole of England (perhaps the world) took up arms and demanded that he return. Conan Doyle was forced to adjust his imagination and skill back towards Holmes and away from his other literary pursuits (Sir Nigel, Professor Challenger, et al).In &quot;No Graves as Yet&quot;, Anne Perry has created two new characters out of the clay of her imagination and wants us, the readers to go along with them. While I enjoy the adventures of the Pitt and Monk, I crave something new from Anne Perry. &quot;No Graves as Yet&quot; fulfils this desire to see her expand her horizons. It was quite entertaining and I can't wait to see more adventures of the Brothers Reavley.Fans of long-running characters can turn on a creator. As in the case of Conan Doyle, Perry wants to spread her wings and write something IN ADDITION to her long-standing series characters. Don't let some die-hard reviewers unwilling to let go of Pitt and Monk dissuade you from picking up this book. &quot;No Graves as Yet&quot; is entertaining and engaging and a fine addition to the Anne Perry Library."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"Conspiracy theories are not my favorite plot device. It is hard for me to identify with the strong feelings expressed by many of the characters in this book, but I do believe people, particularly of the English upper classes, felt them.

Her ability to crease a sense of time and place are unparallel."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"Not what I expected from Anne Perry.

I've read most of Perry's Monk books & enjoyed them; I've tried the Pitt books & liked them less. Perhaps I like this series so much because WWI is a period of history that I've come to find fascinating; its effects are still being felt in our own time, even though most Americans don't recognize that (to rectify that, Margaret MacMillan's Paris 1919 is superb). Perry does a wonderful job at evoking the last weeks before the declaration of war. While perhaps the starlings swirl against the twilight a few times too many, her writing is so descriptive that it's easy to see in my mind's eye each scene. I disagree w/the reviewer who said it was \\"too English\\"...it *is* set in England, after all, & one doesn't need to understand the rules of cricket to understand that it's a game played w/a bat & ball, & not important to the overall plot. The \\"Oi\\" accent that another reviewer complained about doesn't indicate lower-class status; that's the dialect spoken in Cambridge & its environs by people who didn't have the opportunity to go to school & learn the accent we associate w/Masterpiece Theatre. This is my fourth time reading the book & I'm actually reading it more for the plot now than before...there are so many thought-provoking ideas in the book that I found myself previously stopping & thinking for minutes at a time. And Perry's quoting of Edward Grey's \\"The lamps are going out all over Europe--we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime\\" brings up goosebumps. I'm looking forward to spending the next weeks with the Reavleys as I read through the series again."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I applaud authors who branch out away from what is \\"expected\\" of them into new territory. Unfortunately I don't feel Ms. Perry brought the same depth of research or conviction and excellence in the writing to this book compared to her previous work. I agree with other enthusiastic Anne Perry readers who were very disappointed in this book. One of the things I most enjoy in Anne Perry's writing is her richly developed characters who give us keen insights into the social and cultural mores of their time and place through Perry's masterful expression of their inner thoughts and feelings. As others have stated, I felt this very much lacking in this book, and kept asking myself, did Anne Perry really write this? The language from the outset was suffocatingly maudlin, and the plot crept along at an excruciatingly dull pace. I could not feel engaged with the characters or the plot. In the end I just couldn't force myself to continue, and skipped about through the remainder of the book to see how things ended up, and concluded I was glad I had not wasted the time to finish reading it. I hope Ms. Perry can rekindle her spark of excellence in future work -- but this just doesn't have it."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"This is the first in a new series for Anne Perry. Forget the Pitts and Monk, Anne Perry has moved on in time to the start of the First World War and her main characters are brothers Joseph and Matthew Reavley. Joseph is a professor of biblical languages at Cambridge University and Matthew works for the British Intelligence. When their parents are killed in a car crash and Joseph's star student is shot the brothers find themselves having to begin unravelling a complex web of international intrigue.An obscure Archduke is shot in Serbia. What could that possibly have to do with the death of the Reavleys and Joseph's cloistered world at Cambridge? Everything, it turns out, as international forces trying to prevent war vie against those riding heedlessly ahead. War is unthinkable, and yet it seems that there is something worse.One of Anne Perry's strengths as a writer is her understanding of the nuances in the relationships between people and this is shown to advantage in this book. On the other hand, the pace is often slowed by moral discourses and discussions of right and wrong and greater rights versus greater wrongs. In addition to these endless moral dilemmas I didn't feel that the writer is at her best using male viewpoint characters. In her earlier books I loved the sheer fun of Charlotte Pitt and the social whirl and delicious ball gowns, as well as the juxtaposition of rich and poor in Victorian life. I felt for the anger and fire of Hester Latterly as she fought the Victorian medical establishment. I didn't feel for the Reavleys.So this was not one of Anne Perry's more memorable books. I hope there will be more action and more three dimensional characters in the remaining books of the series."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I had trouble putting it down once I started.There is a mention of women voting rights people planting bombsthat was interesting as I had never heard they had done anything like that.The idea that very smart people who are also good looking are hatedjust for being somewhat human is an interesting and probably true plot twist.I was rooting for the headmaster as the murdererbut she chickened out at the end...Very English, what?"},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I was so excited to finally get my hands on this book, and even more so to find out that it will be a new series.I fell in love with the Reavley brothers instantly because they were written so well. I feel like they are just like regular guys with dreams and history, and flaws, and through it all they remained strong for each other.I love Anne Perry's work. This is a great story that takes you back in time and makes you think.Give this book a chance, it's worth it."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"What a disappointment. I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series. It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel: despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"For a very long time, I read Anne Perry's ongoing series of mysteries set in Victorian England. It didn't matter if they were centered around the husband and wife team of Thomas and Charlotte Pitt, or the enigmatic William Monk. But after a while, they started to pale -- after all, the mystery genre fits into a formula of a body is found, an outsider is brought in to find the clues and the people associated with the killing, and eventually justice is served, usually to the delight of the reader who is assured that good will triumph. Read enough of these, and after a time, you can start to pick out what will be happening in the first hundred pages or so. And so, with a sigh of regret on my part, I stopped reading Anne Perry quite so much.But in 2002 or so, Ms. Perry started a new series of mysteries that are more of historical novel than a set of ongoing whodunits. Set in and around the events of the First World War, and more specifically, one family's survival in the tragedy, there would be a definite beginning and end to the series.No Graves As Yet is the first novel of the five. It begins in the rich days of June 1914. Joseph Reavley is a teacher at Cambridge University, watching a match of cricket when news arrives of a terrible accident involving his parents, John and Alys, a prosperous middle-class couple. As his siblings gather for the funeral, Joseph realizes along with his brother Matthew that their parents' death may have actually been a murder -- but with little proof, and even less motive, the family has little go on.Joseph returns to Cambridge, Matthew to London, both of them searching for something to make the horror of the deaths have some kind of sense. Further tragedy awaits Joseph when a brilliant student of his, Sebastian Allard, is found in his room with a bullet in his head, but without any clues or a weapon nearby to suggest who did it. Matthew has plenty of problems of his own -- for he is an intelligence officer, and tensions in Europe are rising with rumors of impending war everywhere. Indeed, war is on everyone's mind, and curiously enough, the death of the Reavleys occurred on the very same day that an Austrian Archduke was assassinated in a Serbian town.Both Joseph and Matthew find themselves questioning themselves and the unsettled times that they are living in. A great deal of the story is given over to Joseph's desperate melancholy, watching as those he has loved -- his deceased wife, his parents, Sebastian -- all vanish, and his deep psychological torment in reconciling his religious beliefs with a world that is getting ever more confusing. Over it all hangs the mysterious documents that it appears that their father had with him at the time of his death -- a secret that may prevent or accelerate a future war.What I liked about this one was that Anne Perry carefully weaves in strands of fact in with her fictional Reavley family. Too, she also gives plenty of little details about daily life in England in that hot summer of 1914, from food, automobiles, telephones, mourning customs, to the larger world of the time. I was also able to learn about some of the history of the time that I wasn't aware of, including the military mutiny at the Curragh, and the ongoing troubles of Ireland, then under British rule; the Suffragette movement to get women the vote, and the subtler tangles of adultery, pride, and the ruthless class structure of the time.The downside is that the novel is glacially paced through the first half of the story. I know that the author is laying down the groundwork for the next four books, and introducing the reader to the Reavley family, but it was very hard going and I was wondering if I should bother with the rest of the series. However, once I got past that halfway point, the story picked up the pace, and the plot starts to come together, building up to a conclusion that breaks at the start of the war, and Britain declares war on Germany.There are quite a few plot lines in this to be untangled, but for the careful, persevering reader, the story has a great deal of depth and insight. Red herrings wiggle through here and there, but I also liked that Perry takes the time to let the investigation develop, having it spread out over two months, instead of having it be solved in a matter of days, allowing us to watch the three Reavley siblings questioning themselves and the world around them to great effect.Recommended, with four stars. I'll be certain to check out the next book in the series, Shoulder the Sky."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I eagerly anticipated Anne Perry's new series set during World War I, but this muddled, ill-conceived mystery was a major disappointment. Perry's mysteries revolve around her characters as much as the plot, so the Reavleys are a surprisingly dull and unsympathetic bunch. These alleged Cambridge intellectuals use bad grammar and address each other in mawkish speeches which are ludicrous coming from stiff upper-lip 1914 Britons.The real problem with No Graves as Yet is that the author failed to do enough research to truly bring this period of history to life. She seems unaware that Cambridge was a center of social and intellectual ferment and misses the opportunity to enliven her narrative and enlighten her readers with cameo appearances by historical figures such as Rupert Brooke. There's a lot of maundering about war and peace in No Graves as Yet, but Perry fails to portray the intense patriotism of the British people, which led even the most radical Socialists to join the army in 1914. The betrayal of that patriotism is the story of World War I and it's especially relevant to today's world. It's a shame that Perry chose to narrowly focus on her flimsy characters and murder plot instead of putting more history into this historical mystery."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I trudged through this dull disappointment in disbelief - is this the same Anne Perry whose William Monk and Thomas Pitt novels delivered finely-drawn characters, incisive social commentary and intricate plots?Here, the characters are cyphers; where personalities exist, they're delivered through overwrought histrionics or dull platitudes. None of Perry's fascinating insight into Victorian mores, gender roles and class issues survives the leap forward into 1914 - in this novel the lower classes are distinguished mostly by their use of &quot;Oi&quot; in referring to themselves, and - in the case of the initially intriguing police inspector dispatched to Cambridge University - witless incomprehension regarding the lofty sphere of British acedemia.Perry must have been having a bad day when she wrote this - I couldn't help wondering whether she'd pulled this manuscript out from a pile of early attempts at fiction, perhaps to satisfy a contractual obligation."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"Anne Perry has developed great depth and skill since her early novels. I think if one is expecting simply a murder/detective mystery one might be put off by the social and moral issues that are at the center of this book. The glimpses of Cambridge Universityand Britain's Intelligence Service in 1914 are wonderful. Thecharacters are so real that I cried several times practically fromthe beginning of the book. I can't wait for the next book to arrive."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"It somewhat dismays me that some of the readers' reviews for this book seem to be more concerned with comparing it to the author's Pitt series rather than evaluating it on its own terms. I'm sure the Pitt books were very good, but the fact remains that Anne Perry has chosen to move on. Nostalgia for that series should not cause No Graves As Yet to be treated more harshly than otherwise would be the case.In any event, I found No Graves As Yet to be a good if not outstanding work. The author's strongest point is her ability to capture a time and place so well with what's usually a fairly brief description. Consider the opening paragraph: \\"It was a golden afternoon in late June, a perfect day for cricket. The sky burned in a cloudless sky, and the breeze was barely sufficient to stir the slender, pale skirts of the women as they stood on the grass at Fenner's Field, parasols in hand. The men, in white flannels, were relaxed and smiling.\\" I'm not a particularly imaginative sort, yet I had no trouble at all picturing myself at a Cambridge cricket field in 1914, thanks to just three descriptive sentences. Other examples of terse yet vivid descriptions abound throughout the book. Ms. Perry also does a fine job at portraying the atmosphere of fear and suspicion pervading the college where much of the action occurs, as well as the apprehension - often expressed through denial - of upcoming war.As for the story itself, it was a reasonably interesting mystery with the requisite number of twists and turns, though things were thrown at us very quickly near the end, making for some confusion. I had to re-read the last chapter just to make sure I had it right. Ms. Perry also was able to blend in a little bit of history into the story without making it all seem contrived.One weakness of the book was that some of the characters were not as well-developed as might be expected, with the singular excepton of Joseph Reavely. We never quite learned as much about his brother Matthew as we would have wanted, though this may be remedied in future books in the series. It also was difficult keeping track of some secondary characters, especially the acquaintances of the deceased John Reavley. But these are minor flaws, and I consider this book to merit a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"What a huge disappointment! As a fan of the Monk and Pitt series I expected to be introduced to a vibrant new &quot;cast&quot; of characters. These are cookie cutters. &quot;Minister/Teacher&quot;. &quot;Intelligence Officer.&quot; &quot;Local Ignorant Policeman&quot; &quot;Adulterous Wife&quot; &quot;Angry Mother&quot;I had to force myself to plough through it. I kept thinking there would be some MEANING to the mysterious missing document, but it never came. And what exactly was the befuddled Sebastian involved in? I finished the book and asked myself &quot;what on earth was THAT mess about&quot;?"},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"It's difficult to believe that the author who produces the Thomas Pitt series could have written No Graves As Yet. The suspense is supposed to involve a momentous document which can affect the fate of nations about to embark on World War I. A preposterous document of that nature does finally emerge after 300+ pages on which several uninteresting characters engage in a few murders and suicides. Matthew as a British intelligence officer is perhaps the least credible character in this poorly researched story. Periodically a line or two reminds the reader that the nations of Europe are preparing for mass slaughter. Please, Miss Perry, go back to Pitt and Monk."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"This was my first (and probably last) Anne Perry novel. Neither the story nor the characters caught me. I forced myself to finish it...."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I wasn't going to begin this new series of Anne Perry's since I love the Pitt and Monk series so much. I thought that none could compare and it's a different historical time as well. I read the reviews for this book in Amazon and thought it probably wasn't worth the time. I am very glad that I didn't ignore this book! Ms. Perry weaves her web and draws her readers into the golden summer of 1914 in England as only she can. A much simpler age than now, surely, but underneath the idyllic setting is a very real threat and enormous danger. It is the dawn of the greatest war the world has ever experienced, and we the readers are right there in it. The book shows the fear, darkness and terror experienced by the people when an event occurs in faraway Sarajevo that will alter the world as they know it. English people know that this war will lead to mass destruction and to many thousands of deaths, and they are powerless to stop it. The book is set around a very small area of rural England (around Cambridge), but even in this sleepy little area the danger of the world creeps in. Murders occur that bring the terror to the citizens of Cambridge. We meet a whole new cast of characters that we hope to see in the future. Awesome! And the title is just as haunting as every page in this book - &quot;NO GRAVES AS YET&quot;."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"Like many others, I loved the William Monk books and eagerly awaited Perry's new series.

I feel a twinge of guilt for giving up."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"\\"No Graves As Yet\\", the first in Anne Perry's WWI series, is nicely written.

I can't wait to start the next installment in the series!"},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I have read most of Anne Perry's mysteries. Not being a sci fi fan, I haven't tried those. I had grown tired of Pitt and Monk--perhaps one can only take SO many mysteries and the dynamics between the detectives and their spouses seemed repetitious.However, I thoroughly enjoyed her new series! Contrary to the other reviewers, I felt that she was painting a long-term picture that I didn't expect WOULD be resolved in one novel. As always, her descriptions are sumptuous and memorable, her characters complex (yes, even the females!) and the various stories kept me reading on and on. Although there were several questions left hanging at the end of the book, it was clear to me that this was the beginning of a story, not an ending. I am looking forward to Christmas when I hope that someone will give me the next in the series!"},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"This is the first in a new series for Anne Perry.

Like the slow motion car crash that opens the work, one reads on, unable to look away from one artistic horror after another. Leaden characters, endless repetition, sickenly twee and lofty descriptions of Cambridge, inexplicable plot developments, superfluous references,characters and plot material, heavy-handed foreshadowing and more foreshadowing. I can only conclude that Anne Perry's editors are laughing at us all over their champagne glasses, laying private bets on just how bad her books have to be before they stop selling. I wonder just how many more of these monstrosities (the book jacket threatens a further FOUR in this WWI based series) will actually make it into production.Ghastly, ghastly book...and perhaps the worst part of it is the \\"teaser\\" first chapter of the sequel. It is truly, truly awful. Save yourself some money and misery and pass on this dreadful \\"bestseller\\"."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"As a long time fan of Anne Perry and an avid World War I buff, I found this book to be tedious and confusing. Many questions were raised and never answered: Who were the two mysterious plotters?What happened to the original document (or the copy if the one hidden was not the original)? What was Sebastians connection with the two plotters? How did the brilliant Irish rebel leader figure into this mix? And on and on. Too many loose threads!"},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I have heard so much about Anne Perry that I had to read one of her books. After I renewed it from the Library for the second time (14 days) and found myself still not finished, I concluded, it was not keeping my interest and was very slow moving. I went to the last few pages, and felt I got most of the story. Only then,do you find out where the documents are and the whole event is very simple. Regarding the world events surrounding WWI, better to go to a history book or true historic novel. If it sequals well, there may be hope. But I would not recommend the book. Better to spend an hour watching a murder story on Law and Order for a fun evening."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I had been saving this book for an after-holiday bad-weather reading treat. Big disappointment. After following the Pitts and Monk and Hester through all their wonderful adventures, I found this book to be a big letdown. It was so boring I couldn't even stay with it--didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. It's hard for me to believe that Anne Perry could write such a dull book, bust apparently she has. Every highly moral idea a character has is stated multiple times, barmaids speak like poets, and pages go by without anything happening except the reader being talked to death. I doubt that I'll bother with the next title in the series. Unless a different editor takes over who will cut out all the excess."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I truly like Anne Perry's two mystery series, but I am listening to No Graves as Yet on CD; I am on disc 6 and have to stop myself from flinging it across the room. A) Nothing is happening B) It is so overwrought . . . everyone's \\"Lips are tight with rage\\" or \\"Chest is tight with emotion\\" . . . yuck. I have yet to like either Matthew or Joseph; they are both annoyingly rigid. Please, Ms. Perry, do NOT write more mysteries with these two cardboard characters."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I enjoy the Pitt and Monk mysteries and looked forward to a new series by Perry. This book disappointed me. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot predictable, the mystery not much of one. Don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"What a disappointment! I was so looking forward to Perry's new series. Although her foray into SciFi was horrendous, Perry has had her Victorian mystery series down pat: great plots, wonderful characters, incredibly vivid recreation of the times...I thought &quot;...Perry's got a new stage to move new characters onto...should be great...&quot; Wrong! The vivid recreation of the times is here: a sleepy, self-satisfied, wonderful, upper middle class England right before the horrors of WWI. All those bright young Oxonions - golden in the British sun - before they go for cannon fodder in the trenches of France. Perry's got it 'spot on' and I gave her two stars for painting a great picture. A novel, however, needs to do more than paint pretty picture (or ugly ones, for that matter.) The plot was plodding - no excitment...no breathless page turning...it was dull. The characters were boring and stupid (especially the ones who were supposed to smart.) The female characters (heretofore a real Perry strength) were particularly lame: stock English countrywomen with no brains or little wit, contrariness for thewhim of it...my skin crawled. And the dialogue! Perry spent PAGES over internal conversations about faith that had little impact on the mystery that lay at the heart of the plot. I have no problems with religion as a central factor of life...I believe that it is underrated as a motivating factor in most lives and in most novels...but not just rambling musings. I don't care if the character was once a minister; a sane character has to muse at least semi-coherently. If the author wants to write a religious tract, let her do so and keep it out of her novels. Is Perry a recently born-again something? I hope this series improves with later releases(which I will purchase used or in paperback)but I don't have much hope."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"This is a lot to like about this book. Perry's prose is often lyrical. The innocence it evokes is made all the more poignant because we know what is about to happen. The mystery of a secret conspiracy at the highest level is interesting and I liked the way real historical events are woven into the storyline.But there is also another mystery revolving around the death of a Cambridge student that isn't nearly as engrossing. Sadly, it takes centre stage and really stalls the book's pacing as the main protagonist emotionally flounders as he tries to come to terms with the situation.Overall, this book is just average. However, it was good enough to make me want to read the next book in the series."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"Stilted dialogue, repetitive phrases and utterly boring. I just didn't care what happened to the characters after the first 50 pages. A \\"grave\\" disappointment."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I used the audio version of this book so may be a bit skewed in my view. Perry writes with wonderful detail and feel for the characters of this era (immediate pre WWI upper class England), yet I found the characters overwrought and hence somewhat unbelievable. While not really convinced of the conspiracy that drives this plot I enjoyed the details surrounding the plot. The \\"Irish problem\\", the assination of an Austrian archduke in Serbia, and how gradually WWI came into being. Not everyone's cup of tea."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"Her books on the 19th century were informative, suspenseful, entertaining and well-written. She lost something in translation to the 20th century. The ambigious, wandering philosophical comments may have had a purpose; but she forgot what they were.The plot was capable of much more complexity, even if only in the hands of the principals. The ending was an anticlimax, leaving me glad the book was done. The mysterious characters who appeared twice in the book were unexplained. Why did she waste time with them? Much hand-wringing throughout the book. And the purpose?It's good to have libraries where one may read before buying."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I'm a big fan of Perry's Monk and Pitt series, so I had high expectations for this first entry in a projected 5 volume series. Unfortunately the principle characters are nowhere near as compelling as William and Hester Monk or Thomas and Charlotte Pitt. The supposedly highly intelligent Reavleys overlook obvious paths of investigation and in general are blind to the emotions that motivate people to act -- until the very end when Joseph Reavley pulls a rabbit out of the hat to explain who killed whom. Furthermore, the conspiracy that sets things in motion remains offstage. The chief conspirator makes a couple of brief appearances that presumably serve to foreshadow his role as the Reavleys' nemesis in the future. But he is such a nonentity here that it's difficult to get excited about future volumes in the series. I'll probably read them -- but I'll also wait for the paperback rather than shelling out for the hardback."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I bought Shoulder the Sky (the second in this series, and this is my first Perry book) the day I finished No Graves as Yet, mostly because I like the way Perry showed how the people within this novel are forced to look at themselves and the people around them instead of just the routine 'hunt for the killer' format found elsewhere. Instead of studying the mind of the killer, Perry gives a study of those effected by the deeds.In spots this book also reads like a travelouge, but it never distracts and in fact enhances the feel of the book. I was surprised she was able to wrap up the whole story nicely in the final chapter. I did not think it could be done well when I started it. I was wrong, and this book is so right..., sounds like a corny 70's love song I know."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"Honestly, I have never been a big fan of Anne Perry's Victorian mystery series (Pitt, Monk), but I thought this one, set just before the outbreak of the first World War, was going to be different. However, just as I found Charles Todd's recent stand-alone, The Murder Stone, to be highly unsatisfactory, so is this book.This novel starts out with a bang and then peters out gradually over the rest of its course. The protagonists, Joseph and Matthew Reavly, are trying to get to the bottom of some sort of dire conspiracy that will do great harm to England on the eve of World War I. Their father, who discovered the existence of the conspiracy, is murdered, together with his wife, on the same day Archduke Ferdinand and his wife are asassinated in Sarajevo. As the investigation goes on, one of Joseph's prize students at Cambridge is found dead in his room, apparently murdered. Now the two investigations progress (sort of) side by side, with some suspicion that they may be related. Unfortunately, the story gets so bogged down with debates and discussions about the Home Rule issue and whether England will be drawn into a war, and a ton of historical facts and &quot;atmosphere,&quot; that the story only hobbles along. On top of everything else, the ending is very open-ended: Do the brothers really know the truth about the conspiracy, their parents' murder, and the death of Sebastian Allard, or don't they? Maybe the story is continued in the next volume. If not, this book ought to get one star instead of two."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"In the last days before the outbreak of World War I, England lives in denial. Surely England will not be driven into a war about an Austrian assassination. Surely the bankers will prevent a war that could destroy civilization and be bad for business. Some, though, are taking more active steps--steps designed to ensure the peace no matter what the cost. When John Reavley gets his hands on a secret document that, according to him, would destroy all English honor, he contacts his son in British Intelligence and sets off to meet him. But John and his wife Alys are killed in an apparent accident before they arrive. Sons Mathew and Joseph are left with the mystery of what happened to their parents, what happened to the document, and what secret could really be so destructive to the world.Joseph returns to his job as a lecturer at Cambridge University where one of his students is found dead--murdered in his room. Now Joseph has two mysteries to investigate. Oddly, however, the two seem connected. To Joseph, the dead student had seemed a bright beacon for the future, but as he digs deeper, he learns that Sebastian might have stooped to blackmail, intentional cruelty, and stealing another student's girlfriend. Any of those could justify murder, but could they explain the apparently cold-blooded death?Author Anne Perry's writing evokes an era when the British class system was still in flower, yet when the world is at the cusp of launching into one of the most destructive wars of all time. Her strong narrative style involves the reader, making us care about the characters, especially Joseph, and his attempts to reconcile his faith with the evil that happens. Perry relies a bit too heavily on coincidence and never explains how John Reavley ended up with such a critical document, but most readers will be willing to overlook these flaws due to the interesting picture of the past that Perry delivers."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I have always enjoyed Anne Perry's books, the Monk series better than the Pitt series. This was despite the sameness in format. I mean that I was thoroughly tired of every story involving a snooty rich family that made the police use the servants' entrance. Did the police of Victorian England simply not investigate crime among the other/lower classes? Or does Anne Perry not know about how \\"the other half\\" lived? I was completely sick of self-important aristocrats.So I was glad to see that she was beginning a new series. Finally, I thought,a change. Nope, sorry. The same old upper-crust bores. And this time, the book had me yawning and struggling to keep awake. I had to stop and read something else after every chapter.Give this one a pass. You won't be missing anything."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"It's always seemed odd to me that no one has given the 'Great War' the same kind of fictional attention that has been lavished upon World War II and the American Civil War. Drawing from her own family records, Anne Perry proposes to remedy that deficiency. If \\"No Graves As Yet\\" is indicative of the caliber of the four volumes still to come, this quintet may well become her masterwork.We will be following the fortunes of one English family, the Reavley siblings - Joseph (our hero), Matthew, Hannah and Judith - from that last halcyon summer of 1914 thru the horrors and devastation of World War I until the Armistice is finally signed in 1918. \\"No Graves As Yet\\" introduces these central characters in a thrilling, stand-alone story that is as tightly plotted and emotionally/intellectually challenging a mystery as any of her previous books. When the novel opens, their parents have both been killed in an automobile accident, and their grieving children...especially Joseph, the eldest (a professor of Biblical languages at Cambridge) and Matthew, an officer in the British Intelligence Service...find themselves confronted with a peculiar puzzle. Before his car inexplicably went off the road and crashed, Reavley senior was on his way to consult Matthew professionally (something he would not normally do) about a mysterious document that had somehow come into his possession which he claimed would disgrace the British Empire and could destroy the civilized world. That document is nowhere to be found in the wreckage, and the 'fortuitous' car accident suddenly becomes horrifically suspect. Subsequent events quickly convince the two brothers that unknown, powerful forces who will stop at nothing to recover the manuscript are behind their parents' deaths, thus impelling them to somehow get to it first themselves for fear of they know not what. While storm clouds gather in Serbia after the assassination of Arch-Duke Ferdinand, Jospeth sustains another, equally personal loss: one of his most brilliant and beloved students is brutally murdered on campus. As Matthew follows an elusive trail chasing the document, Joseph finds himself enmeshed in a criminal investigation where nothing...not friendship nor position nor avowed morality...can be taken at face value. Inevitably the two plot threads intertwine, and the utterly logical yet brutally chilling denouement is a shocker.For anyone who is as captivated by Anne Perry's writing as I am, it's easy to simply assume that the qualities which make her books so addictive will be present in anything new that she chooses to publish: exciting storytelling with a 'twist'...here, the surprising whereabouts of the document...which always leaves you thoroughly satisfied; characters whom you can genuinely care about and identify with, and vivid, evocative world-building that recreates whatever historical period she has chosen in your mind's eye as if it were here-and-now. It's no surprise to me that \\"No Graves As Yet\\" embodied ALL of these literary nuances. However, what stunned and delighted me about this special novel was what I can only call the utter beauty and lyricism of its style. I don't think Ms. Perry's ever written on this level before, and some of its passages left me aching for an England-lost-to-time which I love and have loved for so long. My only regret? There will apparently be a year between novels, and that's TOO LONG!"},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I'm a big fan of Perry's Monk and Pitt series, so I had high expectations for this first entry in a projected 5 volume series. Unfortunately the principle characters are nowhere near as compelling as William and Hester Monk or Thomas and Charlotte Pitt. The supposedly highly intelligent Reavleys overlook obvious paths of investigation and in general are blind to the emotions that motivate people to act -- until the very end when Joseph Reavley pulls a rabbit out of the hat to explain who killed whom. Furthermore, the conspiracy that sets things in motion remains offstage. The chief conspirator makes a couple of brief appearances that presumably serve to foreshadow his role as the Reavleys' nemesis in the future. But he is such a nonentity here that it's difficult to get excited about future volumes in the series. I'll probably read them -- but I'll also wait for the paperback rather than shelling out for the hardback."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"What a disappointment this is, after the superb Pitt and Monk detective novels set in Victorian times. Someone at the publishing house should have had the courage to point out some problems to the writer: (1) She repeats information not once but many times, apparently having forgotten that she had already said that; (2) The plot and denouement are not likely and are hard to follow. For example, the police supposedly look everywhere for the gun that killed Sebastian, and eventually it is deduced that the one place they didn't look was in the drain funnel on the roof of the master's abode. And lo, there it was, wrapped in a cloth and stuck, barrel down. To prove(?) that it was the fatal gun, the cistern barrel for that downpipe is dry. What? Say that again?In short, the characters, the dialogue, the atmosphere just don't measure up to the plunges the reader takes into the drawing rooms and rookeries of London, circa 1880+. Rather than go into this series, the reader would do well to go back and read the Victorian books. That's a sorry suggestion, and I'm sorry to have to make it."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"Anyone who wants to become a successful novelist must read and learn to analyze the work of writers already popular and held in high regard. Anne Perry, a best-selling author with two successful historical mystery series, certainly qualifies as someone aspiring writers should be able to learn from. I read several of her Thomas and Charlotte Pitt mysteries, but that was some years ago. A new series set during World War I intrigued me, as the historical novel I am currently working on begins in 1924.Has my study of novel writing made me too analytical, too nitpicky? I don't think so, since anyone wishing to write great fiction must set very high standards for themselves in today's highly competitive publishing world. Historical fiction especially demands that the writer knows her time period backwards and forwards.The first chapter of &quot;No Graves As Yet&quot; could do with fewer names for readers to begin learning all at once. One has no way of knowing whether all these people will be important to the story, and thus necessary to become familiar with. The vast majority of Americans know nothing of the rules of cricket, and could do with some simple explanation of the game. For heaven's sake, what is a &quot;lych&quot; gate? The word doesn't appear in any of my four American dictionaries, but I'd still like to know. Perhaps I should look it up on the Internet...Every once in a while, Perry surprises me with some obviously passive sentences, something my writing teacher would have insisted I rewrite. Example: &quot;Perhaps she would have been divorced by Thyer.&quot; This clearly should have been written: &quot;Perhaps Thyer would have divorced her.&quot;Perry, in her CBS Early Morning interview, spoke of four Reavley sibings appearing in her story, so it was a disappointment that the two sisters, Hannah and Judith, were such minor characters. They came across as flat. Joseph and Matthew could have been livened up a bit as well.Being somewhat dubious of Perry's historical accuracy, I was prompted to do a little research on my own when I read of the main character taking \\"two aspirins.\\" Did they even have aspirin back in those days? It took less than five minutes on the Internet to learn that sure enough, the Bayer company had obtained a patent for it in 1889. Aspirin tablets, however, were not manufactured until 1915. It would have been much more authentic to show Joseph Reavley using some aspirin powder, which is all that would have been available in 1914. Perry was off by only one year, but my point is that historical fiction demands extreme attention to tiny details such as this.I will leave it to others to express their disappointment in the uninteresting characters, the contrived nature of the mystery's solution, her overuse of phonetic dialogue, repeated use of the adverb \\"huskily,\\" and her excessive focus on a red herring that had Joseph Reavley jumping to too many conclusions.Have I learned anything about good historical fiction? Yes. It's never a breeze to write, even for someone of Anne Perry's caliber and reputation."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"This book is a somewhat generic mystery with interesting nuances. It is set in England, just before World War I, and during the time the Archduke of Ferdinand is assassinated in Sarajevo. The mystery is fine, the writing is good, but a central lurking issue is whether England will be drawn into the upcoming war (if there will be a war). Is this a fight England needs to join? Anne Perry believes it was. Obviously this impacts our times. Yet I feel WWI is a poor example because while one must repel invasion by unfriendly forces, WWI is more about powerful privileged men (the Russian Tsar, the German Kaiser, the English King, and the French whatever) and their cronies, who should have met on the dueling ground, but instead sent millions of their young male subjects to kill each other. Cowardice can trump fairness, and WWI is an example. Sadly, WWI also caused WWII, where even more young men died.

I'm a long-time reader of Anne Perry's Pitt and Monk series, and usually find her books to be engrossing, solidly plotted, and generally populated with well-drawn characters.However, I hope this is *not* the beginning of a new Perry series. I hate to think she would be spending any more time on this instead of devoting it to another entry into the Monk or Pitt chronicles! I should have known this book was a bad idea, because the opening scene is a cricket match, yes, complete with details of a game in this complex arcane sport which is a complete mystery to Americans like me. Slogging through the first few pages, splashed liberally as they were with incomprehensible cricket minutiae, I right away learned that the characters are flimsy paper cutouts, the plot is pure dross featuring (yawn!) Top Secret Papers Which Reveal Treason at the Highest National Level, and I could not get interested enough to keep on reading past the first 30 pages. I flipped to the last few pages to find out about the Top Secret Papers and then turned the book back in.Sorry, Ms. Perry, but this was a sad letdown for a devoted reader of your wonderful Victorian mysteries - and as the holder of a BA in History, I personally find the WWI era more interesting than the Victorian era."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"Anne Perry's new series is off to a great start with \\"No Graves as Yet.\\" Her historical fiction is well researched and her characters portray the feeling and attitudes of the day. When I finished reading this book, I couldn't wait for next one. I'm currently reading the last book in this series of five that have been progressively riveting. I feel that I'ved learned much about the British perspective of World War I from these novels and why these wars had such a huge influence on British life and attitudes even today. The effect on the U.S. is negligible by comparison."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I found this entire WWI series from Anne Perry to be very disappointing. The WWI setting was interesting but done much better in many other novels. The plot was somewhat incredible and the actions of characters at times outrageous. By the end of the books I felt I had wasted my time with repeated themes, one dimensional characters, and motives with no foundation. The potential for a meaningful work set during the Great War was completely lost and ended up being simply irritating and shallow."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I agree with all of the assessments of this book. I finally gave up after a few chapters and \\"scanned\\" through the rest of the book. Not up to par, Ms. Perry!! Too bad. Keep up the good work on the William Monk novels, but forget about this series. If you want to read about WW1 times, read Charles Todd."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"As Anne Perry has developed as a writer she has become more interested in social issues and less interested in the characters who are living through them - or (lest we forget) the mysteries that caused her fans to start reading her books in the first place. I was glad to see her starting in a new direction, since Monk and the Pitts are pretty much 'played out' and I haven't bought any of her new ones in a long time. This book is an interesting start but . .Joseph and Matthew need to be more clearly defined and differentiated. Joseph is mourning everything and everyone so clearly, it makes me wonder if Perry herself is working through a loss. Matthew is a stock character with no identifying features, except for his job. His chapters have no change in tone, except that he is not in agony every five minutes.I too was surprised not to find a good female lead in the group. Hannah is angry (and less intelligent than her brothers we are told). Judith is rebellious and a handful (we are also told) - but seems not to ever leave the house since she is always there when the brothers wander home. American readers will not resonate with Joseph totally, I think. He blames himself for not knowing things he couldn't possible have known and the reader is waaaayyy ahead of him in solving the mystery(s).This book is not a keeper, so don't spend a lot of money to read it. But I am happy Perry is trying something new and I will be interested to see if she can pick up the tempo in the next one. If not, she might as well forget about these characters and try something else."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"As an Anne Perry fan, I recognize that this series is a departure from her usual 19th London mysteries. However, I thought this first book in the series does what it has to do. It lays the foundation for the other four books. Perry always gives me a wonderful sense of the time period in her novels and this book is no exception. This series will obviously contain many moral dilemmas - again, a bit of a departure for Perry. However, I think some of the comments on the low ratings are unjustified."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I struggled through this novel hoping it would improve, and towards the end - it did somewhat, but it still put me to sleep several times!

Like another reviewer, when I finished reading this book, I said \\"Huh?\\" There are so many loose ends, you have to wonder if there is a sequel. Realizing that the next novel does reintroduce Joseph immediately, I will eat my words if Joseph, in his trench in France, suddenly decides to reflect on his parents' murders, etc. and fills in all the unanswered questions. Actually I had wondered if somehow I had missed something, but now I see from other reviews that, indeed, lots of things were never explained. As a lover of mysteries, (...) leading you along and then stabbing you in the back. Like others, I thought the book bogged down in rambling philosophy, but I kept going, hoping to find solutions.In fairness, there were one or two interesting philosophical comments: Sebastian's belief that it really matters what you leave behind, \\"...it's your thanks to the past, your love of the present, and your gift to the future.\\""},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I am frankly astonished at the reviews of this fine book appearing on this site. No Graves as Yet is a beautifully crafted and entirely convincing portrayal of the intellectual climate of England at the beginning of the Great War and serves as the entry portal to what promises to be a subtle and evocative examination of the moral issues that faced England in 1914-18. The mystery is secondary to the evaluation of the question of what issues justify war, and the picture drawn of Cambridge in the summer of 1914 is the necessary predicate for the broader picture that will, presumably, be sketched in the remainder of the series.If the Reavely characters seem a bit callow in this novel, it is because their characters, assumptions and world views have not yet been tested. This story, involving the seemingly accidental death of their parents, begins the process of testing the assumptions by which Edwardian England lived and which were shattered by the experiences of the war.While I think this novel is beautifully written and the characters a good deal subtler than other reviewers, by all means reading this novel should be followed immediately by reading its sequel Shoulder the Sky, which carries the story into the war through May, 1915 and gives a better feel of the author's overall plan for the series.I recommend both books most highly."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"It's June of 1914, and a lush English summer is underway.

Unfortunately, \\"NO GRAVES AS YET,\\" gets off to a slow start, and this may discourage those who ordinarily would be interested in reading the other four books. The pace does pick up about half-way through, but my advice to fans of Anne Perry, historical fiction, thrilling mysteries, and chilling espionage, is to begin with book two, \\"Shoulder the Sky,\\" which does a terrific job of recapping the plot. I can almost guarantee that if you hang in there with the author's most ambitious literary project yet, you will not be sorry.On a sunny afternoon in late June, 1914, Cambridge professor and ordained chaplain, Joseph Reavley, learns that his parents, John and Alys, have died in an automobile crash. He was watching a cricket match when his younger brother Matthew, an officer in England's Secret Intelligence Service, (SIS), arrived to give him the horrific news. Coincidently, on the very same day, June 28, 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated, along with his wife, by a Bosnian-Serb nationalist. Austria-Hungary's resulting demands against the Kingdom of Serbia were to activate a series of alliances, which, within weeks saw all of the major European powers at war.The day before his death, John Reavley, a former member of Parliament, had phoned Matthew to tell him that he discovered documents outlining a plan which, if implemented, \\"would ruin England's honor and change the history of the world.\\" The deadly \\"accident\\" occurred while the Reavleys were driving from their home in St. Giles to deliver the papers to Matthew. These documents seemingly vanished into thin air. They were definitely not present at the crash scene. The circumstances surrounding John and Alys Reavley's deaths are too suspicious for the brothers not to take action. They investigate and find that their parents were actually murdered. The car crash was used to cover the crime.Back at work, Matthew cannot concentrate on the job at hand. He is too distracted by the violent murders and the circumstances surrounding them. Joseph, already grieving at the loss of his beloved wife, goes into a tailspin with the news about his parents. The last straw, in a series of traumas, occurs when he discovers that his most promising student, a pacifist, has been murdered on campus. The brothers take off on a journey through England to find the truth, and, hopefully the documentsJoseph begins to question his core beliefs and convictions. The world is not the place he thought it to be, and the foundation of his faith is shaken. The turmoil in the brothers' lives is echoed by the political turbulence on the continent, and the ever-growing Irish rebellion. Is there a possible connection between John and Alys Reavley's deaths and the impending war? Judith Reavley, the youngest sister, is also restless and discontented. And another siser, Hannah, though grief stricken by the sudden loss of her parents, is kept busy with life at home.The ending explodes with the brothers' findings and the beginning of the Great War, which many predict will end in just 4 months, around Christmas time. Joseph is not the only naive one - the world is still a place of relative innocence in August of 1914. WWI will soon change everything forever.A heads-up here - the primary plot, which propels all five books, is the mystery surrounding the figure of the \\"Peacemaker,\\" a man who represents those who seek to make a treaty between Kaiser Wilhelm II and King George V, which would unite warring Germany and Britain into a common front. The results would be disastrous for the entire world. The discovery of the man's identity, and all the details of his machinations, are not revealed until book five...so I still do not know what happens. I thought I would find the answers at this novel's conclusion and I was disappointed. However, there are enough mysteries throughout the series to keep the pages turning. The wonderful historical fiction is well researched, and the author's description of war on the Western Front is so vivid that the reader feels as if he/she is present in the trenches. The character development is brilliant and I have come, after accompanying these people on so many adventures, to care for them deeply. The chilling espionage, and the perpetrators involved, provide an added attraction which builds tension and drama through all five books.Again, if you have not bought or borrowed \\"NO GRAVES AS YET,\\" I would advise you to go straight to book two. But whatever you do, don't miss Anne Perry's WWI series.Jana PerskieShoulder the Sky: A Novel (World War I)Angels in the Gloom: A Novel (World War I)At Some Disputed Barricade: A Novel (World War I)We Shall Not Sleep: A Novel (World War I)"},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"I've read some of Anne Perry's other mysteriesFuneral in Blue,A Breach of Promise (William Monk Novels)and enjoyed them, but this one is probably her best work so far.The author introduces characters that are three dimensional and real, and her description of England on the eve of World War I is both literate and vivid.

But with this latest book, the first in a series that takes place during World War I, everything changes. Perhaps the change of venue has done her good; perhaps I am more in tune with that period in English history. But for whatever reason, I loved this book. It takes place in the hallowed halls of Cambridge; murder racks the personal lives of one of the professors, Joseph Reavley, as well as the students in residence, as suspicion is cast over all. Joseph's brother has a somewhat minor job in the British Secret Service, and as the crime consumes the daily lives of its characters, so does war loom over all of England.The crime and the impending war are clearly related, so as war draws closer, so does the importance of solving the murder. No, war will not be held off if the murder is solved - history is used as a back drop here and an important character in itself. But World War I would do more than just cause a few years of chaos and untold casualties .... this is what we know as the Great War - literally the war that changed both the face and character of Europe. World War I forced England into the 20th century, and the England will will emerge is not the same one that entered. There is an overriding sense of loss and recognition that the world is about to change in this book -especially for the students at Cambridge. Solving the crime ties up a loose end - but the real crime is in the stupidity - and inevitability - of war.This is a book that explores not only the characters' responses to a crime, but the mood of a generation that is about to go to war. This is not history steeped in dates, but an exploration of what world events do to people and the psyche of a country about to experience massive change. At the book's close, characters start to don uniforms, preparing for the next step, which is taking up arms.There are four more books in the series - and I eagerly await them. Ann Perry has always been a great re-creator of time and place, and I truly believe that talent has been elevated in this latest book."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"Per the jacket, No Graves as Yet is the debut episode of a new series by Anne Perry featuring Reverend-Professor Joseph Reavley and his extended family. Reavley's parents and two men from his university are killed or murdered in what appear to be unrelated incidents during one summer. Reavley sets out to discover the truth about his parents and discovers shocking links to all of the deaths.Ordinarily, I would be thrilled to find one of my favorite authors spawning a new series. But I am holding my congratulations until I read book #2, as this book offered me less entertainment than I expected from the accomplished Ms. Perry.What I liked about No Graves as Yet: The beginning was highly emotional for me. I wept through the first chapter, but found that the remainder of the book could not evoke any emotion out of me whatsoever--neither grief or tension (except disappointment.)After Chapter Two, I could not find any suspense at all. No Graves as Yet held a lot of promise for a good story in the beginning, but its momentum fizzled out too soon. The ending felt like a puzzle piece that was forced to fit where it didn't really belong. While it plugged a hole, it did not make the best picture. I hope the author was saving some intrigue for the next book. Sadly, this book did not leave me satisfied or chopping at the bit for the next one.Puzzlements: First of all, Reavley seemed to be a man of very shallow, shaken faith. I cannot imagine why he would feel compelled, by the end of the story, to enter the battlefield where men's souls are in dire need of man of strong faith. Secondly, what was the purpose for the younger brother Matthew's involvement in the plot after the first chapter? The youngest sister's role seemed utterly foolish to me. Perhaps Ms. Perry plans to build this strong-willed young lady her into a strong woman like her other series' characters, Mrs. Pitt and Mrs. Monk (but I sincerely hope not--I get tired to death of Ms. Perry preaching women's equality all the through her books--enough already! Lets do something different now.).Overall: I hope the next books in this series offer more intrigue and less preaching (pun intended). I thought the peace-war issue was ridiculous and way over done. But, I still like Anne Perry. I hope I like the next book better. I really want to. So, do you want to buy this book? Sure, why not? Go for it."},{"Title":"No Graves As Yet","review":"The more I read by Anne Perry, the more I realize what a mediocre writer she truly is.I am somewhat of a WW1 buff, so I thought I'd try this book to see what Perry could do with a different time period.From the first chapter, she simply rolls out one plot cliche after another, with overwrought dialog and characters from central casting. The central mystery isn't even that compelling, and there are mysterious characters whose significance is never explained. I realize now that the reason for THAT ploy was to drag out this thin plot into an entire series, which is the literary equivalent of watering down the soup.I will not be returning to this series. If you're looking for some quirky mysteries set in the same general era, try the Charles Todd series about Ian Rutledge.

The brothers quickly determine that their parents' death does not appear to be accidental, so they begin trying to find out who caused their car accident. Matthew reveals that their father had telephoned him the night before he died and said that he had obtained a secret document which \\"could change the face of England forever\\". The elder Mr. Reavley was on his way to give the document to Matthew when the accident occurred. Just a few weeks later, one of Joseph Reavley's star students is found dead in his room with a gunshot through his head.

The author evokes a sense of the peace and serenity which pervaded England prior to World War One. However, there is not much action in the story. The first hundred pages moved very slowly.

The so-called unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics and 2. Alfred-North Whitehead's philosophy of Organism. As such, it is only incidently about the main title. It's possible there has been a major misunderstanding but I had hoped to see more than this.Be forewarned, the book is about the possibility of Whitehead's philisophy applied to mathematics and its usefuleness in science. You will need a fairly deep understanding of Whitehead's work already before even attempting this book. Whitehead's work is not explained and is expected to be known. His rather complex theory of organism is not even introduced but assumed.The chapters are separated into the following: 1. Introduction, 2. Whitehead on Mathematics and Philosophy, 3. Zeno's Paradoxes, 4. On Philosophising Adequately about science, Mathematics and Reality, 5. The Model in Physical Science, 6. The Model of Organism in Physical Science, 7. Mathematics and Necessity and 8. Aspects of Whiteheadian Philosophy of Mathematics. There are interesting aspects to these chapters concerning Zenos paradoxes which, although appearing to have been resolved through calculus, are in fact far deeper than this. The last chapter is fascinating concering the limitations of mathematics and perspective in science. In fact the whole book has snippets of really interesting ideas which are not really helped by the writing style which is difficult and wordy. The fact this text was a PhD thesis doesn't help. It should have been thoroughly revised for reading by people other than Whitehead experts. A thorough introduction to his concepts is essential.The book takes time to read and most would give up before the half-way mark. I struggled through hoping for tidbits and found them, occasionally. Most of the time I could read maybe 5-6 pages at a sitting without the tedious writing putting me off.However, wait and you will be rewarded as you progress, a little, not much, but sometimes its worth it. These rewards come from the pen of Whitehead rather than the author. Whitehead's ideas are deep and he studies aspects of science not usually looked at because they are so thoroughly ingrained that they remain almost unconscious.If you want a philosophy of life/organisms that is stimulating, deep and not wholly lacking in the deadness/lifelessness of analysis then read something by Bergson."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"This book is one of the most valuable resources I've ever seen regarding color. The book is more than just a book--it is a tool to be used and referred to often. I am particularly impressed with its scope in that it can be used by all fiber artists as well as bead artists. The book also has been designed by a practical person. First of all, it lays flat. Second it has pockets at the back so that the removable parts can be saved easily after working with them. The photography is superb and the printing is outstanding. I felt like I could almost pluck the examples off the page! Finally, Deb's writing is concise and to the point. No wading through tiresome text. For the price it is the best bargain in the fiber field today. This one will be a classic!"},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"Needless to say, Deb Menz is one of my favorite fiber teachers of all time. And her last book, Color in Spinning, will always be the tool that turned me onto color gungho. This one, furthered my color education and opened my eyes to the endless possibilities of the color and hue spectrum. It even has a color wheel, value scale, hue family colors, and color harmony overlays! I highly recommend this book as a must have tool for any fiber person. I think it will be wonderful for many people just getting into design who haven't had formal theory classes or the opportunity to take a lot of color theory or dyeing classes. Deb does a great job covering how color theory affects a variety of mediums: spinning, knitting, weaving, beading, quilting, needlepoint and embroidery techniques."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"Colorworks is a great introduction to color theory for people whowork in fiber arts, packed with lots of examples of color schemesworked out in knitting, weaving, beads, quilting, paper, machine and surface embroidery. While it is not nearly as in-depth as the now out-of-print Color and Fiber, it is also more accessible. It is also not as specific as Mary Fry's Color for Needlework, but it provides a good, solid ground for a stitcher's exploration of color.Almost half the book is made up of color tools, including palettes of each of twelve hue, ranging from fully saturated hues to extremely muted tones and shades. A Color Wheel and Value Scale are also provide. A series of templates has holes cut out to be used in conjunction with the color wheel to find color combinations.The seven chapters of the book cover all the major topics in colorstudies. There are chapters on color relationships, value,contrasts, and harmonies. Each sub-topic within the chapters isgiven s page of text. Next to it are nine samples in various mediashowing the principle discussed. These examples use the same design from page to page, varying only in the color used. As much as anything, this gives graphic demonstration of the topics and will fuel stitchers' imaginations.The last two chapters apply color to specific media. The sixthchapter discusses the characteristics of media in relation to color. Most folks know that shiny surfaces look lighter than matte surfaces, but how does this apply to knitting yarn or beads. Knowing something of the characteristics of yarns before you shop will help you in making choices. The final chapter, shows how a color scheme is developed in each of the nine crafts used in the book. Paper scraps show the basic colors involved while the text outlines the color harmony used as well as the specific colors. A value scale on paper is included and samples of the media used are also included in the illustration.This book provides just enough information on color to get acraftsperson started with this exciting topic. Unlike many books on color, this book doesn't talk about mixing colors, since thesematerials are all discreet. But it should be considered a starting point for color exploration, not a complete book."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"Wonderful book! There's probaby more than I'll ever need to know about color theory in this book, but I love it for giving me the confidence to dye and combine colors I would have never thought of combining. I've read other reviewers complain about the difficulty of the punch-out reference pages in the back of the book, but that's easily solved by using an exacto knife and about 5 minutes. The results are worth it and the book is all the info you'll ever need to forge ahead and combine colors for whatever application you need."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"Color theory can be difficult to understand let alone put to use. This book not only explains color theory in an easy to follow manner but also includes photographs of samples in 9 different craft areas to illustrate each topic. The samples include knitting, quilting, beading, paper and weaving. Each medium adds it own twist to the \\"rules\\" so seeing an example is worth a thousand words. The portion on value is very good as the role of a colors value is often overlooked. The value principles are also illustrated with real materials. The color wheel and color chips helps one put all the information to use. This book is both a guide and a tool."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"Deb Menz's Color Works is about color combination. There are numerous illustrations of theory and practice. The pages of samples showing several mediums makes the book for me. The same color on yarn, fabric, seed beads, or paper has a different resonance. The text illustrates how color/medium combinations \\"can be dramatic or theatrical.\\" The examples push the reader to consider alternative color choices. Goethe's color theory of relative proportions is convincingly illustrated. Deb Menz offers practical methods to add more colors (hexad harmony) while avoiding a rainbow look. There's plenty to retrain the eye and mind."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"A great resource for the fiber artist; the other high-star comments say it all; my only gripe are the cardboard template tools in the back which we're asked to punch out. This takes a fair amount of time and patience because of inadequate perforations given. This was disappointing because the rest of the book is first-rate in design, content and inspiration."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"Really, this book covers all you'll need to experiment with color. I never knew that so much was involved when making color choices. It's not hard to understand, but it took me a bit to understand the chapter on value. Once I read it through twice, though, it all started to make sense.It also contains a color wheel with punch out overlays to help you choose colors. I did find them hard to punch out, as another reviewer stated, and ended up using scissors to cut the perforations.This book is just packed with information. If you are interested in exploring color, you'll find this book very helpful."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"If you are a craftsperson, this is a terrific reference tool! The examples of spinning, beading, weaving, quilting, and embroidery really show you how color works in each realm. Best of all are the tear out color wheel and color harmony overlays that get you thinking about your palette."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"Finally, a book that I can actually us as a resource!! Anyone that is interested in learning the truth about color and how it affects design must have this book. It includes working templates and explains techniques to aid with color selection."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"Very in depth discussion of color with enough examples to make the text crystal clear. Definately recommended if you are ready to explore color and how to really USE it in your chosen medium."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"I've had this for a few years, but just bought two for friends because it is so helpful with putting together color schemes, whether for weavers, knitters, painters or home decorators. In addition to having the color wheel and color schemes depicted on paper, the photos of knitted, crocheted and woven pieces in various schemes is priceless for showing how interlacing, light and shadow affect the colors."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"I bought this book after I took a color theory class for painters. It is a wonderful book and contains so much of what I learned in the class plus more. The illustrations are so helpful in visualizing color groupings. A big plus is the color wheel and templates to pick out your own color combinations. I use this book when painting as well as when I'm creating digital art. Very useful."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"In \\"Color Works,\\" Deb Menz clearly presents the theory necessary for building a solid understanding of color use. The book is written specifically for fiber artists, which is important since color books aimed at painters, printers and photographers really can't address the unique ways in which light interacts with fiber.Since the study and use of color is a science as well as an art, this book is organized methodically, in a progression similar to a university color class. Ms. Menz explains each principle in words, and then shows on the facing page examples in color worked in various media: spinning, knitting, weaving, hand embroidery, bead embroidery, surface design, machine embroidery, pieced quilting, and paper collage. Despite the structured presentation, the book is truly inspiring due to the beauty of the color plates and the reproductions of finished art pieces scattered throughout.Although the author does not offer explicit exercises per se, the reader can easily work with the book hands-on by going through each section and making samples in her chosen medium the way the author has done. The spiral binding is wonderful for this (I wish more fiber books had that feature), since it lays flat, so you can look at it while you're working an exercise or a project. Serious, determined people can work from beginning to end with good result, whilst people who like to \\"play\\" more can gain a lot by working sections out of sequence, as the spirit moves them.Ms. Menz has provided auxiliary aids at the back of the book, such as value gradation charts, color charts, a color wheel, and templates for choosing harmonies from the color wheel--all easily removed via pre-stamped perforations. She has even included a storage pocket on the inside cover to place all this stuff after you've removed it from the book. The charts are really useful and are made to last on sturdy cardstock.So many of us take color for granted -- we see it every day. But our colorful world is truly miraculous, and the more we think about color, the more we can notice and enjoy the beauty that surrounds us. Ms. Menz's book is an excellent guide to learning to perceive and use color with a more practiced and appreciative eye."},{"Title":"Color Works","review":"This is a book all crafters should have on their bookshelf.

Having moved onto raw land after living in camping trailers and RVs, we had been used to chemical toilets and now faced a situation where we were weekly going to a dump site. I had heard that there were &quot;composting toilets&quot; which were a great alternative, especially for organic farmers, but that they were very expensive. Jenkins' book contributed more to our life than any other resource excluding the Holy Bible. He presents well documented facts for any one who is concerned with bacteria, disease, the environment, recycling and perhaps best of all simplicity and economics. Joes book has helped our family to live a less stressful and more productive life. What he presents can be understood by anyone and will fit the budget of the poorest of us.

Joe's snappy prose laced with a liberal dose of humor present this unusual topic in such a manner as to keep the reader wanting more. Tom Griffin's illustrations are just what was needed to illuminate various ideas presented throughout The Humanure Handbook. The main point I would like to make, though, is to tell you that I had the experience of living on Joe's farm and witnessed the use of humanure in his garden. The produce was first-rate and abundant.

The attractive, comfortable varnished wood bench with a 5-gallon bucket underneath was comfortable, esthetic, and had no odor.

It also shows that for little money (you don't always need to buy a multi-thousand dollar factory designed system), the individual owner-builder can design a system that will cost nothing to operate and make a tangible reduction on the impact to our planet.An excellent book, five - starsPete"},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"I first read the Humanure Handbook in 1996 and recently obtained a copy of the new edition, after giving my old copy to an outdoor education facility. The system outlined in the book is simple, inexpensive, free of odors and pests, and ecologically sound. In sharing this information with others, the author helps us to make the cognitive connection between our lifestyles and the environment by showing us that the circle of nutrients must be completed to be in balance. This is accomplished by putting back into the soil what we take from it. Clear and concise instructions on how to do so, backed up by hard science, make up the majority of the book. The best thing I can say about the book is that I have been using the information for several years by composting my post-digested food, and haven't had any problems. Simple, straightforward, and good for the planet, I recommend this book to everyone whose body expels post-digested food."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"The Humanure Handbook is a detailed, humorous, helpful guide to the recycling of urine and excrement. I have purchased dozens of copies to distribute among friends. As an organic oyster farmer on Willapa Bay in SW Washington, I see the need for better water quality protection through educational efforts to keep pollutants out of our rivers and estuaries. A composting toilet and graywater reuse system is now a legal and safe approach in many States, leading to the ultimate sustainable goal of zero waste discharge. Waste not, want not. Joe Jenkins tells us how to do it simply, affordably, safely, and effectively. Laugh when you read this book, but take it seriously: start composting, conserve water, improve your landscape, and feel superior to those lesser mortals who have yet to figure out that it is not a good idea to crap in drinking water."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"Human effluent has been the nemesis of most societies for centuries and despite all of our current technological prowess, we have yet to intelligently address one of the most basic biological functions of our existence. And our effluent is backing-up on us, big time.After \\"defecating in our drinking water\\" via the conventional toilet, as author Joseph Jenkins succinctly points out, it then gets transported with little or inadequate processing right into our ground water, waterways and/or oceans where it reeks havoc on the environment and contaminates future drinking water. And this is an earmark of a \\"civilized\\" society???The Humanure Handbook provides a wealth of thoroughly researched, hands-on experience and scientific data that demonstrates that after a natural process called \\"thermophilic\\" bacterial digestion, which occurs in a compost bin and where all pathogens are killed, excreta is then converted to a valuable nutrient for agriculture and thereby completing a full-circle life cycle. Most importantly, effluent can then be kept out of our drinking water and not treated or referred to as an undesirable \\"waste product\\".The information is conveyed in a humorous, folksy, down-to-earth easy to understand style along with drawings, charts, tables, photos and a wealth of resource info for further research. Jenkins' website has a forum for sharing more info, experiences and to answer any and all questions in the process of humanuring and constructed wetland gray water treatment.The info in this book should be required study for every human on the planet- it is so basic and fundamental, yet so vitally important for the health of our precious planet and the myriad life forms it supports. Joseph Jenkins has put together a monumental guide to help cleanup Earth, re-invigorate common sense and I should think he is worthy of a Nobel Prize for his efforts! As it stands, Jenkins' book has won many other accolades and awards and I shall add my heartfelt THANKS! to him, his family, and their collaborators!"},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"This sawdust toilet solution has given me great peace of mind. Since we moved 9 years ago to the place we are at now I have been unhappy with the way the septic system is. We have a problem with back up at the corner drain and it is worse when it rains.So for nine years I have tried to conserve flushing the toilet because I was so aware that I was part of the problem. Don't laugh, but I would &quot;hold it&quot; rather than relieve myself just avoid flushing that toilet so much. For nine years.Now I just go. (I drink a lot of water and have to go a lot!) Today I already saved 35 gallons of water. When I told my husband how much water I saved he mentioned that our electric bill will probably go down because it takes electricity to run the pump.I ordered a couple Humanure Handbooks from Amazon. I have to gingerly offer one to my neighbor across the pond. Because their septic backs up, it floods our property and has killed several of our trees. This plan would solve further problems. I don't know if she will go for it. Time will tell. But she does have a nice garden and compost pile already. Might be right up her alley just as it is mine."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"Everyone should read this book, even if they have no intention or ability to use a humanure composting system. It provides a wealth of information on a subject that has been ignored for too long...human waste - how to dispose of it in a sensible, sustainable, practical, useful manner. We haven't flushed a toilet in this house in eight months, since we got this book and built our own sawdust toilet and composting box out back. We had a serious drought here this summer and our well was REAL low, but we had no problems because we weren't FLUSHING FOUR GALLONS OF CLEAN DRINKING WATER UNDERGROUND each time we went in the bathroom. I always wondered why we eliminate in water, anyway. And it doesn't stink, the compost box doesn't stink, it's simple and straightforward and clean and the humanure toilet's time has come! Everybody who comes in our house gets dragged into the bathroom by my husband to meet our new humanure toilet! Then I drag them outside to meet my wonderful compost box! So far we've had one convert, a couple with a camp who were using a stinking old outhouse, and they are just thrilled with the idea of using a humanure toilet next summer when they move back to camp. As a bonus, our electric bill dropped substantially, just because the water pump doesn't have to kick on every time a toilet is flushed. Buy this book, read it, start using a humanure toilet, tell all your friends, lend the book to your friends, do it now! Then read Joe Jenkins' other book, \\"Balance Point.\\""},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"We were so inspired by this book we ripped out both our flush toliets.

Yet, everyday, people defecate and urinate in it, and billions of gallons of treated waste is washed into rivers and the ocean. This book offers a solution: the thermophilic composting of human excrement and urine. It is written in an accessible, interesting, and informative manner, with a great deal of wit.

Couldn't be much more simple than this. Poop, cover with sawdust, dump in compost pile, clean buckets, reuse. We've used in our yurt for last year and nothing but good things to say about it. Takes as much time to empty and clean 3 buckets every couple weeks as it would to clean 3 toilets. Wonder why someone never came up with this in all the years of outhouse use!"},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"Of all the useful books I have purchased, none have made as large an impact as this one. It brings together the useful and the historical aspects of human waste disposal in a way that can make a human difference now. I have used the proposed system and can attest that it works well with a minimum of odor. It truly makes sense not to use our drinkung water to mave our wastes, and that the material can be composted and returned to the land., It has the added benefit to get me outside to do daily weeding to get the material that is needed to cover the compost."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"i've learned more about composting than I ever knew (and micobiology) from this book.

Now it's my turnthe more i learn the more it kills me that so many of us have a mental block and most can't even consider the thought of having anything to do with recyclying human waste. This book lays it out so simply yet with great detail and respect to the living earth (in every aspect! from preserving clean water, not being a disease on the earth etc etc). the methods laid out in this book teach you how to recycle human waste in a natural way which is safe, clean, odor free, and most importantly which transforms \\"it\\" into the purest cleanest humus/dirt you can find! truly! science proves it!I live in a rental located in a beautiful part of california and I would expect to have amazing soil in my back yard but instead it's bone dry and rock hard...roots of tree's are exposed etc...I've had to bring lots of dirt to the property in order to garden...In a perfect world, this system of recycling human waste (*in the proper way*) would be accepted by all and every home would have a system that worked. we would all replenish the soil of wherever it is we live by this process...I can't wait for the opportunity to try!"},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"I found it hard to put this book down because it is both informative and alarming.

Way to go Joe, and best of luck with your new book!"},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"Changed the way I think about things; bought the book two years ago and after following the guidelines on an outdoor toilet for this period of time I'm about to install three indoors. Make sure you read the book a few times and ensure you follow the do's and don'ts to the letter (only two pages in the book) and it will work. It takes me less than five minutes a week to deal with two peoples waste (plus guests) which I'm sure is a lot less time than some people spend per day looking after a flushing toilet! The book may be a bit technical at times and you probably don't think you need all the info, but it's all good stuff to convince yourself and others that this is the right thing to do in an over populated and polluted planet."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"During my first reading of this book, I was a newbie to the whole concept presented in this book. While I had an open mind, I had a lot of questions. Fast forward two years and I now have been using a composting toilet for a year, have given out at least 10 copies of the book and referred it to over a 100 people. It is posted on my blog http://myminimobilecottagebuildingjourney.blogspot.com/ and was key in my decision to going down the composting path with my tiny house.The book is clear, well written and insightful.

Between Mr. Jenkins's book and his website, I had all of my questions and concerns answered or addressed. I would recommend this for anyone concerned about their impact on the environment as well as a more healthy way of practicing sustainable living.It is also a great read for anyone planning any form of off the grid living or survival situation. In my opinion most of the survival plans I have read do not really address a long-term realistic sanitation plan. \\"The Humanure Handbook\\" addresses these issues and more."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"This book combines humor, biology, humor, facts, humor, and specific instructions.

The one we spent over a $1000 for before we bought the book and the $50 one we built after we bought the book. Guess which one is easier to deal with?!"},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"Mr. Jenkins has not only shown us another excellent way to restore the earth, but done it in a way that is delightful to read. Like many of todays &quot;Green&quot; writers he tends to place all Fundamentalist Christians in the &quot;cause of all our problems&quot; camp but even there he is not vicious and does touch on some underlying perceptions that have added significantly to our present polluted earth. The knowledge he shares is so overwhelming that the few &quot;New-Age&quot; digs that he slips in against organized religion are hardly a bump in the road as his technical facts work for all of us and need to be heard by everyone. Joe makes learning fun and is the only one holding class in this field that I know of, at least in a manner that presents clear do-it-yourself instructions and on &quot;a poor-boy&quot; budget. If the author of the Bible reads Joes' book he may roll his eyes during a sentence or two but over all is nodding &quot;Good job Joe&quot;."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"Joe Jenkins is a great guy with a great message to spread. He wakes up his readers to the possibilities of a greatly overlooked resource. Many people, like myself, probably have thought about the use of humane manure for garden fertilizer, but it seemed too crazy. Jenkins EMPOWERS us to take advantage of our byproducts, and shows us that there's nothing to fear! Humanmanure composting makes SO much sense. It provides needed fertilizer, reduces pollution, and reduces the need for huge, dirty sewage infrastructure. It's a shame that so many toilets continue to flush every day.I am currently doing grass-roots development work in rural Bolivia, and am hoping to implement humanure composting in the way Jenkins teaches it. This low-tech technology has SUCH tremendous potential in the developing world, where farmers ALWAYS need more fertilizer, and where there are often not even latrines, let alone sewage systems. Excrement usually just lies about, eaten by pigs and dogs, or leaking into water sources, thus continuing the viscous cycle of parasite diseases.Joe Jenkins has empowered me to do what makes sense by nature and recycle precious organic nutrients. Everyone should read this book and wake up to these fecal realities. I read his book over a year ago, and am still so excited that I'm considering doing humanure research for my PhD!

Composting toilets looked like a good idea relative to septic tanks. Then I found Jenkins' book. Not only does he have the cheapest system, it turns out it is undoubtedly the best system for everybody. Neither my wife nor I liked the idea at first, but Jenkins will lead you by the hand to arrive at the only tenable position for you, your family, and the world. And all I wanted was a good toilet. He is a little redundant and some of the later sections can be skipped as a repeat of former stuff.

I recomend this book highly to anyone who eats. However I found the author's dealing with Christianity to be incomplete. He confuses some (okay most) &quot;Christains&quot; with the precepts of Biblical teaching. As a Christain I find his recomendations to be in line the biblical teachings of stewardship and considering others more important than oneself. The author comes just short of blaming Christianity for the worlds sewage. Even with this said I beleive this book should be read and acted upon by every Christain. Not because we should worship the earth but because it is a gift of God and is therefore precious. I also found the book to be somewhat repetative. I found this to help with the teaching value of the book but it adversely effected the enjoyment of the read. The author should be highly praised for the thoroughness of his research and for his courage to say what needs to be said. Do not let my criticisms disuade you. EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK!!!

I am an green libertarian so environmental and ecological issues are a concern to me. The more I look at the circle of life, our supply chain issues, transportation systems, food security, food safety, and the un-sustainability of our lifestyles the more this book makes perfect sense in closing the circle or loops in so many areas. I have been doing a lot of reading on permaculture lately and frankly humanure should be a key piece of the puzzle. I found this book well researched on the topics of pathogens, temperatures, time frames for proper composting. I highly recommend this book to anyone who gardens and composts as an enhancement to something they are already doing. Much to my surprise I found the author to be correct that there isn't any smell or issues at all with this type of toilet system and frankly I am wondering why we ever started using a water flush system in the first place.

Al Gore was and is wrong - Carbon dioxide levels increase following temperature increases - they don't bring them about. The earth has has ice ages and warm spells for thousands of years before humans showed up on the scene and they will likely continue after we are gone. That's all an aside - it doesn't change the author's very valuable message: Composting and recycling of human \\"waste\\" is the right thing to do regardless of the reasons one chooses to do it. I still use compact fluorescents and conserve energy wherever I can - but not for made-up reasons.Back to the subject at hand - this is a great book and I only hope that perusing it will convince some of the \\"Fecophobes\\" that re-using our bodily products after properly composting them is safe, beneficial, and preserves our precious fresh water supply.Read the book, become a believer!"},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"If you want to learn about how to design systems that will let you safely eat your poop, this book is for you!

While it is far from a scientific discourse on the merits of using human waste as garden manure, it is both self-aware and honest about its own shortcomings.A fantastic book if you are looking to do things &#34;intelligently, but the old fashioned way&#34; but don't quite know what you mean. While most of the passages regarding human health are anecdotal (i.e. in 30 years of humanure composting no one has ever gotten sick from my vegetable garden), the process and awareness that it brings to someone who has never considered composting their own excrement is well worth the ticket price.The section on fecophobia is amazing and I have started to use it as a conversation starter by trying to lend it to friends; you learn something about your peers when you start talking about &#34;black gold&#34; and the ability to be self-reliant using only your garden tools, the method of humanure composting, time and mother earth.

Great information."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"To anyone who believes that once flushed the contents of the toilet are \\"safe\\" and \\"away\\", I recommend reading this book. To those more informed who are looking at an expensive commercial composting toilet ... I recommend reading this book before you make your decision. K.I.S.S. - Keep It Simple Stupid!Joe Jenkins offers an inspiring, humorous, well-researched and well-written book. He makes what should be a very obvious point ... flushed \\"away\\" or thrown \\"away\\" doesn't mean gone ... it merely means \\"someplace else\\", and worse ... someone else's problem.We live in rural AZ where, as far as I am concerned, deliberate water wastage should be considered a crime. Defecating and urinating into our rapidly diminishing, precious water supply is the true definition of madness! It is time for the world to wake up and remember what Nature has always taught ... the function of all organic matter is to enrich and replenish the soil.For those worried about contamination and their health ... I offer these words (coincidentally from another composting toilet book that, other than this quote, isn't worth the paper it's printed on!):\\"Healthy humans excrete healthy E. coli (only some strains of this bacteria can make you ill) and other healthy bacteria. If you are healthy, and you compost your excrement, then you use this on food crops, you will not infect yourself with any diseases that you did not have before\\"Regardless, a properly designed and maintained thermophilic compost pile, as per Jenkins' instructions, will reach temperatures in excess of 160 F (71 C) and this is proven to kill all known pathogens (disease causing organisms) in 24 hours. He recommends that the capped (i.e. no new additions) pile stands for at least a year before use, absolutely ensuring its safety.I simply do not understand how people can blithely trust commercial manure (from cows and chickens known to carry the most dangerous forms of fecal organisms) and yet are afraid of their own humanure?Yes ... at times the book is a little repetitive ... but perhaps like many teachers Joe knows that many people have to hear the facts several times before they truly listen and understand.We've been living on our homestead for just over a year now ... and our first \\"Joe Jenkins Method\\" humanure compost pile is capped and waiting for us to harvest its bounty next spring. Using his method ensures there are NO odors, NO flies, NO problem with marauding animals, and best of all ... NO WASTED WATER!THANK YOU JOE!"},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"This book improved our lives as soon as I finished it! Thank you Joe Jenkins! After living for four years with a well known brand of composting toilet, the sawdust toilet in this book has finally given us simple living. I read this book cover to cover the day I got it. My husband built it in one hour and we started using it. Simplicity at it's best! Everything in this book makes total sense.

I highly recommend it-it should be required reading to live in this country!"},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"Keep in mind that the author of this book composts his humanure with all of his other compost material. By properly placing the humanure material in the center of your larger compost pile you will eliminate any sort of pathogen disaster that A Microbiolgist warns of. Granted, his concerns are valid, but don't despair, composting humanure is easy and sawdust toilets are most excellent party favors."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"Jenkins book is very good from the standpoint of understanding what is possible. Whether or not you wish to be this up-front in the handling of human waste is another question. His most important contribution however, is his analytical approach to the composting process. He explodes some myths about mixing compost to make it work, and shows how to create good compost quickly. He readily admits that he repeats himself in the book. This is true. The essence of this 195 page book could have easily been done in 75 pages. A useful book, and one that will give you the courage to do your own composting, even if you don't compost human waste."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"One could be forgiven for thinking that this is just another \\"how-to\\" book, albeit a bit off the beaten path of woodworking manuals and the like. Not that &quot;The Humanure Handbook&quot; doesn't deliver practical information. On the contrary, the book empowers the reader to exploit a vital and overlooked resource, and to eliminate personal contribution to a chronic source of pollution, water and power waste in the bargain. (Trying doing *that* with a router.) The methods described are cheap and simple. And the author puts his money where his mouth is, espousing methods he has personally employed for over two decades, and backing this practical experience with impressive in-depth research.This much easily justifies the purchase price, but there's much more here than &quot;A Guide to Composting Human Manure&quot;.The Humanure Handbook dispels some fallacies of commonly accepted and widely repeated composting techniques. Even if you're already an avid composter (and I was) chances are Jenkins has some surprises for you (and he did).As social commentary, I can think of no other \\"how-to\\" book that tells such a compelling, frightening tale of blind assumption and culturally ingrained self-destructiveness. We see with startling clarity how the \\"civilized\\" world has combined ignorance, chemistry and technology to convert a needed resource into a nightmarish and wholly unnecessary problem. We are forced to confront the false assumptions each of us has unconsciously absorbed. And, by extension, we are forced to question how many other fundamentally bad ideas have become invisibly institutionalized in modern society.Unlike many preachy indictments of modern life, however, The Humanure Handbook provides answers rather than merely posing questions. The solutions can be applied on any scale, from personal to global, in virtually any climate and economic environment.If I have a quibble with the book, it is that key concepts are repeated extensively. I suspect some fierce editing could boil the book down by a fair chunk. To an extent, the repetition is by design; most of the book's chapters can be read in isolation, and it makes a superb reference volume. I suspect most readers who get through the introduction will end up reading it cover to cover, and a bit of repetition is a small price to pay for a message that is vital, practical, maddening, empowering, humorous, and inspiring.*Everyone* should read this book."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"I remember when I was 6 years old and first learned that manure = poop = fertilizer. I wondered why wild-animal poop was good for plants but people poop had to be flushed. It never made sense to me.When I first saw this book, I thought it was a joke and I didn't even crack the cover to see what it was about. However, recently I decided to take up organic gardening and I ran across the Humanure concept again. This time, it was clear that the book is not a joke. It is serious! But it is also tremendously exciting. Now, whenever someone says the word &quot;compost&quot; to me, grin and my eyes light up. I can't wait to build my own sawdust toilet and finally add my own poop to nature's cycle, the way I've wanted to since I was 6 years old!"},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"Joe Jenkins is a great guy with a great message to spread. He wakes up his readers to the possibilities of a greatly overlooked resource. Many people, like myself, probably have thought about the use of humane manure for garden fertilizer, but it seemed too crazy. Jenkins EMPOWERS us to take advantage of our byproducts, and shows us that there's nothing to fear! Humanmanure composting makes SO much sense. It provides needed fertilizer, reduces pollution, and reduces the need for huge, dirty sewage infrastructure. It's a shame that so many toilets continue to flush every day.I am currently doing grass-roots development work in rural Bolivia, and am hoping to implement humanure composting in the way Jenkins teaches it. This low-tech technology has SUCH tremendous potential in the developing world, where farmers ALWAYS need more fertilizer, and where there are often not even latrines, let alone sewage systems. Excrement usually just lies about, eaten by pigs and dogs, or leaking into water sources, thus continuing the viscous cycle of parasite diseases.Joe Jenkins has empowered me to do what makes sense by nature and recycle precious organic nutrients. Everyone should read this book and wake up to these fecal realities. I read his book over a year ago, and am still so excited that I'm considering doing humanure research for my PhD! Read away..."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"I like it when a book makes me take a big step back and question my place in the world. The Humanure Handbook uses a daily function (going to the bathroom) as the context for doing just this. Not only does it scrutize a deeply-entrenched and accepted modern appliance (the flush toilet), exposing it as a wasteful product of western laziness, but it gives the reader all the information needed to easily, affordably, and safely implement a better alternative.Probably the most important point made in The Humanure Handbook is the fact that we use the word 'waste' far too liberally and in the wrong way. In the phrase 'human waste' the word 'waste' should be a verb rather than a noun, because as a society we are going to tremendous expense to turn a valuable resource (human urine and feces) into something that is so hard to use that it is fit to be described as 'waste' (noun).Jenkins works hard to challenge and ultimately destroy the reader's irrational fear of feces and to turn that 'fecophobia' into an enlightened respect for the resource that it can be.The author cites numerous scientific studies that corraborate his extensive personal experience with composting *everything* that a family household generates. His summary of the scientific literature pertaining to the practise of composting humanure is thorough enough to convince me (a proud skeptic) that anybody could safely compost humanure after a careful reading of this book."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"A must read and great christmas book for those eco-minded friends.

This book has definitely boosted, not only my confidence on how to handle poop, but also my girlfriend is now on board! The parts of the outcome from reading the book we did not expect were when, during dinner conversations, our families would ask us \\"How will you deal with your sewage?\\" Interestingly enough, once you've read the book, your own concerns and fears of odor, and treatment of your waste disappears. The interesting part is that just about everyone else is still stuck in fecophobia world, that is of course until they visit your house and ask what kind of \\"air freshener\\" you use for your bathroom and compliment how good your coffee smells."},{"Title":"The Humanure Handbook: A Guide to Composting Human Manure, 2nd edition","review":"When I first saw this book on the shelf, I thought it was a joke.

It's a great book; informational, thought provoking and enjoyable to read. We lived off grid for about two years and used the methods outlined in the book. We used whatever the local sawmill had for sawdust (more like tiny chunks than 'dust') and mostly oak. If I recall, oak is not preferred for producing compost but our goal was primarily to dispose of our humanure in a safe and effective way. After about a year of filling one bin made from old pallets we switched to a second. Never at any time did the bins smell bad and three years later I pulled the bins apart and the result was a mildly spongy dirt-like matter that still had remnants of the sawdust. It smelled fine, mostly like dirt and oak.

However, I felt it important to share that this was not a book that I felt &quot;drawn in&quot; by. The language used made me wonder a bit about the author rather than it forming the personality of the characters, from the &quot;tall, shaven negro&quot; trying to sell Hash to Catherine to another black man who took hold of her hands and forced a gold chain in it. Later the statement, &quot;A woman came up to them. She attempted to slip round her discreetly, because obviously nothing good to be expected from someone with tatoos like those.&quot; Many of the statements sounded like judgements. I understand that this may have been the personalities and judgements of the characters but they were not people I would want to get to know. I couldn't relate to the thinking or the language used. The author then takes the reader into excruciating detail about this same character, Katherine and how and why she needed to change her pantyliner. This was the only true flow that I saw within the book. Let's just say I did not care for the writing or the characters. They did not seem like people that I knew or would want to know.

Digby Baltzell's first book has lost none of its relevance fifty-three years after it was published. This should be a must read for anyone interested in Philadelphia politics, power structures, the American class system, and sociology. Baltzell discusses in-depth the character of an upper class member from colonial times to the eve of World War II. He focuses his study on his hometown, Philadelphia. Once the American capital, the largest city in North America, and the financial capital of the United States, Philadelphia has lost most of its power. However, the traditions and institutions put in place during the colonial period are still held onto by the \\"old guard,\\" who frequent the Philadelphia and Rittenhouse Clubs, live on the Main Line, and worship at the fashionable Protestant churches. Instead of the \\"melting pot\\" ideology that so many second and third generation immigrants were raised believing, Baltzell clearly shows that the American power system from the 18th to the mid 20th century was held firmly by the white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant elite. Baltzell, who was listed in Philadelphia's Social Register and came from a wealthy family, believes that an upper class is necessary in American society. According to Philadelphia Gentlemen, the true goal of an upper class is to provide leadership and assume positions of power to guide the rest of the country. When an upper class way of life becomes an end in itself and stops absorbing the great men and women of different religious and racial backgrounds then the upper class has become a caste.Much has changed in American society since the book was published. We have our first African-American President, the Governor of Pennsylvania is Jewish, and there are three women and (for the first time in American history) no Protestants serving on the Supreme Court. Has the Old Establishment finally become extinct? One would think so. But Philadelphia has always been the land of the American gentry and a power structure instituted and supported since America's birth won't vanish over night. They may have lost their power but the Philadelphia Gentlemen lifestyle of horse racing, lunches of chicken salad and fried oysters, and games of sniff still continue on the Main Line estates and along the Brandywine River in Chadds Ford and Chateau Country. Meanwhile, the new elite has assumed the position of leadership once held by the WASPs and steer the country towards the future.Baltzell said in his afterword that a copy of Philadelphia Gentlemen was given to politicians and businessmen who came to Philadelphia from other cities in the nation so they could learn its social history and be better informed to make decisions based on the elite culture. Those interested in Philadelphia's social and political history would do well to pick up a copy too."},{"Title":"Miniature Chess Problems from Many Countries: 400 Compositions with Solutions and Comments","review":"If you find this book, buy it and keep it.

I am so glad to see another release. If you enjoy reading historical treatises or are just an art ecclectic, this book is for you. Covering major schools of thought regarding painting from the Southern and Northern renaissance to contemporary practises (of the 1850's), this book covers one overlooked component of sucessful painting- namely method.The steps necessary of how to consider building a painting are detailed. We all know of additive and subtractive color methods, but how about the most powerful? The dynamic method! Most colleges are telling students about &quot;glazes&quot;, which is a poor illustration and obvious that the the entire process is not well understood nor adequately experienced by the professor of &quot;glazes&quot;. This book blows away the semantic myth of direct painting as currently understood with the unrealized potential of lead white, veiling with white, &quot;hot&quot; underpaintings, typical pigment mixtures and a wealth of history.I found my first used copy almost 30 years ago and have found it to be the an indispensable tool for the artist who &quot;seeks further light&quot; from an original source without the meddling of art supply manufactures, convenience influenced art education, and those terrified of heavy metals. If you have the courage to look, read and the iniative to comprehend, the info is invaluable. Take notes as read, for the ideas are simple yet profound in their power and applications. This is not just &quot;a substitute token&quot;."},{"Title":"Methods and materials of painting of the great schools and masters","review":"This classic treatise on the painting methods of western art's great masters is an indispensible resource for the artist and connossieur.

Eastlake's readers were not ignorant hobbyists, but fellow scholars and masters of the art of oil painting. This volume is what it says it is -- a book of secrets. While you may be a master (not by the 20th century definition), you may not be privy to the secrets of Rembrandt, Da Vinci, Velazquez, etc. If only modern books explaining art materials and techniques would treat today's reader as one possessing a few &quot;secrets&quot; of his or her own, maybe western art would still be building on the legacy of the great schools and masters instead of trying to jump-start a nearly dead tradition. More than being a &quot;must-read&quot;, this book is a &quot;must-have.&quo"},{"Title":"Methods and materials of painting of the great schools and masters","review":"Eastlake traces the use of drying oils and resins from the early Greeks through the perfection of these substances for use as mediums by the brothers Van Eyck. He discusses preparation of materials, execution, and technical difficulties faced in the use of an oil vehicle. This work will make you rethink everything you know about oil painting. A must read for the serious painter."},{"Title":"Methods and materials of painting of the great schools and masters","review":"I was disheartened while reviewing the comments by others concerning Eastlake's work and felt personally obligated the \\"weigh in\\" with my own conclusion. Simply, C. Eastlake's book is by far the most valuable resource for any aspiring artist who believes in traditional technique.The concern about the antiquated language is well founded- indeed, the text was originally published post-mortem hundreds of years ago- but, this should not intimidate a student willing to invest in his/her future as a painter. The language, when deciphered (I saddest taking notes the FIRST time one reads the text), discloses a plethora of information which just cannot be found in any other text.I am an undergraduate student at a top-tier art school-> having discovered, purchased, and read the whole of the book as well as experienced some college courses I move that this book, for all of its dated quarks, is by far the best resource from which to learn not only the history behind oil paining but actual Old Master techniques- in an even more comprehensive way than such as Maroger, Doerner, Mayer, or any other more recent contemporary of the late Eastlake.I cannot express the imperativeness of this book to any painters library, if it does not become the painters library."},{"Title":"Methods and materials of painting of the great schools and masters","review":"My initial reaction on receiving this book was \\"Bloody hell is it big enough!?\\" At 1024 pages you're certainly getting a lot of information for your buck.Eastlake (1793-1865) was a former president of the British Royal Academy, director of the National Gallery, and in his day an major expert on painting techniques. Do note the book was first published in 1847, hence the writing style can be somewhat turbid. Perseverance pays with there being more information in here than you can shake a stick at.My comment about caution is based upon recent studies of old master paintings. The old masters would typically have a team of apprentices working alongside them, mixing paint, painting parts of the painting that the master was probably too bored to bother with (as well as good training for the apprentice) etc. The Master/Apprentice setup allowed for a continuous stream of knowledge being passed along the generations. However as oil paint technology advanced, in particular the ability to buy premixed paints off the shelf, the painter no longer needed a team of apprentices. He could pretty much get by on his own. Hence there was no longer anyone for the painter to pass on his knowledge to. This resulted in a considerable amount of technical knowledge being lost. (A good example is the recent theory promulgated by David Hockney that the old masters were able to paint such realistic paintings as they used rudimentary projection techniques to place a guide image on the canvas, overwhich they painted. No one knows if he is right or wrong).From the 1800's on, technical experts such as Eastlake and Max Doerner (\\"The Materials of the Artist\\") began to impart their wisdom on how the old master paintings were created. But the techniques thay had available were very rudimentary, more often than not being a case of the expert trying to reproduce a certain style and looking at the painting surface close up. The experts proferred their theories and techniques, often with much aplomb leaving no room for doubt. Unfortunately they were often quite off the mark - they could emulate a style somewhat but never 100%. There are too many variables involved even for a discerning eye. It has only been with recent advances in scientific analysis, chemical and visual, that a truer understanding of the old master technique is finally being determined. Van Wettering's excellent \\"Rembrandt - the painter at work\\" book details the findings of extensive research carried out on a number of paintings considered to have been painted by Rembrandt. The book is 340 pages, and they still haven't got all the answers. But what they have done is to throw in to doubt the theories and techniques of the 19th/20th C experts.There is a welter of information in this book, but if you are trying to perfectly replicate a certain old master painterly technique, and failing to do so, then be warned the experts might not be such experts afterall.All said and done, I do recommend this book for the wealth of information it contains. Numerous recipes for mediums, varnishes etc. along with many techniques that it lends itself to study in its own right. Dover books have once again provided an excellent product at an excellent price."},{"Title":"Methods and materials of painting of the great schools and masters","review":"I am working on my MFA in art. While I am not a strict conservative in the tradition of painting, I am very serious about my training in the techniques of the old masters. Many new books have been published that claim to give you the substance needed, but most of these books show you what you can do, not how you can do it. We are in a period of time in art education where the late modernist and early postmodernist curriculum is strongly emphasized. It is a rare opportunity to find a teacher that has the information this book contains. A true painter ought to know where his materials come from and how they are made. This book gives direct translations from the old masters on how to create pigments and vehicles for oil painting. Like the fact that masters would save the bones from dinner and them char them to create lamp black. This book also gives techniques for purifying raw linseed oil. Little facts like these have been a mystery to me for so long because few teachers know this information.This is actually a two volume book compiled into one. The first volume deals primarily with recipes of the masters and correlating schools of their time. The second volume deals with techniques such as sfumato(Da Vinci) chiaroscuro(Caravaggio) and other important concepts in painting.If you learn more about the materials you work with, you will be a better artist, no matter what type of art you do.

There is almost no personal opinion here; everything is sourced from historical documents or through some clever observations. This early 19C book is of interest to people who are interested in art and the history of art techniques such as how paint was made at a certain period, what varnishes were used, etc. As a painter like myself trying to learn the tricks of great masters, there are however a certain small amount of gem info that you wouldn't be able to get from Art courses today (that is, if you are able to prod along)"},{"Title":"Methods and materials of painting of the great schools and masters","review":"You have to be pretty lazy not to learn a wealth of technique & knowledge from this book.

But apart from that I can't really see the point of it being marketed to modern day artists. Written in 1847 with language to match, it just simply describes what most realist artists can usually figure out for themselves by looking at the pictures. And come to much clearer conclusions. Something that your average artist without a generous income and the time to travel round europe during that time period probably couldn't do. Hence the reason I imagine, this book was written.As a teaching aid for your modern day realist artist, in my opinion forget it.

Tragically, he emerged from the Boer War safely, but was executed for his role in the 1916 Easter Uprising and his body dumped in a mass grave with several of his patriotic comrades. His sacrifices certainly helped lay the foundation for Ireland's freedom.This book focuses mainly on MacBride's service in the Boer War, the politics and passions of the Irish involvement, and his relationship with the flamboyant Maud Gonne, who bore his two children. MacBride is not a perfect hero, which makes him (and this book)all the more engaging.Dr. McCracken's book is well-wrought history, finely detailed and comprehensively researched. It is also a darn good story, well told. He's a devoted scholar and historian, and a fine writer.

In spite of the lack of new capital, at first everyone is happy with the marriage as Moira adds a dimension of happiness into their lives. However, over the years as the family fiscal crisis worsens and Moira seems to be in a constant state of pregnancy, Hector blames everyone, including the &quot;deceitful&quot; Moira, for his troubles. How will the lack of nurturing from the angry, cold Hector impact everyone else in the family, especially as they reach out for love?THE DESERT CROP is the last novel from the great Catherine Cookson, who passed away last year. However, the story is a tribute to the talent of one of the hall of famers of romance writing. The story line is vintage Cookson, taking place in her usual time and universe, and involving individuals and a family struggling to cope with pending disaster. The characters are somewhat simplistic, but perhaps that is where the charm of Ms. Cookson lies as their motives are easy to understand. Fans of the deceased superstar have a gold medal final novel of love redeemed.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Desert Crop","review":"Cookson has been writing historical fiction for over forty years and I have been reading it for close to thirty. After her death in 1998 her estate released this last book. As always she gives us strong characters with loving ways, drama, death, murder, class struggles, and even a bit of lust and loving along the way.Set in Northeast England we are entertained by the comings and goings of the Stewart family. Patti the rebellious daughter, and Daniel the subservient son, manipulated by a father Hector Stewart who is evil and pathetic. After their mother's death, Hector finds he hasn't the money to run the farm, so is forced to marry an Irish woman with the promise of an inheritance.I love how Cookson is able to take the reader into her world and make you want to return to it.

He explains in great detail the intricate craftsmanship that went into these lovely machines (and some of their associated pains as well). But as any vintage Ducatisti knows, you need to acquire good parts and excellent resources while they're still around. If you're thinking of working on vintage singles (for the first time or for the n-th time), then this would be an excellent book to have. Why wait to pick up an excellent resource such as this?

So it gets into the ugly details of where the designers went right, and where they went wrong, and offers helpful advice for fixes, straddles of the original design as well as how to keep the original design running (more or less). Needing pointers on the finer details of the restoration work is where this book works best. It is not exactly a restoration manual, but instead is chock full of helpful hints and ways to make yourself stop and think about what you are really trying to accomplish, and provides an excellent set of examples in order to get there; whether it's a cafe racer, a Sunday track bike, or a show bike.

I grew to care about each character, to dislike some, and feel a genuin sense of loss when one was killed.

Merging the bond trader and high-tech startup entrepreneur together and layering that on top of a mystery was too blatant a play at a info-novel for me. And it was too predictable. Finally, there were some quirky things about the story. No marital relationship of the story's characters past or present either worked-out or was working out.

There have been few truly integrated financial mystery novels. (A couple others are &quot;The Takeover&quot; and &quot;Nest of Vipers.&quot;) Due to what I considered an exceptional first novel, I was slightly disappointed by &quot;Trading Reality.&quot; Ridpath's latest novel is more cyber-techno than financial; too bad when you consider Ridpath's background in the financial markets. Although he starts the novel in a bond trading room in London, it quickly moves into different territory, that of computer generated virtual reality. That said, this is a pretty good novel, with a fairly intricate and convoluted plot, including a few red herrings, a couple of nasty characters, and a predictable, yet satisfying, ending. I would have preferred if the protagonist developed a more creative financial bailout. Even so, the ending was reminiscent of the classical English sleuth gathering all of the principal characters into one room, making them squirm, and finally announcing the murderer. Frankly, this would probably make a great movie script. It could easily be placed in the USA. Throughout the book, I found myself substituting American locations (Wall Street for London; the coast of Maine for Scotland; Harvard for Oxford), and it still played well.

That is no bad thing - many of the contributing writers and some illustrators were still around and able to contribute their own personal accounts. Where it loses a star is, like the pulp magazine itself, in the poor quality of the printing. It reproduces many of the individual covers inside, but they are very small - 3 covers easily fit across the bottom of a page - and in black and white. That is entirely understandable, colour printing is expensive, but the dpi resolution is so very low - the result is that when reading about a particular cover design, it's impossible to see more than a blurry approximation of the general layout. The only place there is colour, at a reasonable resolution, is on the cover. They really should have made the most of that, but the back cover is a blank glossy black, and if you look on the front, you'll see one cover (described in the text as one of the poorer efforts) reproduced twice in the lower right. There are reasonable images of most of these covers on the web if you google, so I am seriously considering printing them out, and pasting them over the murky versions in the book. Reproductions of Interior illustrations fare much better, since they were always black and white, and had to cope with being printed on pulp paper.An updated and improved edition would be very much appreciated. If it's still possible, I'd like to see every cover of every issue, small but in colour. The reputation of some of the writers, especially H P Lovecraft, has grown even further since 1977 and there is no doubt more that can be said. but in the meantime, this is all there is, and worth buying."},{"Title":"The Weird tales story","review":"This book turned out to be even more fun that I had anticipated.

This book allows you to snuggle with your little one and appreciate what God has given you while enjoying the beautiful pictures and wisdom of Authors Jim and Elizabeth George."},{"Title":"God's Wisdom for Little Boys: Character-Building Fun from Proverbs","review":"My son is not even two yet and this is one of his favorites. I have read several \\"Proverbs\\" to him from the book every night for the past 6 months or so and now he asks for the book before nap time too! If I forget to read it to him before bed, he reminds me by saying \\"boys.\\" The pictures are fabulous and because the proverbs are made into poems, it's appropriate for even very young little boys. I am thinking of buying a copy to take apart and frame some of the pictures (& poems) for his bedroom. If you're looking for a book that teaches great character, you've found it!"},{"Title":"God's Wisdom for Little Boys: Character-Building Fun from Proverbs","review":"This book has lovely illustrations for adults and children. Each page there is a Christian statement or affirmation. No matter what one's faith is I think all of the virtues that are given are universal. I purchased this book when my son was in kindergarten and having a difficult time in Catholic school (we're Lutheran). Because this is crosses faith he was able to apply some of the messages to his daily life at school and at home. At school, when he was asked if he was lying he said, \\"God's little boy is truthful.\\" This is a statement from the book.The statements are a mixture of sweet and solid attributes anyone should have.What's even better is that it has scriptural citations under each affirmation. What's even better than that is that it is specifically geared toward boys. That's a rare thing in the modern world. I want my son to grow up to be a good man. This precious little book has given him statements that he has committed to heart since he was five. He's now seven and still repeats the statements and wants to read the book. Now he can read it to me, (save the occasional Biblical verse).It's been extremely beneficial and a blessing. Frankly it's been better than any child psychology application that has been recommended in books or by others. It's had much more of an impact.Thank you so much Mr. and Mrs. George!"},{"Title":"God's Wisdom for Little Boys: Character-Building Fun from Proverbs","review":"The illustrations in this book are so real and so detailed and so adorable (like two boys sitting on a porch together with their baseball gloves still lying down and the dog waiting nearby, and their popcorn and sodas strewn nearby). Such great artwork all throughout! Each page has a rhyme to teach a character trait (being friendly, kind, giving, cheerful, thrifty, self-controlled, etc). The book isn't that short, they give you your money's worth. But each page is short enough to keep a young child's attention. We enjoy discussing each picture as well as each character trait after reading each page, such a great learning experience! This book is a classic!"},{"Title":"God's Wisdom for Little Boys: Character-Building Fun from Proverbs","review":"This book is beautifully illustrated and the rhymes stay in your head long after you have read them.

The illustrations are beautifully rendered in soft watercolors and has that old time look of little boys in days gone by. The values reinforced here (whether you are Christian or not) are what we all desire for our little men to learn so that they will grow up to be men of character.

I read a few pages of this book every Bible class to the toddlers and they are really fascinated by it.

Wish the illustrations had a little less American flag themed images. Not everyone who reads or buys the book is from the United States.

Just wish the illustrations could be as universal as the words from Proverbs."},{"Title":"God's Wisdom for Little Boys: Character-Building Fun from Proverbs","review":"This book is a real find. The illustrations are so boyish yet sweet. The print, at 4 lines and rhyming, will keep their attention. With 3 boys, we can relate to it and will enjoy it for years to come.

My little son and I enjoy both the exquisite illustrations and the words which inspire us to reach to new heights. Elizabeth George is one of my favorite authors. I read her devotional series, as well as her other books, over and over. Nonetheless, I was rather surprised to find that her children's books live up to her other work. My son and I enjoy looking for the gentle puppy and frog in each picture. We aspire to live according to the truths of Proverbs as found in this gem."},{"Title":"God's Wisdom for Little Boys: Character-Building Fun from Proverbs","review":"This was given as a gift to son on his first birthday. He's almost two now and has invariably brought this book to me when to read. He has many books (secular and spiritual) but this one is THE book for him.The authors pick out a character trait that they see is very godly and good, and then they make a rhyme out of it. They then find a verse to support this (or maybe they did this the other way 'round?). Each page has a different trait.The illustrations are wonderful - capturing many things you see boys doing and quite possibly encourges little boys to be like-minded. The pictures have a lot of detail, unlike many modern children's books where the artists often settle for simplified drawings with little or no interesting ambience. I really appreciate that they keep a more traditional method of book-writing for children.The rhymes are very cute and the idea of encouraging character in children, right from the beginning, may have far-reaching effects! I hope this is so.Also, my son likes to help and he beams ear to ear when I say, \\"Thank you, Isaac, you're beeing Helpful - God's little boy is helpful! (Just like one scene in the book)\\"I would change two things - for my preferences, however, and those are:1. I would have quoted from the KJV - the version that the authors use is very watered down and when I compared it with KJV, NIV, or even NASB, the meaning almost changes completely. The ideas are cute, but sometimes is is almost unbiblical.2. I would have liked to see various little boys of different ethnicicites being \\"God's little boy\\". I can imagine some darker-skinned and dark-haired children possibly not being able to identify with this boy. Then again, I was not a little boy, etiher. But you often hear about adults saying that they wondered, \\"Where's me?\\" in the literature.I think the illustrator would not have lost anything by making each picture with a different little boy or alternatively, used a little boy with medium-brown skin and brown hair.I give this book a four-star rating because of the lack of these two elements, otherwise it would be a five-star.Thus:Content: FIVEIllustration quality: FIVERelevenace: FOURBiblical accuracy: Three to four."},{"Title":"God's Wisdom for Little Boys: Character-Building Fun from Proverbs","review":"Although these are \\"character-building truths\\" taken from Proverbs, this book is great guidance for any little boy anywhere, no matter what religion or lack of. The book is so beautifully done with lovely illustrations, it will appeal to all children and their parents. It isn't preachy at all, but tells each virtue in just four short lines with a proverb to match. My 6-year old grandson was immediately attracted to the book, and read portions of it to me. Another nice thing is that 14 new words to a child are given with their meanings at the back of the book for easy understanding. I highly recommend this book as a gift for your child, grandchild, or your friends with young sons."},{"Title":"God's Wisdom for Little Boys: Character-Building Fun from Proverbs","review":"My son and I LOVE to read this book together. We have read it since he was two (he is now 4 and I think we will read it for a LONG time). What a great way to encourage godly character traits in your child. The scripture that goes along each page is great too. I actually made an encouragement chart that is based on the characteristics listed in the book. When he displays responsibility, courage, generosity...he gets a star. When he gets to 5 stars he gets a special time with mom or he can do a craft. He loves it and it helps me to remember to encourage him."},{"Title":"God's Wisdom for Little Boys: Character-Building Fun from Proverbs","review":"This book is quite fun with all of it's vivid pictures.

Despite the title, this book was originally written in regard to changing the behavior of people not dogs. So, if you want to learn how to train your spouse, children, roommate, coworker, or others, read this book! This book listed is good if you really want to dig into the details of how/why certain methods work. If you really just want a well-behaved dog and don't care so much about the how and why, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Screw not shooting your dog, this helped me not shoot my cat!!I have a VERY vocal, very sociable cat who we got from the shelter a little overweight. Of course, a diet was necessary, but to a cat who had clearly been free-fed food before, this was a tragedy! She would beg, whine, plead, and outright DEMAND food (at the top of her lungs) whenever she thought I should be giving it to her, especially whenever I'm in the kitchen. Hardly fun at 5 am when I'm trying to leave for work! I was resorting to penning her in the bathroom while I prepared food in the mornings and evenings. I couldn't stand it anymore! Water bottle when she meows? NOT effective! I was getting more and more frustrated, and resorting to more and more desperate negative reinforcement. It was terrible for everyone involved.Within 30 minutes of clicker work (note: we had done some work on nose targeting before), she was calmly sitting at the threshold of the kitchen next to her bowl, waiting for her next bite of dinner while I was making spaghetti. It was a revelation! It totally changed my outlook on our relationship. All those naughty behaviors? I can FIX them, and without resorting to punishment or negative reinforcement! Yes, you CAN train a cat!People looking for a \\"quick how-to\\" may be disappointed by this book. This is a fantastic insight into training behavior, and not just for animals. Frankly, I think if you're looking for a quick fix, you're going to be disappointed in what you GET out of your relationship with your pet anyways. If you want to truly understand how to not only be a better trainer, but to have a better relationship with your pet, this is the book for you.I look forward so much to applying these techniques with all my future pets."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Great read for those training their pets wanting to follow the positive training method (vs corrective/abusive). A lot of good insight but just note this is not a step by step manual (highly recommend The Power of Positive Training for that)."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Don't Shoot the Dog! The New Art of Teaching and Training is much more than a training book for pets or animals. It is a book that will teach you how to change your own behavior, your children's behavior, your pets behavior, or even a sea lion's behavior.This book came highly recommended to me, or I probably would never have picked it up. The title certainly makes it look like just a dog training book, and most of the examples do relate to animals. However, this quick read is also a goldmine of the two best kinds of information: valuable and practical.The purpose of this book is to convince you that positive reinforcement is the best way to shape behavior. Chapter 2 lays out 10 Rules for Shaping. \\"Shaping consists of taking a very small tendency in the right direction and shifting it, one small step at a time, toward an ultimate goal.\\" (35) These rules can help you do a variety of things for yourself and others. The personal examples that the author lists through her experiences training marine animals and teaching students hold your attention and are varied enough to appeal to everyone.Chapter 4 lists the eight methods that you can use to change behavior (the first is Shoot The Dog). These methods are comprehensive and will help you think about how you react to everyone around you. Each of the eight methods include a chart detailing various problems and how to use each method to change them. The problems that are tackled include a dirty roommate, noisy kids on a car ride, lazy employees, a faulty tennis swing, a spouse's bad mood, an ornery cat, and adult children that aren't self-sufficient. Intensely practical problems . . . this chapter will change the way you think about raising your kids. Just being able to visually compare punishment with seven other methods of behavioral change is eye-opening. These eight methods were the highlight of the book for me and helped to shed light on how my reactions were reinforcing negative behavior in others. They are:Shoot the animalPunishmentNegative ReinforcementExtinctionTrain an incompatible behaviorPut the behavior on cueShape the absenceChange the motivationThe last two chapters detail more real world environments and how these lessons can be applied. The author also answers the objections raised by some that training is a form of brainwashing. She clearly lays out the facts in these chapters and shows that we are always training someone to do something. This book just helps us to be aware of how we are affecting others around us and what to do about it.This book is highly recommended. It is one that I will refer back to repeatedly in the future."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I am a complete fool for dogs! Our home has seldom been without at least one since I was able to walk and generally I prefer them over most people. I, like many other well meaning canine lovers thought that the right way to properly train was with the chain and punishment method. Sure, it looks good.....but I never realized there was a better way until I read this book and now I am hooked!

I rescue dogs, and they often come to me damaged and hard to handle. This book helped me learn to look for cues when I'm training -- to see when the dog is getting something, and when it's time to to back up in my training. To know when to take a break and play for a bit, so the dog feels less stressed. It even helped me train my husband! Every dog owner should read this. Training is about timing, patience, and reinforcement. It's not about fear and pain.(I can't believe what still goes on out there in dog training. Just two years ago I took a traumatized, rescued puppy to a highly recommended class given by a training club. The \\"instructor\\" jerked a sweet and happy puppy -- choke-chained -- clear across the training ring. When the dog screamed (his throat and neck possibly permanently damaged), the trainer told the dog's owner \\"He can't feel that!\\". I can't help but hope that there is a hell for people like that.)"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"&quot;Don't Shoot the Dog&quot; is a gem of a book.

It is a very honest comparison, and readers can decide for themselves which methods are reliable.in this book, you will learn the general CONCEPT of how to use reinforcement methods to better improve trianing methods. however, you will not learn directly, how to make a dog run circles, 'drop dead', fetch the slippers etc.the excellence of this book is that this concept's use is not limited to just dogs. horses, birds and fishes (as claimed by the author) and humans (family, yourself, trainee) can be trained using these methods.i am glad i read this, now, time to motivate myself to quit smoking!"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Karen Pryor not only knows how to train animals, she gets you started on the road to sanity if you have pets or even children.

What is even more disturbing is how she proudly states the fact in her book, with as much emotion as if she was only discarding a failed experiment. She had her cat killed in the most cowardly and the cruelest fashion. \\"Euthanasia\\" is a term you use when you're killing an animal to put it out of it's physical suffering. You never \\"euthanize\\" a healthy animal, you're simply killing it because you're just fed up with it. Even sicker than Karen Pryor are her fans who applaud her \\"all-positive and non-aversive\\" training methods while turning a blind eye to what she did with her cat. She's just a crafty businesswoman who managed to convince a lot of people that a relationship with a dog or a cat is all about a stupid little clicker toy and a bag of treats and translate it all into a multimillion dollar industry.

This book has very few insights about dogs (indeed, her advice is sometimes dangerously misleading because she doesn't pay attention to the way dogs are hard-wired to behave). And the advice she gives about modifying human behavior are often unintentionally hilarious. (For instance, she recounts that in order to give herself incentive to get out of bed for an early class, she would feed herself small squares of chocolate.) There is much more to the mental life of dogs than this book would suggest.

It cannot do anything - ANYTHING - other than that. Behaviorism is lifeless and stifling, and causes just as many problems as it \\"solves.\\" Pryor, a Skinner disciple, agrees with his philosophy that we have nothing to do with our actions. She states that our own creativity is actually a factor of reinforcement by others or the environment. That's not really creativity, if you think about it. This book disgusted me, especially when Pryor started her lifeless rampage that we are \\"evolved social animals,\\" which may explain why she equates human behavior with animal behavior.

I had already mastered &quot;sit&quot;, &quot;go pee&quot;, &quot;come&quot;, &quot;get in the back&quot;, and &quot;excuse me&quot; with my dogs but was interested in training concepts in general that I could use with my ferret and sugar gliders (and any other critter I might add to my household).I will admit that I have not managed to use many of Karen's lessons with my sugar gliders.

What's up with that???????"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I read the original book some years ago when I'd just started competitive obedience training with my dog. I thought it was about dog training. I've just finished the revised edition.The truth is it's about changing and shaping behaviour. Whether it be people; partners, children, students, yourself, or animals; dogs, cats, elephants, fish, dolphins, you name it, you can use the principles and techniques in this book to improve relationships and behaviours as well as to train specific skills.Karen Pryor's work is based on the work of BF Skinner who was a Harvard Professor and largely credited as being the father of behavioural psychology. Pryor's book, however is not some dry theoretical textbook. It's lively, entertaining and with many and diverse examples to inspire you to try out these techniques. It pushes the boundaries of behavioural conditioning (anchoring in NLP terminology) and what you can do with it and applies it to just about any context you can think of; from the way international governments relate to each other, to getting your teenager to keep his room tidy, to teaching a seal to talk! (Yes, really)A philosophyPryor explains the philosophy behind the techniques and answers any questions you might have about \`why' positive reinforcement works better than punishment in the majority of situations. While it isn't a step-by-step manual, I gleaned enough to teach my parrot, Shaggy to go to a box, pick up a stick, run through a tube with it and then deliver it to my hand. You can see a video of him doing this here [...]as well as a couple of videos of my puppy, Ragz who is also being taught with these methods.Pryor has created tables for the eight methods that can be used to get rid of a bunch of undesirable behaviours and explains the pros and cons of each one.It might be tempting, reading this review to think that the book is about manipulating people or animals. People attempt to manipulate others' behaviour anyway, often unsuccessfully by yelling, punishing, negative reinforcement or ignoring the behaviour (and seething inside!) The information in this book provides you with methodologies that make sense and that you can use immediately to achieve rapid results.I highly recommend you read it, put the principles and methodologies to use and notice how quickly the relationships improve with the people and pets you have in your life."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I've been a professional dog trainer and instructor for 30 years. Pryor does an excellent job setting forth the research and reasoning behind reinforcement training and behavior shaping; she's articulate and clear and fun to read.My issue is with the clicker gadget itself. ***If a handler has developed the eye and timing that enables him/her to implement these techniques successfully, an appropriately chosen verbal cue meets the need quite effectively.*** There is no need for the clicker gadget. It's just another bit of litter cluttering up the handler's hands. In my training hall experience, novice handlers too often conclude that clicker training is an 'easy gimmick' method for dog training. They screw around confusing the dog and losing his attention all together by using the clicker inappropriately, while failing to acquire the basic leash-handling and body language techniques that would have better served them."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Karen Pryor explains why punishment so often fails and why positive reinforcementdoes(on people as well as dogs).

I recommend this book highly to anyone who is seeking positive change. In fact, I am going to order five additional copies right now for friends and co-workers."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I've read quite a few dog behavior, training and intelligence books and always had this on the to read list because of its reputation of being the \\"bible\\" of dog training. But I didn't really want to read it because of the title, and hey, the cover isn't too imaginitive either. I know don't judge a book by a cover, but to be honest, reading has a sensual side too -- good clean lines, fits nice in the hands, smooth paper. You bookaholics know what I'm saying.So, I finally got around to reading this and I can see why people say this book is life-changing. Pryor spent very little time talking about dogs specifically but showed many examples on how these methods could be used with people with disabilities, your own kids, spouse, cat etc.I'm a trainer's assistant at a dog obedience school, and as I read this, it all looked familiar. It is basically the foundation philosophy of our school. It's a method of communication. A way to build a relationship and communicate what you want from your dog in a positive, punishment-free manner. Reading this book helped me clarify why we at the school do things as we do. And as I finished the book, I was thinking of one of the comments a woman made at a trainer's funeral. The gist was that she had learned from his gentle approach to the dogs, and this had spread to the way she approached people as well.It's true. \\"Clicker training\\" as some people call this training philosophy will spill outside of your doggy life and into other areas... if you come to this as a dog trainer. As a dog trainer, your dog doesn't sit when you say sit. Instead of getting mad and saying sit sit sit! jerking on the collar or pushing on the butt, first you think \\"does my dog understand 'sit?'\\" Then you'd break it down into it's components -- sit is an action (head goes up, butt goes down) and responding to the command requires that 1. the dog knows the action 2. the dog knows the word is connected to the action. Then you'd find a way to get your dog past whatever is hanging him up. So, if this is your habitual style of response to other's \\"mistakes,\\" you will start to develop patience, compassion and clear communication. And those skills will take you far in life.And extra bonus -- besides learning training methods, you'll read alot of funny anecdotes about frisbee-playing elephants and bell-ringing hermit crabs too."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"All of the reader reviews currently on the page deal with the first edition. I just received the new edition.First, for those who are looking for a cook book to solve specific problems, this may not be it -- as a response to people who felt mislead by the title.This ISN'T a dog training book, what it is, is a manual and a philosophy for solving the problems in your life caused by other's behavior, whether it is your husband, your children, your pets, or your co-workers.The new edition brings in our new research and our ideas. Anecodotes are more relative and talk about people we all know and have met through the click-l list and other internet interactions.This is definately the definitive book on behavior modification, and it is infinitely readable.&lt;CLICK&gt; Good job Karen!"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I recently bought this book on the advice of a doggy foster &quot;parent&quot;, as a prelude to adopting from a local rescue organization. While this is not a how-to or step by step guide for training your dog, it is an excellent and clear book about behavior and how to shape it in a positive way. I was surprised at how much information I found useful for understanding my own relationship with my parents and how to be a better manager. The anecdotes help clarify the concepts, as well as making for very entertaining reading, and I especially appreciated the series of charts comparing different training methods and showing what can work best for a slew of different behavior problems. My next purchase will be a clicker training instruction manual, and I think it will be all the more valuable because Pryor's book has helped me understand WHY positive reinforcement works. Her book really explains the philosophy behind the methodology. Kudos."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"This is my favorite training book (and isn't just about dog training- it's aboutoperant conditioning for the average Joe). It humorously and thoroughly explainshow to influence and shape behavior using well-timed reinforcement. This book willbe especially helpful to people trying to train animals to do unusual behaviors (suchas disabled people who are self-training their own assistance dog). When you'redone reading this, you'll understand how to break literally any behavior down intosmall manageable pieces that you can train for. But don't assume it's just for animaltrainers. I know an excellent manager who read this book when he was first promoted tomanagement.It's a quick-read, it's fun, and the info is very valuable. Certainly a&quot;must read&quot;."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"&quot;Don't Shoot the Dog&quot; is the best comprehensive guide I know of that encourages the use of Positive Reinforcement. There is no question that PR goes a long way and should always be used as a first option (with both animals and people). Karen Pryor's honesty in this book is to be applauded. While she champions using PR as far as it works to produce the desired result, she realistically acknowledges that PR does not always work. As a dog trainer and author using a balanced approach, I find her candor and her desire to make the world a better place for dogs and people quite noble. If all we needed in our relationships with dogs and people was to find the right reward, this would be the only book we would need.The structure of the book is easy to follow, and along with emphasizing PR, also gives excellent advice about the crucial element of timing in training. I also find this book useful as a tool to help people decide NOT to use muzzle restraining devices. If a dog training student of mine is thinking of using a muzzle restraining device on a dog, I have the student read Karen's comments about restraint as the bottom of page 101. Her clearly stated explanation hits the nail right on the head. Restraining has its place, but it isn't training.Karen's comments about rewarding the wrong behavior also makes a lot of sense. Our leaders in government would benefit from her political applications of her principles."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Believe me when I tell you that those that criticized this book never read it and integrated its principles. Instead, these are people that might have vast experience with different systems that give them good results. The techniques they use have become second nature to them. They conclude: my system is different, my system works, therefore every thing else is crap. One reviewer rambled about how it mainly applies to dolphins because they are confined to a tank. The kindest thing I can say about him is that he never read DON'T SHOOT THE DOG. If he did, I would have to insult his reading comprehension. Little of what he rants about is even in the book. Instead of ranting about hearsay on the somewhat different topic of clicker training, allow me to tell you about \\"Don't Shoot the Dog\\". This book teaches far reaching techniques with universal application. I have trained dogs, horses, and wild caught birds of prey (which were flown free daily not confined to pools or tanks). Though I understand alpha dog training, use negative reinforcement, and have employed many successful techniques, this is one of my all time top 10 books on any subject and it is a MUST READ even for those that will never own a pet. Karen Pryor was in fact a trainer at Sea World but contrary to the title this book is not about the specifics of animal training. It is instead a handbook on behavioral modification complete with an introduction written by B.F. Skinner, the father of behavioral psychology. While he was not a man without faults, he was a huge contributor to some profoundly simplified techniques for modifying behavior. While an easy read (one long afternoon) the power of this book lies in studying the principles and then training yourself to modify behavior. In an entraining and practical manner Karen explains a principle, explains its applications and LIMITATIONS and then gives a scenario that illustrates how to apply this principle with an animal, an adult, and a child. A lay person soon learns that most instinctive responses to unwanted behavior are non productive. We have many roles in life and it is a rare person in which some of these roles don't require us to influence behavior. While people are not animals, behavior modification is behavior modification and we all use it. Unfortunately, more often than not we make critical mistakes that result in the opposite result we want and expect. I read this book 10 years ago. As soon as I did I wished I had read it about 25 years sooner. It brought greater success to training at opposite ends of the animal kingdom. It worked on free flying wild birds of prey that are not social creatures and interpret any negative reinforcement as a death threat. These wild animals can easily leave the trainer and return to the wild to fend for themselves. They get this chance every day. In fact it is nothing but unnatural that they will return from being a tiny speck in the sky just from operant conditioning and positive reinforcement. More amazing, they can be properly trained to do this within 10 days of being trapped from the wild, so much for the hilarious comment about it won't work on things that can run loose like dogs. Speaking of dogs, I have used it on Setters and Springer's not to mention a very strong willed, male Jack Russell Terrier, with a well developed alpha dog mentality. Karen never implies that negative reinforcement is not a legitimate tool. She simply fine tunes its use, timing, and consistency to give you an even more powerful tool. The principles in this book have greatly enhanced what was decades of successful training. Finally, don't under estimate these principles when it comes to inter- personal relationships. If you do, you missed a great part of what makes this a must read."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"As a social worker specializing in child abuse and neglect, I have relied on Don't Shoot the Dog for years to teach harsh and punitive parents benign and positive behavioral alternatives. Parents learn more readily, and even enjoy learning, from the anecdotes about animal behavior, and don't feel criticized themselves because they have not had prior bad or abusive experiences with a chicken or a cat. They begin to see that all small creatures do some annoying things, and that their child is not singularly persecuting them. They feel less victimized by their child and suddenly become empowered to bring about change. The revised edition is especially welcome because of its expanded discussion of punishment, primarily why it doesn't work and what would be safer, kinder and more effective in its place, and for the information about clicker training, an enormous aid to angry or ineffective parents. Don't Shoot the Dog! is a must for all social workers, and for anyone interested in more enjoyable and productive dealings with other living creatures."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"&quot;Don't Shoot the Dog&quot; is only marginally about dog training, (although the dog was reccomened to me by noted dog trainer Sarah Wilson, a fine dog training book author in her own right). What it is about is using postive reinforcement for all training purposes. Postive reinforcement does not mean NEVER correcting the subject, but doing so in a postive way, mostly by rewarding correct behavior. Ms. Pryor shows, by using certain common situations, (kids making too much noise in the car on long trips, dog barking in the back yard all night, etc) how different methods would work or not work, and further adds other examples, with animals that are not usually thought of as &quot;trainable&quot;, how certain behaviors were be easily taught. The author is a big advocate of &quot;clicker training&quot; (as is Sarah Wilson, who I mentioned earlier) but even after reading the book, I really don't understand the &quot;why and how it works&quot; aspect of it, which is why only 4 stars, her explantion just doesn't seem clear enough for someone who is new to the concept. (If half star ratings were allowed, this book would have 4 and a half, since I consider this a minor flaw...) This is a wonderful book which should be on the bookshelf of everyone who does animal training, or for that matter, parents as well..."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"What I found so valuable about this book was that it didn't spend endless pages discussing fashionable theories about the harm of being spanked in public, or how to get in touch with your little inner brat. It's a straightforward plan on how to help people do what they want to do. It's not a charade. It's not tricking people. It's giving feedback about what are better and worse behaviors.I wish the book wasn't so closely associated with animal training because most of its discussion concerns human relationships. It seems like most people who know about this book are animal people. In my case, I obtained a rottweiler who wouldn't let anyone touch him. Instead of trying to *force* him to let me touch him, or *try* to touch him and back away when he recoiled (thereby rewarding the bad behavior), I used Pryor's clicker training. The closer he came to me, the more I clicked. If he brushed by me, I clicked. In one day he was diving into my chest, twisting his head into my chest, and looking for the click. And leading up to this, as he was preoccupied with touching me, he lost any concern that I was touching him.There's *no* other training method that builds the kind of secure enviornment where things move only as fast as the trainee wants it to, that rewards exploration and where nothing's really the &quot;wrong answer,&quot; and everything is learning.This should be required reading in school."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"it is about behavior modification and not dog training per se.Don't Shoot the Dog! is the best fundamental description of behaviorism I have ever read. My husband and I have used its principles in training our extremely submissive and abused by a former owner Jack Russell terrier to develop some mental health. This is not a cookbook, it is a philosophy. Pryor does not endorse pure behaviorism; in her work with dolphins described in Lads Before the Wind, she writes extensively about her philosophy falling between that of Konrad Lorenz, the ethologist, and B.F. Skinner. There are hard wired behavior traits present in all species and using operant conditioning via a method like clicker training actually uses those traits to the trainer's advantage, never forgetting that there are some instincts that are so hard wired that they are impossible to overcome. This training is not necessarily an easy to do BECAUSE IT REQUIRES REAL INSIGHT, PATIENCE AND SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF THE TRAINER!

If you want to train dolphins, whales, birds, or even chickens, this book is for you. But, if you want to teach a dog to come, sit, lie down or stay, there has to be a better choice. This is not a \\"how to\\" book in terms of specific, practical, dog training techniques, but rather a philosophy of training in general. I found the title misleading."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I first read this book a couple of years ago and since then have recommended it to anyone who would listen. I've also bought four copies and given them as gifts.I decided recently that I should reread it to reinforce the ideas and to see if it was as good as I remembered. It is.When I first read this book I can remember being literally horrified at the methods I had been using to try to modify other peoples' behaviour (family, girlfriend, colleagues, etc.). Any time you attempt to change the behaviour of any person or animal you are - whether you realise it or not - attempting to train them.It turns out that the methods most people use (usually unconsciously or because they do not know better) are both ineffective and unpleasant - especially punishment. It is rare in life that you can change to a different method of doing something vitally important that is both much more pleasant for all of those involved and produces better results. This book demonstrates one of these happy occasions.All of our attempts to change the behaviour of other creatures can be broken down into three categories: punishment, negative reinforcement and positive reinforcement. Punishment is an aversive applied after the event (such as grounding your kids or putting a criminal in jail). Negative reinforcement is an aversive (punisher) applied when an unwanted behaviour is occurring which is then stopped when the unwanted behaviour stops (such as the use of a choke chain on a dog). Positive reinforcement involves rewarding desired behaviour (for example using praise or food).Karen Pryor's methods originate with the findings of American psychologist B F Skinner and her work as a dolphin trainer. Dolphins are unusual creatures in that it is not really possible to train them using the traditional methods of negative reinforcement or punishment. Dolphin trainers thus had no choice except to explore what was possible using only positive reinforcement, particularly using the powerful tool of a conditioned reinforcer - something that the training subject associates with a reward, such as a clicker or whistle.(The advantage of a conditioned reinforcer is that it becomes possible to show the subject precisely what it was you liked because you can indicate without any delay. A lot of training problems are simply due to problems in communication. For example, when you yell at your dog for jumping into the lake and it comes over to you and you then tell it off forcefully, how does the dog know that you are telling it off for jumping in the lake rather than coming over to you when you call? And should you be surprised when you find your dog won't come reliably when you call for it?)Dolphins were (are?) considered different to other animals in their level of intelligence, playfulness, curiosity and friendliness to humans. I found it absolutely fascinating that Pryor has found that when other animals - dogs, horses, bears and even fish - are trained only using positive reinforcement they show the same characteristics as dolphins. Even more interesting is Pryor's finding that if even a small amount of negative training (all of which involve use of a punisher) is mixed in you lose all or virtually all of the benefits. And what good sense this makes: how could a dog that is regularly throttled with a chain by its 'beloved' owner have the same level of trust, curiosity and freedom from fear as one that was only praised when it did something that was desired? This has extremely important ramifications for our conduct in our daily lives.One of the principal benefits of Pryor's book is that she teaches us that it is often helpful to make an effort to see the situation from the other side. This sounds trite but is actually the opposite: a simple but very powerful tool. Often problems originate from a communication problem and/or because we find we are actually not rewarding or punishing the behaviour we think we are (as my dog example above shows).I have found Pryor's methods immensely liberating. Previously I always felt that is was somehow my 'duty' to try to correct unwanted behaviour (whether is was something my girlfriend did, service I was unhappy about at a restaurant, or whatever). Thus I either ended up with an unpleasant situation (when is remonstrating with people pleasant?) or felt that I had given up because I was weak. Now I understand that one can and should just wait for behaviour one wants and deliberately reward it. This is the difference between a life filled with negativity and the total opposite. And the results are also better! What a marvellous gift Karen Pryor has given us."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I read about every book I could get my hands on when I got my first dog a year and a half ago and this and Culture Clash by Jean Donaldson and Before & After You Get Your Puppy by Ian Dunbar where the best of all of them.

Yes, I am not making that up. That's right from her introduction. Just like children, \\"raising\\" a companion animal has to be a balance of both negative and positive responses to behavior. It's not all positive and definitely not all negative...and run away from any book that says otherwise. Ms. Pryor is a legend in the field and is most famous for her work with dolphins. (Try her, Lads Before the Wind for her experiences with Dolphins.) I work with Huskies and Malamutes and they are famous for their intractability. It's not that they can't learn, it's that they don't choose to perform simply because someone is asking. So you have to \\"encourage\\" them. And sometimes it's a treat and sometimes it's a scold. But it's never ever angry. Not sure she invented \\"shaping\\" but she provides an excellent discription. (if you've seen Eight Below, you've witnessed dogs that are performing actions that were taught as a series of simpler actions that were stacked as they were learned. Incidentally, although I use clicker training, I don't use a clicker. I lose stuff. I use a short word and use that word only in training. I also use thin parachute nylon chokers that are carefully fitted to just barely slip over the dog's head and rest high up, just behind the ears. You never take them off. I like them much better than choke chains, which can be dangerous if used incorrectly and MUST be removed especially in a multi-dog household.If you only had one book on training, this arguably would be the one. And for those wondering whether to buy the \\"white cover\\" or the \\"blue cover\\" editions, they appear, to the best of my abilites, to be almost identical. The difference (other than the color of the cover) is the last page. The \\"new\\" edition lists Ms. Pryor's web page.

Very happy customer!"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Clicker training has become the New Age buzz word amongst the humanist-oriented dog training bunch-- as well as for many of the pet industry book publishers eager to capitalize on this latest trend.As the owners of the popular dog training web site, ..., we are frequently asked about our opinion of Karen Pryor's book, \\"Don't Shoot The Dog.\\"Based on theories of operant conditioning first expounded by psychologist B.F. Skinner, and later popularized by dolphin trainer Karen Pryor in books such as, \\"Don't Shoot The Dog\\", clicker training involves attaching a positive, motivator (such as food) to an event marker (such as a clicking sound made by a child's toy known as a \`cricket') in order to improve timing and allow the dog to more easily understand which behavior he did correctly.One of the original uses for this type of training-- if I'm remembering correctly-- was to train dolphins. Instead of using a clicker, they used a whistle.Advocates of clicker training often argue that you can't put a prong collar on a dolphin, and since this approach was developed to train a beast as large as a dolphin that it is also the best method for training a dog.But let's not forget: Dolphins are kept in small containment areas, where they are surrounded by nothing but water. Ever.A dolphin can't accidentally [make a mess] on your sofa. A dolphin can't chew through the electrical wiring at the observation park where it is kept.So using clicker training to teach parlor tricks to a dolphin isn't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison.The problem I have with clicker training is not inherent to the use of a small child's toy to assist in training a dog (which, it could be argued, strays away from the natural way dog's communicate with each other) but rather in the promotion and word of mouth associated with this behavioral approach. An approach which closely resembles the ramblings of a college girl newly converted to Evangelism.Furthermore, clicker training has quickly evolved into the poster child of those who view traditional dog training as something closer to torture for the dog, rather than as a method of training new behaviors. (They refer to using a training collar and a leash as using \\"violence\\" against a dog.)Get real.The weak point of the clicker trainer's argument is in the assumption that using compulsion (giving a dog a correction) is the same as punishment and/or force. In reality, a well timed motivational correction is merely a method of telling the dog that he did something wrong.(I guess they think that the mother dog uses \\"violence\\" on the puppies, too?)Whatever.Imagine trying to learn how to drive a car with an instructor who only told you when you were doing something right. And refused to tell you when you were doing something wrong. Sure, you might eventually learn how to drive (if you didn't kill yourself first), but the fastest and easiest method of learning ANYTHING is to know when you are doing something right as well as when you are doing something wrong.I feel there is a definite place for clicker training in a trainer's bag of tricks... for movie and TV training for example... however, as a behavior modification tool... leave this one for the birds. Or dolphins."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I love the title of this book.The contents, however, perpetuate the mythology of behavioral science as an actual science that always and inevitably works to change, shape, or modify behavior. It's not, and it doesn't. In fact, in my opinion it has become more like a belief system--based on a tautology*--where despite mounting evidence of its overall ineffectiveness, particularly when it comes to solving behavioral problems in dogs (which is my own area of expertise, and where it only works about 15% of the time), its adherents continue to tout it as highly successful. They also wrongly claim that ALL dog training takes place through some form of operant conditioning, whether the trainer is aware of it or not. (Most dog training is actually closer to respondent than to operant conditioning, but that's another topic**.)Still, Pryor makes a convincing argument for applying the ideas of B. F. Skinner to everything from dolphin training to the little problems of everyday life, even though the preponderance of Skinner's ideas have been proven invalid. Even Skinner's student Keller Breland, who invented clicker training and later became Pryor's mentor, sadly discovered that, \\"There are definite weaknesses in the philosophy underlying these techniques.\\" (\\"Behavior Problems in Organisms,\\" American Psychologist, 1961.)I have to admit, though, even I was suckered in by Pryor's fervent belief in conditioning when I first read this book. She has that effect on people. And, energized by her passion, I began using her ideas in my dog training practice in New York City. I quickly found out, though, that conditioning techniques are mostly ineffective, and that, believe it or not, using food rewards can actually cause a negative learning experience for the dog, because it isn't intrinsic to learning most of the behaviors a dog needs to learn.***However, I wouldn't want to discourage anyone from buying and reading this book. I think you should look at behavior from all possible angles and carefully consider all sides of an issue. But if you DO read it, my suggestion would be take what Pryor says with a very large grain of salt. And if you're interested in really new ideas about dog training, there are a couple of books I do recommend, and highly: PLAYTRAINING YOUR DOG by Patricia Gail Burnham, and NATURAL DOG TRAINING by Kevin Behan. (Don't be fooled by the publication dates of these books; the ideas in them are still fresh and new.)*The Primary Behavioristic Tautology:What is a reinforcement? Anything that causes a behavior to be learned. What is a learned behavior? Anything that has been reinforced. That's circular logic.** An operant is a behavior which is spontaneously emitted, with no stimulus coming from an outside source. A respondent is a behavior that is elicited or induced by a stimulus coming from an outside source (such as a dog trainer). So, very little of what a dog trainer does could be correctly termed operant conditioning.*** According to behaviorists, intrinsic reinforcers work better than extrinsic reinforcers. And food is, generally speaking, an extrinsic reinforcer since it's not directly related to the behaviors being learned in dog training. Another point is that extrinsic reinforcers, such as food rewards (and by extension, clickers, which get their effectiveness from the association a dog makes with being fed), have a tendency to actually undermine the learning process entirely. (That's not just me talking, either, by the way, that's textbook behaviorism.)"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I have recently purchased the book in South Africa ( have been collecting for the past 25 years) I loved what I could read however after p64 I FOUND AGAIN P33 TO P64...

Although it is not &quot;bad&quot; advice it certainly is not complete, and should not be used as the sole method of training. In order to teach a dog properly one must use a combination of &quot;traditional&quot; training, &quot;altered&quot; traditional training and &quot;modern&quot; (clicker) training. There must be a clear message of right/wrong/reward/correction for a dog to fully understand what is being taught. Yes you may easily teach a dog how to &quot;sit&quot; or &quot;down&quot; using a lure and a clicker, but for serious trainers who wish to keep their dog truly safe and teach such life saving commands such as the emergencey down-- such tools as the clicker are not the best to work with.The fact is, every dog is different. Some are correctable with just a &quot;unhappy face&quot; others are head strong powerful animals that need a firmer hand and a more no-nonsense approach. As long as the animal is treated humanely with love &amp; patients, all forms of training have their purpose. People need to stop trying to be experts on issues they know very little about (it requires more then reading a book and teaching a trick or two to become an expert).

You fail even my undergrad course on behavioral principles.A negative reinforcer is STILL A REINFORCER! It still increases the chance of said act recurring. Ms. Pryor has made the same stupid mistake of thinking that \\"negative reinforcer\\" is the same as \\"punishment.\\" No, no, no!A negative reinforcer is taking away a noxious stimuli, not adding one. It's really a basic issue, and one that is SOOOOO misunderstood and wrongly stated in the popular press. The noxious sound of the buzzer ringing because you didn't put your seat belt on is ONLY a negative reinforcer if you find it reinforcing to have the sound stop. The stopping is the key, not the addition of the sound. We are talking + versus -, not a smiley face versus a frowny face. Please, correct this horrible error, Ms. Pryor!I haven't gotten all the way through the book, but what I was hoping to be a pleasant adjunct to a class certainly can't be used as one given the flat-out wrong information in it.

It is a consumer's guide to behavior modification using reinforcement.This little book is so basic that it includes examples of how to use reinforcement to:-get a roommate to put away the dirty laundry-correct your faulty tennis swing-get the surly bus driver to stop being rude to you,and much more.How to modify each of these situations in 8 different behavior-mod ways is examined. While this is covered in a single chapter, the other chapters will help the reader understand learning principles, and to come up with her or his own methods.My only wish is that behaviorists give more credit to love, or simple affection. When describing how a really big jackpot reinforcer such as giving a surprise party for the family can have an extraordinary effect on learning, the author keeps to her behavioral guns, rather than acknowledging that loving acts carry much more meaning than a calculated act done to reinforce good behavior. This is exactly what scared so many people away from the work of B.F. Skinner and his ground-breaking research ---- Skinner wanted to show that learning came from reinforcement, without affection. He was trying to make a point, but at a great cost to behaviorism.Many readers will want to apply material in this book to their children. For readers who want this laid out in detail, good books are Your Defiant Child by Russell Barkley, and Loving Your Child is Not Enough, Positive Discipline that Works by Nancy Samalin.These days, behavioral and cognitive therapies tend to be lumped together. For psychotherapists who want more detailed ways to use cognitive-behavioral therapy I can recommend two good books. The Clinical Handbook of Psychological Disorders, a Step by Step Treatment Manual gives detailed procedures for therapists to use with a dozen common psychotherapy problems, such as Depression, OCD, and couple distress.

Unlike many recent behaviourist-based training books, Ms Pryor's book is not specifically \\"purely positive\\" and does rationally discuss the uses of aversives in training and learning.This book is not specifically a dog training book, and as such it will not give you step-by-step instructions to make your dog sit or lie down. What it will give you is an understanding of the basic techniques needed for effective teaching. After reading this book it should be possible for even an unexperienced dog owner to design an effective behaviour modification programme for their canine companion.I recommend this book to every new dog owner I meet. However, although this is a valuable foundation text I wouldn't recommend it as the sole reference work for any dog owner or trainer. It definately needs to be complemented by species-specific reading on dog body language and instincts.

I highly recommend it to all of my dog-training clients (and I encourage them to use the techniques with their kids, spouses and co-workers, too). Terrific book!"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"A book doesn't stay in print for over 20 years without meeting a need, and this book does that: It provides an introduction to the basic principles of behavior change in highly readable language. That makes it useful for anyone interested in training or teaching -- pet owners and professional animal trainers, of course, but also parents, teachers, corporate trainers and managers, spouses, and just about everybody else.The title (which comes from a list of ways you can get \\"rid of\\" unwanted behavior) is unfortunate, in my opinion, because it suggests that the book is limited to dog training when in fact it is much broader than that. Indeed, some people have criticized the book because it is NOT a dog training manual. The subtitle comes much closer to describing the nature of the book.Many people think that you need one set of procedures to train dogs, another to train cats, another for horses, another for people, and so on, so they look for a species-specific how-to. It's true that some critters learn faster than others and people get a lot more from watching models and from hearing instructions than do dogs and cats. It's also true that a book aimed at teaching or training a particular species will provide useful concrete examples. But the principles of behavior, and most of the procedures for changing behavior (which is what teaching and training are all about) are essentially the same no matter the species. This is why Pryor likes to say that no one should be allowed to have a baby until they have demonstrated that they can train a chicken.Like a lot of people, Pryor tends to confuse negative reinforcement and punishment, as one reviewer pointed out. But to dismiss the book because of such an error is itself a far greater error. If my own book on classroom teaching proves to be as influential and durable as Pryor's book, I will be very pleased indeed."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Although I think I'm reviewing the previous edition, I can't imagine enough has changed that this review will be obsolete!Kare Pryor presents the science of behavior in an easy-to-read, layman's format. No more huge textbooks, the general public now has a shorter, fun-to-read (full of amusing anecdotes!) book that will give them accurate information. Although gently promoting positive reinforcement training methods, Karen gives the science behind her reasoning. Great book for anyone who wants to change behavior, from pet dogs to spouses to children."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I first heard the name of Karen Pryor from a good friend who had worked with her some years ago. John told me several memorable stories about her, then, novel approach to training marine mammals. Because you can't easily give a porpoise a pat and a good girl, when a new behavior is mastered, a whistle is used as a positive reinforcement from a distance. First you associate that sound with food, then later the sound itself becomes a reward. When I decided to take my own dogs' training to the next level, Pryor's book was the first resource that I sought out.This book will not teach you how to clicker train your dog. That's not its intent. Don't shoot the Dog is more accurately described as a philosophical treatise on the approach and world view underlying clicker training. Herein lies its greatest strength - the clear way it goes behind the technique to explain the underlying philosophy. She carefully ties the approach back to B. F. Skinner and the behaviorists, which provides a sense of scientific continuity. Her anecdotes are intriguing and well writtenI recommend this book especially for those who have not yet begun to train their pets. The best time to decide on your philosophical approach is before the first successful sit-stay. Like good teachers everywhere, dog trainers (i.e., you) need to be comfortable with their own style. Furthermore, some teaching styles work better with some students (i.e., your pet) than with others (i.e., your neighbors pet). I agree with Jon Katz Kats on Dogs, find your style, your philosophy, and then begin to train.Read it once, maybe twice; decide whether the approach is for you and for your dog. And, if you decide that it is, then, and only then, pursue clicker training technique. For me, the approach was quite different and very appealing. In fact, the week after I finished Pryor's book, I ordered a clicker and enrolled in an online clicker training class. The class is good, but like so many of them, it's very applied, like recopies in a cookbook. Don't Shoot the Dog provided me with an invaluable working knowledge of the theory behind clicker training.Bob and Hannah, November 2005."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I've been in management 29 years with over 1000 employees.

I dip in and out of it often to find inspiration for training...though I didn't necessarily find the part dealing with people a huge break through, but liked how her technique can be expanded to other areas in life.

Full of anecdotal evidence from Karen Pryor's many years of experience working with animals, it's a page turning read with more than a chuckle between the covers. I quickly discovered why a lot of my own ideas have worked and some other lateral ways to try as well. As Karen points out, not everything works exactly the same in every circumstance for every animal, be it horse or husband, and although a lot of people have a \\"method\\" it's finding correct principles which govern that make it successful. Clear and concise, this book does what it sets out to do, help us understand or change behaviour to make for happy people and happy animals. No wonder it's changed some pet owners lives.

Raving about her. If you review her book carefully YOU are the one who has been trained...Trained to buy into her philosophy. As you read this book note how she carefully switches terminology to present her techinques positively and vilify anything that dosent agree with her.This book was groundbreaking...when it was orginally written in 1984, 20 years later, its a bit behind the times. So much new work has been done in this field. And there are much more insightful and engaging books out there. As one of the other reviews stated this is not a dog training book. It is more of a behavioral modification philosophy. Pryor has some good tips and techniques, but nothing that impressed me.I had a difficult time finishing this book, I found it very boring. At times her philosophy eluded to manipulating TOTAL control over behavior. I train my dogs with positive techinques to behave well, not be robots. As a result I have an entire wall full of obedience, agility and flyball ribbons and titles. It is possible to overtrain the indivuality right out of an animal or person. Do you really want that??I think this is a case for pop culture. A group of people are impressed by her philosophy, so everyone else jumps on the bandwagon. Losing their ability to be objective. Pryor is good, but I dont feel she deserves the reputation Pop culture masses have given her.She spends far too much time telling stories, and anicdotes, and not much time discussing techniques. For a 200 page book she could have thoroughly discussed her philosophy in 50 pages. The rest is filler....Everyone is entitled their opinion, and has different expectations. Pryor fell far short of mine."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"This is a must read for anyone studying applied behavioral analysis, preparing for a teaching career, business career, getting married or becoming a parent!

This book is an excellent text that can be used to teach a college level class or as a relaxing read to learn how you can become a better person.

Many parents don't have the skills for handling their children. Their inconsistencies in parenting from episode to episode and between two parents gives the child confusing signals and leads to behavior problems. For my optometric vision therapy to be effective and to carry over into real life the child needs to do regular home practice. If the parents and child are at each others throats or fighting then they can't do the home therapy. This book helps families in this situation acquire the insights to begin to find new ways to relate. I also use the book in courses I teach for other professionals."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I have to agree with an earlier reviewer that the title of this wonderful book is an unfortunate choice. The subject of behavioral conditioning is covered in an easily accessible conversational voice and relates to general learning theory (all species including people) as well as specifically to dog training. The principles are presented clearly and concisely with many fascinating examples of practical applications. The fluid style makes for easy reading without being a superficial coverage of the topics."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"The writing in this book just drags on and on. Whenever she makes a point she feels the need to talk about the exact same thing for far too long. She really isn't talking about anything revolutionary in here. If you have even the most basic knowledge about training this book will be useless to you...also, she talks about how she had her cat put to sleep because she couldn't get it to stop peeing on the stove (instead of leaving the cat outside or giving it to someone who knew how to train it she put it to sleep. She also complains about how her mother bothered her with all her complaining while living in a nursing home...zero compassion). Karen Pryor also doesn't seem to express any sort of skepticism about her own work; which is a bad sign in any science.

And Steve also included a note saying, \\"This book will solve many of the problems you and all other business owners, presidents, sales managers & sales trainers encounter on a daily basis!\\" And was he ever right!In fact, ever since my first reading of the book, I've maintained that every single baby should be born with \\"Don't Shoot the Dog\\" tied around it's ankle - - - the \\"Operator's Manual,\\" if you will.While Karen may have originally had dogs, seals & dolphins in mind when she wrote it, and although I have used it to \\"shape the behavior\\" of all of our dogs/cats/parrots/rabbits/guinea pigs over the years, the real monetary payoff has come from improved \\"relationships\\" (read performance) with my salespeople/ Corporate Team Members/clients/customers/children/wife (Please, I'm begging you! Don't tell Gigi I said that!

While I valued the techniques, I wondered what other areas of life I could use them in. A passion of mine was learning other languages. I then read about behavior chains and memorizing poems, etc. I then thought about using this technique to memorize basic phrases of some foreign language. I picked up a phrasebook for the russian language. I listened and repeated the phrases. After repeating the phrases, I then started to treat each phrase as a behavior chain. As I continued learning new material, I would then recall the previous phrase with ease. In a short amount of time I had learned the entire phrase book! I was tickled. As of this writing, I am taking a russian language class and have been passing with an ease I had never known. The professor is impressed with my ability to absorb the new material presented. I am now helping out in an English as a Second Language class and using the same techniques I used to learn Russian. The students have found learning to be painless.

I was looking to get ideas from Ms. Pryor on how to address common problems with dogs--such as walking freely at my side,and to stop barking at the sound of doorbells. Among her books, I chose this one because it had the word \\"dog,\\" in it and I was expecting most of the book to provide examples and experiences with dogs but that was not the case. I was aware that Ms. Pryor had trained dolphins, nevertheless, I thought her focus would be on dogs. The book offers a variety of behavioral training approaches but most are explained in the context of dolphins she trained, human behaviors we try to change in our relationships and in some rare instances, dog behavior.

Anyone interested in why and how positive reinforcement is such an effective behavior modification tool will like this book. I rate this book four stars instead of five because the author is first a scientist, not a writer, but her prose is readable enough and she explains the concepts succinctly. Despite the title, she didn't write this to teach people how to clicker-train their dogs, but if you are doing that, it will help you do it better."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"There are other books that are better at giving the specifics of how to positively train your dog.However, Karen Pryor was the first to use positive training for dogs. It is possible to get some response to human commands by using the negative training that was the mode before Karen Pryor came along. However, she trained marine mammals. You cannot intimidate a killer whale into obeying you as you can, sort of, with a dog. She reasons that if positive training worked for marine mammals, why wouldn't it work for dogs. It does.Positive training leads to much more consistent outcomes, especially with dogs who's been abused.I was asked to take a pure-bred Chow who came into rescue after at least 2 years, and several litters of puppies on a chain. Boys in the neighborhood beat her with sticks and every time the rescue group gave the Chow's family things to help (dog houses, food and water bowls, food, etc), the things disappeared, and the chow stayed out on the chain without shelter or food or water. Finally, Animal control was convinced to take the dog when it got very sick.When I got the chow, she was a fear biter and her skin was infected over 30% of her body--the surface of her foot pads were coming off, as was the lining of her ear flap. She was extremely underweight, ill, and afraid.Karen Pryor's book had just been published. I used the ideas to help my chow girl and, after 4 years, she recovered to the point that she would let strangers, even boys, pet her.Because I was not sure, and it was before Best Friends and all the positive training books since, I never left her alone with children. She might have been okay. I just didn't have anyway to know--not being a veterinary behaviorist or researcher of dog behavior. She passed away at age 16.Karen Pryor gives an excellent idea of why we should use positive methods and a good start at integrating them into a training program. Others give a clearer step by step approach, but I still think it is worth reading the book that started it all."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"This was the first book on behavior and training I read.

How to get the cat off the kitchen table or your grandmother to stop nagging you. How to affect behavior in your pets, your kids, your boss, your friends. How to improve your tennis stroke, your golf game, your math skills, your memory. All by using the principles of training with reinforcement.\\"That first paragraph from the foreword pretty much sums it up. The book is delightful to read. I'm not a behavioral scientist, but it seems like a reasonably thorough introduction to training through reinforcement and shaping. It has helped me better train our dogs, and clarified my understanding of what actually is going on in the training process.I really like her systematic approach to the material, with definitions and examples. She includes a little background -- the\\"Clever Hans\\" phenomenon, the contributions of B.F. Skinner, her own background with marine mammals, the traditional punitive approach to animal training. The book is not exclusively about training dogs; she doesn't address dominance (except as an explanation for the prevalence of punishment in society) or pack psychology. She does clearly explain reinforcers, aversives, markers and the importance of timing, stimulus control, methods (\\"recipes\\") vs. principles, variable schedules, behavior chains, successive approximation (shaping), etc. Particularly valuable for me are the rules of thumb about reinforcer size, the \\"Ten Laws of Shaping,\\" the \\"Training Game,\\" and the concept of backwards chaining.Perhaps controversially, the book advocates using operant conditioning to improve the behavior of one's fellow humans. This struck me as manipulative, but I think I'm starting to agree with Pryor. Operant conditioning ultimately is a tool for communicating. There are clearly occasions when it is a more effective and efficient way to communicate than discussion or argument."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I've read the reviews on this book. The 1-star reviews all seem to come from either dog training companies who view it as competition, scientologists who reject the whole field of psychology, angry individuals who didn't read the product description, or individuals whose worldview is threatened by the idea that our behavior is influenced by external stimuli.\\"Don't Shoot the Dog\\" is the NAME of the book. It's not a dog training book. It's written for HUMANS. It's a book about the simple principles of operant conditioning which influence behavior. Pryor never makes any claims which are not strongly scientifically supported. She provides simple practical instruction for utilizing science to shape behavior. I recommend this book to so many people, I cannot count them. I do NOT recommend self-help books, as a rule. THIS however is solid science with solid evidence behind it being presented in an open, honest, and incredibly helpful way.If you want warm-fuzzy yet ultimately hollow language to make you believe you have a spiritual connection with your pets or that you really are accomplishing your goals for change by repeating them in your head fifty times a day while wearing knee-high socks, go for one of the fifty million \\"self-help\\" books out there.If you want actual scientifically supported methods for creating actual change, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"After reading this book, I used the methods described to teach a very stubborn dog to sit, lay down and rollover in one afternoon. Easy to read, great examples, and applicable to human beings!"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"If you have any interest in animal training, from your pet to exotic animals, this book is a must read. Karen Pryor is an authority on training through positive reinforcement, and this is a great introductory book.When I began my career as an animal trainer, this book was recommended to me as a good starting point. Not only did it organize all of the basic information on animal training, but it also gave great insight on how to use positive reinforcement in your daily life.Even if you have no intention of ever training an animal, this book can still be of great value for dealing with children/parents/bosses/co-workers."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"This book is exceptional and should be the first book you read if you're considering any kind of opperant (clicker or similar) training for dogs or any animal. It's clear, concise, and gives good foundation information without talking down to you. I'm a huge fan of Karen Pryor after reading this book. It's helped me tremendously working with animals as different as dogs and horses... Can't recommend it highly enough! I've actually bought additional copies and given them to friends because it's that good and helpful. Buy this book!!!"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Fun and clever, this book should be compulsory reading in every high school! It is not so much about training dogs as it is about general behaviour and how to treat your fellow people and animals, with the method of Positive Reinforcement. Karen Pryor explains with clear and simple language HOW and WHEN it came about (dolphin training) and WHY it actually works. (Later on, it was adopted by the dog training community as &quot;clicker-training&quot;.) The theories and the training methods are supported by memorable anecdotes. Most importantly, this book is not about any hokus-pokus, but simply an explanation of why we (humans and animals) behave the way we do and how we can go about changing each other's behaviour without using force.After having read the book, I couldn't wait to try out Positive Reinforcement on my cats, my husband, my sons and my mother - and it works really well! The more copies that are sold of this book, the better a place the world would be.If you get hooked on this book and you have a dog, I recommend that you follow up with the more detailed &quot;The Power of Positive Dog Training&quot; by Pat Miller."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I'm a novice dog owner -- and I stumbled across this book while researching clicker trainer. Most \\"traditional\\" dog obedience classes require that a puppy be at least six months old -- so it can withstand the choke collar. In fact, that's what the class in my city paper recommended -- so I decided to evaluate some positive training methods in the meantime. Immediately, I was impressed with the response of my dog. I decided to try a clicker -- though I was too cheap to even invest in that -- so I tried making a clicking sound with my tongue. And, to my amazement, my dog responded.I knew this book was about operant conditioning -- and an all-purpose book on training methods -- not just dogs. In other words, I knew what I was buying -- and I was not expecting a dog training manual. But the advice in this book has been life changing for me.I decided to put the positive techniques to work. As a father, I wanted to encourange my 8-year-old daughter to practice softball with me. She's already a great student, but I was tired of begging her to practice with me. With Karen's book, I realized that all my advice on throwing, batting, etc was acting as a \\"nagging\\" negative aversive to her practice. If I want more time, then I should focus on that first. Reward her for five minutes time -- then bump it up from there. And shape one behavior at a time -- so I focused on catching. First, I challenged her to make five catches in a row. And that is all the advice that I gave. The challenge made \\"catch\\" exciting for her. When she made five catches -- I offered to take her for some ice cream -- and, as Karen suggested, end the session on a positive note. But, to my surprise, my daughter wanted to keep on going. And the next day, she wanted to try another challenge.I also learned to be more selective about my praise. Instead of praising everything on game day -- I'm more selective. I keep quiet, and let her make mistakes. I don't say \\"nice try\\" or \\"shake it off\\" or \\"hustle\\" or \\"get ready\\" or anything. But when she makes a great play, I praise her right away. As Karen suggested, this makes the praise more sincere and meaningful. And it works -- and my daughter is really into softball now.This book has changed my perspective on how I approach training in general. And not only has it helped me \\"coach\\" my daughter, but it's helped with the dog training as well. So much so, that I've decided to forgo the \\"traditional\\" class in favor of a more positive class that accepts younger puppies."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I gave this book four stars only because it really isn't about dog training specifically, or clicker training either. As I realized this, I was somewhat disappointed. But I couldn't quite drop it, and continued. I was glad I did. I found the information, and insite into both human and critter psychology enlightening. Since I had already read Clicker training your Horse, I understood the concept of the clicker. This book gave me a glimpse of how positive reinforcement might be applied to people...where obviously clicking might just get you smacked. I applied positive reinforcment to my boss. He was not a horrible boss, but he was not a caring boss either. I noticed that he seemed to be hungry for approval from his equals, and it occured to me that maybe approval from anywhere might be his &quot;click/reward&quot; I started applying methods suggested in the book, and with in a couple of weeks, he was a most solitious boss. We (the lowerdowns) came to adore this boss, and strove to stay in his department. The more we reinforced the behaviors we liked...the more he exibited them. This book could change your relationship with people. I would recommend it to anyone who deals with people, or animals. Read it through, then go back and study the highlights."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Every pet owner should read this book. Also any parents that have a child with autism.It teaches and explains how our pets view our actions and how they react to us. You can't believe the things you may be unaware you are teaching your pet. Some may be causing poor behavior. This book completely explains the correct way to train and get good behavior from your pet. It also explains how to eliminate bad behavior. I own a parrot and have put into practice many of the suggestions mentioned in the book. The suggestions WORK! I bought both the book and the audio CD because you need to read or listen to the author several times to fully grasp her work. So having both has been useful.The book goes into great detail so be prepared to concentrate, learn and open your mind to concepts that are scientifically based. No unsupported claims made in this book! GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Karen Pryor is a terrific writer. This book is an excellent summary of the field of behavioral science, a field that is largely misunderstood. I certainly didn't appreciate its value until I read this truly excellent treatment of the topic.Before I read this book, I had a general bias against behaviorism. I had heard that some behavioral techniques had gotten good results for some types of mental problems, but it seemed inappropriate to apply such simplistic ideas to humans on a regular basis.Boy, was I wrong!Pryor explains in this slim, fun-to-read volume that behavioral science is real and important. Behavior has its own set of rules, and we are subject to them just as surely as we are subject to the laws of gravity (regardless of how well we understand either). Pryor understands these underlying principles very well, and has a wealth of knowledge about how to apply them.This short book covers so much!It provides an excellent overview of the laws that govern the behavior of all creatures.It gives us a short course in animal training, pointing out the differences among animals. (Training cats is very different from training dogs, training dolphins, Pryor's specialty, brings additional challenges, elephants are incredibly smart; there are some wonderful animal stories in this book.)And it's a really nice short course in how to apply the laws of behavior and the options for reinforcement to our own lives.Pryor makes it clear that much of our character and many of our actions are shaped NOT through language or understanding but through our experiences. Pryor's clear explication of exactly how this works gives us a new language to think with and to experiment with. It was really eye-opening to me. A better understanding of behavior and reinforcement gives us a whole new toolkit to explore.Both a realist and an optimist, Pryor writes absolutely delightful prose. It's uplifting and inspiring, which is pretty amazing for a book that also shows just how far we are from having a good shared understanding of this topic.This book makes a huge contribution toward rescuing an underappreciated body of knowledge."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I found this in the psych/self-help section of the bookstore following a nightmare dance rehearsal, in which I'm trying to learn a troupe choreography for a competition, but repeatedly screwing up and beating myself up.Stop barking up the wrong tree and debating on whether this stuff works on dogs or not. Use this book to help train YOURSELF do the things you've wanted with all your heart but couldn't because you ran up against some vauge and insurmountable psychological barrier.I was sold on the book because it discusses the things you will experience in the course of learning, like when you suddenly are unable to perform anything right after appearing to have climbed the learning curve successfully (prelearning dip), and you're getting so frustrated you're in tears and throwing your dance shoes across the floor (prelearning temper tantrum). Knowing this is a normal progression (but if you're a horse, you'd be kicking and swishing your tail, a dog, you'd be growling, and if you're a dolphin, you'd be breaching and bellyflopping), and not something to feel guilty about.P.S. Thanks to the patience my wonderful dance teacher, we havewon the dance troupe competition."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"I don't know where I and my dogs would be without DON'T SHOOT THE DOG. This book was the first book that opened my eyes to a new way a training -- a way based on understanding the principles underlying the &quot;cookbook recipes&quot; I'd been given. Now I'm so much more successful.I highly recommend this book to any person who wants to learn how to modify their dog's behavior and has been told (wrongly) that their dog is too &quot;stubborn,&quot; &quot;dominant,&quot; &quot;fearful,&quot; &quot;aggressive&quot; or even the wrong breed(!) to train. Those words just mean that the trainer wasn't educated enough to work with your dog. Now you can be successful on your own!I'm awfully glad this &quot;fad&quot; got started. I never would have made it as a dog owner without it!"},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"If you are looking for a basic dog training book, then you will be disappointed. Most dog training books focus on specific methods, whereas this book focuses on principles of behavior modification. That said, you will learn tons about application of behavior modification principles from this book, and they work on any species, humans included. It's a great read, full of valuable information."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"When I first read this book, I was so fascinated that I read it again and again. It's not a step by step manual for dog training but it's a behavioral modification manual. I also purchased &quot;Clicker Training for your Horse&quot; by Alexandra Kurland which deals with the same thing only this is much more of a step by step training book. I loved both books and it definitely gives one a much more positive outlook on life. And it makes for MUCH happier, mentally healthier pets. I also will read Anything by the Monks of New Skete...for dog training.But this is just a way...you can use any method of training with it."},{"Title":"Don't Shoot the Dog!: The New Art of Teaching and Training","review":"Any serious dog trainer, shelter/rescue volunteer or dog owner eventually needs to read Don't Shoot the Dog but it would not be my first choice for a novice dog owner intent on \\"taming\\" their beloved bundle of energy. Pat Miller wrote a better introduction to clicker training, The Power of Positive Dog Training but even that would not be my first read. Perhaps one of Ian Dunbar's earlier books, Teaching a New Dog Old Tricks, or Dr. Dunbar's Good Little Dog Book. I've read dozens of doggie books and have yet to find the perfect one. Patricia McConnell has several short ones that deal with specific issues that are very good.It amazes me how ardent supporters of \\"All Positive\\" training are but I suspect that most of them really don't understand classical and operant conditioning and few have studied any books about clicker training. I believe there are two types of clicker trainers: (1) people with a clicker hanging from their wrist and (2) true dog trainers who happen to use a clicker.While I do not use aversive methods (but I did as recently as six years ago) that does not remotely mean that my three dogs weighing in at from 70-130 pounds don't know the meaning of \\"NO!\\" or that they don't have limits and boundaries. To me \\"NO!\\" is a management word (as opposed to a training term), meaning, \\"stop whatever you are doing instantly.\\" I doubt that I use it more than once a week. \\"NO!\\" is like setting off the fire sprinkler system---it's an emergency measure beyond which there are no \\"easy\\" remedies. Off leash and without a remote device I have to know that a sharp, \\"leave it\\", \\"here!\\" or \\"Uh-Uh\\" or \\"enough!\\" will instantly bring a smiling Great Dane or Weimaraner back to me. If there is a daredevil squirrel jumping from tree to tree it can be difficult to break their focus but the three of them sitting at the base of the tree staring longingly upward as if in a trance means they aren't getting in any trouble and they will begrudgingly respond to me...eventually.It also is surprising to discover how impassioned the other side is---the so called \\"traditional\\" trainers. Many of them who are in the business have probably seen their revenue shrink. Some, based on their rantings, aren't very bright or educated. Others are just really intent on dominating someone or something. When they start talking about how much more humane their prong collars are than The Gentle Leader...If you have a dog and are not enjoying the experience---good for you for attempting to learn some possible answers by buying a book. Sadly, it probably won't be enough. You need a trainer to train you as much as to train your dog.Don't be wowed by the slickest web site and view with suspicion franchise dog training operations. A local shelter or rescue might have some suggestions. You might check with a local hospital that allows therapy dogs and find out who trained them or certified them. At a local dog park seek out the owners with well balanced dogs and ask them.Degrees are nice when coupled with hands on experience and successes. Telephone consults are worthless. Expect that the top of the game in terms of dog training and behavior assessment will be not only few and far between but heavily booked and not inexpensive.The two best in my area, both women, both educated but not doctoral level, both widely admired, both do hours of pro bono work for shelter and rescues, both own big dogs of breeds with aggressive reputations, both with many years of documented success rehabilitating dogs with problems. Not every dog owner needs their services. For most people, a reputable entry level group class will be invaluable."},{"Title":"Foul play","review":"As a novelist and dramatist, Charles Reade loved to investigate social issues of his day; prison reform, labor unions, and sexual issues all came under Reade's scrutiny. In this novel, published in 1868, his target was the shipping industry and insurance companies that would insure goods aboard ships for loss while placing passengers at great risk. If ships sank, the value of goods would be paid for in full, thus giving little incentive for shipping companies to maintain safe ships. The book is part social reform and part Robinson Crusoe. Robert Penfold is accused of forgery (he's the victim of a practical joke) and serves time in prison. Upon his release, he changes his name to James Seaton and signs on as a seaman aboard the Proserpine, a ship destined to be scuttled by its owners for the insurance money. When she does sink, Seaton and an aristocratic and consumptive woman named Helen Rolleston share a lifeboat. They make it to a deserted island where the Robinson Crusoe likenesses kick in. Seaton is a man who can do no wrong and has a solution for everything; if he felt like building a rocket to the moon, Reade would see that he succeeded. Helen, too, proves very resourceful and miraculously (thanks to all that sunshine and fresh air) recovers from her consumption. After being rescued, Seaton proves his innocence in the forgery he was accused of and goes back to being Robert Penfold, actually Rev. Robert Penfold. In case you couldn't guess, he and Helen marry. Much of what happens on the deserted island is unbelievable, as is Seaton's character, but that is not as important to Reade as the fact that by 1875 Parliament had passed a bill addressing the insurance issues he had brought to the fore in the novel. \\"The end crowns the work,\\" as they say, though it's a fairly pedestrian novel."},{"Title":"Pieces of the Piedmont","review":"This is a classic, though I'm afraid too few people know about it. The graceful and alert writing together with the one-of-a-kind monotypes capture this part of the world -- the Piedmont or Hunt Country of Virginia -- better than any other book I've ever seen. Even for people unfamiliar with Virginia,it should be read for its insights into the universal power of particular landscapes, their history and natural beauty."},{"Title":"Pieces of the Piedmont","review":"This collection shows what personal essays should be, scattered by subject yet delving deep. In this case, the unifying theme is the power of landscape, in particular a very, very beautiful and lush-with-history part of Virginia, my native state. But it is not really limited to Virginia, as the author intimates, since this is where America, or at least the idea of America, was probably born. If you like history and nature, this book is truly a wonderful discovery."},{"Title":"The letters of John and Jude","review":"I own this whole set of 17 Barclay Daily Study Bibles and use them more than anything else in my rather extensive library.

It has a good balance of information. It does not appear to me to be swayed to any one point of view. It is easy for the lay person to read and use without having to have a degree in theology. I use it along with other commentaries to balance what I am learning. As it says in the book, it is used world wide, has been translated into several languages and is used by lay persons as well as the Pastor. I do have several others in my collection, but this time I wanted a hard cover so it would stand the test of time and lots of use."},{"Title":"The letters of John and Jude","review":"Our Bible Study group always enjoys working with William Barclay's Commentaries.

I'd be irritated with Delillo if this weren't one of the most magnificent things I've ever read. I also enjoy the cover. I'd never seen that photograph before and hence never understood the story's odd original title. Why Pafko, mentioned in the text only once or twice? But there he is, forever, watching the ball sail over his head and into Cotter Martin's hand. Like Nick Shay said, the ball is about losing, not winning. Buy this book and give it to someone who'd never pick up an 800 page book. Give it to a baseball fan."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"...the fact that this great work has been published previously (first in Harper's back in 1992, then in altered form as the Prologue to Underworld in 1997) does not alter the fact that it is great. Pristine. Phrase-perfect. Sustained in tone. It speaks in your voice, American. Buy it for your old man who loves baseball but has no patience for this contemporary-lit mishegoss. Buy it for that girl you're trying to impress who loved White Noise but can't stand baseball. Buy it for the 12-year-old nephew you're trying to turn on to the glories of great fiction. Buy it. Oh yeah, and if you haven't actually read it yourself, do that too. It's the 50th anniversary of Bobby Thompson's homer, for chrissake."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"Who cares about Underworld? I didn't go near it. Separating this classic from that tome was the best marketing move anyone's ever done. This book should be in the public domain anyway. Imagine taking a baseball game, exploding it into one of the world's greatest historical events as seen from various characters' points of view, and at the same time encapsulating the dawning of a new moment in world history. Every sentence is sharp and detailed, anticipating the next. And then when Thomson hits the home run, Delillo freeze frames each second like you're in a car crash, making sure you're aware of everything that's going on. It's one of the best books ever written."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"I haven't read Underworld, so when I bought this book, all I knew was that it was about \\"the shot heard round the world\\" and that was good enough for me. Having grown up in Brooklyn and having lived in a house with three brothers and a father who were all avid Giant fans, this is something I've heard about my whole life. I wasn't even walking in 1951 so I certainly don't remember that day but what I do remember is it's being discussed in my home, ad nauseam, for as long as I can remember. In honor of my now deceased father and my very alive three brothers, (who followed the Giants and remained Giant fans as they went on to San Francisco), I have taken it upon myself to learn more about that fateful day in Dodger history when Giant fans all over New York roared in unity as Bobby Thomson's strike of the bat ended the Dodger season in 1951.DeLillo's attention to detail is so vivid that I actually felt as if I was hearing Russ Hodges announce the game. The book is full of nostalgic remembrances especially when he talks about one of the Giant sponsors - Chesterfield cigarettes. Between innings, Hodges actually instructs the audience to stay right where they are and \\"light up a Chesterfield.\\" Can you imagine saying that today? And I found that the trivia about the large CHESTERFIELD sign in centerfield lighting up the \\"E\\" when an error was made is stuff my brothers don't even know about. I can't wait to hit them with all this info when we get together this holiday season. As a matter of fact, I've already asked one of my brothers if he knew who was playing left field when Thomson hit the ball and he didn't know. So much for the baseball trivia experts in my family.I also enjoyed DeLillo's portrayal of the young Cotter Martin as he struggled to grab Thomson's ball from under the seats and his race out of the Polo Grounds as he clutched the much sought after ball. While I thought I would enjoy the Frank Sinatra/Jackie Gleason references, I found them to be the least desirable part of the book.The bottom line is that I enjoyed the book and now feel quite comfortable discussing this episode in baseball history with the best of them. I did have one question though -- If Bobby Thomson was \\"hot\\" that day and already had two hits (one of which had driven in a run), why did Branca take the chance of pitching to him? With men on second and third, I would think he would have walked him and taken his chances with the then rookie \\"Say Hey\\" Willie Mays. After finishing this book, I did some further research on this game and found that others have asked this same question. I guess I did learn something growing up as the only girl in that family of all boys. By the way, they're all getting a copy of this book for Christmas this year. It's a definite MUST for the \\"true\\" New York Giant fan."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"And I really believe that. This is the opening section of *Underworld* (1997), and it originally appeared in Harpers--so, when I saw it in stores, I thought &quot;why re-release this as a BOOK?&quot;Then, I read it. It stands on its own as a novella--and it's not *just* about baseball, either, so don't let that mislead you or put you off. It's about *everything*. Maybe you don't wish to read the lengthy *Underworld* (though the themes and characters and plotlines here run through the entire novel)--but at LEAST read THIS.And while I own the novel, I'm pleased to own this, too--and if you like DeLillo and wish to turn others on to his work, this is what you give them. I've given copies to several people, and use this brilliant work in my &quot;Writing a Novella&quot; Creative Writing class.

It describes in Delillo's beautiful writing the &quot;shot heard round the world&quot;, Thompson's famous home run. This novella easily holds up apart from Underworld and is a wonderful one sitting read."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"I found this insufferable for the same reason I find most Delillo insufferable, his language is just too incantatory and too bloatedly self-important to really take seriously. He wants to attach profundity and portentousness to everything in sight. Baseball, Nuclear War, J Edgar Hoover, Peter Bruegel, Frank Sinatra... everything becomes a part of this giant, humorously ritualized mythos, which would be fine, but unfortunately fiction needs to have more to it than the atmosphere of a catholic mass in old latin to really function (or at least is does for me). Delillo wants so desperately to be taken seriously, but his vague invocations make it obvious that he doesn't really even know what exactly he wants to be serious about. It seems like he wants to be a prophet of dread, anxiety, paranoia, really of modernity itself. Maybe instead of trying to be an important writer he should just try to be a good fiction writer."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"First things first - this is a brilliantly-evoked account of the Giants/Dodgers playoff game that ended with the \\"Shot Heard Round the World\\". It is also the opening section of DeLillo's novel Underworld. Like most of the other reviewers of this book, my main beef is \\"Why should one bother to buy this extract?\\" In context, this is only the beginning of a long exploration of American history in the 50 years that separate us from that game - particularly the Cold War, which could be said to begin on that day with news of the Soviet Union's atomic test reaching the US. The historic baseball goes weaving from hand to hand binding the stories together. If you're a DeLillo fan, then, don't buy it for yourself. If you want a taster of his work, perhaps buy it as an entry-level sample but be prepared to fork out for it all over again if you decide you need to read the full novel. Best of all, buy it as a gift for someone who's unlikely to be a DeLillo reader, now or in future, but is a fan of baseball and/of 50s Americana. It's great stuff, but its appeal in this format is just pretty limited."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"Well this has to be a classic, but describing it as a new 2001 novella by Delillo is a sure way to rile Delillo fans like me, who almost ordered it on reflex. It turns out to be the first part of Underworld. While Underworld is, in my view, one of the great books of this decade, the publisher should at least warn potential buyers that they may already own this book. On the other hand for those who find it hard to stick through an 800 page book, this sample delicacy might be a good introduction to the art of Delillo. As for me I prefer the original Underworld, or Body Artist, a completely mesmerizing novella about the same size as Pafko."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"Having suffered through all of Underworld, and having concluded that I should have stopped reading right after the excellent prologue (which essentially comprises this book), I was amused to see that DeLillo has released this as a \\"novella\\". Compelling reading to be sure, but why bother?I suppose this book is easier to carry around and read in bed than the beginning of Underworld, amounting to less than a hundred pages. But it is difficult to justify spending good money on a prologue to a longer novel with an eerie, attractive cover depicting the World Trade Center, that can be found for less money on bookstore bargain racks throughout the country.

Granted, it's a tour de force, and deserves as wide an audience as possible, but the thought of Scribner expecting readers to pay as much for this as they could pay for 800-plus pages of &quot;Underworld&quot; in paperback--or two copies of the &quot;Underworld&quot; hardcover from nearly any superstore remainder table in the United States--boggles the mind."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"No, not really. Since this novella first appeared in Harper's some years back and then was the prologue in Underworld, this makes the third time it's appeared in print. And while it is brilliant, why buy this when you can buy Underworld for about the same price?"},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"One can't help but wonder why so obviously skimpy a &quot;book&quot; should warrant release, especially considering that this only a slightly altered piece that appears in a longer work--and this after last year's short and disappointing &quot;Body Artist&quot;. Pafko calls itself a novella, but it isn't really; if one takes into consideration the font, margins and amount of pages, what the reader receives isactually a long short story, costing sixteen dollars. Why weren't both &quot;novellas&quot; released together, along with the several other uncollected short works written by Delillo over the past decade? Contractual obligation, perhaps, or possibly worse: simple greed. Although an impressive piece,it needs to be pointed out that Pafko is emblematic of a disturbing trend in the publishing business: the release of lilliputian books with gargantuan price tags. And please, let's not get into a quality and quantity debate; however you view it, this is just WRONG. Check this out of the library, unless you simply enjoy wasting money."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"although don delillo is one of my favorite writers i didn't like underworld and this new release of the first chapter of that pretentious novel is part of the reason why. the only reason to release this chapter in book form is to squeeze more profit from what was clearly a novel written to be a best seller. underworld was a fat, diffuse, complacent and superficial book; the chapter on bobby thompson's homerun never closed with the moment, never really overcame the fact that we all know what's going to happen next and how famous those people are, never got over its own hype. by contrast note the body artist which is intensely focussed, dense with meaning, utterly honest. real delillo."},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"I never got the book so how would I know. Needed it for a college class and ended up having to buy underworld at a different store. Thanks for nothing!"},{"Title":"Pafko at The Wall","review":"I do not like baseball so this was boring and it was very hard for me to stay interested to read it."},{"Title":"Blessed: I'm so damn grateful","review":"Once in a blue moon, along comes a book that is made extraordinary by the teller of the tale. Written by 94-year-old Raymond M. Saunders, (now 95), BLESSED, I'M SO DAMNED GRATEFUL, is a book every household should have. What better way to experience a century of history than through the eyes of one of its sons. Saunders shares the beauty of life lived simply, with purpose, and with foresight. Above all, his tale is one that proves the beauty of the celebration of family in its most honest form.Saunders doesn't tiptoe around sensitive issues such as the murder suicide committed by his great grandparents which left a family of six orphans behind. Nor does he wax eloquent on the subsequent rise and success of his grandfather in the cattle business in Iowa. Rather, he has written a story penned for his family that begs to be shared in a larger audience.Throughout the reading of BLESSED, I experienced something that doesn't often happen - that is of \\"hearing\\" the author speak. Throughout each page, each era, each memory, running through my inner mind was the voice of a man who has lived life to the fullest and recognized the lessons we are meant to learn.Saunders decided to write some memories for his family when his eyesight began to fail in the early 1990's, and he introduces each chapter with a vignette into his day on the Iowa farm he still lives on today and grew up on for 95 years. Then, prompted by a memory, he begins a journey into the past that is rich with description.Especially noteworthy is Saunders' honesty with human foibles. Accepting them, recognizing them, and working through them. The world as a whole can learn from this unique historical memoir that documents the wide and varied changes in technology, family values and world events over the past 95 years and more.A unique portion of this special book is the numerous, well-preserved documents and photographs that illustrate the different events Saunders portrays in his written legacy.If only all generations had such an engaging, forthright historian willing to share the history of our immigrant families I believe our country would find deeper value and meaning in our every day lives and recognize the importance of living life.My only regret is not being able to meet in person Raymond Saunders. I would willingly sit at his feet for hours and listen to whatever tale he cared to share. A natural storyteller, Saunders has blessed America with this story, and I'm more than grateful to have had the honor to become engrossed in history made alive through the voice of an Iowa farmer.Interview with Raymond M. Saunders and Craig M. Saunders, co-authors of Blessed, I'm So Damned Grateful is online at the Hands for Hope Website under Book Reviews."},{"Title":"Blessed: I'm so damn grateful","review":"Author, 94 year-old Raymond M. Saunders, is not just a man, but a piece of American history. You cannot truly understand that statement until you have feasted on his life's story and that of seven generations before in his newly released book, \\"Blessed, I'm So Damned Grateful.\\"As we begin the journey we are told of his great-grandparents immigration from England to America and the terrible violent murder suicide that occurred leaving six orphaned children. He then begins to share the different events and encounters with some well known figures in history that family members had, their journey in America, and how it shaped the future of his family.We travel along to our author's life, share with him his hopes and dreams as a child, a young man and an adult, watching not just his life unfold, but also that of America.We rejoice in his victories, cheer him on in his battles through his lives journey, and sigh at the struggling growth of our wonderful country, as we are reminded of the great depression, several wars and the many growing pains she encounters. The pictures and personal family records that are included in the work add a very nice touch and help to bring the experience of the read to a more personal level. Good job.Mr. Saunders is open and frank in his recollection of his lives memories. No life is free from pain, challenges or sorrows, yet the author has taken the very essence of what living is all about and conveyed it to this work. It isn't how big a house you live in, or the model of the car you drive; it is the sharing of friends, family and God. There are many threads that make up the fiber of a man, and through his writing one realizes they have the choice of what threads they will allow to make up their fiber and to mold their character.Blessed: I'm So Damned Grateful, is more than a book of someone's memoirs; it is a book on living' a book on being thankful for the very gift of life; a families journey that continues on. Enjoy and be reminded what really is important.Shirley Johnson/Senior ReviewerMidWest Book Review"},{"Title":"Technology in World Civilization: A Thousand-Year History","review":"Pacey's thesis is that technology spreads through dialogue between cultures. There are three different types of technological diffusion: when one culture simply gives another culture a technology, when one culture gives another the basic idea and the latter improves upon it, and when technology is imposed upon another culture. A good example of the first type of diffusion is when the Chinese empire came into contact with the Europeans they exchanged goods as well as information that lead to the use of gunpowder and looms in Europe. The second; when the Turks taught the Europeans how to make guns and the Europeans developed an even more powerful cannon that made it back to the Turks. And finally, the plantation farming techniques were imposed on the Africans during the colonial era, even when they thoroughly depleted the soil and required fertilizer and pesticides. The AP World History theme best reflected in Technology in World Civilization is the impact of technology and demography on people and the environment. There are hundreds of examples of this theme in Technology in World Civilization so I will list the three best ones. When the gun was invented after the Chinese spread the word about gunpowder, \`gunpowder empires' began to form. The Ottoman Empire is the best example as it was built around the gun. The Ottoman Army was one of the first to fully embrace the firearm into its tactics and even trained special units called Janissaries that were trained from an early age in the ways of firearms. Another critical invention was the printing press in China. The Chinese had an incredible hunger for books and loved to read and learn. The printing press allowed the book to be accessed by many more people than ever before. The final invention that changed life more than anything else was the steam engine. At first only used to pump water out of coalmines because of its incredible inefficiency, it evolved into the force that powered factories, trains, and blast furnaces. Not only did the steam engine make it possible to produce textiles hundreds of times faster than before it united the world. Within 100 years since the popularization of the steam locomotive, tens of thousands of miles of track had been laid and nearly the entire world was accessible by rail. Pacey's thesis seems very sound based on everything he's written in Technology in World Civilization, which makes sense since he wrote the book to defend his thesis. Not having read any other books about the subject matter, I'm not the best person to attack or defend his thesis, but I will choose to defend it because I see no other logical way technology could be transferred. It could be possible that technology was brought over by middlemen who bought and sold information, however it seems that that is a relatively new concept and it didn't occur the pre-modern peoples that information is worth money. The cause and effect examples that support Pacey's thesis are very clear. If one civilization never imposed technology upon another than there wouldn't have been plantations in Africa and the indigenous peoples would still be \`multistory farming'. If technology never spread through dialogue, than the Turks would be ruling the world with their superior weaponry that no nation could come close to. Pacey also has a wide variety of examples from all different cultures and eras that support his thesis. In order to prove technology is spread through dialogue, he starts by using the spread of the loom and gunpowder as examples and then moves through history all the way through the train and how it quickly spread through the entire world. Pacey's sources are very varied and never contradict each other. All the books listed in the bibliography are for specific sources and he consulted a separate book for every area of specific interest as well as several more general sources including two of his previous books. He documented every source perfectly and had a wide cross section of author nationalities as well and publishers guaranteeing that his information couldn't be biased. He also had many illustrations and a few sources that were originally from the time period or based on originals. There are few periods in time were it is excruciatingly difficult to find works of the period and many historians write books to fill in the gaps, which are referenced in Technology in World Civilization. In conclusion, Technology in World Civilization is a good read a well as a very informative book on the spread of technology. The only thing it lacked was the pre-historical spread of technology, which I hoped to learn more about. Pacey's thesis is very sound and he provide plenty of evidence to back it up as well as many maps, tables, and drawings. Every fact is documented and he has an impressive list of sources on his bibliography, from the most obscure Studies in Primitive Looms to the very broad Printing and Paper Pacey covered every subject in his book with the utmost detail. Technology in World Civilization delivers not only a lesson in World History, but also an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Technology in World Civilization: A Thousand-Year History","review":"Arnold Pacey has written a fine examination of the development of technology throughout the world. He does not limit himself to one area of the world ( a common failing of many Eurocentrists), nor does he go overboard in praising the accomplishments of one area at the expense of others ( something many Asiaphiles tend to do).Pacey concentrates on the last thousand years or so. He covers the numerous accomplishments of Asia and highlights the important role played by the Mongols in linking the world. He also spends some fascinating time in the Americas, which tend to get short shrift from many historians, and draws some interesting parallels between the various &quot;gunpowder empires&quot; and industrial movements. The writing is clear and always interesting, with many nice drawings and diagrams."},{"Title":"Technology in World Civilization: A Thousand-Year History","review":"The book is wonderful and has technology broken down into time periods. It starts with Asian technology 700CE-1100CE, Mongols, ands it ends with the 20th century. It is illustrated for nearly every invention. The illustrations show the invention as it is used in a society. You see people in costume as well as the invention. It is certainly a disussion starter. It is a must for every AP World History teacher as well as the casual historian"},{"Title":"Technology in World Civilization: A Thousand-Year History","review":"This book is one of those books that takes time to seep in. It is very well and formally written. Very advanced thinking involved. The thing about this book is that it is more about technological dialogue and interaction more than the actual technology. That is why it is so great for AP World History classes. I found that the book can make you just want to skim over and not read the whole thing because it is just compact and concrete so it is hard to take in alot at one time. The book should be read slowly and having an open mind. The information in the book is just great, it goes over the more important ways societies rose and fell. Very helpful for people taking classes or just wanting to know where technology developed from."},{"Title":"Technology in World Civilization: A Thousand-Year History","review":"This book is full of information relating to old technology. I would recomend it, for any one studing Engerineering. I also feel it is relevant to anyone learning about history."},{"Title":"Technology in World Civilization: A Thousand-Year History","review":"I had a choice to read one out of five books for my AP World History Class and I thought I made a pretty good choice. When I saw what books my friends chose, I was very happy I chose this book. Technology in World Civilization does not use complex vocabulary- so I found it easier to follow. It isn't that long- 250 pages. It also has a interesting drawings (they take up pages!). However, this book is very hard to write an essay on because it is pretty much just facts. Overall, it is a good book to choose for an AP World History class, but would not recommend for \\"fun\\"."},{"Title":"Technology in World Civilization: A Thousand-Year History","review":"The book's a great resource if you're a Marco Polo fan BUT..Doesn't he know that the Industrial Revolution was caused by the POTATO PLANT which was cultivated by the Aymara Indians in present-day Peru?The potato plant allowed European wheat-grinding mills to be converted to textile mills and a mere 300 years later, Europe had nuclear reactors.The Ancient Greeks had the steam engine! Heron of Alexandria called his invention an &quot;aeolopile&quot;. But Pacey didn't explain why Ancient Greece had no Industrial Revolution.Pacey is a physicist. Maybe he knows if the Ancient Greeks had an Industrial Revolution in some Parallel Universe."},{"Title":"World Cup Soccer","review":"I was really hyped to finally get my hands on this book reading alot of good stuff about Michael Lewis. Finally i got this book June 13th 2006. Full of useless info about all other world cups, highlited page numbers and words BBC and Reuters, only black and white pictures and outdated team rosters, out which you can only see black and white pictures of USA team. On top of that you get the worst possible designed cover for something as big as a WC i have ever seen. I'm in shock Mr. Michael Lewis. How can someone who've been to 6 world cup's and insist in his book how big this event still is for him can produce something as outdated and useless. Book released in june of 2006 so why do you have 2004 rosters in your book? I can give at least 5!! examples of players that are not even in their national team. This book is a bad story about previous cups and gives you no information on what is happening right now in Germany. Every team rosters is outdated 1-2 years at least!!! Get Guide to World Cup 2006 instead, it's full of color, much more recent info and not as boring as this marvel of soccer journalism. I guess americans just can't kick."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"This annual is a good example of how pretentious, self important design of a book can ruin it. Otherwise (probably) terrific examples of the latest in American design are reduced to irresponsible unreadable game of the apparently self-important book designer (J. Sterling?) who thinks that her design is more important than the actual pieces selected for this prestigious contest. A complete parody of the functionality of graphic design. 4 stars for the work itself, 1 star for the interior editorial design. Sorry spectacle AIGA."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"The previous reviewer is right on the mark. The book designer intruded into the pieces that are supposed to be the highlight of the book, it took me a few page turns to realize that the grids on top of the full page images were in fact not a part of the pieces on display. What bothers me most about this book is the pretentiousness of the books editors/judges in making this the book that will forever divide the web designers from the print designers. This book is being used by the print firms to suck projects back into their court by putting a &quot;manifesto&quot; of sorts in the back explaining why there are no website projects profiled. They really show their colors by saying websites are poorly designed because the designers are not a big part of the process anymore. What a great way to convince clients that will be looking at this that they need go with a &quot;print firm&quot;. They also say that the web suffers from the Jakob Nielson usability first, design last effect. I suggest that other designers (i work in print and the web) follow my lead and burn your AIGA membership cards and forget about collaboration. It seems that the judges do not like working on an even playing field with developers and site arhitects (I would like to see Michael Beirut design global flash narratives across a 6000 page intranet)... hopefully this book will have little effect on our community."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"To show your design skills is not what design is meant for when you have over a hundred other designers whose work you are trying to showcase. I really felt that the pieces that were shown in this book where destroyed by cutting them up into different sections and not showing the whole. How could you get a sense of the pieces as they are not shown in their entirety? Many of the pieces I have seen in other publications so I know this is the case. I love what they chose to be included and agree with them on their beauty, but how can you not show the whole work? Would you show four different pieces of a Ray and Charles Eames piece of furniture, part of a Frank Gehrey building or a little of one of Phillip Starck's industrial designs? No, people would be upset....and that is my point. This isn't the designer of the books work but a collection of other peoples work . If the book was a Photonica catalog (which it strongly resembles) then I would say great job! This is just another designer (whose work I love) stepping on other peoples toes...sorry."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"Very dissapointing book overall. Although creative, it doesn't do what is suppose to do -- communicate. It shows off the the designer's trendy style, but does no justice to all the winning participants. If my work were shown in this book in little distorted details, I would have asked for my money back."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"How you'd rate this depends on whether you're rating it as an object or on it's content. What was AIGA's purpose here? I thought it was to showcase the award winning work within not just Jennifer Sterling's work. I left this book on the shelf at my local bookstore.There are plenty of books on the market sold as objects. I don't see the purpose of disrespecting other peoples work to create an object in what is supposed to be a showcase to honour what they have done.I like Jennifer Sterling design work but if she wants to sample other peoples work she should record a hip hop album next time. And why did AIGA approve this?"},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"I've never had such a violent reaction to a book before. They call this a book yet it bears little resemblance to me. They show samples of great design by showing several photos all cropped differently. Not one showing the full page. Then there is the text, sometimes repeated 3 times on a page adding to the visual confusion the rest of the design creates.I couldn't get through the whole book, I returned my copy."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"The book itself looks wonderful, with a nice, strong design on all of the pages. The sad part is this design comes at a price, and that price is the content it's trying to display is completely truncated, and ineffectual. As far as inspiration books go, this is definitely one of the worst books I've purchased. You can tell that there are some real gems located within, but the sad part is you only see the top corner, or little snippets. Maybe next time AIGA should focus on letting us see why the winners are in the book, instead of trying to make an artsty statement in and of itself."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"Although the text is insightful and the layout is creative, it does a poor job displaying the work of those who were talented enough to be included in the book. How dissapointing it must be to people who paid entry fees only to have small sections of their award winning work shown. This book layout was all form, no function and self indulgent on the designer's part. Plus the cover curves up."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"This book is a good example of where art and design go their separate ways. It's a beautiful book, clearly put together by a very creative individual. But it's &quot;designed&quot; very poorly, it doesn't serve it's function. It's hard to read, you can't see the pieces it's supposed to highlight, and the binding breaks very easily because of the chosen materials. Again, they look great, but they don't do their job. Design that's honored by the AIGA should live up to higher standards in my opinion."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"Sterling miss 2 stars for the cropping, its true that I can't see what the winners' works look like.But the cropping itself makes the content more interesting.Think different, .. its amazing that I enjoy reading this book more than any other AIGA publications. I don't get any inspirations from the works. I do get more how Sterling thinks.."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"The book itself is stunning. Plastic covers with heavy binding, on heavyweight non-glossy paper. Over 400 pages of sampled work and lots of copy to support each piece.The layout is experimental, and most of the time exquisite.The work, as found in other reviews, seems less relavant than the layout of the book itself. It is difficult to tell which &quot;version&quot; of the artwork is the original. It is hard to figure out where the editors added their own cropping to a piece of work, or whether it really appeared that way.Overall, the edition commands respect, but I believe that the work was compromised, and it is difficult to know if i'll refer back to this volume as much as I do other annuals and such for inspiration and knowledge."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"OK, OK, it's true... everything they said is true... Sterling crops the living heck out of everyone's work... but the presentation as design is beautiful... Honestly, if people are that dissapointed because of this, I think they are being petty. This book is gorgeous, and with 500 pages, you are bound to find something that inspires you... I love this book, but feel the cropping issue only deducts one star, NOT 4! That's not being generous... this book is worth it IMO. Blows away every other AIGA book without question. Who wants boring presentation anyway? Stick with Typography 24 if you want boring. This is for fans of ATTIK and TOLLESON, and of course Sterling."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"I saw this book while visiting a friend in the U.S. It is truely beautiful.

But unlike previous years, 365 provides the insightful details that have previously been missing. For instance, was it the great illustration or the striking photograph that helped get a piece selected. 365 takes these things into consideration, rather than just showing a cover and one spread. I also like 365's index, which resembles the navigation of a website. The bottom line is this book is extraordinary."},{"Title":"365: AIGA Year in Design 21","review":"If you can only buy one design coffee-table book this year, because, like me, you're feeling the pinch of a deflated economy, then buy this book.

The field is inviting: politics, perhaps one of the great venues for projection, begs psychological insight. It's obviously extraordinarily difficult to produce the kind of insight which does justice to the field. This book's problem is not its prose, which is o.k.

Today it is still a big paper, but nothing like it was.This book is the personal recollection of seven of the editors that made Woman's Wear what it was. They held verious positions on the paper and tell the stories with wit and a tenderness about the paper they obviously loved.

There are spoilers ahead.There is really no precedent for Joss Whedon's continuation of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER in comic book form. If Gene Roddenberry had continued Season Four of the original STAR TREK after it was cancelled by writing a series of comics it would have been the equivalent. But I'm not aware of any creator of a franchise of the level of BUFFY continuing it in a different medium excluding movies and television. While I would vastly prefer Joss Whedon focus his efforts on producing a new television series, I'll take new stories from him in any form I can get them. And that is what Joss truly is: a storyteller. But more importantly he understands something that most other storyteller don't quite grasp: it is less what happens in stories than how what happens affects the central characters. BUFFY was never really about killing vampires; it was about how killing vampires and fighting demons changed the ones doing the killing and fighting.Another thing that Joss Whedon has always excelled at was not giving the fan what they were expecting. I've never encountered a storyteller who so persistently managed to surprise. Whedon resorts to clich&eacute;s less than almost any other narrative artist I know and the start of the new BUFFY series is no exception. About the only thing that we knew about Buffy Summer following the destruction of Sunnydale was that she was living in Rome and dating some guy known as The Immortal. But here at the very beginning of this issue we learn that the Buffy in Rome wasn't our Buffy at all, but a decoy. So much for what we knew about Buffy! In fact, she is in Scotland and she is homesick, lonely, and sad. And everyone calls her ma'am.With her in Scotland are only two of the Scoobies: Xander and her sister Dawn, who has grown too big for a britches. In fact, she has grown larger for anyone's britches, thanks to dating the wrong guy who caused her to grow to the size of Paul Bunyan, if not larger. Until Willow returns from wherever she is (we aren't told where), Dawn will remain a giantess.Meanwhile Buffy has discovered some guys who have carved odd symbols into their chests and summoned demons. More about this in the future to be sure. And the military considers Buffy's new slayers to be terrorists and have struck a deal with an old friend to take her down, none other than Amy.Anyone wanting to follow this story -- and any fan of the TV series definitely will -- I would strongly recommend early preordering of these books. They have been selling out at a record pace and both of the first two issues have already had to be reprinted. It is clear that this is going to be one of the best selling series of comics in the history of the genre. Be part of it."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #1: The Long Way Home Part One (Dark Horse Comics)","review":"*Possible spoilers within.*I wonder if Joss Whedon originally had more story to tell after the end of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" or if he simply came up with more recently. As \\"Buffy\\" ended where he'd supposedly originally intended it to, but \\"Angel\\" was cancelled when Whedon expressedy stated that he had more story to tell, I would have expected him to continue \\"Angel\\" rather than \\"Buffy\\". (I still wish he would do so, and he has recently said that he's considering it.) However, I'll gobble up anything by Mr. Whedon, especially if it has something to do with the Buffyverse. And so when the first issue of the Season Eight comics was released, I devoured it. It's a tasty morsel indeed.This season takes place a while after the epic finale of the TV show. The U.S. government, investigating the annihilation of Sunnydale, is now pursuing Buffy Summers, whom they consider to be a dangerous terrorist. Buffy herself is leading the thousands of Slayers currently in Europe in small groups, while the patched Xander Harris guides her from their base in Scotland. Obviously this is no small operation - in fact, it's huge.Speaking of huge, Dawn Summers has recently lost her virginity to a \\"thricewise\\" - the result being Dawn's sudden growth spurt, from about five feet to about fifty feet. She's huge, unhappy, and currently housed in a warehouse where her tiny sister tries to sort things out with her. Buffy knows all about the repercussions of your \\"first time\\", but Dawn is waiting for Willow's return to vent. (\\"And anyhow Willow's the expert on boys since when now?\\" Buffy muses.)In Part I of the season premiere, titled \\"The Long Way Home,\\" Buffy battles a group of large, nasty beasts whose most recent victims appear to be members of a cult. (Expect a follow-up on that in future issues.) Meanwhile, in Sunnydale, government workers have unearthed someone from Buffy's past with a hankerin' for some vengeance. And cheese.If the first issue is any indication, Season Eight of \\"Buffy\\" is gonna rock. Truly, this is going to be an absolute delight for any and all fans. Whedon's writing is as witty, creative, and shocking as ever, alluding to previous events and baddies like he so loves to do (and we love him to do) as well as the revelation from Season Five of \\"Angel\\" in which we learn that Buffy is currently dating some jerk called \\"the Immortal.\\" Nope - that was one of three decoy Buffys used to throw enemies off her trail. As for the actual look of the comic, George Jeanty's artwork is excellent. Already he has the look of the characters down pat.I was worried about how well \\"Buffy\\" would work as a comic as opposed to a TV show. I needn't have worried. \\"Buffy\\" works, and it works well. It's a blast to see the characters back, OFFICIALLY, and from Whedon's own hands at that. (In future issues, other writers from the series will be scripting the issues as well!) By all means, don't just go out and buy these, because they're selling like mad. Pre-order them well ahead of time so you can get your hands on some simply sumptuous \\"Buffy\\" action.Buffy's back, and she's just as awesome as ever."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #1: The Long Way Home Part One (Dark Horse Comics)","review":"I was one of the million fans who lamented the end of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" back in May 2003. After a seven-season run, we all bid farewell to one of the most truly imaginative series of the past decades. The series finale was really spectacular on its own and I felt that it left you satisfied while still wanting more.Over the past couple of years, there has been possibilities of TV movies, big screen films, and even a Buffy Cartoon! Joss Whedon finally gives his faithful fans the continuation of \\"Buffy\\" that they had always hoped for, albeit in a medium many weren't expecting: comic.At first, I was a bit apprehensive about this announcement. Admittedly, I've never been a frequent reader of comics and I wasn't sure how the show would make the transition. I'd always felt that one of the main strengths was its brilliant acting and I wasn't sure how much I'd enjoy a Buffy story without Sarah Michelle Gellar or Alyson Hannigan bringing it to life.All my apprehensions were relieved once I ordered the comic online. I just had to give it a chance, especially being that it's written by none other than Joss Whedon (or as Buffy aficionados refer to as \\"GOD\\"). What initially pops out about the comic is the breathtaking cover, illustrated by Jo Chen. Whedon has said that he wants to keep her around for the covers as long as possibly. Let's hope Chen sticks around. The rest of the illustrations in the comic (done by Georges Jeanty, Andy Owens, Dave Stewart & Richard Starkings) are beautiful as well. The images just jump out at you and are truly epic in scope.Now, what about the most important aspect of the comic...the writing! To sum it up in just one word is difficult. Whedon alleviates my previous worry that I wouldn't be able to connect with the dialog without actors because he writes them so well and so true to who we came to love on the series that you can just hear Gellar saying it as if you were watching it on screen. One unique thing about this comic that we don't get in the series are private thoughts from Buffy's head. This provides some great insight and touching moments.This comic exceeded my expectations and I cannot wait until the next issue. Whedon says \\"season eight\\" will go about 30 issues, or even more! With a new issue coming out every month, this means all us Buffy fans will be entertained for the next years to come!!"},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #1: The Long Way Home Part One (Dark Horse Comics)","review":"Here, at last, is the canon continuation of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" as written by Joss Whedon.Joss Whedon, creator of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and the author of this comic, said it best--he wants readers to see this comic as, not a full episode of Buffy, but the teaser of an episode. The book--as a rule with comics--goes very fast. While this issue has two more pages than the norm (a total of 24, not counting ads), it is over before you even realize it. But there is a lot of goodness to take in; new information and characters, mingling with old loved characters and references to past episodes.The plot is simple, but promises a lot. Not to mention, it's classic Joss. Buffy and Xander are leading a \\"24\\"-esque base. Buffy is the \\"Jack Bauer\\" to Xander's \\"Bill Buchanon.\\" While on a field mission to kill a few baddies, Buffy and a small group of slayers find a dead body with a strange symbol carved into it. Xander and Buffy hit the books, researching like old times. Meanwhile, it is revealed that the US Government has noticed the slayers and, following the destruction of the Sunnydale Hellmouth, sees them as terrorist cells--and they enlist the help of a character from the TV series (don't worry, no spoilers) to defeat Buffy. After it is revealed who this character is, an even bigger bad is alluded to. Suspense is a-plenty!The only plot-line that made me iffy is Dawn's problem in this book. I won't reveal it, but I'll say this; it's a bit hard to swallow. Yet, knowing Joss, he'll make me bite my tongue in the next few issues and sell me the plot... as he always tends to do.Season Eight kicks off with a bang and I, for one, can't wait for the next issue. I do have to say though, it isn't the best place to start with Buffy. If you weren't a fan of the show but want to try the comic, I suggest you read up on what has happened so far. Wikipedia has an exceptional page devoted to Buffy.9/10"},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #1: The Long Way Home Part One (Dark Horse Comics)","review":"I really miss the Buffy t.v. show, so I decided to read the comic.

After reading this first volume I'm left wanting more, but not quite as satisfied as I had hoped. Comics are okay, but seeing this on tv is so much better. If this had to be written I think I would have preferred a regular book instead of a comic book. All in all I think the first comic is just okay, but I still look forward to reading volume 2."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #1: The Long Way Home Part One (Dark Horse Comics)","review":"Let joy be undiminished. Joss Whedon is scripting the new Dark Horse comic book \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8.\\" After having to make due with all of those post-\\"BtVS\\" novels that exist outside the canon, Joss himself will reveal to us what happened in what would have been the next season of our favorite television series. With Marvel doing an adaptation of the first Anita Blake Vampire Hunter novel, \\"Guilty Pleasures,\\" and Whedon scripting first \\"Astonishing X-Men\\" and now \\"Runaways\\" for Marvel, the stars had clearly aligned and given a choice between an animated \\"BtVS\\" that goes back to the high school years but with Dawn running around the way everybody retroactively thinks she is because of all that mystical stuff and a comic book about Season Eight, I vote for the latter. That would explain why as soon as I read the announcement regarding this comic book I turned around to the clerk at my comic book store and told him to put me down for three copies of each issue. No, I am not salting away copies in mint condition: one copy is for me and the others are for my daughters. This is how I score parental points.We begin \\"in media res,\\" which is to say that we do not begin \\"Season Eight\\" right after the final scene of the series finale with Buffy and the Scoobies standing at the precipise of the giant hole in the ground that used to be Sunnydale. After all, we do have some specific references to Buffy and the gang during the fifth season of \\"Angel,\\" although Whedon is already engaging in revisionist interpretation (the Buffy partying very publicly in Rome \\"and supposedly dating some guy called 'The Immortal'\\" turns out to be a Slayer set up as a decoy when it became clear Buffy was a target). It has been a long time (technically the end of Season 1) since there has been only \\"One girl, in all the world, a Chosen One\\" yadda yadda yadda. Now there are eighteen hundred, with five hundred of them working with Buffy in ten separate squads.The key thing to remember when you read through issue #1 of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight\\" is that is Part I of a story entitled \\"The Long Way Home.\\" Consequently, this 24-page comic book does not exactly translate into the equivalent of one episode of the \\"BtVS\\" television show. My inclination is to assume that what we will end up with here will be more like a television movie than an individual episode or mini-series. Both of the first two issues end with the surprise reveal of a familiar character and these could just as easily be the equivalents of the fade to black at the end of an act of a television drama as it could be the cliffhanger at the end of the entire episode. We shall see. But be forewarned that not everybody from the cast of Season Seven shows up in this first issue. Remember, Anya is dead and Spike has an excused absence since he is still busy with Season Five of \\"Angel\\" (at least that is my short term assumption).The vampires in this world might be gone (all of the soulless ones, anyway), but there are still demons and Buffy is still fighting the good fight. Buffy has a new Watcher (well, she thinks she does anyway) as a result of one of Whedon's patented character upgrades and all I can say about Dawn is that she certainly has grown up. But the big development is that the U.S. government has noticed that giant pit where Sunnydale used to be. What Buffy calls \\"squads\\" the military thinks of as \\"cells\\" (as in \\"terrorist cells\\"), and what they see is an army with power, resources, a \\"charismatic, uncompromising, and completely destructive\\" leader and \\"a hard-line ideology that does not jibe with American interests.\\" No wonder Buffy is in Scotland.Issue #1 is scripted by Whedon, with pencils by Georges Jeanty (Marvel's \\"Weapon X\\"), Inks by Andy Owens (\\"Fray\\"), colors by Dave Stewart, and letters by Richard Starkings & Comicraft's Jimmy, along with a cover paint of Buffy by Jo Chen. It is great to have a \\"BtVS\\" comic book written by Joss Whedon, but we really have no idea as to what constitutes a great \\"BtVS\\" comic book written by Joss Whedon. Like I said above, this story is labeled \\"Part I\\" for a reason and what is important here is that as we move from the anticipation of getting to hold this comic book in our hands to actually reading it we are now salivating over what Joss and company are setting up. One of the tragedies of the cancellation of \\"Firefly\\" was that we were just getting to point where Joss was upping the ante and moving into the second-half of the season story arc as River started to display her fighting skills. I have no doubt that Whedon will be able to get to the end of the road this time around. Final Note: If reading one issue a month strikes you as being as bad as watching one new episode of \\"BtVS\\" a month, you could wait until the inevitable trade paperback is produced collecting all of the issues of \\"The Long Way Home.\\" But that probably means waiting until early next year. You were warned."},{"Title":"Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 8 #1: The Long Way Home Part One (Dark Horse Comics)","review":"This was a wonderful comic!

Gun? What happened to the prohibition against slayers using firepower? Oh well she was always on her own trip anyway and answerable only to her late mother, sometimes. Whedon must have made a deal with actress Sarah Michelle Gellar, for it's her face, at least the best stab illustrator Georges Jeanty can give at it. Wonder if SMG is feeling a little, I don't know, overexposed right now? Maybe that's part of the joke about there being three doubles for Buffy, one in Rome dating the Immortal, one to come in \\"The Chain\\" I guess, and the other working as a decoy drawing vampire fire with her looks and general Buffy demeanor. And a fourth in Hollywood still trying for that acting career in such bombs as THE GRUDGE and SOUTHLAND TALES--the way Cordelia started out on ANGEL, a hasbeen before she really gets started!Anyway, Xander is directing operations and has a lovely, shy second in command, Renee, who's halfway in love with him and don't think he don't know it! What a switch from the old days when Xander still had two eyes and his virginity.The main Big Bad this season is going to be some kind of military industrial thing trying to rally the American public around the concept of the Slayers as \\"terrorists.\\" Tall order but, to his credit, Joss is making this development more or less thinkable. They have that huge crater that used to be Sunnydale as evidence of nuclear-like power manifested by Buffy . . .

Every character looks like they are 13. Buffy should at least be in her mid twenties.The plot is pretty simple stuff. Buffy is the leader of a teen group of slayers who fight vampires in the future. Dawn is attending Berkeley and has a really BIG problem. Willow wasn't in this issue. Xander is Buffy's manager.

Read this book. Follow its directives.It may take a while to digest the very dense information contained in this book, but for the serious student of organizational effectiveness, it is worth it. Very terse and prescriptive in his style, Jaques' writing may disenchant some. Yet the wisdom in this, his flagship tome, is immense. It took a while to sink in, and I found that reading several of his other books helped clarify the concepts for me. See for example: Executive Leadership, Social Power and the CEO, Human Capability, and Levels of Abstraction in Logic and Human Action. Requisite Organization, however, is the book to which I return for reference and details; it covers all the important concepts in a single volume. [The other books add detail and emphasize various points, so they have particular value too.] Organizational Design by Rowbottom and Billis helped me too, as did the excellent work by both Mark Van Clieaf at MVC Associates and Gillian Stamp at BIOSS.I didn't, at first, fully understand the importance of the information contained in this book, or the solid research foundation that underlies it. A little known fact is that the concepts included in this book provide the foundation for leadership development, talent management, and compensation processes of organizations such as GE and the US Army. Many other authors and consulting organizations touting talent management, leadership pipelines, succession planning and the like derive their approaches directly or indirectly from Jaques - an interesting story in itself. Most give him little or no credit, though Colin Powell, as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, honored Jaques with the Joint Staff Certificate of Appreciation for \\"outstanding contributions in the field of military leadership theory and instruction to all of the service departments of the United States\\". And the American Psychological Association honored him with the Harry Levinson Award of the Consulting Psychology Division for \\"a distinguished career and impressive accomplishments.\\"After reading Jaques, all the others seem derivative, shallow, trite, and somewhat off-target. Granted, other authors have something of value to say about organizational structuring, accountability, strategic planning, leadership, selection, mentoring, coaching, compensation, managerial practices, functional alignment, measurement, and the like. But while all the rest are shooting in the dark, Jaques hits center target!"},{"Title":"Requisite Organization: A Total System for Effective Managerial Organization and Managerial Leadership for the 21st Century","review":"The Requisite Organization is a text explaining how to organize and properly staff a beaurocracy for maximum effectiveness. Sounds painful and dull, but perhaps beaurocrats get such a bad rap because they are operating ineffectively.Stratified Systems Theory is a hard-core scientificaly derived theory on who has the adequate personal capabilities to be a manager. The key concept is that leaders should be given responsibility based on their ability to think about long term complex problems. All other management competencies (emotional intelligence and other soft skills included) are secondary to this ability. It's a hard concept to handle, but backed with sufficient data.Many secondary implications are discussed too. How should one promote individual contributors? What's the effective span of control a manager can have? How does one handle organizational conflict? Should one override a subordinate in a staffing decision? All these questions are relevant to today's manager, and it is good to have a theoretical foundation to think about these questions.There's two downsides to the book. First, whenever there's a book stating, \\"The whole world is wrong and headed to hell in a bucket!\\" I tend to greet it with skepticism. Secondly, although Jaques has a tremendous amount of impirical work supporting his positions, it is not clear if the ability to think long term is the driving factor of personal performance in todays world of shifting organizations and personal loyalties.Even if you disagree with half of what Jaques says, the originality, insight and rigor put into such a soft field makes it well worth the read."},{"Title":"Requisite Organization: A Total System for Effective Managerial Organization and Managerial Leadership for the 21st Century","review":"Elliott Jaques devised a system for analyzing executive ability based upon an individual's time horizon--the maximum period of time in the future toward which his/her work activities were aimed in their performance. He reached this conclusion during extensive, longitudinal, empirical studies in England (see \\"The Changing Culture of a Factory\\" for example). His series of books reflect his elaboration and extension of this finding. He worked, for a time, with Dr. Owen Jacobs of the U.S. Army (and then the Industrial College of the Armed Forces, ICAF). Jaques groundbreaking book, \\"Requisite Organization\\" is more pictorial than \\"Executive Leadership\\" which followed it or the later \\"Human Capability\\". While the present work may be oriented more towards organizational structure, it is useful to practicing executives. True, it may present an ideal which cannot, at present, be achieved, but as the Cheshire Cat said to Alice, if you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there. I wish more bosses would read Jaques' works--and carefully at that. I bought and loaned some of them to my boss. This volume is rather pictorial: the charts provided are engaging and thought-provoking. The more extensive, \\"Executive Leadership\\" followed this book in sequence--it is a fine sequel..

It is full of old-fashioned management 1.0 thinking. Examples: The higher the manager the better his capabilities should be. Managers are the only ones qualified to do performance appraisals. Only managers should be allowed to hire people. Etc...My biggest problem with the book is that it claims to be based on science, which is nonsense. The insights from complexity science and systems thinking reveal totally different needs. For example, the author claims we need accurate definitions of terminology in business, just like in physics. But from science we know this to be impossible. The more complex the system the fuzzier the terminology will be. There's no way around that. Terminology in social systems is necessarily the fuzziest.I give the book 2 stars because there are a few quotes that I liked. For example, \\"We can agree to be creative and innovative.

The basic idea is to create hierarchies by function. The characteristic distinguishing layer from layer in a hierarchy is the span of time over which planning takes place. Work is accomplished by managing the flow of processes across functional area hierarchies.This all sounds great. Unfortunately, effectively managing cross-functional workflow in a requisite organization is extremely difficult and time-consuming. Since the attention of most people is on local optimization, and very few managers are up to the task of maintaining a global focus, functional-area hierarchies end up optimizing their local processes at the expense of global performance. Also, since this organization IS so enduring, it is extremely difficult to effect positive changes.There are some interesting ideas in this book. However, the ultimate product is usually going to be an organization that self-reinforces suboptimal behavior. If you want a self-perpetuating organization rife with finger-pointing, political in-fighting, and deadlocked workflow... implement a requisite organization.I you want a lean, mean organization in which ownership and accountability are tied directly to business goals and system throughput is emphasized... look elsewhere. Start with &quot;The Goal&quot;, &quot;It's Not Luck&quot;, or &quot;Critical Chain&quot; by Eliyahu Goldratt.

Viveca has endured the hardships of marriage to a drug abuser and her twin sons, Elijah and Elgin, have brought her grief with their scrapes with the law. Iralaun, a self-absorbed, baggage carrying college student is sleeping with her roommate's boyfriend and then meets the perfect guy. A juvenile court judge, Belinda is plagued with bad relationships and finds herself being used by her current man. She then meets a cop who wants her but is still clinging to hope of reconciliation with his wife.Viveca's life is drudgery; working odd hours as a nurse, cooking and caring for four children who are left unsupervised and plagued with memories of the pain and abused suffered from her ex-husband, Eddie. Her twins resent her for their father not being in their lives while their father is yet fighting his addictions. Viveca just cannot seem to get ahead to the point she has let herself go physically and mentally. She feels she has been let down by her marriage and by her church. Iralaun finds in Allen a man of character but does she deserve him? Her mother died without ever revealing the name of her father. Belinda is forced to reflect on her relationships while coming to grips with her disabled father's self-imposed isolation from his family. Eventually these characters are connected by fate and circumstances.My online book club eagerly anticipated reading this book as our March selection, believing that the same competition that gave an award to such a wonderful book as The Darkest Child would surely be worth reading. We however were sorely disappointed. First of all, the book was poorly edited. Numerous misspelled words, wrong synonym usage, wrong verb placement, and grammatical errors were throughout the text. This was distracting and interrupted the flow. Secondly, the comments from my book club members were that the characters were stilted, underdeveloped and we just did not feel anything for them. With the exception of the twins, we could care less. Additionally the sequence of events and the intertwining of the three stories seemed to be forced, as to prove the theory of six degrees of separation. I agonized over both giving this book a fair, critical review and rating it impartially, debating between giving it a 2 or 3 as my APOOO rating was a 2.5. Perhaps with better line and structure editing, this manuscript in revised form will be a better product.Dera WilliamsAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"From the first chapter to the epilouge I truly enjoyed reading this book.

Kia Dupree put her heart into every charecter and delivered a message that was outstanding. If you are looking for a book with a great story and captivating message, this book is for you. Excellent job Kia, keep writing, we need more authors like you putting out more than just another novel, you sent a message, posed a question and dared a change to come forth. I enjoyed the story and adore your work.Nikkea \\"Auset\\" LewisPssst Bookclub memberAuthor of Gold Diggin' and Reflections of a Womanhttp://ausetausarproductions.net"},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"To say Kia Dupree's debut novel is outstanding is truly an understatement! From the beginning to end, page to page, one will be left wanting more; checking their watch making sure they're not late for an appointment; twirling the bookmark in hand, desperately trying to find a place to appropriately put it because it's time to go to sleep, and IT CAN'T BE DONE! Ms. Dupree's book will have you hooked immediately. She did a miraculous job introducing the characters & developing the story. Furthermore, she effortlessly and seamlessly tied together all of the lives of these individual women. Not only did she really cause you to evaluate each woman's situation regarding the lack of a model father figure, she artistically created such vivid imagery that pulled on every emotion imaginable. For her first work, Ms. Dupree has truly diplayed her excellence in the art of writing."},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Dupree and buying this book from her. She is an extraordinary woman and an extraordinary writer. I was interested in the book from cover to cover - never getting the \\"how many more pages in this chapter\\" syndrome. The stories were intriguing and the characters refreshing.My only wish is that Ms. Dupree had a better editor. A good editor could really have made this book shine. There are some grammatical errors, and I really think a good editor could have made it perfect. She is so talented, and I can see the start of something great in her writing. I look forward to reading her next book!"},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"Kia Dupree's Robbing Peter shows the indomitable spirit of the black mother. We are all connected in some way, and Ms. Dupree brought that out in Robbing Peter. The characters were real and believable. I almost felt I knew them.

As the mothers work several jobs to maintain the household and raise the children, the fathers are nowhere to be found. There are some households where the fathers are physically there but not emotionally, mentally, spiritually or financially. ROBBING PETER by Kia Dupree delves into the lives of three women whose lives are very different, but who end up being connected as their city of Washington, DC is terrorized.Vivica Jeffries is a single mother of five children. Vivica married her high school sweetheart, Eddie at a very young age. They began having children right away and shortly thereafter, Eddie became addicted to crack. After being physically abused one too many times Vivica kicks Eddie out and is forced to raise her five children alone. She has a set of twins, Elgin and Elijah, Evan, Eric and Eve. With virtually no education Vivica struggles to go back to school, hold down a job and raise her children. In an effort to give her children the best, she ends up being away from home more than she is at home and in essence the kids are raising themselves. While Elgin and Elijah are terrorizing several communities in the DC area and bullying the younger kids at home, Vivica has her hands full.Belinda Maxwell, a family-court judge, is single and has no children. She is very successful in her career but unsuccessful in love. Belinda finds it hard to understand how her mother can wait on her father hand and foot when he refuses to do anything beyond his disability to care for himself. After an accident that caused him to become disabled and confined to a wheelchair he virtually has done nothing for himself, although he could if he wanted to. Belinda is finding herself being submissive and nurturing to the men she dates, and she begins to lose her sense of self. To complicate matters even more she gets involved with a married man. Belinda wonders if her father was more active after his accident would she be a different person towards the men she dates.Iralaun Fugere is a college student who has never known her father and doesn't even know his name. Growing up she was taught not to trust or fall in love with men, but to basically get what you can and be gone. This works well for Iralaun until she meets and falls head over heels for Allen who is nothing like the losers she previously has been with. Allen is kind, considerate and understanding. Will Iralaun let her guard down or will she continue to get what she wants and be out?Full of twists and turns and a heart wrenching surprise ending ROBBING PETER is definitely a book that needs to be read. See how women of all walks of life are connected in more ways than specifically an absentee father. The characters are very well developed and I found myself not wanting to put the book down. I cried, yelled and laughed with the characters and found myself asking where ARE the fathers?Reviewed by Eraina B. Tinninof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"Robbing Peter is an emotionally stimulating depiction of the cycle of life. It is a graphic trip into the reality of how one person's decisions can have detrimental effects that not only travel through generations, but permeate the lives of seemingly unrelated individuals in a vicious pattern stricken with poverty, drugs, crime, and self-loathing. I absolutely loved this book. I picked it up on a Wednesday, and was unable to put it down before reading its last pages the following day. If you want a page-turning read that doesn't pacify the cliche that \\"every cloud has a silver lining\\", then Robbing Peter is for you. And if you need that cloud...strangely, Robbing Peter is still for you. Ms. DuPree, I will definitely be following your works in the Future."},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"While reading Robbing Peter I felt like i was right there in the pages with the characters. Being from D.C. I was always waiting for an author to capture my city the ways it should and Ms. DuPree dose just that. Her writing style is wonderful, it was an easy read because of her style. Robbing Peter was a page turner. I finished the book in 3 days, I could have finished sooner if I could have read it at work. I can't wait until her next book. By the way when is is coming out and is Ms. Dupree doing any apperances at books stores in the near furture? Let me know, I don't want to miss out on the opportunity."},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"This new writer has enormous talent. I read this book in three days. She has created three characters that everyone can relate to. It takes you through the struggle and sacrifice of a single mother; The soul searching of a young woman trying to find her own identity and rid herself of her mother's baggage; and a woman who has realized all her dreams except two very important things: finding a man who truly loves her and dealing with personal issues that involve her mother and father. This book will entertain you as well as enlighten you about the struggle of a woman. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"I know by giving two stars I'm in the minority of this review section but I call it like I read it. I couldn't wait to get this book because the title and subject matter drew me in. As I started reading I became disappointed.The storyline had potential from the beginning but never met that potential. You can tell that the author has taken great care in her \\"technical\\" writing skills but that's where the positive aspects stop. When I read a book I not only want it to be written free of typing and grammatical errors but also make me feel the characters coming off the page. Ms. DuPree attempts to have a cast of main characters whose lives intertwine either directly or indirectly. It's a lofty idea but it didn't work. I just felt like I was reading a book of short stories. Just when you think you're getting a glimpse of a character and the reasons for their actions the book jumps to another character. It's ok to do this but only if it's relevant to the story and there's a natural flow in jumping around.Another thing that I could have done without is that in about two-thirds of the way through this book the characters turned preachy. I don't mean in a biblical sense, I don't mind that. I'm talking about the characters trying to sum up the breakdown of families and other social ills in a single chapter. There's nothing wrong with trying to put a message in your books but having the very same characters that are criminals or sleeping around being bad in one chapter and Al Sharpton in the next is just not believable within the confines of this story.The ending was anticlimatic. The epilogue was unnecessary, usually there'll be some type of unexpected twist but this one was a no-brainer.As I stated earlier, I think that this book had great potential, there are some good chapters, but the author didn't write a seamless story. That's a must if you use multiple main characters. I support many types of African-American fiction from male and female authors but I will always give my reviews in an honest manner in hopes that my opinions are helpful to Amazon customers as well as the authors themselves. I hope Ms. Dupree reads this and heeds my advice because she missed the mark on this one. Hopefully she'll accept constructive criticism and improve on her next book. Good luck."},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"The story is about three women, that have never crossed paths before. Vivica, a single mother with a set of troubled twins. Belinda, a successful judge, that's unlucky with love. Iralaun, is a young college student that is sleeping with her roommate's boyfriend. Through a series of unfortunate events, their lives intersect.The twins ends up in a high speed chase. The vehicle they are in , hits the car driven by Iralaun's boyfriend. When Iralaun ends up in the hospital, Vivica is her attending nurse. Belinda's ex is the lawyer, that once represented the twins. You have to read this novel and see how this drama unfolds."},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"Kia Dupree introduces the readers to three women from different backgrounds and how they deal with the trials and tribuations of life. Each of these women have different situations and eventually their three lives intersect. Viveca is a single mother of five, whose husband had substance abuse issues, which caused him to be both a mental and physical abuser to Viveca. Her twins boys were truly hell raisers in the community, who initially idolized their father, but later realized how he destroyed their family. Belinda was awarded the priviledge of a middle working class upbrining, until her father suffered a devastating job-related accident, which not only destroyed his world, but destroyed his family relationship and caused Belinda not to respect him for the way her treated his wife (her mother). Belinda was so busy trying to achieve career status and dealing with her parents situation, that she suffered in her male oriented relationships. Iralaun had issues stemming from her mother not revealing who Iralaun's father was to her, which caused her to have low self-esteem when it came to having relationships with men, and it seems when she became part of a true relationship with a true gentleman, events outside of her control threaten to destroy it. I love the way the circumstances were revealed that caused the three women to meet and how they each dealt with the circumstances. It seems like initially the three women were diamonds in the rough and they all came out as jewels in the end. Ms. Dupree really penned a beautiful novel, that had an urban feel, with contemporary events and a little romance. I acutally read Ms. Dupree's other three novels before reading this book, which she wrote prior to these novels. All I can say is that Ms. Dupree does not disappoint her readers. Please keep these types of books coming."},{"Title":"Robbing Peter","review":"This is an outstanding read, I could not put the book down until I read its entirety. What a remarkable job the author did in making the women so believable, most of us can definitely relate at one point or another.

Her mother taught her to be tough and never need anyone. She doesn't know her father, not even his name. When she meets Allen a caring man she learns how to open up.This story shook me to the core! When Elijah and Elgin get in deep it pulls the lives of these three women together. How they all connect and the events that take place are haunting. Dupree packs a big punch with this debut.

However, I'm giving you 5 stars!!"},{"Title":"Environmental Microbiology","review":"I was anxious to receive this book, since it was praised as one of the best books available in the area of environmental microbiology. After reading through the pages, I just couldn't agree with this statement.Here are some of the good points of this book: It's written in a fairly easy to understand language and provides a lot of pictures and graphs to illustrate important concepts.Here are the bad points: It summarizes a lot and leaves out a lot of details and information. Whoever buys this book better know something about biochemistry and microbiology already. The graphs and pictures are sometimes ridiculous and of poor quality, almost like they were done at a home PC.The book would be best for somebody who is a hobby environmentalist that wants to expand his/her knowledge, or undergraduate students of biology who want to explore the environmental aspect of microbiology out of curiosity. If you are serious about environmental microbiology and really want to get into it on a more professional level, I suggest the \\"Manual of Environmental Microbiology\\" 2nd edition, published by the American Society for Microbiology.

This might deter some students, but it shouldn't: it doesn't take long to get used to the Japanese system. Second, and far more important, the 5th edition contains 40% more words than the 4th, and the English equivalents provided are far more useful and contemporary.

A car towing a strange van into an old house followed by a series of squeals sets the stage for quite a thrilling first mystery for the Secret Seven.This Kindle edition (2011) is updated in today's language - farewell to 'jolly japes', 'golly gosh', 'mercy me' and 'cripes'. The stories though, remain the same.The kindle edition also includes a note from Enid Blyton's eldest daughter , Gillian about the 'Secret Seven Books' ... this is a really nice touch.ABOUT THE SECRET SEVEN:The Secret Seven are led by Peter, his sister Janet, and their friends Jack, Colin, George, Pam and Barbara and of course, their golden retriever, Scamper.The Secret Seven have a secret password, a badge, and a secret headquarters.

I have very fond memories of every single book in the Adventure series, (River of Adventure, Island of Adventure, Castle of Adventure, etc.) But, some series hold up better than others.Secret Seven is the entry level series. Then there are the Five; then, the Adventure series.The Secret Seven mysteries are very simple. Every few pages a random adult provides critical information. The boys are very patronizing in their treatment of the girls, and the girls appear to accept this condescension as fair and appropriate. Given how many modern entry level mystery series now allow for strong and personable girl characters, this weakness seems especially glaring. There is not much atmosphere, little character development, and not a great deal to capture the imagination. On the other hand, the books aren't all fantasy. magic and dragons, and there is a lot to be said for the old-fashioned neighborhood gang-of-kids mystery.The upshot is that while I cam certainly see the Adventure series hooking a young reader, it's a little harder to determine where the appeal would be in a Secret Seven book for a younger reader, except for the fact that it is a solid entry-level read.That said, I have this first volume in my early readers library. I'm waiting to see if any of my grandchildren warm to it before I get any more.

I'm surprised that these books are not as popular any more. When I used to read these books, we were sharing them with friends and making sure we read all the books in the series. Nowadays, television and game consoles seem more interesting to children.

Also, the actual conclusion to the whole series is surprisingly anticlimatic in my mind and let me down a little. Eddings' characters are pretty interesting, although they are mostly little more than strict adherences of practically all the fantastical archetypes. Several characters like Silk, Barak, and Mandorallen I especially liked and wondered why Eddings didn't discuss them further, especially in later stages of the series. The relationships between the men and women is interesting and I found myself rooting for som"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"DON'T READ THIS BOOK........

Quite simply put,it's good, it's fantastic, just go out , buy this book and read it..you can thank me later.I envy those who have never read it for the y get to be introduced to such imaginative characters such as Belgarath and Silk. A truly epic saga that deserves more praise than could ever be putdown in writing. WHat are you waiting for, read it!... trust me"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"I have read everything I can find by Tolkein. I have read all I can of Tad Williams. I have read hundreds of books in this genre and I can say this series is excellent. This genre is popular because it requires an imagination, and it is there for the readers to have a good time, not to make literary students of all of us. I don't give a damn for character development and plot - I want something that is going to take me away and let my imagination go on a ride. Eddings did brilliantly with this. The last few books were so fast paced, I couldn't put them down. I can't wait to begin reading the Mallorean. If a person wants to do some seriouse literary reviewing then try a different Genre."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"Enchanters' End Game chronicles the climax to Garion's long quest to bring two conflicting prophecies back into synch. As Child of Light, he and his friends have wandered across the Alorn kingdoms, ventured into Tolnedra and Nyissa, and now Garion, Belgarath, and Silk are in the Angarak side of the continent heading for the final confrontation with Torak.Pacing Garion is C'Nedra, who has rallied the armies of the West to provide what amounts to a distraction so that Garion, thousands of miles away can slip into Cthol Mishrak without the entire Murgo population trying to put an end to them. For all the sarcasm and wit that the characters display, this is a grim struggle, and C'Nedra's forces will be caught between the massive armies of the Mallorean Emperor Zakath and Taur Urgas the insane king of the Murgos. Levity or not many will die in the confrontation.Of the two story arcs, C'nedra's is the more interestingly told. Garion's adventures are mostly hiding and running at a very forced pace. His challenge is to keep his fear in check as he prepared for a duel that will kill one of the participants. On the other hand, the Alorn kings and many friends surround C'nedra. The preparations for the final battle are extensive, and many of the characters show unexpected sides.In retrospect, once this series slows down in Castle of Wizardry, it never quite regains its pace. Eddings hadn't quite learned to control his efforts in this series, and his early rush left him lacking a bit of plot in the fourth volume of this series. Enchanters' End Game recovers (nothing like a massive battle to perk things up) but Edding's will always be noted more for characterization and detail than for action. But his next series, the Malloreon is more evenly written, so the pacing is much smoother.I tend to view these stories as comfort food for fantasy addicts. While they lack something in the way of fast paced action and emotional range, they are genuinely entertaining. I've reread them all several times and they always seem to bear up. I wish everything I read was at least this well done."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"Enjoyed this one as much as the others in the series. This ends the Belgariad series and sets up for the Malloreon. All in all these are good reads. Most of the folks I know have read this series and The Malloreon several times...they are sort of habit forming. If read for what they were written for, light books which should be enjoyed and ones to have fun with, then you will like them. If on the other hand if you just graduated from Jr. High and are much, much too mature for them, then you should probably wait until you reach your dotage so that you can appreciate them again. Yes, they are flawed and yes there are endless contradictions (some 233 by my last count), but that is part of the charm of this work. Hey, go out to a oak tree in the woods or in your park, kick back, read and enjoy. Recommend highly."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"I'm probably one of the very few people that actually admit reading David and Leigh Edding's novels now. Especially since Tolkien has come back into fashion in a big way. But I've always been a great admirer of Eddings novels - their plots are EXACTLY the same as Tolkien's literary classic, right down to the location names (\\"Cthol Mishrak\\", anyone?). Despite all that, there are two things that keep drawing me back to their novels.The first strength is how strongly their characters are written. It's so easy to believe that these characters COULD exist in real life, because they're so flawed...and yet so noble and heroic.A good example is \\"Belgarath the Sorcerer\\" - Belgarath is DEFINITELY not a Gandalf clone. He's a thief, a liar, a cheat, and loves keeping the company of woman of questionable reputation. Despite all that, he's still one of the most adept masters of \\"The Will and the Word\\", and can perform heroic deeds when called upon.The Edding's other strength is their narrative. The plotline IS a rip-off of Lord of the Rings, but it moves along at such a good pace, and is so well written, that you totally ignore that issue as soon as you read the first page. The only conclusion I can come to is that although the main plotlines are similar, their execution is totally different.Now...onto the book review. Of all five books in the Belgariad, this is my favourite. And a large portion of that is due to the battle at Thull Mardu. The plotline in this book revolves around this single event - we see the lead-up (gathering the troops), the battle itself (which is realistically written), and the aftermath. In the lead-up, we get a much better look at some of the protaganists - especially the Alorn Kings. We're also introduced to General Varana, a character who will return in the Mallorean. All of them are very well written, and each of them has a character quirk that endears them to us. We start to care about what happens to them.The battle itself is quite realistically written. The Edding's strength in this area isn't the body count - we don't seem to get a real idea of how many people die. It's their portrayal of individual events that make it so powerful. There's one quite affecting scene involving a young boy playing a flute on top of a hill that is very well written - and is also used to portray the stupidity and waste of war. It's also important to point out that the good guys are actually outnumbered in this battle, and very nearly don't win. My only complaint about this section of the book is that the Edding's don't provide a really good explanation of exactly how the good guys escape in the end. It just seems to reach a particular point, and then, seemingly satisfied that things will turn out alright, we immediately switch to the battle between Garion and Torak.As for the battle between Garion and Torak? It was every bit as interesting as I thought it would be. I would love to see this scene portrayed in a movie. The one aspect that really surprised me was HOW Garion defeated Torak - anybody who's read the book knows what I'm talking about. In the end, it wasn't through Garion's skill with a sword, instead it was through taking advantage of a certain aspect of godhood. In retrospect, this makes sense. After all, a god is totally infallible but does have one obvious weakness.In conclusion, I enjoyed the battle at Thull Mardu far more than the final battle between Garion and Torak. Both were equally powerful events, it's just that one had more time devoted to it than the other. I actually read the Mallorean novels before I read the Belgariad, so it was interesting seeing the events that lead up to the second set of books. I can certainly see why so many people like the Belgariad more than the Mallorean. As for me, I enjoy both saga's equally, although I have a soft spot for the Mallorean because I read it first."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"In Enchanter's Endgame David Eddings draws the Belgariad to a much anticipated conclusion. As the armies of the West invade Mishrak ac Thull to stave off two huge armies of Angaraks, Garion, Belgarath, and Silk jounrney to the heart of Torak's dominions, Cthol Mishrak, City of Darkness. Both the allied armies and Garion's small company will face challenges and a few suprises that the sleeping God Torak has up his sleeve.Edding's stories are nothing terribly new, but they are fun and witty. This book especially showcased Eddings ability to weave some really fun characters into a familiar fantasy setting while not being cliche. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD!!While glancing through my reviews last night it came to my attention that I wrote a pretty involved review of Castle of Wizardry and then went on to write what I thought was a cool review of Guardians of the West. This means that I just blew past the climactic novel in the Belgariad without even noticing for a while.After a little reflection I realized how that could have happened.It goes like this. Enchanter's Endgame is book five in a beloved but rather um... safe series. The upshot here is that book 5 of this series is essentially about a duel between our hero and one hell of a villain. Since this is how most fantasy series in the last decades have gone there is a tendancy to just say \\"This book is where the good guys finally win.\\" and be satisfied with that.Under the surface though, it is not that simple. While it is true that this is a good guy vs. bad guy story, while it is true that the good guys obviously win and while it is true that the casualties on the good side are people we ultimately don't care about, it just isn't that simple of a climax.One reason for this has to do with the fact that Eddings knew he was going to sequelize this series so he was sowing seeds for the Malloreon here at the end. It is here where the mystery of Errand is really brought out. It is here where we meet 'Zakath for the first time and, if you are like me, you want to know what that apostrophe means.All that aside, this is still a novel about endings. These endings are, for the most part weak and safe. Examples of this are Durnik's death and resurrection, a plot device made all the more disappointing by his ascention to sorcererhood. I don't really hold that against him though since this kind of stuff is very common in fantasy.So, this is a good final installment of The Belgariad and a good precursor to the Malloreon and a solid book in its own right."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"First, everyone is a critic, few get paid to do so.Any work had rave reviews and negative reviews. Take a chance and read it for yourself to be the final judge.Well, Unlike most reviews, I'm not going to 'book report' it and summize what happened. The story continues nicely, and now the overall climax of the previous 4 books comes to a head. The fate of the universe lays in the balance, and it depends not only on Garion, but also his friends, Polgara, Durnik, Errand and his future wife, to decide what happpens.Very well written. I like the climax and the gradual wind down to the end (whereas many books have the climax and end shortly thereafter leaving you asking. 'what about?').All of the lose ends concerning everyone get tied up. Wow. I am glad I bought the first book on a whim recalling a good review here on Amazon.I look forward to the Malloreon!I would recommend!

The ends of all of these books leave you hanging for more. The Malloreon is just as good. Right up there with Harry Potter and The Secret of Platform 13!"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"I'm not going to review each book of the series individually since they are all the same in structure, and sadly, nearly in content as well. This series has to be considered one of the most predictable, monotonous, dry fantasy series out there. Near the beginning of every book David Eddings, for some reason I simply can't understand, basically spoils the rest of the book by having characters say what they're going to do. It's like \\"We'll do A, then B, then C,\\" where C is the end of the book. These summaries wouldn't be so detrimental if the author actually had some unexpected things happen along the way...but he doesn't. It happens exactly according to the summary every time. At least ninety percent of every book in the series is monotony--basically you know what's going to happen and are just waiting for it to take place.The characters are also pretty flat. They each of interesting quirks, but the author just keeps replaying them over and over again. If Aunt Pol makes one more smart-guy comment or Garion \\"blushes\\" in embarassment one more time... I tell you, someone blushing as much as him has no right to be a king of any sort.Now that the worst aspects of the series are out of the way...I must say I enjoyed the \\"mythology\\" inserted into the beginning of every book. In fact I enjoy that more than the book itself. It seems very creative, and it is very well done. Also the first book is probably 3 or 4 stars, rather than the rest of the series' 2 stars...the beginning of it is much better done.I have to conclude that life is too short to waste time on books like these. Just pass it on."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"I read the whole series in a few weeks, and I say it was great. It lacks a bit of power, but is very well written, funny, and much more entertaining with realistic insight then some overhyped fantasy.Good action, romance, human emotions, and a building zenith of events that keeps the pages turning. The only part I had a problem with was how they cut out the best part at the very end. I mean, come on Dave, you know we all wanted to know what happend AFTER Ce'Nedra and Garion got married. And I say that from a comical standpoint. But I still fail to see why fantasy, as well as socity, embelishes violence, yet shuns sex. Whats up with that? If you can write in detail about death and bloody combat you can sure write about love and sex. The joke with the orb was funny, but I think something much more funny was going on at the time ^_~ And it was also a good charcter development point, to bad it was to ''offensive'' to write about. Only other flaw was that travel got a little boaring and I would have liked to know more about the universal sceam of things, I found that very cool. Despite a few flaws ( and every writer has flaws) Eddings is great. Truely great.And if you didnt like it why did you bother reading it. I put a book down if I don't like it and, I sure don't go to a major webpage and say how it sucks. Get a life. And for people who can enjoy good fantasy, read Eddings. Or other authors, there are so many good fantasy novels, if you can stop compareing and read with an open mind, and heart."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"Of all the books that I have read, this is the best. Nobody does it better than David Eddings. His style of writing is so unique in a way that you'd think he's actually been there. The words that describes the scenes and objects that the characters see just sinks into ones mind.The characters' actions, characteristics, and the way they talk makes them alive. And it almost makes you believe that your right next to them and seeing all the action in front of you, but you theres no way you talk or respond to them.The way Belgarath and Garion communicates with wolve, and the way they describe wolves is so unbelievable that it's great. It's like seeing and feeling how wolves acually are.David Eddings description of how Torak was slayed and the action of the other gods were incridible.

The way they describe the battles - having each element of the rainbow-array army move in turn.

Some of the parts were funny. &quot;I thought you wanted to stand around and watch the world change.&quot; &quot;Please stop groaning, Rhodar.

You can play with your little toy soldiers again tomorrow.&quot; And of course I liked when Polgara discovered she had had her power all along.

I hate to leave any story unfinished, so for that reason, and that reason alone, I managed to stagger to the end of this series. Bad move. In most heroic fantasies, we get to see adolescent (or at least naive) heroes grow and mature over time to become truly extraordiary individuals. Not so in the Belgariad. While the magical powers of the characters grew, there was no growth whatsoever in the morals, courage, or other personal qualities of any of the characters. Also, the characters and storyline actually seemed to become more juvenile and trite as the story &quot;progressed&quot;. For example, two of the main adolescent characters who have never fought with horse and lance manage to win a jousting tournament in a land of &quot;ultimate&quot; knights with only some minor magical aid. And the interaction between the male and female characters in the book bore far more resemblence to a junior high school than to the way one would expect the most powerful individuals in the world to behave. The &quot;evil&quot; characters were too stupid to be threatening, and the heroes' demeanor was more like they were on a picnic than involved in a life or death struggle against evil. If Mr. Eddings insists on publishing more of this drivel, he should arrange for someone to pummel that annoying hag Polgara. Her condescending treatment of every male character might have been appropriate if they had all acted like immature brats, but -- oh, yea."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"Enchanter's End Game by David Eddings is the fifth and final book in The Belgariad saga. This book finishes off the tale of Garion and his progression from kitchen scallion to that of powerful wizard. Edding's writing style may turn off some fans as at times he will explain in great detail some event and then others he will offer only a cursory explanation and description. Also, some of his characters are very clich&#65533;d and he seems to recycle a few plot lines now and again. However, that should not take away from the fact that this series of books tells a good story and offers a variety of situations to keep most readers interested. I also believe that this series of books would be a good series to recommend to a younger (12 and up) reader to get them interested in the genre as the concepts are not overly difficult to understand.The plot of this book starts up right where the last book, Castle of Wizardry, leaves off. There is an epic battle that will be taking place and Garion and his group are seeking to kill the god Torak. The two plot lines together lend themselves well to playing off of each other and allowing enough time to set both up. Edding's does a good job at making sure the reader understands they story well enough so that when events occur the readers knows why they happened as well as an inclining of what to expect next.As I mentioned before, my biggest complaint with Edding's writing is that his characters are overly clich&#65533;d and it seems like he uses a cookie cutter to place a \`class' of character into the story and then adds a bit to make the character appear new and interesting. The only character within this book, and the previous 4, that really stood out to me is Silk. He brought a slightly new feel to the classic rogue character and his banter was rather humorous at times. Other than that the characters were mostly forgettable. I am not saying they were \`bad' characters, they are simply not characters that kept me interested for the sake of themselves. I was interested in the story, just not so much because of the characters.Overall, this was a good book and a decent series. If you are expecting an epic tale, like that of Steven Erikson, you will be disappointed. This is a series that is fun to read and does not require a great deal of effort to understand it. I would however recommend this series to newer fantasy readers as well as younger readers. It may be a good \`hook' series to get more people interested. All in all not a bad finish to this saga."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"This book is David Eddings worst, but it's still absolutely amazing!

Yes, all the familiar Eddings trappings are there, but they begin to wear thin after awhile.... all the witty, one-dimensional characters. This was great literature when I was in 7th grade..... only sentimental attachment, and the acknowledgment that I re-read the series an infinate number of times growing up cause me to refrain from rating this failed ending to the series lower.

There in Cthol Mishrak, the evil god Torak is stirring from his endless sleep and waiting for their prophesied battle, the outcome of which will decide the fate of the world.Meanwhile, Ce'Nedra, self-proclaimed Queen of Riva in Garion's absence, is travelling across Arendia and Tolnedra, raising an army with her speeches. Although it breaks her heart to know that it will be badly outnumbered and that it won't stand a chance against the hordes of Thulls, Murgos and Malloreans, she knows this is a necessary sacrifice to create the diversion Garion needs to reach Mallorea.The part I preferred in this final volume is when Ce'Nedra's army is encamped in Algaria. There Durnik and the Alorn Kings engineer clever contraptions to carry King Anheg's fleet up the mile-high Eastern Escarpment. I also enjoyed reading about the battle of Thull Mardu, where all plans start to go awry, not to mention the final encounter between Garion and Torak, where all the pieces of the Prophecy click into place.

The characters are life-like, fun, and endearing. Besides, the repetitions are what you would really notice if you thought in book-report-format: \\"and then they did this, and then this\\", but I think that there are enough details that differ to keep it interesting.I like this book best of the series because it wraps up all those loose ends and of course, there's all the surprises, so touching since by the time you reach this book, everyone in the book is like family..."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"I decided to rate one of the books of Belgariad, because it was the first series published, and it was first I read. I have read all of Eddings' fantasy books, and I have to say with the exception of &quot;The Redemption of Athalus&quot; and the &quot;Polgara&quot; they are all great books. The problem lies in the fact that all of Eddings' series are the same. He had one brilliant idea back when he wrote the Belgariad, and every thing else has been the same with a little twist. If you are a die hard Eddings' fan and you think I am wrong, reread the Mallorean again, and you will see that Eddings' confesses to it thru his charater's. So if you are new to Eddings' Choose one of the series and only read that one series.

It is important to read the Rivan Codex to be placed in the proper context of the storyline, characterisation etc. That is onlyif yout have dismally failed to realise the man's brilliance at writing. Granted, David Eddings is not the most prolific writer, but in any creative field, you grow as an artist, and he has shown considerable growth in his other series. Enchanters End Game is a book I shall continue to read, and each time, it will provide fresher entertainment to my eyes. To the reviewer who labels Polgara as a &quot;hag&quot; all I have to say is that you are a mysoginist who is afraid of a woman in power. With your blatant views on females, I do not suggest reading Melanie Rawn's Exiles trilogy. The story is a good one, the ending not to final, but does not leave the reader frustrated. I think the battel with torak is well-written, and was not dragged out for long. The battle of Thull Mardu is a well-written piece and for all the clods out there, it takes precision to stage a battle of that magnitude. I found it delightful reading the battle with the hierachs of Murgodom. So what if the good guys win??? Was Asharak's victory with Garion's parent not enough to satiate a blood lust?? I hav eto disagree with the reviewers who have slated the book. I found it entertaining, worth my time, and would recommend this to anybody who wishes to cut their teeth in the fantasy genre. Thanks"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"Looking at the average rating for this book left me absolutely shocked, I find it impossible to believe that anybody could find anything even remotely interesting in this series, or any other by David Eddings. Firstly, the plot in this whole series is so shallow it is almost insubstantial, and gives the reader so much information that there is no joy in trying to piece together the story. The information in itself was not such a bad idea, but unfortunately Eddings gave too much away, and quite often I had guessed the outcome of an event a hundred pages before it was finally revealed. Also the series was made boring by the fact that the enemy was never all that evil, and the \`good guys' always seemed to have the upper hand in all areas. Secondly the characters in the entire Belgariad/Mallorean series are completely inappropriate for their chosen roles. They are reasonably well developed, but completely and utterly unconvincing - they seem to behave as if they are showing off to their mates, not at all as if they were out performing the seemingly serious task of saving the world. The main character Garion seems to undergo almost no psychological change at all after all his experiences, his behavior and attitude is the same when he is a nine year old kitchen hand as when he is a sorcerous king of the world. Aside from this the characters and the plot are so hollow and predictable you feel dissatisfied and ripped off when finishing the series because it fails to deliver any of the things such as plot, character development and suspense, which are so essential for a novel's success. One good point, however, the series is so long that you ca really become emerged in it for a short while, but unfortunately this only adds to the disappointment at the end of the series. I have heard people criticise this book for being unorigional, but in actual fact these criticisms are unfounded, the book is original - nobody else has ever written such a linear, empty and predictable example of fantasy literature. Finally, to all those people who think this series is god's greatest gift to fantasy readers, do yourself a favour and read Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"The Belgariad series ends with a fluffed up book. While the finally apocalyptic battle between Garion and Torak is exciting, the end of it is somewhat cheesy. The worst part of the book is the useless fluff written in order to extend the ending into a full-fledged novel.Going into the fifth book, the reader knows that Garion and Torak will fight an epic battle. What the reader shouldn?t have to do is drudge through the micro-management of an army travelling, nor read about how a queen runs a country that has nothing to do with the story anymore. Unfortunately, that?s half the book. Most of the rest of the book is Garion, Silk, and Belgarad travelling. Like usual, they travel, almost face capture or death, and escape. The same sort of thing that happened in the last four books. It seems like Eddings really wanted to extend this series to five books no matter how useless the material was.Other than that, Eddings does retain his readability, and his imagination is as good as ever. I recommend this book, however, as it tidies up the prophecy nicely."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"Just another example of why fantasy is considered pulp, and suitable only for 11 year old social outcasts. I read this when I was twelve and found it to be childishly written and poorly conceptualized, with paper-thin trite characters to boot. Oh well. If you read this series, and still want to give fantasy a try, read &quot;Memory Sorrow and Thorn&quot; by tad williams. It is everything these books are not."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"Will Garion be able to overcome the dark God Torak even though he is deemed the overlord of the west. Will he be able to overcome the will of a god and save the world the universe itself. Read the book yourself and find out."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"I stopped about page 150 or so. The truth of it is, this series is just a little too immature for me. The way Eddings steoreotypes his races- i.e. all Tolnedrans are greedy, all Arends are incredibly stupid, all Sendars are practical, etc.- is just way too unrealistic. I remember reading a scene where the Mimbrates and the Asturians are discussing their animosity, and finally figure out that they've been fighting thousands of years over nothing, and what's more ridiculous, they haven't realized this because they never once talked to each other about it. It's ludricrous for people who have been warring for millenia to all at once say, \\"Oh! Is that it? Wow, it's a good thing we finally spoke to each other, or no telling how long this would've lasted.\\" No one's THAT stupid. Also, a good portion of the dialogue is JUST PLAIN SILLY. At first it was bearable, but after a while all the little dry comments began to grate more and more. All in all, these books are just too chldish and should be avoided by mature readers. Also, the characterization is not that great, and this makes for boring reading.I finally stopped when I got to that Arend nonsense, but honestly, this book isn't any better or worse than the other books, so if you've been enjoying this series so far you shouldn't find any problems with this one. I guess it just took me this long to finally realize what I was reading. Stupid me, I suppose."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"Well this last book was so drawn out I could barely finish it. I believe the series would have been better if it was in one 500 page book. Not to bad of a series but my god was it draw out."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"Without repeating what Allanon86 and A Reader (\\"Well, So Much for Free Will\\") said in their reviews I'd like to add a few other things:It seems that David Eddings has done NO background research _what so ever_. He seems to have zero understanding of music and his descriptions of the mental and physical aspects of battle are sad and laughable at the same time.About music: it seems most of the heroes are virtuoso players/singers without any practice. I can't remember if it was in this series or in the Malloreon in which Durnik played a lute but even when I last read it when I was 13 I remember shaking my head in disbelief: I've played classical guitar since the age of 6, electric guitar since the age of 12 and drums since the age of 10 so I have a vague grasp of how the whole concept of playing music works, how your skills improve or rust etc. In the scene Durnik turns out to be a master lute player even though he hasn't touched an instrument for years and years. I assure you, if you once learn to play guitar or lute, leave it for a few years and then try to play, you won't be able to play crap. Same goes for singing. I doubt Eddings has ever touched an instrument himself or talked the matter over with a musician. If he had he wouldn't have included such silly scenes in his books.As for violence...it's clearly apparent that the author has not consulted people like law enforcement officers or bouncers or soldiers who all face real world violence on a daily basis let alone been in a violent confrontation himself. If he had consulted the pros or if he had any personal experiences of violence he would drop the glorified and humoristic Hollywood approach which stain all battle scenes in all of his books. They are mostly happy-go-lucky scuffles in which the heroes actually HAVE FUN! I mean, come on, make sure you know what you're talking about before you put it in a book! Not to mention the 100% lack of any compassion towards their opponents; Eddings has written the story so that the angaraks (murgos, thulls, grolims) are not to be considered human; they are waste which should all be killed and to top it all, killing them is great fun! The more murgos you kill, the more fun you have. Afterall, they are _just_ people of an inferior race.What made me laugh in the fighting scenes were the actual descriptions of the moves and maneuvers. My favorite scenes were those which included Silk because he, being an acrobat and all, had the most ridiculous moves. It's like reading an over-the-top parody of a fight scene. Just make sure you're not eating while you read Silk's fight scenes; you might choke on your food. Same thing with the physical impossibilities: at one point he describes how Cho-Hag pierces his opponent with his sabre...yes, fine, but just a few lines back Eddings said that Cho-Hag's opponent was wearing a plate armor! How can you pierce a plate armor with a sabre? It's the same as trying to pierce a steel plate with a butter knife. At that point (250 something pages) I just put the book away.By the way, has anybody else noticed a certain reflection of our world in Eddings'? The great, vast Mallorea with their red clothes and great numbers of men (Russia, anyone?), Chereks with their beards, braided hair, war boats, and large swords (Scandinavians?), Murgos and Grolims, the religious fanatics (Muslims?), the &uuml;ber-practical but simple Sendars (Germans?), the Rivans on their Isle of Winds with their gray weather (Great Britain?) etc. etc. Maybe it's just me...Anyway, another funny thing is that in the great battle of the armies of the Glorious West and the Evil East it seems that the Angaraks have no cavalry. Eddings constantly goes on about how the mounted Algars and Mimbrates destroy the Angarak-infantry but where is the Angarak-cavalry? It's clear that they have horses but where are they in this great battle? Did the angarak-army march to the battle and then go \\"oh gee, we forgot to bring our horses\\"?Another strange thing is that the troops of West are all very organized, the leaders use tactics and whatnot whilst the troops of East seem to be this unorganized mass with no sense of military tactics?It seems, at times, that the whole point of the novel is to emphasize how much superior other races (mostly the western ones) are when compared to others (eastern/southern races).Most of the female characters are also pretty clich&eacute;.Two stars for actually going through the trouble of writing a fantasy tale (which I enjoyed when I was 13) and for some of the humor (some of it is actually funny). I might recommend this series to a fantasy-hungry preteen even though there are better series out there."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"There are some very good things about this book, and then some really glaring flaws. Despite all, this series is the best Eddings wrote. His characters are actually likeable. In later ones his writing style goes clunky and he tries to make every other sentance a deadpan joke. In \\"The Dreamers\\", the style of writing is so 'talk about important things in a silly way' that the series falls flat. Sorry to rant about that, but really, if you want to read Eddings read the Belgariad. (If you're curious, the Mallorean is about the same characters and has some of hte Belgariad's charm, but not all. The Elenium and the Tamali, both about a two-demensional knight named Sparhawk, are okay but really not at all interesting. \\"The Redemption of Athaelus\\" is one book about a thief and a goddess; completely funny, but it would be a disaster if it weren't a single book. \\"The Dreamers\\" is just aweful. STay away from it.)However, I'm talking about Enchanter's End Game. Moreover I am writing to amuse myself, not whoever reads this. So: Things I like. I adore the way the queens left behind to rule while their husbands go off and fight handle things. Silar of Algeria, Porenn of Drasnia, and even the flakey Islena of Cherek spend their time defeating hte plots of the Bear-Cult, a bunch of conspiratorially minded religious extremists. Silar sends them off to conduct a survey of all the foals and calves in her kingdom; Islena (assisted by the formidable Lady Merel and the sneaky Queen Porenn) ships them all off to war; and Porenn herself manages to clean them out of her spy service and send them to the worst duty posts she and her spymaster can think of. On the side, Porenn negociates with the supposedly enemy kingdom of Gar og Nadrak so that hte Nadraks end up switching sides in the middle of a battle. The queen of Arendia, Mayaserana, manages (in heavily embroidered language) to stop her country's civil war, which was supposed to have ended centuries ago but stayed because of a formality. Something regardant on which of her titles half of the country owed fealty to. You have to read it to understand- honestly, the Arends are the silliest people in teh series. And finally, Layla of Sendaria, a rather stay at home mother, defeats a scheming ambasador by pretending to be incredibly absent-minded and enlisting hte help of her three youngest children to interupt him. The queens all get away with huge things because people expect them to be stupid, and they aren't. Except maybe Islena, and she has the good sense to pick good advisors. The situation parellels the way ladies took over ruling and fighting at home when their husbands were off on the Crusades in teh middle ages.The humor in this book hasn't gotten so crazy and omnipresent. It's there, but in later books Eddigns feels that his undoubted funniness gives him the right to ignore characters, setting... in fact, the later books are made up of humor, battles, some sex/romance, and in some cases a little-girl goddess. Bad form. Fortunately he hasn't done that yet here. This one's still okay.The bad things: Eddings tends to make every person in one of his countries as one of a 'type'. Sendars are practical and decent. Period. Arends are passionate and not too bright and taken up with nobility to the point of idiocy; if they are Mimbrates tehy talk in high style (Thee, thou, prithee, et cetera, sentances that last forever.) Chereks are semi-pirates. Drasnians are sneaky. You get hte picture. THat's the chief flaw."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"'Enchanter's End Game' brings us the story of how Garion travels towards his final encounter with the god Torak, which he will have to fight in order to save the world from a grim fate. At the same time, Ce'Nedra and the others are gathering an army to meet the threat of the Murgo and Malloreon forces which are converging upon the western kingdoms. I will not give away the ending, but this book is as great as all the other books in the series, and gives a suitable ending to the tale.This is the sequel to 'Castle of Wizardry', and the final book in the amazing series of five books known as 'the Belgariad'. The series is later followed by another five in 'the Malloreon'. The story is the classic fight between the Evil which seeks to rule the world, and the Good which wants to save it, but what really makes the book so great is the characters. They are all very distinct from each other, with their own personality and desires. Eddings manages to keep them all separate, so that they are not mixed together in a faceless group. Instead they each have their part to play in the quest to save the world.I have read the entire series at least 20 times by now, and it remains my favorite fantasy. It is lighter than 'The Wheel of Time' series by Robert Jordan, which makes it suitable for younger readers as well, but it is great for anyone from around 12 to 112. I think many, like me, read this series as their first fantasy, and it is a great start to get interested in the world of magic and swordfights.

I felt a strong emotional attachment to many of his main characters and thoroughly enjoyed reading The Belgariad Series."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"In just three short days I plowed through The Belgariad series and emerged, happy (and a bit melancholy to leave them behind). As much as I loved the series, wept at certain deaths, rejoiced as characters got everything and more than they could have dreamed of, I have only one small criticism to offer now that I've finished my first David Eddings series.I think authors such as Brandon Sanderson and Mickey Zucker Reichart have spoiled me when it comes to battle scenes. Take for example, Reichart's Renshai series - the swordplay is so beautifully described it makes me want to weep thinking about reading it again. Every motion came alive in my imagination. In contrast, David Eddings struggled with putting into words the action taking place in these books. Villains died quickly and neatly, which robbed me, as a reader, of a need to see them get their \\"just desserts.\\"That said, I still loved the direction of the story, the way all the pieces fit neatly together, the growth of the characters and uniting of the world, and that little bit that left the story open to grow more."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"I had not read in a little while and found out I was going to have surgery. So I hit the book store searching for a book. I love the King Arthur lore, so the first book in this series appealed to me. OMG!! I picked the perfect series. I read the first five before I left the hospital. I enjoyed it so much, as a present my husband bought me the first book in the second series. What I enjoyed was the different layers to the story and the characters. Each character had the flaws and their good points. The story line on the surface is somewhat simple and easy to read. But each time I read them I find a new depth and meaning to each plot twist. I even managed to talk my husband, my nephew and my niece into reading them. We all agreed the series is a 5 star read."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"The final book of the Belgariad continues the two plot threads begun in the previous book: one thread with Garion's quest to Cthol Mishrak, and the other chronicling the war. Strangely, the first part of the book (Gar Og Nadrak) is the part I found most enjoyable of the book. It shows an Angarak nation caught in the middle and desperately trying to stay out of the coming war. I really enjoyed the scenes in Morindland with the magicians. Eddings did a good job detailing the preparations made by Belgarath before entering Morindland, and also vividly describes the battle Belgarath had with the rival magician. When they finally get to crossing the land bridge, there is a sense of palpable foreboding as they approach Mallorea.As we switch to the war plot thread, we also see snippets of the other queens currently ruling the kingdoms of the West. These parts did not provide too much insight, although the scene with Layla's children and the Tolnedran ambassador was humorous. But overall these scenes with the queens for the most part could have been cut without damaging the narrative. I also noticed a propensity by certain characters (*cough* Ce'Nedra) to end a conversation with \\"You're impossible\\", and detracted from the story a bit every time that phrase was repeated.The battle scenes at Thull Mardu were decent, and Eddings did a good job of showing the magic vs. physical battles taking place. He did include a short, but poignant interlude with the Arendish flutist being silenced. Eddings does a good job of bringing characters from earlier books into the main part of the story.The climactic showdown was kind of a letdown (although nowhere near as bad as the one in Mallorean). I did find Belgarath's tantrum at Garion to be pretty funny, and the most interesting part of this section. While the Belgarath-Zedar showdown ended in unexpected fashion, the rest of this sequence was fairly predictable. While Eddings alludes to Garion's inexperience during the battle being equalized by Torak's maiming, it just seems that Garion has not made enough strides to take on a god (even if that god is maimed).What struck me while reading this book is that Garion becomes more and more one-dimensional as the story progresses from Gar og Nadrak to Mallorea. It seems that Garion needs to be constantly prodded to take the next step, be it by the voice of prophecy, Belgarath, Ce'Nedra, Polgara, or Adara. At certain points, I just wanted to yell at Garion \\"Take the initiatve for once!\\"In spite of my criticisms, I did enjoy reading this book. This was the first time I had read the Belgariad in almost 20 years, and overall I still think the series is decent. I think the series tends to fit the mold of YA fantasy, and that's fine. Eddings gives the main characters decent insights through the balance of the series (which is found wanting in the Mallorean). Aside from this, I've read the Mallorean, Elenium and Tamuli by Eddings; I would say the Belgariad is easily Eddings' best work, and I look forward to re-reading it again at some point (hopefully sooner than 20 years next time ;)"},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"Many people think David Eddings is overly formulaic which he is a bit but since I enjoy the tale he tells I do not mind reading it over again.

This may explain a lot.3) Despite this, they are color-coordinated.Sadly, with Garion's slaying of Torak and the defeat of the 'Other Prophecy', he effectively removes free will from the universe, locking it into its original 'purpose' - a destiny so controlling you might as well not even bother getting up in the morning. When cosmic forces micromanage, you know you're in trouble.I assume the only reason anyone would read this book is because they read the previous four, so a review seems rather besides the point.

The plots are a bit thin, but ok. Once the plot is established however the books are then filled with page after page of meaningless drivel. For example, when the group passes through a town, I don't need to read 3 or 4 pages of the town's history and political structure which has absolutely nothing to do with the plot but this kind of thing happens over and over. I understand trying to drag out the suspense a bit, but saying he went completely and ridiculously overboard is an understatement.The books would be ok for teens I guess except for the questionable moral behavior. The books seem to continuously advocate that lying and deceit are perfectly fine if it gets you what you want. Also, most of the main adult male characters binge drink whenever possible. I wouldn't want my teens reading about that, they have enough bad ideas already."},{"Title":"Enchanters' End Game (Book Five of The Belgariad)","review":"This entire series is just a bunch of clich&eacute;s gathered in one place.

That is probably the upper limit if you want to enjoy them. Eddings couldn't come up with an interesting story if his life depended on it. The main character (Belgarion) jumps around with a big silly sword killing bad-guys to the left and the right, but in 10 (!) books he doesn't get hit once!!

One kids pop up book would seem to about handle the amount of real plot and development which has taken place in this series. The characters are a paper thin bunch of cliches who hack and slay their merry way through huge numbers of sub moronic bad guys. The Quest for the Blue Stone motif is most definately wearing thin in Eddings stories, (I hear the plot was recycled in the second series) and the premise that this merry band should prance their way around laughing and joking with the weight of the world on their shoulders is basically just pathetic. OK, OK : some of the jokes are funny, and the series is a way to pass time on a long train ride or something, but dont take it seriously. And a special message for people who compare Eddings with Tolkien : Give UP! There is NO point of comparison. Tolkien created a living, breathing world of characters complete with mythology, rich history and complex and deep characters. He did this subtly so some people may have missed a lot. Eddings created a world of stasis which suddenly springs into action in time for a bunch of cliches to prance around saving the world before dropping back into stasis again. Then, in the second series, he does it a second time. Readable, but definately a lowest - common - denominator pulp fantasy.

Kreeft does an excellent job of explaining, simply and clearly, that right and wrong are objective - regardless of whether or not it is easy or makes someone happy. Kreeft also clears up some moral misconceptions like 'if it doesn't hurt anyone else, then it's ok' and 'the end justifies the means'. Also included in this book is an excellent discussion, scientifically based, on why abortion is objectively wrong (such as the fact that science has always defined a fetus as another human life, science has never been able to come up with a concrete time limit on so-called viability, and that a fetus has a distinct human genetic code that is separate from it's mother's).While in reading this book Kreeft does spend some time talking about God and his Christian faith, his arguments are philosophically and scientifically sound across the religious spectrum. Regardless of a reader's religion/athiesm, Kreeft's logic applies. While Kreeft argues that morality comes from God, he also demonstrates that one need not know that or believe in God to understand and use objective morals.This book is highly recommended for all readers who need help with a good strategy for making choices. It would also make an excellent gift for the person in your life who constantly argues that their morality is relative."},{"Title":"Making Choices: Practical Wisdom for Everyday Moral Decisions","review":"This is another of Peter Kreeft's typically illuminative books, on the largely-neglected topic of moral reasoning.Kreeft spends the first part of the book simply establishing the basic truths that once upon a time were obvious, but not in the present day - that moral laws exist and are knowable by human reason; that they are \\"built into\\" the universe, and thus true whether we know them or not; that moral relativism is self-refuting; and that morality ultimately derives from God (in Dostoevsky's words, \\"If there is no God, then everything is permissible\\").His discussion of the Greatest Good is also very sharp, especially in its discussion of ends and means.Part Four, in which he engages topics of Sex, Abortion, and Truth in greater detail, is really the meat of the book, and where Kreeft most directly engages modern culture. His discussion of sex in terms of sacredness is wonderfully clear - understanding sex as sacred simultaneously avoids both errors of hedonism on the one hand, and repression on the other. \\"Christian morality is based on human nature, on the kind of thing we are, and the kind of thing sex is. It is not the changeable rules of a game we designed, but the unchangeable rules of the operating manual written by the Designer of our human nature.\\"Kreeft's bit on our society's confusion between sex and money is utterly incisive - we use sex as a mere means of exchange (of pleasure), but we erect all manner of legal protections around money, treating it as virtually sacred, even expecting it to reproduce and grow. Priceless.Kreeft's aim here is not ethereal or theoretical - this is not pie-in-the-sky, \\"out there\\" moral philosophy. He means to give real people real tools for living real lives in the real world, and in this, he succeeds admirably"},{"Title":"Making Choices: Practical Wisdom for Everyday Moral Decisions","review":"A very simply written and fun to read book.

As a professor, the author, who taught theology at Fordham University, is appreciatively profiled in a May 2004 America magazine article by Kevin O'Brien entitled \\"Tuesdays with Rahner.\\" Dych had the experience of being a student and a friend of his fellow Jesuit mentor and brings a familiarity with his life and work that makes many of Rahner's contributions more readily accessible to current readers who may not have been mature students of Catholic theology in mid to late 20th century.Dych introduces his book by explaining how he experienced Rahner as a teacher and how Rahner valued his own teachers and mentors from his own time and from the Catholic tradition, especially Martin Heidegger and St. Thomas Aquinas. Rahner valued the \\"courage to question anew so much in the tradition considered self evident,\\" not to tear down but to bolster a \`faith seeking understanding.' He esteemed teachers who did not simply supply answers but teach us how to question and how to search. For Rahner, theology is always unfinished by its very nature, dealing as it does with the Mystery that lies beyond human speech.In this book Dych presents a short biography of Rahner, linking it with his theological and philosophical work, giving many insights into his working relationships and associations through the years, including a collaboration with young theologian Josef Ratzinger in preparing an alternate schema to that first proposed at Vatican II for the document on Scripture and Tradition.Dych's explanation of Rahner's contribution to the theology of grace and the church was especially interesting for me, as my initial exposure to these teaching lacked sufficient background for adequate understanding. It is difficult to imagine now that the phrase that \\"the Church is a Church of sinners\\" could have been a startling expression, but such terminology was not commonly used before Vatican II. Indeed Rahner stated clearly that the Church is a sinful Church, but nonetheless remains the body of Christ, not to be abandoned for some presumed yet illusive and in fact impossible sinless organization.In addition to sections on grace and the church, Dych includes chapters on Jesus, Transcendental Christology, Gnosticism and Agnosticism, Christian Vocation, the Church in the World, the Trinity and Ethics and Eschatology. Readers might find some portions of the chapters a bit difficult if they are unfamiliar with basic Catholic theology and some of the issues that it wrestled with during the past century. However, anyone with a \\"faith seeking understanding\\" will profit immensely by reading this book which concisely describes how a giant of Catholic theology in the 20th century wrestled with and dealt with most of the major theological questions of the day."},{"Title":"Meteor of War: The John Brown Story","review":"I agree with the reviewer above - John Brown is one of those figures that noone really understands so a full length work with sources and analysis of Brown's writings like this has been a long time coming.

But this book shows the various John Browns of history and myth, so that, whether you agree with the actions of Brown, you will at least understand them better and see him as a complex and human individual. The Harvard authors have a sense for biography and history, and do convincing close readings of John Brown's own writings. Fascinating sources and great prose by the authors, good analysis of art a bonus. It's a good story and told well.

Of course, most know him as the one who coined the immortal, defiant phrase &quot;I have not yet begun to fight!&quot; This book delves beyond that, as Morison shows Jones as he really was, a human being born in obscurity in Scotland who developed a love for the sea at an early age. He was simultaneously a shrewd combatant with a quick temper (in many ways the American equivalent of the great English admiral Nelson,) and a gentleman who enjoyed the company of numerous lovely ladies ashore. Morison leaves no stone unturned as he takes the reader on a detailed, captivating journey (from page one, the reader is hooked.) He sailed the waters that bore witness to Jones's battles and drew extensively upon the naval archives of the four primary countries that figured in Jones's life. To give you some idea, the engagement with H.M.S. Serapis is fleshed out in such marvelous detail that one can almost smell the gunpowder, but Morison goes beyond that, explaining what happened before, during, and after, most of which one would not learn in history class. In fact, I would make book that at least ninety percent of what one will read in this book would not be learned in history class. Morison has included pictures, charts, diagrams, excerpts from letters (some of which are in French with English translations), and has deftly blended them and the text into a perfect biography. For anyone who wants to learn more about Jones, this is required reading."},{"Title":"JOHN PAUL JONES A SAILORS BIOGRAPHY","review":"It has been said that most great men are bad men. Samuel Eliot Morison's superb biography of John Paul Jones supports, if not proves, that proposition. Jones's greatness is undeniable: Although he was the son of an obscure Scottish gardener, he virtually founded the United States Navy, he won one of the most important sea battles of the Revolutionary War when he was only 32, and he later commanded ships in the service of France and Russia. But Jones also was extremely temperamental, excessively vain (after receiving an honor from France, he liked to be addressed as \\"Chevalier Paul Jones\\"), and he had mistresses in practically every port. Morison, a longtime professor at Harvard and the author of the authoritative, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Christopher Columbus, as well as a massive, multi-volume history of the U.S. Navy during World War II, reports all of this in a matter-of-fact fashion. Morison's Jones is a great sailor and a man of the world in every respect.According to Morison, Young Jones was highly ambitious and went to sea at age 13 \\"as a road to distinction.\\" During the next 15 years, he learned well his trade and he also became an American patriot. At the beginning of the Revolutionary War, Morison writes that the American navy was \\"only a haphazard collection of converted merchant ships,\\" and the Royal Navy was probably the most powerful in history. But General George Washington, according to Morison, \\"had a keen appreciation of the value and capabilities of sea power,\\" and, in October 1775, Congress appointed a Naval Committee of Seven to manage the colonies' maritime affairs. In December 1775, seven months before the American colonies declared their independence from Great Britain, Jones accepted a commission as a lieutenant in the continental navy.Although Morison is primarily interested in Jones's activities during the Revolutionary War, he makes a number of more generally cogent observations. For instance, the United States government was in a state of nearly constant impecuniousness and was able to afford to build only one of the largest class of naval vessels, a ship of the line, during the conflict. In Morison's view, this was the status of the war at the time of the battle off Flamborough Head in September 1779, which secured Jones's fame: \\"The War of Independence had reached a strategic deadlock, a situation that recurred in both World Wars of the twentieth century. Each party, unable to reach a decision by fleet action or pitched land battles, resorts to raids and haphazard, desultory operations which have no military effect.\\" That deadlock continued, according to Morison, until 1781. Morison also writes that Britain took the position \\"since the United States were not a recognized government but a group of rebellious provinces,...American armed ships were no better than pirates.\\"Morison appears to be deeply impressed by Jones's technical competence: \\"One of Paul Jones's praiseworthy traits was his constant desire to improve his professional knowledge.\\" That passion for self-improvement reached fruition September 1779 off the Yorkshire coast of east-central England when a squadron which Jones commanded from the Bonhomme Richard defeated the H.M.S. Serapis in a three and one-half hour battle during which those ships were locked in what Morison describes as a \\"deadly embrace.\\" (Bonhomme Richard sank during the aftermath of the fierce fighting.) It was during this battle that Jones defiantly refused to surrender with the immortal phrase: \\"I have not yet begun to fight.\\" According to Morison, \\"[c]asualties were heavy for an eighteenth-century naval battle. Jones estimated his loss at 150 killed and wounded out of a total of 322.\\" Morison writes that Jones was at his \\"pinnacle of fame\\" in late 1779, and, when he visited France, which was allied with the U.S. during the Revolutionary War, in April 1780: He became the lion of Paris, honored by everyone from the King down.\\" When Jones returned to the United States in 1781, however, he was unable to obtain what Morison describes as a \\"suitable command,\\" and he never fought again under the American flag. In 1788 and 1789, as \\"Kontradmiral Pavel Ivanovich Jones\\" he swerved in the navy of Catherine II, \\"the Great,\\" Empress of Russia. When he died in 1792, he was buried in France, but, in 1905, his body was returned to the United States and now rests in the chapel of the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.Jones's nasty temper is frequently on display. Morison remarks on various occasions that his crews were \\"disobedient,\\" \\"sullen,\\" and \\"surly.\\" Which was cause and which was effect is difficult to ascertain. Jones clearly was an overbearing commander, which may explain, though does not excuse, his crews' bad attitudes. On one occasion Jones had one of his officers \\"placed under arrest for insubordination [giving the officer] a chance to clear it up, and Jones was unwilling to admit his error.\\" It is not prudent to compare events during war in the late 18th century to the peace and prosperity of our own time, but no reader of this book will be impressed by Jones's interpersonal skills.Morison makes numerous references to \\"prize money,\\" the curious, but apparently then-universal, practice of rewarding captains and their crews in cash for capturing enemy ships. The fact that Jones pursued prize money with vigor may raise additional doubts about his character, but I would guess Morison believed that Jones simply followed a custom which probably motivated many successful naval captains of his time.Morison held the rank of admiral in the U.S. Navy during World War II. Although the degree of detail in his narrative is fascinating, I found some passages too technical, and I suspect some other lay readers may be baffled as well. (The book's charts and diagrams were, however, very helpful.) But that is a small price to pay for a wonderful biography of one of the most intriguing figures of the American Revolution."},{"Title":"JOHN PAUL JONES A SAILORS BIOGRAPHY","review":"John Paul Jones is one of those figures on the fringes of the American pantheon. Most educated people have heard the name, but few know anything about the man beyond, perhaps, that he proclaimed, \\"I have not yet begun to fight!\\" Much to my surprise, after reading this classic biography (winner of the 1960 Pulitzer Prize for Biography) by Samuel Eliot Morison, the godfather of US Naval history, Jones' exploits are both relatively unknown and relatively modest. There is, however, nothing relative or modest about Morison's biography, which is an excellently structured and wonderfully written piece of history that is a pleasure to read.How did Jones attain immortality for his role in the American Revolution while other leading military figures of the period (most notably, in this reviewer's opinion, General Nathaniel Greene) have nearly vanished from history? Jones' attachment to the United States, both as a nation and a cause, were slight, even dubious. He was born and raised in Scotland and didn't arrive in America until roughly 1775 (on the run from a murder trial, no less, which also prompted him to add the alias \\"Jones\\" to his birth name of John Paul). He never owned a home or even maintained a permanent resistance in his adopted land, and instead lived with friends or at hotels at government expense. During his forty-five years of life, Jones only spent about three of them on American soil -- and that time was divided among four brief visits. His commitment to the principles of the American Revolution are a bit suspect, although he did frequently claim to be a citizen of the world engaged in the fight for liberty. Nevertheless, when Catherine II of Imperial Russia, the ruler of the most despotic of European monarchies, dangled a much coveted flag officer position before him in 1788 Jones quickly jettisoned his liberal pretensions and jumped at the offer.If Jones lacked the deep American roots of a John Adams or the strong ideological convictions of more recent immigrants like Thomas Paine, he was at least a military hero, right? Well, sort of. Jones' major military exploits during the war can be summarized as follows: a partially successful raid on his hometown port of Whitehaven, Scotland followed by a botched kidnapping attempt and then the capture of a modest-sized British warship while cruising the Irish Sea aboard \\"Ranger\\" in 1778, and then the famous defeat of the \\"Serapis\\" off Flamborough Head in September 1779 aboard the \\"Bonhomme Richard.\\" Like Doolittle's Raid on Tokyo in 1942, the military value of these actions were minimal, but the psychological impact -- both at home and with the enemy -- was enormous. The British home islands had, afterall, been inviolable since a Dutch raid in 1667. Thus, Jones stands alone as the man who brought the American Revolution home to the British Isles, albeit in a way that caused little material damage.So, through a combination of moxie, luck and the general absence of anything else to cheer about, John Paul Jones -- one-time slave trader, murderer, Imperial Russian admiral, and alleged rapist of a 12-year-old (in his defense he swore, foreshadowing a future American scandal, that he \\"did not have sexual relations with that [girl],\\" although conceded that other amorous relations did occur) -- emerged as a bona fide hero of the American Revolution. Jones died alone, indigent and forgotten in Paris in 1792. But today his remains rest in an ornate tomb (modeled on Napoleon's) at the US Naval Academy and he is widely regarded as the father of the US Navy, which has become the global juggernaut he dreamed it would be.In closing, Morison does a remarkable job in capturing not only the essence of his subject-- Jones' native intelligence, egotism, insecurity and opportunism -- but also the pulse of life on the open ocean in an eighteenth century sailing vessel. The skill, experience, fortitude, and endurance it must have taken to guide these ships in battle and in treacherous seas with a motley collection of mutiny-inclined men as a crew is difficult to fathom. That Jones did so with such obvious success is, indeed, impressive. For readers with an interest in naval affairs or simply a love of sailing, this book would be a welcome addition to your library."},{"Title":"JOHN PAUL JONES A SAILORS BIOGRAPHY","review":"A hero of my youth, this book appears to tell the full story.

I recommend it."},{"Title":"JOHN PAUL JONES A SAILORS BIOGRAPHY","review":"A voluminous writer, including the lengthy \\"Oxford History of the American People\\", Samuel Eliot Morison is probably best remembered for his \\"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\\", a 1942 warts-and-all biography of Chistopher Columbus, in which he revealed, among other things, the great explorer's fondness for torturing animals. Morison's 1959 \\"John Paul Jones: A Sailor's Biography\\" is equally frank and detailed. Born John Paul in 1747 Scotland, the boy went to sea at the age of 13 to learn the profession and at 21 became the master of a merchant ship. For a brief while he engaged in the slave trade (on what was called a \\"blackbirder\\"), but he was turned off by both the moral question and the incredibly filthy conditions. By reading and socializing John Paul improved his mind and his manners, though Morison makes it clear he was always \\"a hard person to get along with\\". It was his bad temper that got him into legal hot water and caused him to add the \\"Jones\\" to his name while eluding the authorities. The name sort of came and went thoughout his life. An interesting point in the narrative is the fine line between pirating and privateering. Our hero was often accused of being a pirate, an accusation he resented, because all his exploits were supported by the government; and actually the only difference between the two occupations seems to have been official approval. Morison also depicts sea life in the late 18th Century unflinchingly. Shipboard existence could be brutal: seamen who signed on for \\"an agreable Voyage\\" were soon disillusioned by the disagreeable reality, and when a suspected mutineer receives 230 (!) lashes with a cat-o-nine-tails, the reader must wonder how the man survived. Jones' most famous exploit was the battle (described with diagrams) off Flamborough Head when he was commodore of the Bonhomme Richard and proclaimed his momentous declaration not at the conclusion of the battle, Morison assures us, but near the beginning. As for romance, the Captain had an active port life, seeming to prefer women who were already attached; he himself never married. More than once Morison hints that Jones was of a dashing appearance, but contemporary calculations put him at 5'5\\" (he probably suffered from what would later be called the Napoleonic Complex), and Houdon's bust reveals a sharp hatchet face. (The same year Morison's book was published the Brothers Warner released a biopic called \\"John Paul Jones\\", and who'd they cast in the lead? Six-foot, woodenly handsome Robert Stack. Leave it to Hollywood.) Jones' true love, of course, was America, and he continually endorsed a strong central Navy. Even though he died and was buried in Paris, his remains were eventually exhumed and replaced (appropriately) at the Naval Academy Chapel in Annapolis in an ornate sarcophagus that Morison admits was \\"more or less\\" based on that famous tomb in the Invalides. This is a intelligent biography, including 25 illustrations, with only one caveat: other reviewers have implied that the maritime vernacular gets awfully thick for the average reader, and this is true.

Then I tried it during car commutes via Audible audiobook for use in the car (a way I've used in the past the finally get \\"finished\\" with a fiction book I know I \\"should\\" read but had not had time to focus on) ... this got me through the book and it did eventually make a lightbulb go off (way past the 3rd quarter of the long story) that helped me see the fullness of the Macro-Life Cole concept that Cole had to greatly smoosh into two articles and an hour long presentation. Maybe that will help you, maybe not. But in any case, if you are looking for the Cole work itself - the one that obviously influenced O'Neill but I feel Gerrard missed some of the forrest for the trees, look for the Space World Magazine issues."},{"Title":"The Grammar of Conducting: A Practical Guide to Baton Technique and Orchestral Interpretation","review":"I'm taking an Elementary Conducting course and the professor called for the 3rd edition of this book, but I got this one because it is A LOT cheaper.

Initially a direct continuance from \`A Body in the Bathhouse' where the culprit who Marcus had exiled to Gaul, turns up in Londinium as the murdered party, secondly Marcus has a more personal reason for investigating the case. A step away from his usual informing, though it is given an official air by Hilarius and Frontinus, the Roman Britain procurator and governor, respectively. What Davis also does, is impose an even tighter deadline for Marcus to carry out his sleuthing, than in the preceding novel.After the somewhat muddied effort in \`Bathhouse', the Jupiter Myth is a better offering from Davis (however, I still believe Marcus is at his very best when operating in the familiar surroundings of Rome). It is, however, very slow after opening with Verovolcus' body headfirst in the Shower of Gold's well. By the end, it is ironic that this murder was more a catalyst for the remaining action, rather than particularly relevant. In fact, more effort is given to Marcus' search for Petro who inexplicably takes off over the first hundred-plus pages than any cohesive effort at establishing motive and suspects. Indeed, Petronius' behaviour doesn't match with the character Davis has so painstakingly created over the series. His rough treatment of Marcus, ordering him to stay out of it before he gets killed is blatantly ignored in the immediate as the pair begin to openly meet. I am still not entirely sure what the purpose of the scene was.Other than mutterings about a widespread protection racket and liberal descriptions of Londinium after Boudicca's revolt the book then stumbles through until we meet Marcus' old flame - the new gladiatrix Amzonia, more personally known as Chloris. It is at the point the entire novel is rescued as Davis' writing lifts, the action becomes precise, fast-flowing and Marcus becomes the fast-witted informer we all love.We leap from a battle in Londinium's wooden ampitheatre (Helena even gets involved with a pack of dogs), to ballistae at warehouses, legionary fights at locales to the breathless end with Petro's saving and Maia's somewhat exasperated final action.So, a tale of two parts. On the first part you could see a continuance of \`A Body in the Bathhouse' in that it was beoming more and more evident that Falco doesn't travel very well. However, in the second part, Davis rescues it with the final hours from Maia's \`capture' to the breaking of the racketeering gang. Perhaps this is due to the fact that, this time, Rome follows Falco to Britain and thus the easy familiarity is readily established. By the end of the novel Falco is back to his sleuthing best with plenty of action thrown in making this latest installment a delight to read. However, his insistence on going \`home' to Rome, gives hope that the whole of Falco's next installment (The Accusers) will be back to its very best."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"I generally like it when Falco goes out of town. Falco gets to make fun of the colonials, and Davis gets to descibe a new setting and (often) a different cuture. But Falco shouldn't be out of town for too long at a time.The Jupiter Myth was fairly well executed, but it had two major problems.First of all, Falco works best when he alternates between the provinces and Rome. Two books in the same province (Body In The Bathhouse, Jupiter Myth) are too much. Especially a province where he has already been (The Silver Pigs). It is obvious that for a British author there is a certain natural appeal to setting the books in Britain, but I'd rather see Falco continue to be on the move. The endless references to Britain's weather are somewhat trying (especially to a reader from a rainy climate, like me). I want to just shake Falco and tell him, &quot;Get over it, already!&quot;The second problem is the Helena dispute. It seems so forced. Falco has a rough past, but never once has he been anything but devoted to Helena since they first met. Why now would she suddenly take seriously a chance meeting with an old flame? I think Davis is looking for a substitution for the old tension between Falco and Helena from back before Falco was established enough for them to securely marry. This isn't the right way to do it, though. It just seems out of character for Helena.The story was also rather grim, almost as grim as The Silver Pigs. Beloved children die, mobsters corrupt the town, problems erupt between Helena and Marcus, a very morose Petro wanders around in a funk ... it certainly is not a happy story. Even for a murder mystery.On the whole, though, I liked it. Falco and Helena are still engaging characters, and their companions are all nicely three dimensional. I look forward to the return to Rome.Perhaps what is needed is a new perspective. I wonder what a Falco book would be like from Helena's point of view? Or Petro's?"},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"I was introduced to Falco through my daughter's Latin teacher, who loaned us all of the books except this one. I whipped through them all, loving Falco, Helena, and all the rest of the colorful characters. I also liked this one, though it was darker than the others. It might have been the gloomy/chilly/too hot weather (Falco is never happy about the weather!). It might have been the reports of the deaths of two children back in Rome, though I'm pretty sure this was a common occurance. It might just have been Falco's black mood through most of the book. He seemed to be sulking just a bit, wanting to go back to sunny Rome, not staying in murky Britain with his wife's relatives. Either way, I enjoyed it a lot. Fans of the Falco mysteries will, too. Beginners should start with the first one."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"Lindsey Davis is the author of the hugely popular series about Marcus Didius Falco, her detective from the first century, AD. This episode, occurring in 75AD relocates Falco and his family to Londinium, the Roman London of today. A hemchman of a tribal king is found drowned in a barrel. This places the Roamns in a diplomatic quandry as they must discover the murderer to satisfy the king. Falco is called upon to solve the crime. His investigation takes him to the dregs of this early settlement where we are treated to a virtual tour of London, 75AD.This is the second year in a row that Lindsey Davis has been nominated for the Ellis Peters Historical Dagger, an award she previously received. The problem that I had with the last book was a feeling that there was a general lack of authenticity. The characters and the locale was so remniscent of today that it just as well could have been a modern crime novel. This is almost certainly intentional on the part of the author. This is not the problem at all with this current volume. Londinium is described in loving detail. The early Londoner's recreation, entertainment, living arrangements, bars, shops are all rendered with care. What was perceived by myself as the major weakness of the last book is the major strength of this one. Characters are well known to the readers of the series including Falco's family. They are very well rendered and are another strength of this work. The major weakness is the tepid plot that barely holds this book together as we plod through the pages endlessly progressing to the uninspiring conclusion. I am not yet a fan of this series."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"Marcus Didius Falco and his family are waiting to return to Rome after a successful investigation in Britain when a body is discovered in a bar well. Falco is an informant so he gets the job of investigating. Unfortunately, the dead man was one Falco knew--a criminal. And Falco soon learns that the death is associated with a criminal gang that seems to have virtually taken over Roman London. Falco's problems escalate when his wife adopts a teenaged runaway girl, and when Falco himself runs into the lover he left behind--a beautiful acrobat who has become a female gladiator.In the first century A.D., Roman Britain is still fresh, Rome is still an expanding power, and Britain is the ragged edge of Empire. Still, Roman customs are being introduced to Britain--baths, gladiators, olives, and wine. And the gods, of course. But it takes a while for Falco to determine that there is a connection between all of the wineshops, whorehouses, and theaters named after Jupiter. The connection is the gang--a gang that is another very Roman innovation in Britain. And it turns out that Falco and his best friend Petronius Longus had faced that gang before, back in Rome.Author Lindsey Davis does a fine job drawing a picture of early Empire law enforcement. In each of the Falco books, Falco seems to emerge as a more interesting character and his relationship with Helena continues to deepen. Politics and corruption are not modern inventions and Davis describes the ancient version of the Mafia in intriguing detail. In THE JUPITER MYTH, Falco spends a lot of time chasing badguys, battling for his life and generally adventuring rather than sneakily crime-solving, but that doesn't keep MYTH from being an exciting story and even, occasionally, a heart-warming romance."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"\\"Spartacus\\" and JULIUS CAESAR meet \\"Goodfellas\\" in this Ancient Rome mystery that's literally classic noir. You can smell the wine and the sweat from a female gladiator named Amazonia, a.k.a. femme fatale (literally) Chloris, who's just one of the complications auditor and secret Roman Empire sleuth Marcus Didius Falco, happily maried to partner in solving crime Helena, runs into while on holiday in Britain after an old enemy, Verovolcus, who's connected to native Britain king Togidubnus, is found stuffed down a well in a gin, er, wine joint named the Shower of Gold, after the form Jupiter (that's Zeus to you Greek fans) took to seduce one of his many conquests.The description of ancient Romans living with ancient Britons is a vivid portrait of the age and the headaches of colonization. Marcus, formerly a man acquainted with the seamy side of life that old girlfriend Chrloris represents, now finds himself going up against it again when he uncovers evidence that Verovolcus' death may be linked to organized crime through a wimp of a mob boss whom Tony Soprano would whack on the spot. Not only that, the wimp boss in question has a personal grudge against hero and Falco friend L. Petronius Longus, who in turn has a personal, intimate tension with Falco's widowed sister Maia, who, in true noir tradition, reportedly is kidnapped by the mob in the book's final third.But all is not as it seems...and you'll have fun deciphering the ending with Marcus and his cast of strong women."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"After Marcus Didio Falco solved the mystery of A BODY IN THE BATHOUSE, the thirteenth book in the Marcus Didio Falco Mystery Series, the Falcos planned to remain in Londinium for a vacation, staying with relatives. Then, a man suspiciously drowns at a local pub and the Falcos learn they will be staying in Londinium a little longer than they'd first anticipated.Roman London, A.D. 75, is nothing like modern day London. It's primitive. With its imminent and endless downpours muddying the roads and the hearts and souls of its people, Londinium is the perfect setting for a murder mystery noir. The only smiles in this dark tale are those the reader leaks out in response to our sarcastic sleuth's wry comments to himself and others. How apropos that the unfortunate murder victim is drowned behind a pub on the wrong side of town.Solving the murder isn't the only mystery in town. Keeping track of the suspects and the story lines is like trying to watch sideshows at the Circus Maximus. Who was the murdered man and why is his demise of such interest to the king and to Rome? Who is the waif Marcus's wife, Helena, rescues from the streets? What is Marcus's best friend, Petro, doing in London and why is he hiding from Marcus? What does Jupiter have to do with London? Why would Amazonia, the infamous female gladiator, have Marcus seized by her troops?The plots are as thick with theories and red herrings as the streets and rivers of Londinium are with sludge, muck and bodies. Getting to know Marcus, his family and colleagues starting with this book, the fourteenth in the series, is like trying to understand I, Claudius beginning with its seventh episode. History buffs will enjoy the maps and historical references, noir fans will enjoy the ever-present gloom and disorder, and THE JUPITER MYTH will likely be best appreciated and enjoyed by faithful followers of the Marcus Didio Falco Mystery Series."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"Lindsey Davis is now well into double figures with her Falco novels. They say that most people have a good book inside them, but to be able to write consistently good novels with innovative plots is a gift.I believe it was a conscious effort on the part of Lindsey Davis to take Falco out of his normal surrounding and freshen her storylines up with a visit to Roman London.Of course no sooner has Marcus Didius Falco and his wife Helena, who's breeding and background should put her far out of the reach of a rascal like Falco hit the streets of Londinium than a body is found stuffed down the well of a wine bar.The unfortunate victim is a henchman of King Togidubnus an important ally of Rome.Falco needs to pull out all the stops to find the murderer and placate the powers that be, but many things are about to happen before the mystery can be solved.Keep it up Lindsey."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"Well, continuing right along in our visit to rainy barbarian Britain, now we are in dark and dingy London town in its early days, certainly before civilisation got a good foothold. There is hope, however, for what is the new appearance there of a Roman criminal gang but the other side of Roman civilization, a sign London was becoming worthwhile?Having resolved a problem with local ruler Togidubnus (in BODY), imperial agent Falco and his family intend to vacation with his patrician wife's cousins in London. \\"Intend\\" is the operative word. Falco soon stumbles on murder linked to that ruler, a protection racket, ugly enforcers, sharp practice, and shadowy bosses. Maybe these bosses are so shadowy because the setting is so often dark, muddy, and bleak--as life on the frontier must often have seemed to a true Roman.Davis's acerbic wit is entertainingly honed here; in recent books it's been too too. Its anachronistic and decidedly British slang can be excused by the nationalities of the setting and the author. Both these books (BODY and JUPITER) show an increasingly literal and explicit archaeological basis for her descriptions of place in her novels. With her map it provides a better sense of distance and effort to the story's actions, and a better sense they might really have happened. The Londinium map even shows us how it \\"maps onto\\" (or rather is buried under) the center of modern London. Remarkable! Falco's adventures read like a tourist's guide to ancient London, too, as he explores its scruffy byways from top to bottom, from court to cantina, from an arena with the trendy idea of female gladiators, to criminal hangouts along the fetid Thames.Falco and his police buddy, Petronius (who just happens to be in town on some unspecified mission), get into some very tight and dangerous corners. Long-time readers of this series will have noticed that Falco most readily gets into that sort of trouble when he hares off on his own. In his mind, noble causes often win out over caution or common sense teamwork, much to the frustration of his lovely wife, Helena. She is, once again, the most likable character in the whole series. With the children underfoot now, we don't see enough of her on the case.It will be good to be quit of Britannia once again, by Jove, and returning to Rome where Davis shines."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"Something odd happened with the previous Falco novel, 'A body in the bathhouse'. The series is generally very reliable, but it started to dive and reached bottom with that book. The Jupiter Myth is inevitably an improvement -- but not much. It's set in Londinium, but the plot is a retread of 'Time to Depart'. Somehow it grates. On the one hand, we expect Londinium to be pretty rural and basic. But on the other hand we have this crime syndicate operating, invisibly? This simply doesn't work. Helena is nagging Falco, which doesn't really work either.So it's hard to recommend this one. Buy one of the earlier ones: anything up to and including &quot;One virgin too many&quot;."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"I'm reading all of the Falco series and will admit that I like the stories set in Rome the best, that's why 4 stars instead of 5."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"This is another in the Falco series and a continuance of the previous tale &#34;The Body in the Bathhouse&#34;. Falco and family are still in Britian. They are now in Londinium visiting Helena's uncle and enjoying a well deserved rest before heading back to Rome. With Falco and his immediate family are his sister Maia and her children and Falco's old buddy, Petro. Thrown into this mix is the Governor of Britain, Frontius who is an old acquaintance of Falco (see Three Hands in the Fountain). Of course, things happen - there is a murder of some significance and Falco is called in to clean it up. As always there are a host of characters who provide vivid colour to the story and to the backdrop of a backwater colonial capital. The story is straight forward and not overly complex, however it is still enjoyable. There are several subplots that flavour the book, most of them focused about Petro. You also get to meet one of Falco's old girl friends. Overall, The Jupiter Myth is a nice, enjoyable read and a satisfying addition to the Falco series."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"First, the positive, Lindsey Davis has skillfully worked new discoveries of London in the time of Roman occupation into the fabric of an interesting plot centering on corruption and organized criminal enforcers. The author injects some humor by allowing the reader to contrast the London of today with the dingy alleys of drab Londinium.The bad news is that this novel is written well below Davis's usual standard with clumps of text in clumsy declarative sentences that are couched in passive construction. Even a fight scene in the arena, with criminals facing a band of female gladiators, is written in this flat colorless style. Passages of excellent writing would engage my interest and then suddenly I would be wading through dead prose as if the author was just going through the motions. It was like reading an outline with no life given to the characters and no urgency in the plot. I think the writer may lose some interest when her hero Marcus Didius Falco is working outside of Rome. I know I do. I almost gave this only two stars."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"I picked up my first Marcus Didius Falco novel when I wanted a tape to listen to while I drove or walked, and besides the plot, a couple of things drew me to this \\"reading\\" experience enough that I checked out this novel and two others.First, I enjoyed hearing about what life was like in the Roman empire, though I now want to read about actual life in the Roman empire (whether in Rome, Hispania, or Londinium, the only places I've read about so far), since I don't know how well the novels are grounded in facts. The crime detection sounds fairly modern (though without modern technology).Second, in the first tape I listened to, Falco sounded kind of like a guy from Brooklyn. In this novel, read by someone else, he has a bit more of a cockney accent. I kind of enjoy comparing the performances (and mispronunciations) of the various reader-performers, wondering whether a word that seems clearly mispronounced is because nobody bothered to correct a mispronunciation or because the British readers simply say words incredibly differently than American readers would.I did learn to check the book out of the library along with the taped recording, because in the front of the books is a map of things as they were at the time. I was a little confused without the map. I know, I know, we're supposed to buy the book, but I do not buy books on tape."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"The Romans stayed in Britian for four hundred years, but Falco has already been there too long. That's what is wrong with this book and the one before it. Rome is as much a character in this series as any of the humans. I can see where the idea of going to Celtic Britian where Falco had a past would be intriguing to an author, but it didn't work out very well."},{"Title":"The Jupiter Myth","review":"London Calling.Falco, fresh from rooting out corruption in the last book, decides to take the relatives on a trip to Londinium. Yes, that means dead people there, one of them known to the bloke Falco was sorting things out for previously.

The illustrations are mainly drawings (excellently presented) and some rather uninspiring black and white plates (photos).I have issues with the text, Mr. Audsley's language is extremely flowery. He makes comments about the organ in Sydney (for example) and its voicing (esp. the lack of swell boxes for non-swell divisions). To be sure this was an issue when the book is written but, he doesn't validate his comments by stating that he actually heard the beast in operation.The second criticism I make is this: if your French is not good the wonderful quotes contained will be meaningless. And certain ones are by the highly esteemed Cavaille-Coll and worthy of an appendix giving translations (which is missing).However, I adored Book 1 as its history of the organ is fascinating reading. Indeed, Volume 2 gets down to the nuts and bolts of design, acoustics, couplers, action, wind-chests, pneumatic levers ... et cetera et cetera.A wonderful tome, to be sure ... if you can tolerate the ponderous Edwardian language."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"Most grammar books are about as entertaining as reading all the text -- including footnotes -- in a sixteen-volume introduction to the history of the shower curtain.

For instance, what exactly is a chimera or a samovar? If you don't know, you can still learn from the book, but you will not get the humor. I would read a sample before purchasing.One of the nice touches this book has is the inclusion of margins. The author invites you to make notes and comments to help enhance the experience.

The example sentences for each gramamr rule are beautfully written and highly amusing. I laughed aloud often at some of the author's more bizarre creations. As far as grammar books, this one is clearly the most artistic and unique of an otherwise dry genre. The author is clearly an eloquent and accomplished writer.While the gothic illustrations and humorous sentences were entertaining, the art of the book tended to overshadow the instructional content of the book. I got the impression that only those who already have a solid knowledge of grammar and an appreciation for the language would benefit much from it. My knowledge of grammar was sadly lacking when I first checked out this book, and I found some other books far more helpful at explaining the material. The author of \\"The Deluxe Transitive Vampire\\" assumes a lot of her readers, and I suspect that she intended to cater more to those who already have an appreciation for the languange. For those who are in need of a good instructional grammar book, I would try \\"Grammatically Correct\\" by Anne Stilman.

You will need a hard core and detailed grammar book for that. And if you're just a grammar nut and love reading about it (like I am), you're probably going to be bored to tears.So who would this book be good for? Well, some of Gordon's grammatical explanations are quite original, so I would recommend this book for the classroom teacher of grammar who is looking for alternative phrasings of traditional rules. And for the motivated learner...If you struggle with grammar, this book might be fun for you to read through, and will probably serve as an excellent introduction to grammar. Don't be deceived, though--neither this nor any book is going to teach you to write. You will learn to write by reading great authors and attempting to immitate their writing, and by seeking out an editor/teacher--someone who will read your writing and give you personalized tips. It is nearly impossible for even the best of writers to edit their own writing, and you shouldn't read this book thinking that it will solve your grammatical woes.I think the greatest value this book has to offer is in its readability and ability to inspire (I hope). I recommend the book if you want an introduction to grammar, and I hope you will find yourself inspired to pursue further studies.aryln@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"I have long held the notion that grammar really isn't as bad as it's cracked up to be.

If that's that case it might deserve a higher rating. For people like myself who are very challenged in spelling, punctuation, and grammar it just isn't helpful.I purchased this book in hopes that it would give me a fun way to learn writing mechanics. I expected illustrations to guide me through the stickier spots in my work. This book does not have that. The pictures are cute (in a vampirey, gothic way) but they do not add much to the explanations.The index is really not usefully at all to someone who is clueless in grammar. Terms such as Past Perfect Progressive Tense and Subjective Complements mean nothing to me. After reading these sections - they still mean nothing to me. It would have been nice to see index entries such as: Who's vs. Whose or Past vs. Passed. These are not listed. I took some time to try and find these sections in the handbook, but couldn't.If you are grammar challenged like I am, skip this book."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"If nothing else The Transitive Vampire proves that if you want to sell books, a great title with a misleading premise beats a work of integrity with a mediocre title any day of the week.Credit though must be given to author Gordon for more or less inventing the gimmick: that is, implying the study of English grammar might actually be fun, not to mention kind of hip and sexy. The problem? The contrivance is a fraud. It's like claiming to have invented a perpetual motion machine. For let's be real folks--unless you are a major English geek (supposedly the book is mostly not intended for these people)--no matter how you slice it, studying grammar is a dead bore. Emphasis on dead. Like a vampire.Case in point. I did a \\"Surprise Me!\\" search. The first result (bottom of page 33): \\"A word that completes the meaning of a verb is the complement of the verb. Complements are either direct objects, indirect objects, or subjective or objective complements.\\" zzzzzzzzz. It gets worse. You see, no matter how many vampires you surround this stuff with, grammar just ain't fun or hip or cool or sexy or interesting or anything of the sort. It just isn't.Now to those lauded graphics. It may be all you need to know that the graphics are the main thing most people take away from this handbook. Geeks included. The recipe: insert old gothic line drawings from the public domain (this means it cost the author nothing), sprinkle them in a fun and sexy way throughout, and just don't mind that mostly they have nothing to do with the accompanying text. Or worse when the picture and the text seemed to be related but they're really not. Or are they? It's all so much fun! Almost as much fun as wrapping your mind around subjective and objective complements. And just in case your brain isn't twisting enough, Ms. Gordon will provide you with a semi-incoherent sentence example to sink your fangs into. (The one at the bottom of p.33 does not disappoint.)\\"A Handbook of Grammar for the Innocent, the Eager and the Doomed.\\" Whatever that means. A hipper-than-thou subtitle that manages even to outhip the superhip main title. Again, great concept. However, within the context of that concept -- that Karen Elizabeth Gordon has created a compelling, sexy, alternative adventure into the world of English grammar -- the result is rather a blood-sucking mess."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"Didn't care for the book.

It gradually draws you in with its quirky illustrations & clever examples, and then all of a sudden you are hooked! It's a great resource for anyone who loves a few gargoyles, werewolves and vampires with their grammar. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who struggles with grammar and needs a basic textbook. If you love language and you're already comfortable with the basics of English grammar, then this is perfect. In fact it is *delightful*.

Some pars were a little lacking, but the whimsical feeling of the book won me over."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"In case you couldn't figure it out from the title, this is a short prescriptive grammar of English. Its gimmick is that the examples have a silly gothic horror theme (\\"How wicked to behold you,\\" \\"The girl squatting under the bridge is a debutante\\"), and the text is interspersed with old woodcuts, which have absolutely no correlation with the text, or, often, with their own captions.The 1993 edition adds an index, which makes it much more useful than the original 1984 version.The level of the book is extremely basic. There is no discussion of the subjunctive, for example. There is also no room made for nuance: nothing about British versus American usage, house styles, levels of formality, or issues on which good writers can disagree (split infinitives, prepositions with nothing after them).The best thing about the book is that it's entertaining. The examples are strange and charming, and reading them is like eating bonbons. I plowed through the book in an hour, enjoying every minute of it. Unfortunately I didn't learn anything from the book that I didn't already know, and I don't think it's going to be particularly useful to me as a reference.Readers who want a grammar book for self-instruction will probably not want to use this book, since it lacks exercises. Readers whose native language is not English will probably have trouble following it, since the sophisticated style and vocabulary are mismatched to the basic level at which it discusses grammar. It might be a good choice for a bright teenager whose high school doesn't teach English grammar effectively."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"The subject of English grammar tends to conjure up vision of stern gray-haired teachers who look like they suck on lemons between classes. This book breaks the stereotype while achieving the almost impossible: making the acquisition of a firm grasp of grammatical conventions enjoyable.Starting with the basic of the sentence and progressing through parts of speech, and the nuances of verbs and pronouns, the illustrations attract the reader's attentions and the offbeat and tongue-in-cheek examples keep it. Progressing through more complicated structures and finishing off with sentence construction, this is the most fun I have ever had while reviewing sound grammatical style.The somewhat risqu&eacute; nature of some of the pictures and content keep this book from being a staple in the average classroom, but its judicious use can pique the interest of even the most grammar-adverse student.Personally, I would not allow any high school student to unrestricted access to this book because it would destroy the no-fun, sourpuss, and asexual image that English teachers have worked so hard and so long to create.

Some of the grammar lessons get lost in Ms. Gordon's desire to be bizarre. The clip art is ghoulish and not very well done.

As a basic primer for fundamental parts of English, it is simple enough to be a good review for those of us who have been out of school for several years.

It's very interesting, to say the least."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"In an essay from her collection Mama Makes Up Her Mind, Bailey White describes how she learned to get children to read. Teach them that they can find out really nasty, tragic things from books. Because despite what adults would like to believe, kids love that stuff. How else to explain the publishing phenomena of Goosebumps and Lemony Snicket.Karen Gordon seems to be using a similar tactic on the teaching of sentence structure with her book, The Deluxe Transitive Vampire: A Handbook of Grammar for the Innocent, the Eager, and the Doomed. (Now, that's a title.)In her introduction, Gordon states that she knows what \\"a dangerous game I'm playing\\" by illustrating the rules of grammar via \\"a menage of revolving lunatics kidnapped into this book.\\" However, she persuades that by following their stories, we will \\"be beguiled into compliance with the rules, however confounding those rules may appear to be.\\" She's right. This is absolutely the most fun I've had reading a grammar primer. The rules are written simply enough; this book's charm lies in its illustrative sentences--wonderful, gothic examples of subject and predicate, adjective and adverb, dependent and independent clauses. Sentences giving examples of a subject include:The persona non grata was rebuked.His huge, calm, intelligent hands wrestled with her confusion of lace.She goes on to give examples of nouns: Person (eavesdropper, ruffian, Peter Lorre), Place (Aix-en-Provence, Omsk, Mars), and Thing (marzipan, scum, haunch); as well participles and gerunds. This is a thorough look at all the rules necessary for proper communication. The examples make for curious reading, and when the sentences are captioning the numerous classical paintings and woodcuts scattered throughout, often provoke a laugh.Such as the simple picture of a lady's hand, with the legend \\"The hand that is languishing on the windowsill once was mine\\" (restrictive adjective clause); or the painting of the nude which illustrates the separation of independent clauses with a semi-colon and reads, \\"She wrapped herself up in an enigma; there was no other way to keep warm.\\"We need to know how to use this language we have, and use it well. And while we're relearning the proper usages, why not have fun doing it? Karen Gordon thinks we should. As the final sentence in the book states: \\"You must beckon the transitive vampire to your bedside and submit to his kisses thirstily.\\"Now that's a well-constructed sentence."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"You don't get Karen Elizabeth Gordon's language books for a complete reference on the English language; there are far more comprehensive guides than these. No, you get them because you're allured, nay, *seduced* by her prose, and because she has a flair for leading you on, then looking innocently on as you stumble over your own wicked thoughts.Gordon published her original *Transitive Vampire* in 1984, and it was a delight to read then. The newer edition, published in 1993, has only gotten better. There are more lurid examples and, of course, more of those pictures.This isn't to say that the book is devoid of useful grammar instruction. While copy editors are unlikely to find a use for this book, almost everyone else will find something here that they weren't aware of before, whether it's the rule on number agreement or the cases of pronouns.But the real value of Gordon's book is that it makes us actually want to read through it, and the grammar lessons seep into our ears almost by the way. Other grammar books are reference sources; this one reads more like a good novel, and is practically as hard to put down.Gordon's cast of characters include a dour but charming gargoyle named Jean-Pierre, the lovely Alyosha, assorted bats and demons, and even the Statue of Liberty. This gothic motley trundles through the book, whispering sweet nothings about verb tenses. At times, Gordon plays the vamp: &quot;The debutante rocks on her haunches and sucks her thumb.&quot;That alone ought to send some to their dictionaries, eagerly looking up what haunches are, and why a scantily clad debutante might be rocking on them.This book is a must for gothic logophiles--and anyone who isn't, might consider playing the part, if only for a night, just to read it."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"My grammar stinks, so I've read a few grammar books to help me out. Most of them are okay-- they've taught me a thing or two about punctuation, syntax, and so on--but the grammar book that stand outs the most is The Deluxe Transitive Vampire. What makes it exceptionally informative and even fun to read is that the author does not attempt to teach you the rules of grammar with boring and windy explanations. Instead, she teaches them with numerous examples of grammatically correct sentences to tell you how they should be written and grammatically incorrect sentences to tell you how they should not be written. This is the most effective approach to teaching grammar. Students will quickly and effortlessly acquire a deeper understanding of grammar."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"At age 54, starting to write for the first time, it seemed only natural to scour the shelves of my local purveyor of books for helpful references. Both the cover and the title of this book fairly leapt into my visual field, making it impossible to leave the vampire--or his debutante--on the shelf. Not only did it clearly answer my rather pedestrian questions about the various parts of speech, etc., it did so with gusto, elan, humor, and very clever self-defining plays on words. More importantly, Ms. Gordon's characters brought home to me WHY these various grammatical entities were essential, showing me ways to convey intent, innuendo, shadings of meaning, and so forth that have been immensely helpful.I recommend this book to writers, writers-manque, lovers of both the English language as well as linguistics in general. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"I am surprised at the negativity of some of these reviews (also of the author's other book! I think some people take grammar too seriously--it is not a religion.) This book is hysterically funny as well as being factual, but i guess it is not everyone's cup o'tea, so to speak. It does offer decent grammar instruction. The examples are random and bizarre but this is no liability, in my opinion. The stranger and more creative a sentence, the more I pay attention to it. Being an English teacher of gifted children, I can tell you that if I use bizarre and amusing grammar examples, students pay attention. Although I do not use concubines and gargoyles in my grammar lessons, I am inspired to be a little more creative when providing examples for my students. I think this book can help one to write well in many ways--it helps prove that grammar can be creative and interesting. It also helps to connect grammar to actual writing in that it is extremely creative and suggests a story or a plot. It also is a welcome relief from the &quot;drill and kill&quot; method taught when I was a student--that did not help me one bit. I wouldn't use this book to teach my kids, but I do prefer to reference it when I am checking something--it puts a smile on my face and puts me in a good mood. When tackling something as inherently boring and conservative as grammar, that is a plus!"},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"I hate reading about and teaching grammar; that's why I love this book. Gordon has transformed the boring rules of grammar into something unique and entertaining. My students are always pleasantly surprised when I give them Gordon's examples, and it helps all of us get through what would ordinarily be a grueling process. I think the illustrations for the example sentences are what make this book really come alive for the reader. It also helps that this book uses examples involving vampires, penguins, and hot flashes, things that we normally wouldn't expect to see in the same place. Gordon's book is also a great way to build vocabulary. Many of the words she uses are unfamiliar to the average college freshman, so I give my students extra credit vocabulary assignments from her examples. As previous reviewers have said, this book is by no means the best grammar book out there -- in some cases, a quick-reference guide may be more useful -- but it's one of the more entertaining guides."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"It's a rare quality that a textbook - for that is, essentially, what Karen Elizabeth Gordon's &quot;Deluxe Transitive Vampire&quot; is - can actually entertain the reader as well. It's even more rare to find a book that actually makes something as dull and obtuse as English Grammar seem interesting and - dare I say it - fun?I was introduced to this book as part of a college-level grammar class that I'd been putting off until my senior year. Although I fancy myself a decent writer, I couldn't tell anyone what a gerund was, or how to diagram a sentence, to save my life. I knew the rules of grammar intuitively, but I just didn't know what they were called. I'd be lying if I said this book taught me, but it certainly set me on the right path, and took away a good deal of the dread of looking such things up.Illustrated liberally with a spattering of Victorian-style Gothic imagery, and incorporating semi-stories about vampires, debutantes, trolls, and tea parties, the Deluxe Transitive Vampire is a great guide to grammar, from the simplest rules about nouns and verbs to the most abtract, outlandish little &quot;English-isms&quot; in our language. It's a pleasure to browse through, and when you have to turn to it, it never fails to bring a chuckle (or a shudder).Deluxe Transitive Vampire belongs on any writer's shelf, between the Stunk and White and the Thesaurus."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"A book that describes verbs as the heartthrobs of sentences can't be all bad. With vivid imagery in grammatical examples and exhortations, one can effortlessly gobble up this book before you know it, licking your lips with verbal blood. Gordon is =thorough=, naming grammatical entities I never knew even had names (often very suggestive names, too - expletive nouns and copulative verbs. I suppose Mom was right - there =are= naughty words!)However, I would suggest this as a start to investigating grammar and writing style. Gordon's explanations are truly bare bones; for example, she simply indicates one will be chastised for splitting infinitives, but doesn't indicate =why= splitting infinitives is seen as wrong. The reason why: 17th and 18th century grammarians decided that English grammar should be logical. Since the most logical language they knew was formal Latin, and since one couldn't split infinitives in Latin (because they are one word in that language), they decided that one shouldn't be able to split infinitives in English, either. However, &quot;to go boldly&quot; has a whimper of an impact compared to &quot;to boldly go&quot;. Similarly, grammarians did away with double negatives and duplicated superlatives (native to the English language, back to the Old English) for added emphasis. Why don't =you= tell the Rolling Stones they should've sang &quot;I Can't Get Any Satisfaction&quot;, and then you can tell Shakespeare to cut out &quot;most&quot; of &quot;the most unkindest cut of all&quot;.However, you can't go wrong with the grammatical and stylistic rules found in Gordon's Gothic grammar; it's a great place to begin, and one is entertained in the process. If one doesn't know how to work within those rules, one can't tell when it is legitimate to break them. So why don't you boldly go and get satisfaction from this book?"},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"My Muse was very taken by this book...she positively squealed with rapture! With its wicked, witty and eccentric cast of characters, The Deluxe Transitive Vampire is the most delightful handbook of English grammar that I have ever had the pleasure of reading.That's right. I said handbook of English grammar.Through whimsical prose and exceptional cleverness, author Karen Elizabeth Gordon beguiles even the most stubborn grammar-hater into a happy understanding of the tricks and turns of the English language. The example sentences not only illustrate usage, but also intimate a shadowy and fanciful tale populated by dope fiends, Debutante, wolf, bat, baby vampire, mastadon, lamia, courtesan and pizza chef. Presented as the vaguest outlines of a captivating gothic narrative, these stories are less explicated than tantalizingly hinted at. The Deluxe Transitive Vampire is a feast for the imagination.This book is a delightful introduction to the rich and varied, though often reviled, subject of grammar. It is, however, only an introduction, and Gordon does not draw as clear a distinction between formal and demotic usage as one might hope for. Even so, I venture to say only the most Procrustean of grammarians will fail to be charmed by this clever and delightful volume."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"It must have been quite a challenge writing a book that would be predominately read by all of us stick-in-the-mud grammar teachers. I think Gordon does a great job of catching the reader's attention while teaching some very (I'm sorry but it's true) dry material. I teach it, and even I hate reading about it!By no stretch of the imagination is this the best book on grammar out. Nor is this the best book written on the subject. I would equate it to a grammar coffee break. It's useful, but also pleasant. If you want a hyper-organized, get the answer quick reference book this is a poor choice. If, however, you want a fresh source of ideas to present to your hyperactive, low attention span, immediate gratification students you may find this quite a bit more useful that diagramming you millionth sentence."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"I found this to be an excellent addition to the curriculum when I was teaching English abroad.

It will probably hold their interest, and they'll probably learn something.

The book covers only the most basic principles of the English language -- another disappointment for someone who went to school to learn the basics, but might want more from a book like this. Even the clip-art was badly placed and only added to the general feeling that the book was tossed together quickly, cheaply, and without the focus necessary to be informative.

Instead, it is a mini-review prompted by the desire to further what we must assume to be one of the book's purposes, namely to promote correct usage.Much, maybe a majority, of the text is one-sentence examples.

It's not one of those technical manuals that will answer the quick question you have about that pesky comma. It's going to teach you why the comma is there and how to identify the parts of your sentence with the fluency to rearrange them for greater effect, thus avoiding having to include that comma at all. It wasn't all sunshine and roses, though, from the point of view of a grammatical craftsman who likes to compare constructions in French, German, Latin, and ancient Greek. Gordon swept the differentiation of tense from aspect under the rug, and the book was completely lacking a discussion of mood. Since that's kind of an enormous gaping hole in an otherwise charming, illustrative, and exhaustive book, I have to go 4 stars instead of 5."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"I absolutely love this grammar book, and I give it five stars even though the narrative (that is, the non-example parts of the book) falls short on definition at times. For example, under Subjective Complement, the author says: \\"A subjective complement comes hot on the heels of a linking verb to explain or identify the subject. If the subjective complement is a noun, it is called a 'predicate noun.'\\" This statement is followed by nine examples, including \\"That grande dame was once my COMPATRIOT\\" (my caps, to indicate the author's italics) and \\"A tingle is a PLEASURE.\\"In the example above, the author's definition does not define what a subjective complement IS, merely where it IS PLACED in a sentence. To be fair, if a reader went back two pages, she or he would learn that \\"a word that completes the meaning of a verb in a sentence is the complement of the verb.\\"Definitions such as that given by Constance Hale in Sin and Syntax are more precise, accurate, and clear, and therefore help educate better. The way that Hale handles the subjective complement is to teach it as part of a simple sentence pattern, S + LV + C, and to say: \\"In the fourth simple sentence pattern, the subject is paired with a linking verb, which is followed by a noun or an adjective called a complement. . . . The linking verb sets up a kind of 'relationship of equals' between the subject and the complement.\\"Nevertheless, the The Deluxe Transitive Vampire is an excellent book, with numerous examples of what is meant. All of the examples are witty, or funny, or intriguing, in a way that most grammar examples are Not! So one of the appeals of The Deluxe Transitive Vampire is that users will become so bewitched by the sentences that they will try to emulate them, and will continue to consult the book. I have seen this happen with students, and I have seen the delight they take in understanding the sentences, and so I give this book five stars."},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire","review":"It's a great book for reviewing grammer basics.

The treatment is more basic than S&W;, beginning with a review of the parts of speech, working through prepositional phrases and clauses, moving on to parallel structure, verb agreement, and so on, and concluding with a chapter of weakly-constructed sentences and suggested improvements. The \\"vampire\\" part is the examples, which range from the sublime to the truly bizarre. How can you not like a grammar book that uses examples like \\"The debutante in the Dior dress was nuzzling the gargoyle\\" (illustrating proper phrase placement) or \\"The hand that is languishing on the windowsill once was mine\\" (use of the nonrestrictive adjective clause) or \\"In her rickety garret, which was crawling with rats, she lay dreaming of biceps and divorce\\" (proper sentence structure)?We can't say what a transitive vampire is relative to the other kind, but if it helps you remember the difference between a coordinate conjunction and a conjunctive adverb then we say it has earned its keep.

Another is the sheer volume of examples that give more reason to slip in some more bizarre words.What I found a bit lacking was crisp definition of some terms and rules. Some times the author was spot on when she decided to elaborate further, whereas with others the examples and a few introductory sentences didn't quite cover the subject.

In this book are two separate stories about two officers' difficult roles in command. In &quot;His Battalion&quot;, the seasoned Captain Voloshin must lead his force in a hastily-planned attack on a well-fortified German stronghold. So undermanned is his battalion, that he must place the pregnant corpsman as ranking officer in command of one unit. In &quot;Live Until Dawn&quot;, inexperienced but impetuous young lieutenant Ivanovski leads his ski-mounted team in a night raid to destroy a German munitions-dump. After a late start and a series of deadly mishaps, his dream of glorious victory is reduced to a final hard reality: he must survive until daylight to sell his own life as dearly as possible. Both of these stories spotlight the desperate conditions during the War and the tragic cost in Russian lives for the smallest gains. As a writer during the post-Stalin period, Bykov is not afraid to point an accusing finger at the deficiencies of the regime and its toll on the Soviet defenders. But beyond that, Bykov's sympathetic characters, through their thoughts and remeniscences, give the reader a glimpse of the humanity and comaraderie of soldiers struggling for their country's survival."},{"Title":"His Battalion ; And, Live Until Dawn (Contemporary Russian Writing)","review":"Please, note, original language is BELARUSIAN, not Russian.Vasil Bykau - belarusian patriot, who wrote his books in Belarusian language."},{"Title":"Video Field Production and Editing (6th Edition)","review":"This is a good book according to our very experienced professor.

Having said that, it is very well researched and very well written, and you REALLY do have to finish it, although I had to persevere to about 90% {Kindle e-reader} - then &#34;the plot thickens&#34; and events unfold. I would recomend it to anyone with a forensic medical/legal interest."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"I'm a huge Jeffery Deaver fan however, this book lacked his usual excitement and suspense....I know he wrote it a long time ago and then rewrote it but it is still lacking the usual Jeffery Deaver touch I expected ...."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"Another fine accomplishment..... I can't get enough.. write faster. Now that it's over what am I to do till your next one?"},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"Like all his books and his writing you will not be disappointed, the Lincoln Rhymes series is worth reading form the beginning"},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"I usually can't put Jeffrey Deaver's books down, but this one was, although entertaining, was not a page turner - so I was a bit disappointed."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"I love everything Jeffery Deaver writes. This is not the best of Deaver but it was a good read with the usual twists and details."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"I love this author, but this book was definitely on of his best as far as unexpected turns in the plot. As always I am looking forward to his next work of fiction."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"Deaver is a great author but he hadn't yet hit his stride with this one. It lacks things that are abundant in his other novels ... believability, humor, page turning compulsion. In Mistress of Justice, the characters have no talent or history for the amateur detective work they undertake....just lots of spunk and luck (and absence of contemporary corporate security provisions.)"},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"Well before Jeffery Deaver gained a considerable following with his lengthy Lincoln Rhyme series, popularized by the movie based on the first in that set, \\"The Bone Collector\\" (with Denzel Washington as Rhyme), he authored two shorter series of books: \\"Rune\\" and \\"John Pellam {Location Scout}. He also penned several standalone novels of suspense, \\"Justice\\" being the first. Although the original story was published in 1992, Deaver admits to totally recreating it in this 2002 edition to make it more of a thriller. Written in two parts, the nearly 300-page first part describes a big NYC high-rise law firm (almost ala Grisham's \\"Firm\\") that is in the midst of a proposed merger that is little better than a mutiny. One of the prominent partners, Mitchell Reese, has enlisted paralegal Ms. Taylor Lockwood to help find a missing document that might stave off the merger. As she hunts for the insider responsible, she uncovers all manner of office treachery, illicit affairs, and other skullduggery occurring both inside and outside the firm, leading to some fateful outcomes in a related trial about the document. Then in the roughly 100-page part 2, Taylor rethinks some of the earlier events and makes further discoveries about who did what to whom!While we didn't get to read the original, we'll agree Deaver has provided us the intended roller coaster ride of a plot. Whether the sleuthing machinations of the otherwise amateur Lockwood might be debatable, the story did move right along, strewing red herrings left and right along the way. We suspect most readers will indeed find \\"Justice\\" to be a suitably suspenseful early entry in the Deaver bibliography."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"I started out with Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme series and have gone back to read his earlier books. Not all of his early books are as enjoyable as his recent offerings. But I was surprised with this one. It sat on my shelf for awhile before I finally got around to reading it. I shouldn't have waited so long. Taylor Lockwood has to find a stolen $25 million promisssary note of Mitchell Reece loses his case and is out of a job. She is a great strong female character, whose amateurish sleuthing is amusing. Finally, just when you think you've figured out who stole the note, you're in for one surprise and then another. This book hints at the great things to come from Jeff Deaver."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"these early Deaver re-issues are turning out as real gems among his back-catalogue. I can say with complete confidence that Jeffery Deaver has not once written a bad, unenjoyable book.Deaver's writing style is concise and addictive. It's clever, quirky and enjoyable. His plots are well devised and well structured. They run smoothly and without a hitch.This is a very good, very hig-class legal thriller, better than almost anything by John Grisham. the plot is complex and intriguing, and the lead character is very human and very likeable, with some very distinctive quirks which make her a pleasure to read about.The book moves at great pace, and is a true page-turner. There are a couple of nice twists along the way, and, as is usual with Deaver, one final wallop right at the end.Another very good book from Deaver...not quite his best, but i still reccomend that you read it. As i do with all his books."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"This book seems to have been written by Jeffrey Deaver just prior to his full acquisition of the unique style, creativity, pace and humor that marked his later works. The Lincoln Rhyme novels, for example. All of them employ Jeffrey's formidable writing skills, and are tremendously entertaining on many levels. Mistress of Justice falls short of these expectations, however. I got only halfway through it, skimmed the rest, then went right to the ending - which was predictable. Never thought I'd do that with one of Jeffrey's books, and I have read nearly all of them. The problems with this book are many. The pace is very slow. The plot - not very strong. Too many characters are introduced, too quickly. Too much writing space devoted to non-essential details. But there also seems to be a snooty, snobbish tone to the entire book - almost as if Jeffrey had written it to impress his cronies in the lawyering arena of NYC. While I was reading - I failed to find anyone in the story to admire, to cheer for, and more importantly, to identify with. Although some may be fascinated by that particular class-based New York / New England culture of old money, politics and snobbishness, I am not. Yet Jeffrey revelled in laying this all out in a manner that suggested the reader should love and embrace this culture. Fortunately, Jeffrey moved away from this style in his later novels - all of which are marked by rich characters, from life's many diverse walkways. Mistress of Justice reinforced my belief that you cannot hit a home run every time up - and that's fine. And, I am grateful that the mistakes made in this novel are not found in any of Jeffrey's later works. If you are as big a Jeffrey Deaver fan as I am - and you have not yet read Mistress of Justice - steel yourself for possible disappointment."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"I found this, on the whole, an enjoyable read. After a suspenseful opening, it took a while for the plot to grab me again--perhaps because the issues at stake didn't seem to be of life-or-death importance. The excitement level picked up, however, as the story progressed. The writing is excellent, the main protagonist a well-drawn character.But none of the intended surprises caught me off guard, not even what was meant to be the biggest. Is this the fault of the book (a plot conceived some dozen years ago, however the author has sought to improve it), or of my having read too much Deaver lately? I honestly can't say."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"This is my first Deaver book I have read. Good thing, I borrowed the book from the library. First half of the book was slow and not real interesting until the plot gets more interesting from second half of the book till the end. I didn't figure out the correct suspect until I almost reached the end. The suspense is great, but the story and wordings could have been better. I guess that's understandable since this one was one of author's earlier books. I hope his later books are better as other people say."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"Deaver's plot in Mistress of Justice is very elaborate and chaotic. The finger is pointed at so many people and there is so much going on that I struggled to keep track. If part of the fun for you is figuring out \\"whodunit\\", I suggest taking notes right from the start. Even with notes, I think only the very astute reader will figure out the real culprit."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"This novel was initially written in 1992 and the author modified it and updated the work ten years later. It is one of his better works, yet does appear to have a limited audience. The book is well researched and centers around the personalities in a large Wall Street Law Firm. The characters have depth and become richer as the work progresses. A good part of the book is spent in introducing the reader to the main vharacters and establishing the plot. Once the reader passes this, the book takes off rapidly and mixes suspense with a legal thriller that is difficult to put down. The writer is able to skilfully bring the reader into the world of his characters. When it appears that one has figured out the dorection of the writer, he is able to throw in unexpected twists that keep this book moving along at a rapid pace."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"This book is nowhere near as good as Deaver's other work, before or after this novel. The \\"goings on\\" at the lawfirm are too exaggerated to make the story believable. Rather than serious fiction, it seemed more like bad comedy at times. Read one of Deaver's other novels for a treat, but skip this one."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"A law book with a thousand turns. Like every Deaver book you just never know. I found I couldn't put this down, and started to sneak just another few pages. Don't try and guess where it's going - just enjoy. And then read all his other books. I haven't been disappointed yet, and can't wait to find another."},{"Title":"Mistress of Justice","review":"Clever. Edge of the seat read. As usual Mr. Deaver never fails to keep me reading. Already on to another one."},{"Title":"Half mile down","review":"If you love the sea and adventure, this book is for you! Beebe takes you down into the depths as he witnesses deep sea species live for the first time. You feel like you are there in his bathysphere with him."},{"Title":"Interest Rate Models: An Introduction","review":"The book assumes that you've done some stochastic analysis courses before. You need to be familiar with Girsanov's theorem (change of measure) and some PDE theories (Feynman-Kac) to better understand the materials. The book starts with the introduction of instruments in the interest rate market. Then before introducing the continuous-time models, it shows how to price interest rate derivatives/ZCB in a binomial model, the classical Ho/Lee model is also introduced. The chapter on short-rate models is good, it shows 2 different ways to price zero-coupon bonds, martingale approach and the PDE approach. The book even proves ZCB/options on ZCB under the Vasicek and CIR models (in the appendices). More recent developments such as LIBOR/HJM are also introduced.The book might be a littel bit difficult to read at the start (formal maths), however, it rewards perseverance.P.S. the solutions to the exercises of chapters 1-5 can be found from A.Cairn's web-page.P.S.2 note that the book does not give any details on implementing different interest rate models in practice."},{"Title":"Interest Rate Models: An Introduction","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. The exposition is very nice and clear, one is not bogged down with too complicated calculations of too complicated models. It's a shame that there are no solutions to end of chapter exercises though. Hence one star down."},{"Title":"Interest Rate Models: An Introduction","review":"A light-weighted text book for students taking IR model class.

This one gives a clear and easy to follow chapters in order to increase your knowledge of this not easy field. The formality is a key point in all the book."},{"Title":"The Longhorns","review":"This book is classic Dobie in style and is &quot;the&quot; book on Texas Longhorns. Dobie takes us through the history of the breed, through the animal, through the men and women that loved, used and abused them, and through the many tales that surround them, both fiction and fact. The animal stands large in this work, but the flavor of the old days, of the hardships, of the ranch life, of the love for the land of the people who lived and died there is a part of it too. For anyone with an interest in this breed, this book is a must read. For anyone else with a feel for the Southwestern United States, Texas, cowboys, or the land, it's time well spent."},{"Title":"The Longhorns","review":"Frank Dobie, a University of Texas professor, spent years collecting stories of the old southwest. Many are tales that he wrote down of 19th Century life. Several are collected into volumes about important parts of life at the time, including &quot;Longhorns&quot; and &quot;The Mustangs&quot;.They provide great insight into the origin of those animals and their importance to people who lived in those times.Another excellent Dobie book is &quot;I'll Tell You a Tale,&quot; with excerpts from these two books and others. The anthology includes tales of gold, stories of irony, Old West characters, and saddle stories."},{"Title":"The Longhorns","review":"J. Frank Dobie spent his life documenting the grassroots history of Texas and this book is probably his finest examples. I've read all of his books and found this one to be the most informative. There's also a wonderful collection of photographs of many of the different variations of horn and hide at the rear of this book. You'll learn how the cattle came north from Mexico in the beginning and how early settlers rooted them out of the thickets of East Texas to start their herds. You'll learn about many of the principal cattlemen of early Texas including their drives north to the Kansas railhead.If you enjoy Texas history you'll really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Longhorns","review":"THIS BOOK WAS GREAT COLLECTION OF STORIES ON THE LONGHORN. IT STARTES WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF CATTLE AND HOW THE LONG HORN CAME TO BE.

There are different editions of this paperbook out there, so be aware. In case you are wondering what the difference is between the University of Texas Press edition and the Grosset's Universal Library edition, while the text is the same, the U of Texas paperback has 16 pages of actual photos of longhorns inserted behind page 346 (the photo pages aren't numbered) and the Grosset edition doesn't.Definitely worth it to get a copy with the photos... some go back as far as 1899 with others from the 20's and 30's.
