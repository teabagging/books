While the basic premise about the costs of globalization rings true, the narrative is so implausible that I immediately began searching for factual errors that might betray this as a counterfeit.The first of these I may have found is his description of a puppet show in Java. He does not specify whether this is wayang kulit--the traditional leather shadow puppet--or wayang golek, the less common marionette-like 3d puppet, but from his statement that the dalang had over 100 puppets I assume he is describing the flat wayang kult puppets, since 100 wayang golek puppets would take up a huge amount of space.From my brief exposure to wayang kulit, I know the dalang (the puppeteer)can make the puppets appear to do amazing things: fight, dance, fly, engage in complex battle scenes, etc. But his description of the puppets' actions seem impossible to achieve with flat shadow puppets: Nixon lifting Vietnam off of a hook, putting it in his mouth and then throwing it in a bucket, for example.More troubling, he describes the dalang as playing all the music on a \\"gamalong, an instrument that conjures images of temple bells.\\" As far as I have been able to determine, the only common alternate spelling of \\"gamelan\\" is \\"gamalang\\" with an \\"a\\", and it is very infrequently used. Furthermore, while a gamelan IS often described as a single instrument by the Javanese and Balinese, it is what westerners would more likely describe as an orchestra, with individual instruments played by multiple musicians. The dalang is typically the conductor of the gamelan--he signals the players using a wooden peg held between his toes as I recall--but I don't believe he typically plays any instrument. In any event, he could NOT play an entire gamelan. (Perhaps this is a typo for gambang, one of the instruments in a gamelan, which conceivably could be played by a dalang, though I doubt he could play and perform simultaneously.)And while it is certainly true that dalangs are ascribed extensive magical powers, I am troubled by the author's statement that \\"I later learned that the dalang is a shaman who does his work in a trance\\"; while this may be a folk belief, my own admittedly limited experience of dalangs is that they are extremely conscious and focused performing artists and teachers, and are regarded as such by most sophisticated observers.In sum, this whole scene sounds wrong to me, as though the author not only had not seen an Indonesian puppet performance but perhaps had not spent very much time in Indonesia. I would like to believe otherwise, so I am asking if anyone has ever witnessed a wayang performance that matches in any respect the description in the book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book lacks meat. I read \\"The Secret Money Market\\" by Inco Walter and it gives a much better account of what Perkins is trying to describe. The book is 300+ pages but only about 50 should be of any use to anyone. What perplexes me about this book is that Perkins doesn't seem to know that 9/11 was an obvious inside job. How could he be an EHM (Economic Hit Man) and not know this? Or if he did know it, why didn't he describe it as another move by the jackals or the assassins or other EHM to position us (the USA citizens) to support Israels designs on Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, and the rest of the middle east?Also, he rants over and over again about how the oil companies have destroyed the rain forest. How? Drilling an oil well takes a relatively small acreage. In the Gulf of Mexico and other offshore sites it takes virtually no acreage at all. Finally, he seems to have the same confusion as most environmentalists and do-gooders about wealth and poverty. He seems to see it as a zero sum game. It's not. As a nation makes more efficient use of its human and natural resources, all citizens have an opportunity for a more satisfying life. The fact they don't all get it is not a function of wealth (as Perkins himself shows by being wealthy but feeling guilty)."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I admit this is a touching story of how the author was a very bad man, but one day woke up and became a compassionate liberal.

I would give the author more credit if he had facts, but it this is the economic version of a Kitty Kelly book.This book is about the evil corporate empires that never do anything good for the poor, like provide jobs and cheap prices for quality products, and the corrupt government that bribes people for oil and other things in their interest.

If you're an adult with any life or business experience you'll see this book for what it is. Mainly the self-promotion of a mentally unbalanced individual railing against globalism, capitalism, competition, and the usual bugbears of the leftist establishment. He complains of the 'system' at the same time bragging on his alledged exploits. While short on facts or ANY specific details the book is still sometimes interesting. A good read while needing to waste time (like on a airplane or train) since the writing is simple and there are no complex ideas or words to get in the way of a fantastical story of one man's midlife crisis. However, despite his tortured hand-wringing over the morality of profits and competition it is unclear what his beliefs in fact are! During parts of the book he complains about nationalism, profit, and his jobs. However he also frequently praises nationalism- especially when its the anti-American kind- and he obviously, according to his claims, profited from his participation in this 'evil' system."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This author simply doesn't understand major league international finance.

HUH? This guy is nuts. I suppose he also thinks the objective of the TVA was to widen the gap between the rich and the poor. I can assure Perkins that the intent of private sector lenders is to get their money back with interest and the intent of the rating agencies is to analyse and critic objectively the work of feasibility studies. Maybe he just worked for a bad apple. He admitted that he was a bad apple. Now he is trying to capitalize on it. A shame.

Yep, for sure, Perkins made it all up! Well, at least the important parts. I know that for a fact because I'm also an economic consultant who has worked in the field for more years than Perkins and has never encountered any of bizarre, but entertaining, goings-on he alleges.Readers should not be taken in by John Perkins claim to be an Economic Hit Man. Such a being does not exist except in his over-active imagination. As for the man himself, I'm still undecided if he's a certifiable New Age nutcase or a cynical charlatan, or maybe both. But in any event, he would be well advised to stick to writing about his specialties of shamanism and dream traveling and leave the economics and politics of development to those who know more about the field than his preposterous conspiracy theories."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"There is a book drive going on in my building right now. There is plenty of space on my new bookshelf. I never throw away books.I would not give this book to a friend or a stranger. I would not put this book next to other works by real authors with real and instructive things to say. I summarily placed this work in the trash bin and regret it not for a nanosecond.The easiest book to put down in my reading career, some thousand or so and counting. I am trashing this work something fierce, I know. It's just that bad.Perkins is not a credible voice. His confessions are inelegantly and awkwardly sourced from creative writing 101, plot template X. Any good professor would give him an F for his specious claims of non-fiction, a D for re-labelling it fiction, and seek his expulsion for subsequent protestations of first-person liberties and economic expertise.I tortured myself through 2/3 of this book only because I pride myself in my bookstore selection skills. Boy, did I get it wrong this time. When I finally accepted my mistake, I slapped the book shut and tossed it into the oblivion history will applaud and prove to follow.For all those worried about Mr. Perkins safety from those who would silence him, rest comfortably. There is no way anybody anywhere lifted a finger to stop this nonsense from being published. It's not that there is a lack of proof to his claims. His claims never derive from any specificity about anything whatsoever. The actors of purported significance ar just that, products of his script. There should probably be a committee of ethical librarians, publishers, custodians or something somewhere who protect us from these sorts of fanciful America-bashing, ego-dramas.If you want to know about economics, read Michael Porter and his Comparative Advantage, or some work that actually educates you about the science of economics or the objective of free markets. If you blindly and blithely follow Perkins' view of the world, go ahead. But, if you want to know why the third world is behind the first world, it's not because of some American conspiracy. Try reading Robert Wright's Non-Zero: The Logic of Human Destiny. It explains that the world Perkins thinks he knows so well is driven by win-lose transactions, not win-win, the kind of world that Americans know and seek to expand. Now, Perkins works tirelessly to impose losses on America so the third world can win. He's as misguided now in his fakely contrite way as he was when he was imagining this life he formerly lived."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book proves Mr. Perkins either needs therapy or should have been a Liberal Arts Major in college.

Out."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am willing to believe that the US Government has done some awful things over the last several decades (in fact, we know they have done). And so, Perkins' story is somewhat plausible. However, in reading it, I did not feel that it has the \\"Ring of Truth\\" that I look for in such an account.Perkins is making some fairly strong accusations/statements about our government. Carl Sagan often said that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and of course Perkins cannot provide that -- we just have his unverifiable anecdotes. Perkins' narrative is framed in such a dramatic fashion, complete with quotes from conversations from the mid-to-late-seventies, that it feels slightly embellished or re-imagined. He includes details, like people taking significant pauses or how their smiles looked, that simply wouldn't be a part of any journaling/note-taking he would've done at the time. Those are details he's adding for color. And, in a work of this kind, I expect scrupulous attention to the truth.Despite his unsavory role, Perkins always manages to describe himself as something of a hero in whatever circumstances he finds himself. Locals in every region take to him as being \\"the American who *gets it*\\", bring him in and share their secrets with him without reservation. It's too convenient. Perkins' NSA-ish contact, Claudine, is straight out of a Bond film. Why would the NSA put so much trust in a Peace Corps. volunteer with a BA in Business Management? Perkins says it's because his NSA screening test showed him to be dissolute enough to make the grade, but I imagine that there are a host of low-moral college kids that the government wouldn't bring in to the innermost cabals, straight out of school. Also, Perkins insists that Economic Hit Man is an actual job title... it makes no sense; usually, positions that people want to keep hidden are given *euphemisms* not titles that make them sound more incendiary than they actually are. Nixon's thugs were called \\"plumbers,\\" not \\"political hit men,\\" and actual hit men sometimes call themselves \\"cleaners\\" or such. Perkins' details seem off.Finally, if we buy into the least part of Perkins' tales, we have to realize that he's admitting to the following: that he has for the greater part of his life acquired wealth and status by lying to people's faces, time and time again. I understand that people can change, and maybe Perkins has, but I think we must be open to the possibility that... he might be willing to lie for a buck just one more time.I give this book one star because, while it's readable and enjoyable, and has some good information inside... I don't think it's honest. And a book of this kind must be honest, or it is worse than worthless -- it is a travesty."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I don't doubt the main premise behind this book: the world financial market and leading financial institutions seek to dominate emerging markets to maximize profit for their own gain. I also don't deny the very real historical facts covered in places such as Latin America and Indonesia. But to call this piece of work \\"history\\" is a farce.The picture Perkins of himself seems part Bourne, part Bond. It is fanciful, generalized, and darkly romantic. It lacks the unmistakable flavor of truth.In his Q & A that follows the novel, he responds to whether or not he fears for his life since he divulged so much information. To which he replies (and to paraphrase), his death would lead to more copies of his book being sold, thus more publicity about the evil empire seeking to crush the little people of this world."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I was pretty excited when I started this book but I had to make myself finish it.

In the end I will settle on the middle ground as the writing style itself is quite good but the content is questionable at best.Mr. Perkins agreed to live the lifestyle that he did and accepted the benefits of the same but when it came time to uphold his end of the bargain he went soft. This book appears to be his bloodletting in an effort to clear a guilty conscience for selling out not once but twice. First of all he sold out his ideals and morals (by his own admission) and second he sold out his former employers even though they made it clear what he was getting into (again by his own admission). I do not agree with his conspiratorial slant on the corporate world we have created but think this is an unfortunate culmination of centuries of mercantilism and conquest. Is it right? Certainly not and it is no more right for Western youth who are bombarded by Madison Ave and taught to live in excess than it is for Middle Eastern youth who are under the shackles of corrupt leaders beholden to Western interests. The fact is that it does exist and many of us (Mr. Perkins included) benefit from it as much as we suffer from it as long as we maintain our personal beliefs and integrity.His conclusions about downsizing one's lifestyle and taking an interest and becoming active in local as well as world events are good ones IMO but I have reached the conclusion from a different perspective. The Western system is fine although there will continue to be excesses at the top. It is not necessary to swing all the way to the side of socialism (Mr. Perkins seems to have a soft spot for LatAm socialist leaders) but more likely to meet somewhere in the middle. One could write a counterpoint book on the abuses by the very Socialist leaders that Mr. Perkins raises up as the same amount of dollars end up in corrupt hands only they end up with family and friends instead of in the hands of large corporations. Is that better or worse? Just different IMO as the lower classes tend to benefit for a while but the economy deteriorates as foreign investment flees.In the end I appreciated reading his perspective but think of this story as pseudo-fiction due to the conspiratorial hobgoblins created where I feel none exist."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John seems to think the CIA and NSA are interchangable overlooking the fact that the NSA is a code-breaking organization.

What gave this book hope for a unique spin was the fact that the author claims to have been one of the warriors fighting for the bad guys. This perspective does not come out at all in the book - rather, it's a long lamentation, never really presenting the rationale he had for participating in the \\"corporatocracy\\" (his term for economic imperialism). The result is that it's hard to understand the perspective change - if I were a conservative person reading this book, I would not identify AT ALL with the main character and consequently his transition to being conscientious about globalization would be totally lost on me. In short, this book does nothing to coax right-leaning thinkers over to the left, which should be the goal of any left-oriented political work in my humble opinion. It is rather a moral \\"pat on the back\\" for people who already have political beliefs consistent with the author, and that is quite frankly pathetic and unhelpful.Moreover, Perkins' suggestions on what to do about the \\"corporatocracy\\" are some of the worst I've ever come across in this sector of the political spectrum. First, he presents his own \\"action\\" - to write about his experience. I would maintain that his writing is of so little significance to the overal progress of globalization that this action is functionally meaningless. He then proceeds to profess the merits of confessing one's crimes in contributing to globalization. So his process becomes one of confessing to his evils in an ultimately meaningless book so that he can feel better about himself and die with a less guilty conscience. What an incorrigible excuse for radicalism.For readers, he suggests a few mild practical measures such as cutting back on oil use - as if that wasn't the same thing that everyone left-of-center has suggested for decades. Beyond that, he says, he can't really tell you what to do because it's up to you in your particular role, based on your job, etc. Masked beneath this pithy \\"find your own role\\" rhetoric is the more tragic truth that people in first world nations will never change enough to solve the global problems that he discusses. His practical suggestions amount to reducing our personal ecological footprints, but if you look at the hard data on average ecological footprints for 1st worlders, 3rd worlders, and an average sustainable footprint, it will become readily apparent to you that life in America, absent moving to the wilderness and foraging, will never be ecologically sustainable (search \\"ecological footprint\\" on Google).Perkins ends up sounding like a hippie who dreampt an imaginary life that he wrote a book to criticize, without ever really coming to grips with what it means to confront the global problems he so skillfully narrates about. This is why I give his book three stars - his book is an easy and pleasant read, and it has many alluring moments that suck the reader in, but in order to hook those last two stars, he needed to deliver a bit more. A much better book on this subject is Planet of Slums by Mike Davis. I would reccomend that book over this one to anyone.Conclusion - enjoy the fruits of civilization while they last, and make as much money as possible so that if in fact the big crunch comes near the end of this new century, your children won't all die of disease like those of the 3rd world, and the wealthiest shall inherit the earth."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Incredible.

America does not look good, but it is not an hate America Book. It tells another side of corporations and US foriegn policy that I found quite upsetting. Especially how we all live in ignorance and have no idea what really goes on. To me, it puts the Iraq war in a different perspective as to why we really went to war. The story and players in Iraq has been played out before in other third world countries that did not give us access to their resources. My only complaint - (why not 5 stars?), I thought he dragged it out a bit and I am surprised he did not have more examples of his intervention to other countries."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The opening salvo leads the reader to believe you will be taken into a clandestine world of subverting foreign economies for the U.S. global empire. But read the book carefully - there are very little specifics and a lot of read-between-the-lines speculation. There's a little bit of history revision as well - it's not hard to divine that Perkins is left-leaning, as he constantly expresses admiration for communist/socialist leaders (e.g., see their Wikipedia entries) while the US presidents aiming to destroy the third world are all, perhaps coincidentally, republicans. There is an interesting message within the book, one worth reading, about being part of a machine yet at the same time not knowing what the machine really does.But, like other reviewers, I suggest readers be skeptical. I think Perkins oversells his role & importance in the events he discusses just as he admits in the book how he bolsters his resume by selective truth-telling and implication. He constantly talks about how guilty he feels about what he does, yet again and again he describes how he kept quitting and coming back to it. I suppose with his book sales, he can finally escape the corporatocracy \\"trap\\". Some of the \\"economic hit man\\" activity he talks about, like the US trying to culturally entangle itself with Saudi Arabia in the hopes of gaining more oil supply certainty, is really not as dire as he suggests. I don't see, for example, exactly who is suffering - we get oil & jobs, they get infrastructure and money without burdenous debt.His intentions seem to be noble, which is a common refrain people offer when committing indiscretions, in that he wants to help the poor. Yet I am skeptical that everything is as he says it is. Many of these countries that incur burdensome debt are not democracies - their leaders decide the kickbacks are worth it and screw their own people. Some company gets the benefit, sure, but who's really to blame? He says his growth projections were deliberately inflated to conduct these economic assassinations... so will he be held accountable now? Will these countries he helped assassinate economically attempt to extradite him now that they have a written confession? Fraud is illegal, after all, in every country. Somehow I doubt it and the fact he hasn't been held accountable for all these \\"sins\\" is a red flag.I agree with his indictment that enough corporate leaders are detached from the implications of their decisions and the suffering of the masses such that the gain of the few does not outweight the suffering of the many. Inasmuch as possible, we should prevent this. However, the naive message he seems to be suggesting is to eschew this evil corporatocracy in favor of... what? Government control? Yeah, they're MUCH more in touch with the people than corporate leaders. And although evil companies can be bankrupted by boycotting or fought with competition, evil leaders will persist until the \\"jackals\\" get them or they die of old age.In summary, the book is a good read, especially in the beginning, but gets boring and repetitive towards the end. It has some interesting insights, but reading carefully, you can see he has an agenda and is retelling his experiences from a biased viewpoint."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Wow!

Perkins describes how he helped promote U.S. commercial and foreign policy interests by overstating economic projections so these countries could be loaded up with debt. Countries would then spend this debt on large public works projects to support the overstated economic projections. And who gets the contracts for these public works? Large U.S. multi-national companies. Surprise. Surprise. Perkins claims the National Security Agency promotes this system to make countries beholden to U.S. interests. This is not a conspiracy theory. Much of what Perkins describes are well documented, but not well known facts, such as the U.S. overthrow of democractic governments that fell from favor. He elequently makes the case that the short-sided U.S. support of corrupt governments has resulted in long term foreign policy disasters.

This book really ties all the loose ends together. Mr. Perkins explains how the foundation of our economic policies have metamorphosized into a \\"system that promotes the most subtle and effective form of imperialiam the world has ever seen\\". He says that effects of Corporatocracy go way beyond greed and materialistic goals that generally define \\"empires\\", but go directly into the soul of our civilization at this point in time. I would hope that every American would read this book,.... (unfortunately, few Americans read, I've heard). Most Americans get their news from our media, which as Mr. Perkins has said, - has become part of the \\"Corporatocracy\\" (banks, corporations, government & media).

He says we have to get beyond the \\"third grade view of history, which runs: \\"They\\" will take care of it,.....it will all turn out for the best...\\".His book is a wake-up call for all Americans who still believe in the country our founding fathers envisioned, a country \\"Of, for and by the people!\\". It is time we all turn off the tv, etc. - and actively participate in our democracy. Write and tell your elected officials exactly what type of country you want - or don't want. Participate. Discuss. AND READ THIS BOOK!It truly is ...astonishing!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This history will not be found in American textbooks, however. The truths that form the underlying foundation of this book strike at the very core of who we are as a country versus who we think we are. And judging by the reviews I've read, there are many who remain blinded by the \\"right\\". For them, the easiest mental path is to believe the myths fed by official versions of history and by a media which itself has become part of the Corporatocracy unmasked in this book.\\"Confessions of an Economic Hitman\\" is an enlightening and disturbing book that relates a history of the world since World War II. It demonstrates how the United States has become a new kind of Empire, and in doing so, much of what the U.S. sowed in the past 60 years we have begun to reap in the form of increasingly widespread terrorism and hatred of United States economic and political policies.This new American Empire was founded not on military might -- although as we see in Iraq, this is always an option -- but on the power of giant U.S. engineering, construction and oil corporations that induced nations around the world to borrow heavily from entities like the World Bank and IMF -- ostensibly for the purposes of economic development. Unfortunately, once these nations joined the list of debtor nations, the staggering debts they incurred were utilized to get them to accede to a variety of U.S. political and corporate interests.\\"Confessions\\" is John Perkins' personal account of how, as an \\"Economic Hitman\\" or EHM, he and others like him spearheaded this new kind of imperialism. The corporations these men and women worked for are virtual quasi-governmental entities, and like a revolving door, influence has moved from these corporations to government to Non-Governmental Organizations and back again.It is no coincidence that many governmental officials who have been in the forefront of national policy for the past twenty-five years have come from and returned to these corporations. People like Dick Cheney (Halliburton), George Schultz and Caspar Weinberger (Bechtel) are some of the best known and most influential. But perhaps the best example is George H.W. Bush, who started as owner of United Fruit -- one of Central and South America's most notorious U.S. landowning corporations. After that he got into the oil business, became a Congressman, U.N. Ambassador, CIA Director, Vice President, President and is now associated with the highly-influential Carlyle Group; a corporate holding company that has among its associates a number of former defense department officials and ex-politicos from around the world.The book outlines how -- as a powerful Corporatocracy -- people, agencies and corporations like these, along with the complicit assistance of ruthless and corrupt third world leaders, had a great deal to do with many of recent history's most pivotal events.When this Corporatocracy discovered to its dismay that there were leaders who couldn't be seduced by the wealth and power offered to them, the \\"jackals\\" of the CIA could always be employed to do the dirtiest work. Time and time again, legally elected democratic leaders were assassinated in countries like Guatemala, Iran, Chile, Panama and Ecuador. Their sins? They wanted more of the profits from the oil, minerals and produce of their countries to help advance the standard of living of all their people -- not just the rich.However, the Corporatocracy felt otherwise, as maximum profits are its only raison d'etre. When these principled leaders couldn't be convinced to do the Corporatocracy's bidding with either bribes or threats, these men had to be eliminated. In most cases, their successors were right-wing dictators whose oppression of their people went part and parcel with subservience to U.S. and corporate demands.It is interesting to note that even today, in Venezuela, the patterns begun a half century ago are being brought into play. A legally elected maverick President wants to go his own way and help the poor of his nation. Since his election in 1998, the United States has tried to label Hugo Chavez everything from a communist to a nutcase. A 72-hour coup that occurred in 2002 was instigated and supported by the United States government and the Corporatocracy that is losing money because profits are being diverted from the nationalized Venezuelan oil company to the poor of Venezuela. A leader who opposes the Corporatocracy is a dangerous man. Will President Hugo Chavez survive the \\"jackals\\" who are sure to pursue him?Perhaps the most relevant part of this book, at least for Americans today, is that which tells of the Corporatocracy's 30-year relationship with Saudi Arabia and the House of Saud. The machinations of their symbiotic relationship reveal a great deal about why we find ourselves in Iraq today, as well as why the unbridled greed that pervades the Corporatocracy is increasingly eliminating any notion of creating a better world in the Zeitgeist or our times.\\"Confessions of an Economic Hitman\\" will never find itself on a shelf of American History textbooks.

I kept reading with a somewhat skeptical attitude almost till the end but I am now convinced that this book tells the truth. Whether you are a traditional conservative (not the pseudo neo-type) or a progressive, this book will give you much to ponder about the current state of the United States in the world. You wonder, how a country with such high ideals and purposes that was founded on the principles of opposing tyranny and injustice, can be turning into the evil empire of the 21st century. Is it too late to change course and return to our original values? I don't know but every year brings us closer to an accelerating decline as a nation and culture. After all, what is American about the Patriot Act; trillion dollar deficits and lousy schools; interference with the internal affairs of other countries through coups and invasions; forced indebtedness of the third world through World Bank, IMF, etc.; and the illogical consequences of free trade and globalism that appear to be benefiting only the rich and the large corporations? It would appear that the twenty first century will be another 100 years of revolution and warfare caused by the greed and heartlessness of a few meglomaniacs trying to force a New World Order on the many. Militant Muslims are the first wave that will include dissaffected millions in the future.

The empire depends on the efficacy of big banks, corporations, and governments - the corporatocracy - but it is not a conspiracy. This corporatocracy is ourselves - we make it happen - which, of course, is why most of us find it difficult to stand up and oppose it.

It was obvious that he left out the really bad ones to look like he's really a good guy now that he supposedly feels guilty.The scam goes like this: The company Mr. Perkins' company worked for would influence government representatives to take out huge loans using hookers, drugs, money, blackmail or promises of power. The loans would go to pay for public works, weapons, soldiers, etc. Their constituents are now responsible for paying back this loan. They can't pay it back, so now the banksters that issued the loan own the country, with its citizens now indentured servants to repay the debt. The US Military is the enforcer of last resort.In a side note, this is not too different than what happens domestically. Lobbyists influence Congress to fund public works projects (includes wars) using the same methods as above (money, hookers, drugs, blackmail). The U.S. is broke, so it borrows the money (China, Japan, or have the Federal Reserve print it and lend it to us). The taxes that we pay cover only the interest on the debt. The banksters that issued the loan now own the country, with our citizens indentured to repay the debt. The IRS and police force serve as enforcers to ensure the debts incurred by your government are repaid.All this theft is institutionalized, perfectly legal, and the roles of the legislators, police, government agents, and soldiers are so compartmentalized that even they are not aware of their big-picture roles. A government agent thinks they are merely enforcing laws. A soldier thinks he is just \\"fighting for freedom\\".I think that everyone who has ever wondered how the world really works should read this book (but perhaps buy it used in order to bypass Mr. Perkins' wallet)."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The things that John Perkin's claims to have done and wittnessed are horrendous.

His humility and willingness to look at his own failings as an impressionable and ego-driven young man are commendable, as is his courage in writing a book which was always guaranteed to be controversial.Perkins' account is depressingly believable if you are already aware of the mechanics of our monetary system and the fractional reserve banking house of cards upon which it is built: the thought that otherwise well-meaning but similarly young, impressionable and ego-driven people of today are furthering this empire, believing they are doing good in the process, is disturbing to say the least. A thoroughly-recommended \\"conspiracy classic\\"."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I want to start this brief review with an assertion that at first might seem rash. It certainly would have seemed that way to me, before I undertook an intense period of reading about cold war politics and history roughly from 1945-1970. The authors Colby and Dennett make the assertion that the roots of the North American Free Trade Agreement NAFTA can be seen in the transition from JFK to LBJ. The authors describe a change in the Alliance for Progress from US aiding the national governments of Latin America, to a much greater role for US private investment in working out deals with Latin American partners and getting rid of the remnants of economic nationalism that lingered in Latin America from the 1930s unitil the early 1960s. Thy Will be Done, Nelson Rockefeller, Evangelism, And the Conquest of the Amazon in The Age of Oil, also ties these foreign policy shifts into a vast domestic shift that might be summarized as the shift from industrial capitalism to finance capitalism. The Colby Dennett book is IMO one of the most important books of politics and history of the last forty years. There is good reason why it so little known.Now how does this all relate to Confessions? Perkin's book can be seen as a very useful closeup of the economic processes that Colby and Dennett describe in incredible detail in nearly all of the countries in Latin Ameica-- especially Brazil and Columbia, but also with lots on Ecuador. Here we see US banks and corporations making deals with local business elites that effectively make the national government obsolete. The specifics of Perkins one country approach make it very useful in illustrating the broader pattern described by Colby and Dennett.Thy Will Be Done: The Conquest of the Amazon : Nelson Rockefeller and Evangelism in the Age of OilAt this point another book comes to mind. It is about JFK ,but it is not a whodunnit. It is a unique book about the POlCIES that created the sort of reality of today described by Perkins. Above all it is the best answer to those critics of JFK who argue that he was just another Cold Warrior, and that there were no important policy shifts after his death. It is very significant, IMO , that most of these arguments have been aimed at the left by writers such as Noam Chomsky and Alexander Cockburn-- although there has been no shortage of strong left -disagreement here, see for example Michael Parrenti. No less an authority on the CIA, Vietnam, and the entire national security state, than Daniel Ellsberg-- he of Penatgon Papers fame-- has endorsed this book, by saying that if fundamentally changed his view of the assassination.And the left criticisms of JFK are addressed decisively, so that there can be no doubt whatsoever that the shift from JFK to LBJ represented a very significant domestic and foreign policy watershed for the US. This argument is not made by naive liberals, but is rather documented in a most convincing manner even for those extremely cynical about the corporate nature of what the Democratic Party became. But again, the best thing about JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and WHy It Matters by James W. Douglass, is that it is much more a WHy book than a how book. It focusses on the policies that created deep and fundemental conflict between the elected president, and the permanent national intelligence bureacracy. Just so, it is not just a book about an individual president but about a unique moment in US history when one can see more clearly than at other times, permanent unelected bureaucracy--with strong corporate ties-- surpass the power of elected officials.JFK and the Unspeakable: Why He Died and Why It MattersThe two books I have mentioned are essential for the big picture. But Perkin's book is no less useful, for it is here that we see more closely the effects of big picture political and economic shifts on the majority populations in so many of the countries suffering under neo-colonialism that is the reality behind todays specious free market rhetoric."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am a slow and lazy reader.

It is written in a gripping, fluid style, but ultimately falls flat as a work of non-fiction.There simply isn't enough hard data in the work to substantiate the author's cloak-and-dagger claims. In addition to the general lack of substance, there were certain elements of the narrative that sound very off, especially with some knowledge of economics and finance. For example, the author claims that he had to convince the members of certain international lending organizations that the lending would be a good deal for them, presumably convincing them that they would be repaid, which the author claims was a lie. Somehow, despite his relative lack of experience, the author was able to pull the wool over the eyes of the experienced analysts and economists at these institutions. How, precisely, he achieved such a feat is left to the reader's imagination. This is only one small example, but there are many other cases where the lack of supporting facts makes the book read like some kind of mediocre spy novel.Ultimately, it is difficult to look to \\"Confessions\\" as a reliable source. It is long on conspiratorial accusations and political and economic intrigue, but painfully short on hard evidence."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Generally thought this book was a good overview of the US Empire's economic imperialism and how it functions using debt, banks, governments and corporations. Perkins provides an interesting inside look at these institutions, which I have not come across before.However there are a few points in the book that I had issues with.First: Perkins clings to the belief that the US can be the world's savor; fixing all the problems it helped to create. In this respect he comes off a bit arrogant, replicating the \\"American white men can solve all the problems in the world\\" attitude. Certainly though reparations for Empire's destruction are in order, but how that should happen, I think, should be up to people in the effected areas and not up to the Empire itself.Second: while Perkins points out many of the US backed coups, assassinations and massacres around the world, he somehow misses the 1965/1966 US role Indonesia. Odd since this was one of the first nations he worked in as an EHM. Perkins maintains the dubious US official line of a PKI (communist party) coup attempt in Jakarta, even though there is ample evidence of direct and indirect US involvement in setting up and backing the brutal regime of General Suharto (1967-1998). Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky have some good work on this in the book, The Washington Connection and Third World Fascism.The book also does not offer much in the way of alternatives or actions for the public to take. For a really interesting look at economic alternatives see the book, Parecon: Life after Capitalism by Michael Albert.Otherwise a good, informative and entertaining read. Recommended."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is over-hyped. Perkins sets out to unmask the American corporatocracy using a simple premise. Based on his own professional experiences as an economist to an engineering consultancy that has broad connections within the international aid business, Perkins decides to confess who a few years of self-searching.. The confessions are somewhat interesting, but never intriguing, since they are thinly veiled mostly war stories most often shared over drinks with type-A friends or potential clients. And as every tall tale of men, it has to be thrilling, mysterious, and sexy. Perkins adds some clandestine suspense telling us about his induction into the secret society of economic hit men and his search for the truth. That is the thrill. Typically, Perkins seeks to convince the reader and to make the story even more credible or incredible, depending on your way of looking at this, there are side stories relating to the NSA and the clandestine services. That is the mystery. When a mysterious and attractive woman selected by his unknown minders to seduce Perkins intellectually and psychologically, but seemingly not physically, we would expect an avenue of sexual exploitation to open. When she indoctrinates Perkins into the mantra of economic hit man, we have the sexual crescendo of money. That is one of the first letdowns in the first couple of pages. The good news is, Perkins continues to disappoint us. The bad news is, you just wasted a good read.We all are aware of the financial hardships the less developed countries face. The official explanation and widely accepted explanation has been fundamental mismanagement of development loans and aid by corrupt LDC governments due to their malfunctioning political and institutional frameworks as well as corruption, graft and share incompetence. Perkins accepts this, but adds something different: he puts burden on the purveyors of development advice and not on those governments who have been seduced by this advice.In short, this advice has been and continues to be that large-scale infrastructure projects for hydroelectric electricity generation, transportation structures, and communications network will lead to rapid GDP growth and benefit the poor of those countries. With the developed world providing financing to the developing countries, the infrastructure of the countries will - and not would - propel them from their 18th century colonial past to the 20th century vanguard of economic powerhouses. According to the foreign aid bureaucracy, everyone will benefit from these large-scale investments, including the poorest of the countries. Since a large proportion of the financial expenses associated with these large-scale foreign investments are paid through taxes imposed on the production of the local economy, the burden in these countries is put on a disappearing middle class. The poorest of the poor will get worse off and the richest class, the politically and financial well-connected cleptocracy will benefit the most. They become entrenched politically, consolidating the geopolitical reaches of the US government. And this is the point that Perkins wants to make. He could have done a better job.Perkins takes his explanation for granted, and we suspect that it is true. He explains that the reason infrastructure investments did not lead to institutional reforms that would have improved the overall welfare of these countries was the need of political stability during paranoia of the post-Vietnam political soul searching. In countries such as Indonesia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Colombia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq and Panama the richest segment of the population got even richer, unless there were political changes that unsettled the ruling and dominating upper class. These were allowed rarely as the dominating class has always been and continues to be well connected to American corporatocracy, a mysterious political-industrial-financial-intelligence complex dominated by republicans with the Bush family as its major flag bearer. Perkins makes his expected jabs at the both Bush presidencies, extols the corruption of George H.W. Bush, the incompetence of George W. Bush, the intimate relationships among the Bushes, Carlyle group, the Saudi princes and the dominating Wahhabi. Sounds Michael Moorish to me, which is a very sad thing to say for me who is a European-born elitist East Coast liberal (with somewhat horrible English grammar). These all may be true, but by the time Perkins get around making the point, I became so turned off by his self-serving statements, his Oprahesque soul searching, constant self-aggrandizing, and \\"mea culpa\\" that I was ready to listen an hour of Dr Phil. Or Bill O'Reilly for that matter.The book sets out to unmask the American corporatocracy, and it would have succeeded if Perkins had a less self-serving tone and considerably less abundant ego. He wears all his confessions on his sleeve and attempts to find a reason why he is no longer associated with the business. He circles around the points, he finds a right approach, but never gets past second base. While it is likely that Perkins was a willing participant, who did not know better, that explanation is hollow. Perkins claims that power, money, prestige and thrill his work brought him made him blind and he robbed the poor and rich alike. That he was a willing prisoner of his own subconscious desires. It does not ring true in my ears. While I agree that he was seduced by his own success and power, he was more seduced by his ability to fib. He takes credit for the introduction of Markov modeling in econometrics; that's a tall tale that any economist or econometrician would disagree. Perkins dines with Graham Greene in Turillijo's Panama right around the Panama Canal Treaty and talks as a classic Champagne-liberal. My point is not that the book is fictitious or is dominated by conspiracy theory; it is rather that the book contains a lot of self-serving drivel. And this clouds his overall credibility.How much of the book is true? Objectively, not even Perkins would know. How much truth can a reader deduct? Enough to recognize that the aid business can be a profitable way to keep weak, politically and socially repressive governments in place, while entrenching US interests in the region and transferring wealth from the poorest of the poor to the ruling upper and professional classes."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It's odd that Perkins points out several times in the book that what he's describing is not a consipracy theory, but something something even more odious and concealed. His claims - that the CIA, NSA, and a handful of powerful families are colluding to create a global empire - are hard to frame as anything much different from conspiracy. If they're not conspiracy, what are they? Policy? They're supposed to be secret plans.Perkins' book certainly has its merits. It earnestly attempts to focus attention on the truly shady things that the US government and certain corporations have done, and how these actions are often ignored by the popular press. He's clearly been witness to events and policies that he found repugnant. He doesn't attempt to paint himself as being a laudable person, but rather a typical guy who rationalizes bad things and tries to get by. I didn't get the impression that the book was so much about him as it was the issues (though his timeline at the end seemed unnecessary). I did question his self-assessment of his relative importance (and that of his employers) in the whole scheme of things. To hear him speak, one would assume that the world is a very simple system that spins on US \\"corporatocracy.\\" He was essentially a salesman who lied to get contracts, though he would have you believe that he was part of an NSA/CIA master plan at all times, which just seems unwieldy and overstated to me.Perkins' specific claims make sense. I can buy that the US government had a hand in attempting to control foreign governments, waged unwarranted wars, and benefited those in control. I can buy that corporations use government influence to snare lucrative contracts, pollute environments they operate in, pay people as little as they have to, and distort the truth during sales pitches. It's no revelation that there is corruption in governments around the world, and that their policies aren't so altruistic towards their disenfranchised populace. In short, I have no contention with the depiction of people as being self-serving and greedy, and acting on those impulses in immoral ways.Where I can't get in line with Perkins are in the sweeping generalizations he draws from these points, the premises underlying much of his economic and societal arguments, and the overriding importance of these particular issues. There's a common thread that runs through the book which identifies capitalism as slavery, consumer spending as destructive gluttony, and the actions of all US corporations and government as therefore being sinister subterfuge to spread both. Now, there are probably a lot of people who do agree with these depictions, so the book is doing well. There's a very black and white philosophy that seems to sprout up in many similar camps which equates everything done for profit as intrinsically evil. It's a sort of \\"throw the baby out with the bath water\\" type of mentality that refuses to allow for any benefits from corporations. If someone is making a lot more money than someone else, the whole system is obviously there only to serve that wealthy person.It's a categorical dismissal of a system that is much more diverse and complex than such arguments imply. Perkins expresses an obvious fondness for living close to the land, and the people of the world who subsist on centuries-old methods of survival. He would prefer us all to live in very small local economies, stop the advancement of Western technology, and become more spirtitual (in some vague way). I'm certainly not knocking such societies, but I don't see how they're the only acceptable way to operate, or why \\"modern\\" systems of society are some sort of anathema of humankind.It boils down to an argument of socialism (or friendly anarchy) against capitalism, which is too large to address in my capsule review. It assumes that greed and injustice never existed until the advent of corporations, and that all bad things flow forth from them (mass starvation, disease, war). It's also an age old argument which assumes all wealth is an innate property of the environment, and not something that is created via work, organization, and processing. It doesn't effectively evaluate why poor countries are poor, and were before the United States ever existed. By his own admission (and the strength of his arguments), Perkins isn't an economist.In the end, Perkins seems mostly to be a man trying to alleviate a guilty conscience, with an exagerrated view of the evils he's experienced, much like the self-loathing and aggrandisement of someone with depression. Who can blame him? If I worked in an all-you-can-eat buffet for 30 years, I'd probably think that everyone was a glutton. If I were a cop, I'd see everyone as deceptive and destructive. Our reality is shaped by our unique experiences, and Perkins' weren't so rosy. His heart is in the right place, even if his evaluations and solutions aren't so accurate or utilitarian. I did enjoy reading the book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Imagine no possessionsI wonder if you canNo need for greed or hungerA brotherhood of manImagine all the peopleSharing all the worldYou may say that I'm a dreamerBut I'm not the only oneI hope someday you'll join usAnd the world will live as oneAn old guy named John Lennon wrote these lyrics a long time ago, about the time John Perkins got off the plane in Ecuador and started his career (along an alternate path) as an economic hit man. He has led a fascinating life, and played a role in world-changing historical events. The clear message in this book is that the world is as you dream it. We have dreamed the dream here in the American Corporatocracy and have changed a planet in a remarkably brief time. Have we made the best choices? We've helped Less Developed Countries to gather and collect their resources and send them to Developed Countries, for the betterment of all. In the process, the income ratio of the one fifth of the world's population in the Developed Countries to the one fifth in the Less Developed Countries has dropped from 30:1 in 1960 to 74:1 in 1995.

These are crazy times we are living in.John describes the role he played in creating \\"debt traps\\" in third world countries. This is actually relevant to our own situation because the US is itself in a similar debt trap today. John would provide growth estimates that would \\"prove\\" that a country would be able to afford expensive modernization loans meant to pay American construction companies to begin the process of modernization. The countries would then take out loans from IMF or American banks, build the infrastructure, and then be trapped under the oppressive loans. Then when growth doesn't meet predictions, IMF requires Austerity measures which will hurt the economies and make it even harder to repay the loans. At that point, the world power structure has it's hook in place and can control behavior of the countries. Leaders of the country in question frequently know what is going on, but it doesn't matter because they are getting rich! Examples of leaders who wouldn't play along... Omar Torrijos - assassinated in plane crash. Jaime Roldos - assassinated in plane crash. Saddam Hussein - It turns out he was *very* good at screening his body guards, so we had to go to war.The proof is in the pudding.

I found the beginning to be very interesting but unfortunately it just gets preachy after that. The author claims that has was an Economic Hitman or EHM, who technically worked for a private company but mostly did missions for the NSA and the world bank in developing countries where his job was to help convince developing nations to borrow well beyond their means so they would not be able to pay back their debts and thus become susceptible to the US abusing them for political, economic and military gains. The problem is the book is rather thin on actual proof of what he claims, and the second half is the author simply being preachy about how the \\"corporitocracy\\" abuses the developing world. While the ideas could reflect some sort of truth, it feels like more of a conspiracy theory than anything else and leaves much to be desired."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The synopsis of this book intrigued me, but was extremely disappointed with the book. The book was more about the author's political perspective of the condition of the world than anything else. The author states with monotonous repetition how all the evils of the world can be attributed to American \\"imperialism\\", and capitalism in general. For being a self proclaimed economic expert and statistician, the author does not substantiate or quantify any of his statements or evidence he produces to justify his belief system. He repeatedly makes generalized statements like \\"although America is one of the richest countries in the world, the people are the least happy, suffer from depression, suicide, crime...\\" etc, etc. He then makes comparisons that Muslim terrorist are as noble as American revolutionaries and that Islamic countries would not be violent, nor would there be any terrorism, if America wasn't so imperialistic.If the author could have limited his book to his life as an economic hitman and eliminated his radical leftist socio, economic, and political opinions, I'm sure it would have been a very interesting read - but it probably would have resulted in a short 50-page book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"While there are some elements in the Perkins book that are authentic and accurate, the implied conspiracy theories and self-inflating descriptions should be taken with more than one grain of salt. As a read, the book is moderately entertaining for its first half, but it lapses into tiresome moralizing as it goes on, which is less interesting. Economic development has always been a mixed bag, with the bad getting most of the press.

It was billed as an \\"insiders\\" view of economic misdeeds; however, of any nafarious misdeeeds by the authuor were not included in the book.

Nice, but no \\"Econinic\\" hitting that I could see."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is truly an eye-opening experience. I highly recommend you read it for all it's worth, because this book offers a wealth of knowledge. Not only is John Perkins an incredibly intelligent man, but also a superb writer. I won't give away the plot or summary of the book itself, but I'll offer an excerpt to demonstrate how well written and crafted this book is.He begins with the basic hard truth, that the \\"corporatocracy\\", a massive collusion of massive businesses, banks, and governments, are attempting to centralize the power of the United States in the world through exploitation and corruption. He then goes into a chronological explanation of the events of his life that lead up to his inclusion in this world-enveloping plan. Again won't I won't give away details, but reveal a very clever analogy on his part. As a young adult John found himself being interviewed for a position at the NSA, and while he did not end up there, it was not all for naught. The interview was largely focused on his past, the frustration with his parents, and the struggle he had with coping with his anger from his younger years. When he being trained to become a self described \\"Economic Hit Man\\", the NSA interview profile was used against him, all the information he had given about his past was used against him. His instructor used his very strengths and weaknesses against him, to shape him into what his employers wanted him to become. And his profession was outlined by this same strategy, take a nation's past and their strengths and weaknesses, and cater an argument or plan against them using this information. In this way, the global empire of the United States is expanded to encompass new satellite nations, not for their benefit, but for the benefit of Madison Avenue.In conclusion, this book is fantastically written, and is a MUST read. This book is also an atonement on the part of John for the things he has helped to bring about around the world, and which I believe is a very sufficient, sincere, and heartfelt apology. By exposing this massive and subverting plot, he, and all liked minded individuals, hope to reverse the horrible consequences that have been brought upon these nations and their populations. This oppression was brought on by a disgusting and indifferent profit oriented system, the same that deprives even American citizens of basic needs, like affordable health care. (That's an argument for another day, its just simply an analogy) So please, read this, it will change your perspective, guaranteed. It's not about you, or me, or John, it's about all 6 billion of us on this planet that we are ruining for ourselves."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is the account of John Perkins, a retired development professional who claims to have participated in a massive conspiracy theory aimed at tying the economies of developing countries to the United States through debt and securing new markets for American goods and services by all means possible. It's the story of economic injustice, environmental disaster and tragic warfare.Critics, however, cast Perkins' credibility into question. If your sociopolitical outlook falls to the left of the political spectrum, you'll find that Perkins' story corroborates a lot of your beliefs about America's economic empire and the new world order. If your outlook falls to the right, you'll likely call b.s.In either case, Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is an interesting tale that's quick and enjoyable to read. Readers with a background in political economy will find it especially interesting."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I wish I read the reviews before purchasing this book.

It appears that he did fictionalize it. It's hard to believe that the coincidences Mr. Perkins recounts are all literally truthful. He happens to run into his former high school class mate after more than 15 years in a city bigger than Los Angeles, he happens to run into a relative of a high level official in a developing country? I think not.Mr. Perkins premise that the USA uses its economic and political strength to its advantage in ways that work to the detriment of some in the developing world is not terribly insightful. It's a description of human interaction for the last 12,000 years. The true crime in the stories he recounts is in the leaders of the developing countries who take advantage of their own people and the US officials who authorize and carry out the assassinations. Using physical violence to further economic advancement is wrong and should be stopped.However, Mr. Perkins tale is no more than a colorful expression of a political viewpoint. One can oppose or favor the granting of favors and the use of obfuscation to help American companies expand their business in developing countries, but the moral crime is in the leaders of the developing world that willingly accept personal benefits at the expense of their people.In today's world, the leaders of the developing world do not have to fear assassination or a coup if they stand up to the west. They only need to fear another generation of poverty, hunger, lack of access to medicine and hopelessness in their countries if they do not wisely accept the benefits of industrialization."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is an excellent review of American foreign policy since WW II -- especially covert actions to change world leaders. It also makes clear sense of international trade agreements, and how US policy makers have used World Bank loans to ensure compliance with US foreign policy objectives. Even for someone like myself, who has an interest and reads widely in contemporary politics, the book revealed depths of cynicism in our government's policies that i was unaware of.My only caveat is that it is difficult to fully sympathize with the author -- i wanted to like him, but he keeps repeating that he knew what he was doing."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book was quite a read for me over the summer....Admittedly, I am very anti-US government, despite being an American. Americans should not be surprised to find out what their government is REALLY doing behind the scenes. This book cannot be taken for fact, but the premise of the events and how they went along is probably not far from the actual truth. If everyone wants to learn more about duplicity and how the government gets played or plays other parties, you should look at how the US totally screwed over Russia post Soviet Union days.This book is not as dull as some people think. I read this book on the recommendation of a friend while I was in Germany, and it really came as no surprise. Americans overall trust their government way too much, and all of the eavesdropping, black helicopters, et al, are just par for the course.All I can say is that I'm glad I don't live in the US anymore. Not that it would matter much, they have their tentacles everywhere, including allied nations."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Behind the seductive title and the pretense of a nagging conscience, Perkins work is really about attacking capitalism, America, and Western institutions in collusion with a publishing company well known to publish only such books. Imagine settling in for a real-life espionage adventure, anxious to eaves-drop behind-the-scenes at his confessional, thinking I may learn something useful, hoping I would finish more informed and enlightened than when I began . . . imagine all these expectations so completely missed, while being left feeling angered, annoyed, bamboozled, patronized and embarrassed--for and at Perkins and, having looked over the reviews, the lemmings and cattle and socially autistic that buy into this utterly preposterous fantasy.I read through the reviews and noted several interesting items that corroborated and expanded my many suspicions and objections to this author and his \\"book.\\" First, this publishing company's mission statement must read - To print and publicize any and all work, no matter how false, that demonizes America, corporations, the free market and the legacy of Western civilization. Toward that end, they are wildly prolific. Every title is a shot at capitalism. Second, several readers, the observant ones, have noted that the G8, led by the dollars to be provided by the US, intends to forgive the majority of all third world debt. The only oppressive catch is that forgiveness goes to nations which are genuinely implementing reforms to improve education, jobs and other social needs Perkins himself suggests they require most. Third, Perkins strikes you as someone with a bit of a gypsy, snake-oil streak in him. From his shaman scams to psychic navigation to his personal, live conversations with the one and only Jesus Christ, there seems no end to this man's blasphemies (to common sense) and ridicule of your own intellect. He's a grifter with a keyboard. Fourth, this work may be the end-all to liberal, hate-filled, puppies and poor people are great by neighbor is the devil types, driving sales and rankings, but don't look for accolades from book awards circles. This is an extremely poorly written book. Fifth, the egoistic, incessant accounts of his childhood troubles strains your limits of obliging empathy. He rattles on and on as if he were beaten or abused. His complaints are mainly about the good schools, good education, parents who tried to impart values and morals, and the fact that he grew up with privilege. Talk about self-loathing. Seriously, this guy is so beyond the pale. Sixth, he builds from point to point in ways that are incredibly inconsistent. Like claiming association with intelligence agencies as a key theme to the book and his life while then detailing a life so completely absent of any association you wonder if he is quite sane and proof-reading his own book. Seventh, he builds you up with the promise of romantic intrigue, then reveals a plot without any except for persuading an acquaintance to hooker for him to get a contract. Yes, his female spy is some woman he collars and offers a few bucks to give some loving to a guy who can influence the decision on a contract that would make him money. Someone, this is the government's use of female sex agents? He's nuts. Eighth, he insults Thomas Paine repeatedly, speaking on behalf of a man he is certain would join his Scientology-like gangster approach to politics. Thomas Paine is surely rolling over in his grave at these references. Ninth, Perkins demonstrates an utter lack of knowledge about geopolitical necessity, disregards the imperatives of the cold war, offers no balance whatsoever to his theories, trapping them in a box of distasteful and blatant bias, shows no grasp of the mountains of data that contradict his claims in SE Asia, the Middle East and Central America. Where there is no balance, there is no believability. This book tilts in only one direction. Tenth, you finish this book knowing that Perkins was a jerk as a child, a prick in college, a greedy, no-good sell-out in his career, and a demagogue, liar and purveyor of hate in his later years.Do yourself a favor and ignore this man and his message, and live your life in ways to counter-balance a world where bad people like this exist."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"\\"Confessions\\" is at once too good to be true and too vague to be believed. The author apparently had a successful career supporting requests for development loans for major electric utilities projects to the various less developed countries by grossly inflating their projected economic growth. His motivation for doing so was admittedly to keep his job (his boss was fired when he provided more realistic projections) and flourish in a consulting company whose financial success was clearly dependent upon the loans being approved so that their clients could get the lucrative contracts to do the construction work. Nevertheless, Perkins attempts to make what would just be another sordid tale of Enron-style numbers spoofing into a nearly epic story of official U.S. chicanery by alleging that fraud was perpetuated at the request of the American government in order to trap the borrower nations, apparently too ignorant or corrupt to watch out for themselves, into an eternity of economic and political servitude by intentionally burdening them with debts they could not pay. Unfortunately, despite Perkins career as a self-proclaimed \\"economist\\", his book is devoid of even a single statistic backing up this claim. Instead, it rests almost solely upon the words of a mysterious \\"Claudine\\" - a woman who present herself not as a U.S. government agent, but as a consultant to Perkins's employer - who in a series of secret meetings imbued this revelation to Perkins from on high as it were, much as Gabriel dictated the Qu'ran to Mohammed. To say that this story is hard to believe is to treat it with a respect it is manifestly undeserving. Perkins's main pitch seems to be that his own apparently solid status as an establishment insider is sufficient proof of his own credibility, despite his enthusiastic admissions that made a substantial fortune exagerrating and lieing for a living. Yet Perkins is no McNamara, but a best a midlevel manager in the \\"corportocracy\\" he exposes, and his story lacks the abundant details which made true insider accounts, like Phillip Agee's \\"Inside the Company\\" so unmistakably authentic and powerful. In fact, it is precisely its quasi-fictional nature, rather like Carlos Castaneda's dubious account of his dealings with Native American shamans, which makes \\"Confessions\\" such a good read. It reads like fiction because it basically is fiction, albeit interlaced with enough true events from the author's life and recent history to give it the veneer of plausibility. In the end it is useful mostly for the (few) books it cites in its (sparse) footnotes, which offer some useful insights into some of the lesser known incidents in the history of the American Empire, such as the abortive careers of Omar Torrijos and Jaime Roldos. But it cannot be treated as a serious contribution to the debate on globalization."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins, in this amazing read, provides a detailed review of the transgressions in third world countries made by American corporations and the government. He provides a plentiful amount of dates and names and offers numerous footnotes in case someone wants to trace his references or find where one could go about in finding more information. Those who have scored this book poorly, have generally complained that there is not enough documentation to back his arguments. First, Perkins does provide footnotes, for those who really would like to pursue more information. Second, what kind of documentation can be he provide with such discrete and hushed information such as this? This is where critical thinking comes in place. With any resource you retrieve, you must critically analyze for yourself whether or not the statements are plausible. Because let's not forget that even in journals and much more the case of the media, facts are often twisted in favor of some agenda. So, it is upon you, as with any other reading, that you analyze the information for yourself. However, if you really wish to find first-hand accounts of these experiences, visit these third world countries!! I'm sure that they have a different take on America than we Americans do. Although the majority of the disapproval for this book has been centered on lack of evidence, I find that for many, the real problem is that this book counters their right-wing political ideology. In fact, it counters both right-wing AND left wing political ideology. No one likes to learn such uncomfortable information that they may not be rooting for the right side. It takes courage to become aware of what you do not want to become aware of, and to change your opinions and actions in the effort to do the right thing. It is all too often easy to judge others and not take a good look at yourself in the mirror. Just because he doesn't bak up your opinions and ideology, doesn't mean that he's right, but it definitely doesn't mean that he's wrong either!! If you are interested in world economics and politics, like to think for yourself, and your ego does not have an unhealthy attachment to THE GOD BLESS AMERICA AND WE ARE THE BEST MENTALITY, then this book is perfect for you!!

During the time spent there he had an occasion to closely interact with top management in charge of international projects and politicians around the world.The thesis sustained by the author is that consulting companies backed up by corporations, politicians, the World Bank and the IMF, tend to release inflated economic growth forecast for developing countries to justify huge unnecessary building projects of infrastructures. After obtaining the necessary consensus around these projects they proceed to finance them through the World Bank pushing the developing country into debts and granting in this way political control over its decisions. According to the author if the country refuses to sign these contracts, which tend to favor multinational corporations instead of the local population, the US and its allies take other steps which resemble more to the actions taken by traditional empires such as overthrowing local governments, assassinating political leaders or invading the rebellious countries.Personally I found very interesting the facts Mr. Perkins reported related to his consultancy jobs, somehow interesting the theory built on them and unnecessary, for the purpose of this book, the copious description of his personal ethical crisis."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Whenever I would read in the newspapers or watch on TV news the protesters at G8 conferences, I never understood what point the protesters were trying to make.

The goal of the scams are to maintain in third world and developing countries (1) governments favorable to the US, (2) to grab for US based big business the economic spoils from those countries, and (3) to ensure a market for US military weapon manufacturers.The US creates economic mayhem in other countries around the world using the World Bank and the IMF (International Monetary Fund). Even if only half of what John Perkins has written is true, the US is a beast out of control. What the US giveth (using the World Bank and the IMF), the US taketh away.It's not a dry treatise on the World Bank and the IMF, there are plenty of those, both pro and con. It is a first person account of pressures used to manipulate other countries, not for their own good, but for the greedy benefit of the US.I found this book engrossing and so did my 19.5 year old son.On the other hand, if you have a closed mind, a flag waving one that is sealed and locked (\\"my country is always right\\"), you will be disgusted with this book and consider it total fiction."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins offers an honest and critical account of his activities as an economist for an international consulting firm, MAIN (which was similar to Halliburton and Bechtel).

I read the book in 2 days. This is a good read.Picturing the USA as a slick haired loan shark extorting money and favors from our poor neighbors may seem too far-fetched for many readers. Before you dismiss Perkins assertions entirely think back to the first time you heard about the US govenment's experiments at Tuskegee: disbelief, outrage, and a loss of faith.Perkins describes his life and career as a hit man in a prose and pace that I found entertaining. He captured my attention. He made me rise above the dishes in the sink and the bills that are due. This is what a good book does. \\"24,000 people die every day from hunger in the world.\\" explained Perkins. He threw the fact in my face and made me stop and consider all that I have.A really good book changes you. The hand that picks the book up is different from the hand that places it down. Thanks Mr. Perkins."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The United States has never had the external trappings of imperialism so visible in the classic exemplars. But as the author makes obvious from his account that surface appearance is misleading, and the portrait is of a new kind of empire, almost insidious in its career of subtle economic domination. People making charges of imperialism are often stridently ideological, thus this 'insider' account is the more convincing for that reason. Keeping track of the manifold of the American system is hard to do, and to research, and the result is to succumb to propaganda. Even someone who suspects is hard put to really get to the bottom of what is going on. Thus the accounts here of the cases of Ecuador, Panama, Colombia, and Saudi Arabia are especially enlightening. Important reading, and a reminder of the level of deception taken as normal."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Mr. Perkins would like to believe he has written an important tell-all book concerning the inner workings of the capitalist network he operated within over three decades. Unfortunately, the book reveals very little that I did not already know. He makes the most pedestrian facts seem alarming, all the while comparing himself to his alleged distant relative Thomas Paine (who he calls Tom because the one hundred and fifty years separating Mr. Paine's death and Mr. Perkins's birth haven't stopped them from getting close). In that spirit, I will refer to John Perkins as JP because he is my seventh cousin (I can't prove that).One reason for my disgust with the book is JP's fact-less accusations and generalizations. He claims all college professors are bought off by corporations to sink capitalism's tentacles into today's youth. He compares globalization to the Crusades and genocide, while comparing CEOs to plantation owners. He says that economic growth only helps rich people. Meanwhile, he offers no evidence for any of these claims. Every single foreigner he meets is bleary-eyed and innocent; every American an uncultured boar looking to manipulate others.JP is both egotistical and paranoid. He says he was recruited in a very sophisticated manner. How you may ask? Well, by his girlfriend's uncle who offered him a good paying job. He then trained in the most clandestine of methods. Where? At the Boston Public Library. JP talks about threats he received while writing this book. Were these threats middle of the night phone calls? Uh, no. He was once asked in an interview not to disclose any of the firm's secrets. That's a fairly standard request. JP is shocked that his resume was used to highlight only his good experiences while leaving out the trivial details of his working career. That's what a resume is for! All the while, he keeps referring to himself as an economic hit man. I work with computers. Does that make me an IT assassin?A synopsis of the book's antics can be found in what he comically refers to as the \\"Saudi money laundering scheme.\\" Saudi Arabia invested in United States treasuries and the United States in turn paid US firms to westernize Saudi Arabia's infrastructure. Is it just me or is there nothing particularly damning in this accusation? This westernization is what causes the world's ills in JP's mind. He believes the government uses corporations to exercise its will in foreign countries. I would argue that it's exactly the opposite: corporations use lobbyists to persuade the government to make policies that favor the corporations, i.e. Jack Abramoff.There is no doubt that the corporatocracy we live in has its flaws - people like John Perkins. He admits to inflating figures in order to win contracts in third world countries.Capitalism and globalization have the ability to lift people out of poverty; the JP's of the world keep them impoverished. And how does JP atone for his life of sin and purge the guilt he professes to feel? By writing a mundane book with an overdramatic title in order to make more money. Mr. Perkins leaves us with the following suggestion at the end of his novel: tell more people about my book and start study groups for it. So he's a capitalist after all!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am disturbed by all the people who have written comments of this book that attack Perkins instead of the point of the whole book which is that certain elements of our goverment work like a Mafia and have for decades.I recently asked someone if they had seen an Inconvenient Truth and they had not seen it because they \\"did not really like Al Gore.\\" I tried to tell them, it's not about Al Gore. These people have small minds. This book is profound and important and essentially, it is not about John Perkins though his self-disclosure was redeeming. He took enormous risks to write this book--it is sort of the \\"playbook\\" of howthe CIA, multi-national corporations and their thugs rule the world. It is disgusting and disturbing. It meets its objective in propelling most readers to want to DO SOMETHING about it. I consider those reviewers who attack Perkins incredibly small minded and possibly stupid or maybe they are part of the system he is revealing so they are going to flood the reviews with negatitvity to discredit him but it won't work. History and fact support everything he says. Everything. Shooting the messenger accomplishes absolutely notihing if the facts bear out as true as they do. Right now, the President of Chile is under enormous pressure to approve the construction of hydroelectric dams all over her country. The EHM Mafia is zoning in on her and now I understand how and why. Watch what happens if she rejects these projects. THIS IS WHAT WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT. We should be concerned about enabling this leader of a soverign country to stand up to the Mafia, which is what it is. For those reviewers who are so very small minded or have ulterior motives in attacking Perkins himself, the book is a waste on these people but for those of us who are sickened and disgusted by what we have learned, we have a huge task ahead of us and I am full of despair by what I have learned but also grateful for Perkins for having the incredible COURAGE to do what he has done.

The author admits to not having ever regarded himself as an economist, so it is not surprising that he fails to actually talk about economics, but he does not really even talk much about international politics, or any sort of factual events in any depth; he simply rehashes the fact that American corporations work with politicians to unfairly take advantage of developing nations. The book is about him more than anything else, specifically his personal feelings about the events of his own life.If you want to read an unpoetic exposition of the feelings of a not particularly gifted writer, this is the book for you. If you want to read about corporate imperialism, international economics, or politics look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book tells the amazing story of a man who washired, trained (in an unorthodox manner) and sent outto con Third World countries into making theireconomies perpetually indebted to what he calls theGlobal Empire. For more than three decades, theauthor, who was known in the lingo of his trade as anEconomic Hit Man (EHM), traveled the world, meetingwith Kings and Presidents and trying to get them dothe bidding of his masters.The choice of strategy to use in subjugating a givenThird-World country depended on the country'sfinancial standing. In the case of a country with vastamounts of idle cash to throw around, the strategyconsisted of getting it to invest in large amounts ofUS Treasury Bonds, thereby tying down its resourcesfor long periods of time. The interests accruing tosuch investments would then go to finance largeconstruction and engineering projects in the saidcountry. It goes without saying that such projects arecontracted out to American firms undermore-than-generous conditions. The projects aredesigned in such a way that the need for servicing andupgrading by the contracting firms continues inperpetuity.In the case of a country with substantial naturalresources but no cash, the strategy changes to one inwhich the country is encouraged-even pushed-to indebtitself over and above its ability to repay.To convince the targeted country to commit, theEconomic Hit Men would present their leaders withover-inflated projections of returns on investmentsfinanced by borrowings from international banks.It is only after the country begins to default on itsdebt servicing that things go sour. The lending banksthen step in and demand their \\"pound of flesh\\". Thistime, they want nothing short of control over thecountry's key natural resources.We are familiar with terms such as democracy,theocracy, etc. Here comes another term which may benew to most of us. It is Corporatocracy. A conceptwhich brings together, international banks,Construction and Engineering firms and Governments; andwhich, the author insists, is not a conspiracy.According to the author, Corporatocracy uses athree-layer strategy. First, the Hit Men (whom I'mtempted to call \\"Con men\\") come in to persuade, cajoleand bribe. If that fails then people the author calls\\"Jackals\\" step in to coerce, intimidate, assassinateand even topple the regime. The third layer consistsof invading the country militarily, if the other twomeasures fail.It is in this context that the author explains thepresent situation in Iraq.This is a tale of seduction and coercion, of powerand money and self-aggrandizement. It is also a taleof the author's struggles with his conscience. Of thechoice between honoring the whims of his employersand listening to his inner voice, as fashioned by hisstrict upbringing. The author admits to (and regrets)having been used as a tool to foster the aims ofbosses and clients in their mission to build a GlobalEmpire- at the expense of the poor.Reading this book will shake some people awake, pullthem out of their blissful ignorance. It might confirmsome people's suspicions about why the global economyworks the way it works. Why some countries, eventhough richly endowed with valuable natural resources,will continue to wallow in poverty.Much to my disappointment as a reader from a ThirdWorld country, the book barely mentions the continentof Africa.

I really had trouble swallowing this as nonfiction. I thought it would make a much better James Bond screenplay.And it's not that I don't believe that superpowers seek to economically \\"enslave\\" third world countries for our own greedy consumption habits. But every person the author meets and every conversation he has is just too coincidentally heavy handed in illustrating this point. The situations are too good to be true.Like when he just so happens to meet the residents of the Panama Canal Zone who talk about it like it's heaven but they're obviously morally bankrupt people because they refuse to learn the native language and call the \\"warm\\" and \\"handsome\\" new president a despot and a \\"dangerous man\\".I mean who drives into a city in a taxi cab and has some random person walk up to the window of the cab and start a conversation with them about their personal political beliefs? This just isn't real. It's ridiculous. And the book is just absolutely infested with these types of situations and conversations.The other thing I disliked about this book was the author's hypocrisy.Here's this guy (the author) who is about to set the stage for a country with a budding, hopeful future to be economically devastated and it's people placed into further turmoil and poverty. And he has the gall to sit in a bar and judge some dumb American sailor for harrassing a prostitute. As if that sailor is somehow the most depraved person in the whole world. He waxes on about this sailor's belief in Manifest Destiny and so on.I just wanted to throw my book against the wall at that point and say \\"Shut It!\\"And I could never understand how he would read up on these countries and come to have so much respect for their leaders and meet the amazing inhabitants of the country who taught him much and shared their lives with him and then in one little cab ride back to his hotel he would just brush off his guilt for ruining their country like he was swatting a fly.I mean really.

However, whatever the true may be, the author fails to convince the reader that his story is more than fiction.The premise is that world corporations and the US government share a combined interest in enslaving other countries. The way they do that is to use the world bank and other development organizations along with corrupt foreign leaders to overwhelm those countries with loans and ultimately debt that they can't pay off. End result, infrastructure projects that will never be utilized, padded wallets in Halliburton and their subcontractors, and subservient countries that can barely carry their interest payments. The author's role in this? To project rosy economic predictions that warranted the huge infrastructure projects.Three things strike the reader at an early stage.One is the na?ve tone of the author. The places he visits are postcard superficial, the characters are either good or evil, before he travels he researches the country at the public library instead of through professional publications, his economic insights are layman-simplistic, he is constantly confronted with insights that will \\"change his life forever\\", and even his dreams are moralistic dramas.The second is that the stories are void of the type of experiences or anecdotes that suggest the author was really there. Analysis into how the grand conspiracy works stay in the abstract. The little details are absent. He drops names, but we know nothing more about them. The reader wonders if they could've written the book with a little research at the library.The third is: is all this really necessary? Corrupt leaders of poor countries are notoriously willing to borrow and steal far more than their countries can afford. Why the big secret conspiracy? Just lend them the money. And why use big supranational organizations with their suspicious apparatchiks? Just use Citibank.Is it real, or a conspiracy theory?

First,Smith would recommend that huge retaliatory and revenue tariffs be placed on all imported goods coming from countries that are heavily subsidizing products being produced by multinational corporations.Second,Smith would recommend that all monopolies be broken up.Third,Smith would recommend that the central bank of Venezuela impose a low,fixed rate of interest on all loans to all residents of Venezuela that would not be higher than the equivalent of the existing prime rate of interest in Venezuela now.Fourth,Smith would suggest that all loans to prodigals,projectors(Keynes's speculators),and imprudent risk takers be prevented.Fifth,Smith recognized that the capitalist system of wealth generation(The Invisible Hand of the Market process that starts with comparative advantage ,leading to the specialization of labor ,leading to the division of labor ,leading to the extension of the market ,leading to economic growth and ending with real free trade(both national and international),while powerful,generated very severe negative,undepletable externalities that would be detrimental to the entire work force.Smith made it clear that only government action and interference in this process could mitigate/reduce/eliminate these negative consequences of trade.Sixth,Smith would advocate that all public goods beneficial to the country of Venezuela as a whole be financed out of the general tax revenue.Finally,Smith would suggest that the tax system in Venezuela be a progressive one overall.This would entail that the rich and multinational corporations/international banks pay higher overall taxes.These policy recommendations can be found on the following pages of the Modern Library(Cannan)edition of the WN:pp.298-302,322-328,339-340,434-439,681-682,716-768,especially 734-735,777-780,and 794.Smith's economic policies would vastly improve the political,social,economic,and institutional aspects of life in Venezuela (or any other 2nd or 3rd world country when combined with Smith's dictum of the necessity of implementing the rule of law and eliminating economic and political corruption in the ruling party).There is no need to nationalize the oil companies,banks, or the private sector.This is a mistaken solution to a real problem.In summary,Perkins needs to rewrite his book.This can be done by adding an additional chapter that deals with Adam Smith's entire system of thought.It is apparent that Perkins was never exposed to the real Adam Smith in any of his economics classes.This is not surprising since there are no more than a couple of dozen economists currently living today in the world who have read The Wealth of Nations in its entirety.The vast majority of economists,if they read Smith at all,read pp.1-150 and 421-427 and call it a day.It is tragic that Smith's path breaking work is ignored by,for example, the economists at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,all of whom Smith would fire for gross incompetence and negligence for failing to carry out his very clearly specified recommendations on pp.434-439."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is true history which will necessarily open your eyes -shockingly wide perhaps - as it reveals the workings of the US Government to buy off the heads of state of other countries with the unspoken real threat of assasination as a wedge.

Their business is to swindle countries out of trillions of dollars by cajoling them into taking out loans with the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), or the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).Of course the interests that these loans incur are not only astronomical but also unpayable.Small countries such as Ecuador aren't able to make the slightest dent in the interest payments. This is all contrived solely on the bases of acquiring natural resources, such as oil, coal, water, valuable gems, etc... When a country can't pay its bond debt, it is then forced to sell off its resources. This isn't at all confusing really because this was all in a day's work for Mr. John Perkins.In his book \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit-Man,\\" John Perkins presents an autobiography of his life that is most striking. His story begins from early childhood when his father accepted a job teaching linguistics at the Tilton School in New Hampshire which was a prep school for boys. Perkins had the displeasure of attending the school until he grew up and went to college and avoided the draft during the Vietnam era.Along the way he made some friends. One in particular was a rambunctious Iranian youth named Farhad whose father was a general and personal adviser to the shah of Iran. Fardah would later save John's life.In 1965 Perkins enters Boston University's College of Business Administration, and this was when his life really began to change. He then started to seriously date an acquaintance named Ann (He would later marry her) who then introduced him to her father's best friend whom she referred to as Uncle Frank. Frank was employed as an executive at the highest echelons of the National Security Agency (NSA).To make a long story short Uncle Frank took a liking to Perkins and offered him a job. Perkins then had to go through preliminary training, which was perfectly fine because this allowed him to continue dodging the draft.Subsequent to Perkins' training he joined the Peace Corp with Uncle Franks' blessing. This experience(Perkins must have thought to himself) would give him a personal edge in business dealings around the world, while getting to learn about the indigenous populace.However, what Perkins was still obtuse about was that good old Uncle Frank was prepping him for his new job \\"as an Economic Hit-Man (EMC).\\"After his Peace Corp tour of duty was finished, Perkins became acquainted with an Einar Greve, the vice president of MAIN.MAIN was a low profile international consulting firm that set up loans through institutions such as the World Bank.In the case of Ecuador, and other Latin American countries the loans were for building hydroelectric dams, and other building project, and Perkins was offered a job at the firm and he accepted it and so the adventure began.Perkins was still a little wet behind the ears at this point, so he needed more personal one-on-one training. And it was also well known that he had a strong proclivity for the opposite sex.{{{Enter... Claudine!}}} ...She was a beautiful raven-haired siren who was slightly older and more mature then Perkins. If she couldn't show him the ropes then no one could. And so his career as an econometrician began with salacious interludes behind close doors.Perkins' tale then takes a turn into Indonesia where he received his first assignment in the capital city of Jakarta. It was a poverty-stricken city and John had to figure out how he was going to swindle them out of billions of dollars. To accomplish this feat he would have to sell his soul and prevaricate outrageous figures that would seem to make perfect sense on the surface.Perkins then crossed paths with an upstart named Charlie, and a cranky old fuddy duddy named Howard.In Howard's case the many years working for MAIN rubbed off harshly on him because he grew a conscience and became disenchanted with the company's Machiavellian business practices.However, both Charlie and he would show Perkins the ropes in one form or another.John also came in contact with a native of Indonesia, his name was Rasy and he took Perkins for a guided tour of all the sites and sounds of Jakarta, while teaching him some Javanese and other local dialects. Subsequent to that, his meetings with Indonesian political leaders were anything but gem&uuml;tlich.The meetings almost went completely sour, and what made his stay in Jakarta even worse was when Rasy and he went to a puppet show, which the natives called dalang. It just so happened that this was a politically charged event, and this, along with his earlier meetings with political officials made him feel extremely guilty.In the whole scheme of this book Perkins paints a catharsis that is not only the antecedent of events to come, but he explains thoroughly just how seismic the problem of corporate greed is and how it affects the world around us. He also shows how the United States government hires individuals to work for companies such as Bechtel and Halliburton.This book is not for the faint of heart. Perkins' book may seem rather phantasmal at times, but trust me it is the real deal. Checkout his sources!\\"Confessions of an Economic Hit-Man\\" is a must read for anyone who is interested in how the United States' oligarchy conducts business around the world. Trust me!

I really did. I'm a Democrat-- and not in the same way that Zell Miller is-- and I often find fault with current and past Republican administrations. However, some of the allegations, as much as I would love them to have merit, are completely erroneous. Take the following sentence: \\"I could not have known back then that Torrijos would collaborate with Carter to return the Panama Canal to the people who rightfully deserved to own it, or that this victory, along with his attempts to reconcile differences between Latin American Socialists and the dictators, would so infuriate the Reagan-Bush administration that it would seek to assasinate him, as testimony to Senate inquiries would later reveal.\\" The footnote denoted at the end of this \\"fact\\", which I believed would be damning evidence against Reagan and Bush the elder, instead described evidence given before the Senate during the Watergate hearings, and later testimony (given in 1975) that proved a plot existed to kill Noriega and Torrijos-- however, neither Reagan, nor Bush, nor even Carter were in power while these plots existed. I won't claim that future presidents didn't also share these plans, but if you don't have the sources to back up your claims, then they aren't worth the paper on which they're printed.Mr. Perkins had a unique opportunity to shed light on a potentially malicious corporate scheme... however, by trying to take his conclusions too far without proper proof, he loses his credibility."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The conclusions I came to at the end of Moral Armor turned out to be no exaggeration. Here is a man who has been a part of the fascist machinations perpetrated in the period from the Kennedy Assassination to 9/11.Addressing his own guilt, he has come forward to share the truth with the world about our world banking system and the multinational corporations taking advantage of third world countries. It's important to know that THIS is not capitalism, it's cowardice.America is NOT evil; there simply are murdering fascists in America (and other countries) who want something for nothing and will do anything to get it. Most Americans would never agree with the conduct of the CIA or the Federal Reserve if they had any idea what these organizations really do. Look at the horror the German people had to face when the camps were opened at the end of WWII. \\"This was done in our name\\" they feel; a guilt they carry to this day. Americans face the same horror now, but on a world-scale.Those in government still won't clear the air about the Kennedy Assassination because to do so would expose the system still in power. He pursued it directly; it's why he was killed.We are at the end of a vicious pillaging scheme that skirts American laws, set up by the Rockefellers just after the turn of the century, and the American middle-class is about to be left holding the bag.

However, the book doesn't stand up to critical reading: facts at key points are missing, many incidents are too clich&eacute;, dialogue is too smooth and trite, the author claims too much prescience and understanding during his younger years, it all fits so neatly together and has none of those nasty contradictory facts that real events generate as a matter of course.

Butler about his solidering in the 20th century.Butler was a decorated Marine General by the way and he actually named names.Here's one quote:\\"I helped make Mexico, especially Tampico, safe for American oil interest in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Center American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. The record of racketeering is long. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international banking house of Brown Brothers in 1909-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for American sugar interest in 1916. In China I helped to see to it that Standard Oil went its way unmolested.\\"War is a racket.It always has been. It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable, surely the most vicious. It is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars and the losses in lives. A racket is best described, I believe as something that is not what it seems to the majority of people. Only a small \\"inside\\" group knows what it is about. It is conducted for the benefit of the very few, at the expense of the very many. Out of war a few people make huge fortunes.\\"Grow up and wise up folks, just because you aren't personally, individually informed and in on a conspiracy doesn't mean there are none.

Perkins' fantastic story telling, in a common manor, allowed me to rip through this book. Perkins' strolls through his text at a quick enough pace and with enough detail so as not to become drudgery, nor is it over too soon. His personal accounts of his seductive career are filled with colourful exemplification and a real sense of humanity. His personal accounts are also brimming with disturbing revelations that will leave you questioning its veracity.

Well, in fact Arnulfo Arias was freely elected and overthrown 11 days into his presidency by the military (yes, Torrijos did not particpate, he overthrew his comrades a while later).

It's a shame that a lot of people seem to be reading it and swallowing its line whole.As a non-economist working in international development, I know only too well (as do very many people) that many corrupt, inept or naive developing country leaders have thrown their countries into massive debt by borrowing for big infrastructure projects (some useful, some not). And it's certainly true that a large proportion of the money goes right back to big western consulting and construction companies. In fact, it's one of the main reason that the average American citizen supports the US providing even the embarassingly low level of foreign assistance that we do. However, the lending terms for the poorest countries are so concessional that these huge loans are often virtually grants, and in recent years they are even being forgiven completely. Foreign debt is certainly a large burden for many developing countries, but it usually pales in comparison to the financial burden of supporting massive military forces and conducting internal and external wars.But Perkin's main premise goes far beyond these realities of development economics into the realm of paranoia. His main point is that the indebted countries are thereby forced to march to the US Government's tune (e.g. supporting US positions at the UN). This simply doesn't stand up to observable reality. In fact, many governments which owe huge amounts to the US Government, the World Bank, IMF etc., very noticeably do not support US positions or otherwise defer to western will. As a fiendish strategy for world domination, it's remarkably unsuccessful. It's also highly wasteful: surely it would be far simpler and more efficient to simply bribe the corruptible leaders directly, with a few tens of millions of dollars, rather than \\"painting them into a corner\\" by lending their countries billions.The book is long on inuendo and unsubstantiated assertions, and very short on concrete facts and supporting evidence. The fact that the book includes bits and pieces of real history is not evidence that events unfolded in the ways and for the reasons he claims. The way that he seems to pop up in the middle of historic events reminds me of Forrest Gump. Basically, we're just supposed to believe what he tells us because he says so.And this, of course, raises the textbood conundrum: Perkins is in effect confessing to be a lifelong liar, so why should we believe that he is telling the truth about anything, including this? Perkins is also amazingly full of himself. I got painfully bored with his self-aggrandizement and conceit by about page 20. I don't think I'd want to spend 10 minutes in his egotistical company, and I didn't spend more than a couple of hours in the company of his book before tossing it aside in disgust.Globalization and international development are very complex issues, with many positive and many negative impacts. Anyone who reads this book and thinks they've learned something about it all is kidding himself/herself."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man presents the experiences of John Perkins, while working as an Economic Hit Man (EHM)- although he was officially titled as an economist, essentially cheerleading foreign loans to third world countires as a means of economic development, although as Perkins claims, is was expected that the third world nations would never actually achieve the growth levels to allow them to pay off the loans.All of this was done to both line the pockets of multi-national construction firms, primarily U.S.-based, as well as lead to the expansion of the United States \\"Global Empire\\".While I find Perkins' writing a bit preachy, and his views somewhat a \\"holier-than thou\\" attitude, as it comes to his statements that he foresaw the ramifications of his work \\"doctoring\\" economic forecasts, the book is an interesting book that did make me consider a number of events on the international stage that I had previously considered chance happenings.I think the time spent reading Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, is time well spent."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Profound apologies if I'm totally off on the following analysis. This isn't truth, just my own burning questioning of something that doesn't feel quite right.I heard John Perkins discuss his book on Amy Goodman and then in Portland on 12 Nov 04. John is actually doing something enormously difficult -- raising awareness around the \\"hit man\\" in society. The hit man is an unseen symbolic archetype, a ghost role that none of us known well enough in ourselves. We often hit each other in various ways - some more brutal and deadly than others -- economically, verbally, emotionally, with our military, and with the WMD of globalization. And many of us benefit from the hitting of others, but don't have the courage yet to admit that we are tacitly supporting the abuse.A part of me wants to hold John to a higher standard than I could stand myself. I wonder why, after many years of deep shamanic personal transformation, does it take him so long to speak up? The real question may be, how is it that he could now when most do not?And why, after deciding shortly after 9/11 as he walked around ground zero \\"smelling the smoke and the burning flesh,\\" deciding that he had to speak out, why does it take him three years and two months to come out with this story? Perhaps he has been speaking all along, but until now only a few were listening.And why does he wait until he can bring his story out in a commercially viable package (second printing in its first week - good for him!) rather than speaking out immediately and loudly? Again, perhaps he was, but until now only a few were hearing.In Portland he recommended that people not spend their next fifty bucks, but instead donate it to a worthy NGO (always a good idea), but he doesn't say how he used the half million dollar bribe he received to stay silent. Was it to the benefit of humanity? What has he done with the millions he made at Chas T. Main?Although I know there must be a lot of feeling behind the transition that led him to leave and I understand some of that from his book, I don't feel him and I don't hear any emotional reaction against himself or against his acts when he speaks. Watch the interview on DemocracyNow.org. Notice where he smiles and laughs. Where is the emotional reaction or connection with the suffering he's describing, suffering that he helped to create? He seems happy. Great that he's happy, but to not also express more directly the emotions against the oppression he is describing is inflammatory and also leaves him open to being hit.Even if none of the details in the book are new, an insider confirming the stories is an astonishing thing. I notice that in a way I want to hit him for what he's done and for not having more of a feeling reaction against himself. Or, maybe I'm just jealous. First he's a star of the right, and now he's a star of the left. Great for him!!! What an amazing man and in many ways a tremendous book!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The author was employed as an economist for an international consulting firm. But his true job was taking part in scams to enrich international banks and multinational corporations usually at the expense of poor people in emerging nations. He eventually developed a guilty conscience and quit. To expiate his sins, he has written a book exposing this sleazy business. He had difficulty finding a publisher, since those whom he approached either feared stepping on big toes or else wanted him to disguise his writing as fiction.Perkins is at his best when he is describing what he knows well: how what he calls the corporatocracy really operates. He is less convincing when proposing leftist ideas as solutions. For example, he praises President Chavez of Venezuela as someone who has helped his people, but Perkins does not mention how Chavez has also propped up the Castro regime in Cuba.Perkins says that the corporatocracy is not an organized conspiracy. One can quibble about the conspiracy part, but he offers no insight as to why he does not consider it organized. Even primitive life forms like ants and bees exhibit a high degree of organization. The author himself says that he keeps seeing the same agencies, companies, modus operandis, and even actors involved. Yet he would have us believe that this is a random DNA match despite astronomical odds.He also waltzes around the maypole as to who is behind it all. The face cards in his deck--McNamara, Bush Senior, Shultz, Weinberger, Cheney, Kissinger--are all members of David Rockefeller's Trilateral Commission. Yet the \\"T\\" word is never mentioned.Perkins says that cozy ties of government, corporations, and Wall Street began in 1974 with the Arab oil embargo. Yet he fails to mention that Rockefeller, the Ace of Spades, created the Trilateral Commission the year before.The author says that he declined to issue the book under the guise of fiction. But fine exposes have already been done. A made-for-television classic of the 1970's called \\"Brotherhood of the Bell\\" came very close to describing Skull and Bones, a shadowy organization whose members include John Kerry and the Bush family. A more recent film called \\"The Skulls\\" was practically a documentary about it. Another film called \\"The Firm\\" told of an ambitious law student from a disadvantaged background who climbed the heights of success after striking a Faust-like bargain with a sinister legal outfit. It sounds like an allegory of Bill Clinton's becoming a made Trilateralist, except that the character in the story developed a conscience at the end.Anyway, the author himself blurs the line between fact and fiction. Most of the anti-American statements that he quotes were made by people with whom he supposedly had private conversations who are now dead or anonymously identified.Perkins says that legitimate anti-Western movements in emerging nations are being hijacked by Muslim extremists because of mistreatment by Westerners. But anti-American despots treat their people worse than Westerners do. It was Kadafy of Libya who ordered the bombing of a Pan American passenger plane. Ayatollahs of Iran were complicit in taking American diplomats hostage. The Afghan Taliban sheltered 9/11 terrorist bin Laden and his al Qaeda operatives.It would be nice to see Perkins write more especially about what he knows. One has the feeling that he has barely touched the surface in this book. Forgiveness of debt by poorer nations may become an even bigger scam than what Perkins was involved in. It appears that governments--but not private banks--are going to let some nations renege on debts. The result is that money which would have gone to repay debts to governments like the US will instead be used just to pay debts to banks like Rockefeller's J.P. Morgan Chase and Prince al Waleed's Citigroup. People in poor countries will see little benefit, and taxpayers in creditor nations will be subsidizing these billionaires."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is classified non-fiction and autobiographical of John Perkins, but I get the distinct feeling he is blowing some kind of smoky substance into my neither regions with a short length of hose. In my opinion a more appropriate title could have been, Confessions of a Self Aggrandizing Narcissist by John Perkins.John is supposed to be one of the evil corporate insiders who are rigging the system to help evil American companies get rich by exploiting poor developing countries by building sewers systems and bringing electricity to darkened huts. That doesn't sound to bad, so you might be wondering how this is evil. Well keep your pants on I'm getting to that part.John would over forecast the demand for power and the infrastructure that was built would be more then what was needed. Why does no one notice these faulty demand predictions? Well everyone else is just too dumb and in awe of John's skills to figure that out... or so John claims. Oh and if you are smart enough to question his figures, the CIA will kill you, or so John says. Anyway the idea is that there is an unspoken rule of building unneeded infrastructure so the countries would be indebted to America. This debt allows America to pillage their natural resources. John says he was totally aware of his key role in this \\"rape\\" but now after getting rich, feels bad about it. It seems like a God complex or little dictator syndrome to me but I'm not an \\"insider\\".You may get the impression that I think the government isn't meddling in world affairs and that big business farts rainbows and sunshine. I don't. I just don't believe John Perkins.So, if you like conspiracies theories and have a lot of time on your hands go for it. But I warn you; you'll have to delve through a lot of self-aggrandizing [..] and funny enough self-debasement to get to anything interesting. I think the conspiracy theory stuff could be summed up in a 3-page pamphlet. Pick one up from a frothing lunatic on a soapbox near you."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I did not like the book. As I read it I wanted to believe Perkins, as I am very concerned about the direction our country is going - but I found it harder and harder to believe him, as I got further and further into the book. My feeling is that he was truly involved in all the things he describes but he expanded and distorted his role in them. I didn't find him believable. If he was just a little fish in a big ocean, he should not pretend (as he did in the book) to be a big fish in a little ocean.If there is any truth in the thesis of this book, it is important for all of us to read it. If there is no truth, it isn't ever worth the 2 stars I gave it. The average reader, like myself, cannot tell which is the case. We are not privy to the darker workings of our government.All of this being said, the book is a fast read and I couldn't put it down after I started it. It should be required reading for everyone concerned about where our country is going. Then the reader can decide if my sense of the book (and the author) is right or wrong."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"After carefully reading Perkins book, I have significant reservations about his true motives in writing the book. In my experience, people deeply impacted by guilt over their work don't last 30 years in the business that causes their guilt. Further, his views are consistently based on obviously incomplete data. And finally, he has benefitted far too greatly from being part of the system he attacks to be a truly independent viewer of it.For example, he makes no note of Israeli influence on the US \\"Empire\\" which may well impacted our decision to invade Panama.In that case, defined by Ostrovsky in his book \\"The Other Side of Deception\\" far more influence was being exerted by the Israelis on Noriega in the international drug trade than is typically known by Americans. Perkins leaves such pertinent information out of his rather elongated and somewhat dull mea culpa.Further, he fails to consider what would happen if the US didn't influence other developing countries to follow a free market method of evolving economically. He doesn't consider examples like Hawaii and the Philippians which have benefitted tremendously from their support and protection by the US. This, considering that both might have fallen under the control of Japan, or later, Red China. It appears those populations have done quite well under American protection. How about the fact that America, at the end of WWII was the only country with the bomb, and could easily have taken over any country it wanted to, but chose not to continue war actions? That unaddressed foreign policy really erodes the whole, \\"America is an Imperial Force\\" argument that Perkins defines in the book.Why would Perkins fail to note that?Also, why did Perkins give such minimal note to the repression that went on in Iran when Jimmy Carter allowed the Shah to be deposed and the Ayatolas to take over? Are Iranians better off in a repressive Islamic \\"Republic\\"? Would they be better under Russian, Iraqi, or Red Chinese rule? We can say for certain NO in the first case, and almost certainly not in each of the others.Here's another question: How did Perkins fail to note the American banks that wrote off foreign debt to South and Central American countries in the 1970's and 1980's? Given his hypothesis that America uses debt overload to ensnare small countries and rape them for their raw materials- up to an including invading them when necessary, why didn't we just invade those bad debtors?You'll hear none of America's success stories or mercies in Perkins' book. Could Central and South America have fallen under Soviet control without successful US foreign policy? You bet, and I have force recon marine friends who were there in Central America watching soviet tanks on the ground in the 1970's. How well did those foreign empires treat the indigenous peoples they interacted with? You won't hear a word about THAT from Perkins.No, you will only hear him bash American oil companies, the US Government (but only conservative administrations like Reagan's and Bush's), American Christian missionaries, his consulting company MAIN, and finally, himself. Perkins also fails to discuss the attempt by Saddam Hussein on George Bush senior's life as a reason that George H. Bush went into Iraq the second time. If Perkins really was an insider, he would have known about that and included it at the time he published the book...I was left to conclude that this book is somewhat more eco-leftist propaganda than a complete and balanced telling of factual history.Perkins obviously did just great financially himself, selling his \\"green\\" energy company and spending time in Palm Beach yachting, and taking rich tourists to meet- and perhaps taint- indigenous South American tribes. Not exactly a sympathetic character from my view. Perhaps Perkins would be more palatable if he really did give up the high life and go back to living in a native manner. Maybe if he \\"went native\\" - and \\"aboriginal native\\" at that- he could finally absolve his guilt... and I might have more respect for him. Despite his effort at the end of the book to describe himself as a new age Paul Revere, I could only envision him riding Paul Revere style with a grass skirt, bone through his nose, yelling \\"The Empire is falling, the Empire is falling!\\"By the time I got done reading the book, I was glad it was over- it was a relief to stop hearing the whining about how bad he felt. He writes and rewrites these emotions like a compulsive obsessive- get ready to read the self-deprecating emoting over, and over, and over.... And frankly, while Perkins may have at one time been somewhat of an insider, he admits he was at best a middle level manager econometric who \\"couldn't do the math.\\"So really, what I observed in the book was a man writing to position himself in a role that his revealed information access could not support- i.e. he over inflated his role in the American WASP Imperial System. Certainly publishing his resume (including his picture) was one step more than was needed- again supporting my current hypothesis that the book is largely all about him and his guilt driven neurosis. Of course he had to go into cheating on his poor wife in detail- it seems like standard fare for immoral WASPS, Bill Clinton, minor demons, and so many others I have read writing from an intelligence dimension of view. Perkins made some econometric observations about the American dollar at the end of the book- and his inflation argument has merit. But he fails to name the Federal Reserve as the perpetrator in inflating away the value of American citizen and world dollar supplies. Perhaps he doesn't want to take a swim like William Colby did, hmmm.In conclusion, Perkins is a narcissistic boomer who has a neurotic need to be heard. His views and beliefs are far afield from those that built America and made us a super power. And his efforts have created push back from gullible Americans that may hurt America in the long run. But we have room for eco-commies in a free speech society that embraces and generally ensures its citizens' liberty. And getting off Arab oil is a common sense idea, since we are financing serious nut jobs in the Middle East (both Arab AND Israeli) far too well for our own good with our petro and foreign aid dollars. Ergo what he has to say should be heard- but observed with an informed, careful, and discerning view by the reader. I have no illusions that many in the world do hate and want to destroy America- but those people will only be emboldened by the works of foreign policy apologists/propagandists like Perkins."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Four stars for eye-opening content, two stars for poor editing and excessive blubbering about his guilty feelings. Other reviewers have already summarized the book so I'll just relate my impressions. For me, the best lesson of this book is it makes you think more critically about recent events. Why would Burma's leaders eschew western aid after its devastating cyclone? Because they are ignorant, suspicious savages? Maybe there is a different reason. Why would \\"undiscovered\\" Amazon natives react in such a hostile manner to a hovering helicopter? Because they are ignorant, suspicious savages? Maybe there is a different reason. Why do certain foreign leaders \\"flip the bird\\" at the USA? Are they really whack jobs who are a threat to our nation? Maybe not. And why/how did industrial behemoths sell faulty nuclear reactors to Japan when it was ramping up its industrial production during the 1960's?Critical readers will ask themselves whether the events in the book could have really happened. They certainly pass the \\"smell\\" test, and they are happening here, in our own back yard: look up Jefferson County Alabama sewer bonds for starters. Study any state/municipal \\"incentive\\" package used to attract relocating businesses.To his credit he doesn't explain these events as products of a massive shadowy conspiracy; instead these international business deals resulted from people who ignored their conscience, and there just happens to be a lot of those people in influential positions, on both the buying and selling sides.The message is, however, tarnished by the messenger. After finishing the book, my impression is he has a massive ego. Many publishers rejected his book because (he says) the content was too hot to handle. I think the rejections stemmed from the poor writing or perhaps the book didn't fit in with their portfolios. It is arrogant for him to frame those rejections as a censorship. Plenty of similar titles have been published without a conspiracy to quash them. Also, he relishes dwelling in moral conflict: over and over again he chooses the venal path, taking home handsome sums in exchange for dubious practices while wallowing in guilt.He challenges the reader to take actions appropriate for their situation. I suspect buying an econocar and eschewing discount retailers or famous-maker sneakers won't make a bit of difference."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The story reads quickly and I found it difficult to believe that the author could have spent so much time in the developing world and could have, at the same time, have been so incredibly naive. Autobiography by its nature is self-serving and this book does not disappoint. He proudly proclaims himself as a corporate hit man, but at every turn, his actions identify him as a dupe. I don't know whether to feel pity for the author, bumbling around Asia and Latin America wanting to rebel against the establishment and yet not having the courage to do so -- or to simply write him off as a \\"white man overseas\\".I can't recommend the book except as an example of how not to be at every possible level."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"As if we needed more evidence that the World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, and United Nations are all instruments of subjugation, now an insider tells all. Throughout the 70's and 80's, this author schemed to bring third world nations into debt-slavery by convincing their leaders to take huge loans from the World Bank and IMF to fund massive, ill-conceived infrastructure programs. The credit always came with conditions designed to force open each nation's vulnerable fledgling markets to international competition before viable domestic producers could emerge. The international competition destroyed domestic employment, driving down internal revenues, and increasing social welfare expenses. Eventually the infrastructure projects could not be completed and resulted in no significant economic development. More importantly (to the World Bank and IMF), the victim nations defaulted on their loans, and had to come hat-in-hand to their creditors, who would only refinance after significant natural resources concessions. Essentially this is a story of how first-world banks rape third world nations. Before you go thinking first-world banks are somehow on \\"your side\\", consider how their mechanations endanger us all by impoverishing regions, causing destabilization, war, and terrorism. It is an utterly disgusting, immoral tale, and kudos to Perkins for telling it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book, regardless of it's validity, is an interesting read. There are plenty of summaries, I will spare you that, what makes this book interesting isn't in the book, but the questions it raises. What in this book is true? How much impact does the American consumer have on the world? etc... to bigger questions: What impact does anyone (wo)man have on the world? What relations should corporations and governments have? What is Power? and how is it derived? etc...My advice to everyone I know is: read this book, with an open mind and a large grain of salt.P.S. Two things, there are parts of this book that are unreadable (e.g. the dream about Jesus) and this book is not for academics, it is, at points, a memoir and for a large portion of the book is a chronicling of world events."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book almost rises to the level of required reading for all Americans.The author recounts his career as an EHM (Economic Hit Man) for MAIN, an American, consulting/contracting corporation. It's a tale of how American corporations, with the aid of the American government, spread Western imperialism - usually with horrendous consequences for the \\"little people\\" in the nations affected.It rises above most \\"Ain't it Awful\\" books by concluding with concrete ideas and examples of what individual Americans can do to set things right.I have only two complaints with this book:1) The author spends far too much time recounting his struggles with his conscience. This is a recurring theme that recurs too often.2) The author seems less than fully informed about the de-facto pact between American politicians and American banking/industry. Had Perkins studiedThe Creature from Jekyll Island : A Second Look at the Federal Reservethis could have been a much better book.Those minor complaints notwithstanding, this is an important book - one that I think every concerned American should read. For the most part, it is well paced, well-written, and is nearly a page-turner.If you need a reason to support Ron Paul for President, these books should suffice."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It is fascinating to get an inside look look at how the international business world works, and the motivations of the people in it.

My only fear is that, since it is understandably not well-documented (much of the goings-on in the author's life was secretive and nefarious), it will not be fully appreciated by those who are not already familiar with the colonial process. I suggest that anyone looking for more substance begin with Francis Moore Lappe's \\"Why Can't People Feed Themselves?\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is a fantastically engaging book that reads like a corporate espionage novel, but is in fact simply an insider revealing how American imperialism really works. This is a must-read for anyone interested in globalism, corporate imperialism, or the true workings of American capitalism -- A system that depends on deception, lies and the threat of violence to survive. John Perkins, after a total crisis of conscience and after realizing how unhappy he was deep down, decided to write this book after many years of abandoning the project due to threats from former colleagues, bosses and others who have an interest in keeping the American Scam alive and well. You get a sense that he's really speaking from the heart and not just writing a sensational book to make a buck or two.I wrote him a personal letter and he actually called me on my cellphone, confirming to me the true intentions of his soul and heart after years of serving an evil, exploitative and cruel system. He now writes mostly on Shamanic wisdom, which he tries to bring to the West, as he worked with many Amazonian tribes during his work in South America. First he went to exploit them, and now he goes to spread their knowledge to hopefully help the West get its arrogant head out of its proverbial butt. This book is a revealing and fantastic read!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I read this close to a year ago. It was well written, and is a good introduction to the real political and economic landscape the exists throughout the world. My words truly can not do this book justice. The wasting of natural resources, enslavment of other nations to our debt machine, the bribes and the lives they destroy. All of it is in here. However, to really get the impact of this book it would do the reader well to also read books like \\"The Creature From Jekyll Island\\" By G. Edward Griffin. My only reservation on this book is that it doesn't explain the full impact of the first economic hitman Kermit Roosevelt. Yes, it describes his impact during the ousting of the Shaw in Iran. There is an article written in the New American magazine about two years ago that I feel gave better background on those events. You should be able to find that article through that magazine's website for free. It is good background for this book, and is a good read."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Please read this book.

Yrs, George"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Read it now.. see what we are doing to the world and her resources AND people."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"In the aftermath of the JFK assassination, the Watergate Caper, Iran Contra, and Mena, Arkansas, just to name a few, far be it for me to question the author's integrity or slam him with ad hominem attacks simply because he weaves a complex \\"semi-conspiratorial\\" story based on the alleged use or misuse of American economic power. As he noted early on in the book, given the nature of international politics and international economics, a conspiracy would be unnecessary and redundant. On this point, I could not agree with him more.No, that is not what I see wrong with this very well written and carefully thought out piece. The problem I see is with his \\"syrupy 10th-grade moralizing,\\" which begs an important if somewhat paradoxical question about the use (or misuse) of economic power in an international system ruled by power: Clearly the author must have missed the point that all countries, whether rich or poor, developed or undeveloped, act in their own enlightened self-interest. The author's scenario (and whether it is true or not is entirely irrelevant to the point he is trying to make) is explained entirely by the imperatives of international economics and politics. Which, to state it brutally both are part of the Hobbessian world. It is still a \\"might makes right\\" kind of world: no matter how much we wish it were otherwise.The world remains an economic jungle \\"out there.\\" Where the large and powerful often, openly and repeatedly devour the small and weak (for breakfast) -- lest they get devoured themselves, period. There is no moral ambiguity built into the international system itself. It is avowedly amoral and unless we change it, will forever remain so. That evidently is a point the author missed or glided over as he was going about the work of recounting his experiences or, spinning out his tale, whichever one he was engaged in.Being poor and undeveloped, whether the author wants to recognize it or not, puts one at a natural, decidedly and almost certainly at a permanent disadvantage in international economics and politics. Those who have the power make the rules, and are not obligated to help others at all unless they find it to be in their enlightened self-interests. But when and if they do, self-preservation dictates that the are incumbent to do so only up to the length of their own enlightened self-interests, and no further.Nothing the author has said suggests that the U.S. (or the countries being assisted by it) have in anyway violated these well-established laws of international economics and politics, as they are so carefully laid out and dictated by self-interests. Sure, everyone wishes that the \\"terms of negotiation\\" were different: less stringent, more moral, more humane, fairer, more balanced, prettier, fancier, etc. But as others have noted, to hedge in that direction, expands the surface of reality into the other dimension called fantasy.In this regard, I must say that never has there been a more appropriate time to modify Churchill's famous comment about democracy being the worst form of government in the world, and applying it to economics than here: Reformulated it would go something as follows: Capitalism is the worst from of economic organization in the world: that is, except for all the rest.Not only is this reformulation true, but violently and brutally so.As bad as capitalism is (and we get the author's point, here that it is very bad indeed) it is better than the next 100 economic systems (even in theory!). So, there is more than just a cosmetic difference between economic systems that are \\"better than all the rest\\" and those that are just simply \\"bad.\\" It is a fact that capitalism is the very best of the worst the world has to offer. But that is a very low standard and is an indictment that must be charged against the world system, not against the U.S. per se.Is the U.S. supposed to apologize for the kind of world it finds itself in? I don't think so. Couple that with the fact that the international community is still essentially Hobessian, that is essentially amoral, and there is no need for EHMs, or scenarios with fancy fictional footwork: it is simply the world we have, no more, no less, period. (Its cold out there.)At some point, the poor nations too must recognize the kind of chess game they are playing in, and learn to step up to the plate and organize to change the rules more in their favor.Still I don't begrudge the author; he made his points very well, fiction and all. None of this is personal. Its just that given the current realities of international economics and politics, his was not a very good moral point to make.Five Stars."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John is a great writer.

The book reads more like fiction than fact and strains credibility. Large sections are just not believable. Dialogues with people living in third world counties are especially bad and appear to be contrived. At the end of the book you get the sense you have been conned.3. The author's ego-centric writing style detracts from the book. The frequent mention of girlfriends and money seem to be gratuitous ego-centric inclusions aimed at boosting the charisima of the author while actually having the opposite effect.4. The author explains his wrong doings at the beginning of the career (unethical economic forecasts) and repetitively describes his guilt throughout the book. Like other reviewers, you get the sense that the author has not been reformed and is continuiung his unethical behaviour by the inclusion of mis-representations/fictionalisations.5. It's not obvious that this book should be avoided until the first few chapters have been read.6.

Most of the information in the book is available through other sources. There was also no satisfaction of him taking us from the start of a project to the end. He speaks vaguely of his various projects, never confiding in us about any details. However, he took ample time to talk about his feelings of guilt and second-guessing. For someone who second-guessed himself as much as he claimed to have, he seemed to make it through a good 20+ years of this work. Without the details, the stories do not have the ring of truth. And, the imposition of his self-doubt and guilt on virtually every page, just leaves the whole story flat and unmoving. And the biggest question is, if he really was a member of such a ruthless and powerful organization, how can it be that he is still alive after writing this book?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"An insight view of our government foreign policies toward third world countries.

We can see how our government make wars to benefit the mighty corporations, their CEO's that move freely between high position in congress or the white house and the helms of large corporations. Sadly Mr. John Perkins is a dying breed. I commend Mr. Perkins' courage for speaking out for what is righ, and just. His call to others to speak out, and do what is right. His call to others to fight in a democratic way, by using the power of our votes to change the corruption among the learder of our country's government. A leadership that seems to be only at the service of big corporations for the benefit of few mighty rich families.

I bought it because of my interest and curiosity regarding the subject, however the subject of the book turned out to be John Perkins. This book is completely self-indulgent. I'm surprised it wasn't distributed out of the trunk of his car. While he probably has a great story to tell and extreme insight into this lesser known strategy in world finance, it is all squandered amidst his use of the book as personal therapy. I find it hard to place Mr. Perkins' character - is he the protagonist, a martyr? I say neither. I have no sympathy for a man who immediately expresses his disgust at the work he finds reprehensible, but continues to perform these duties for some thirty-odd years (successfully and to the clear detriment of millions). It's little solace that he chooses redemption in the form of a profit hungry, sensationalized account of his sins. I'll admit that is how it works in America, but something tells me the damage done at his hands in those many years will not be cleansed by a book signing tour.Read the book if you have time to pick out a few gems of insider knowledge among his constant moral realizations, detailed accounts of his luxurious lifestyle, and even visions of Jesus. If not, then pass it over."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"While I do believe the evidence is there that loans and aid to developing countries have served primarily to enrich corporations like Bechtel and Halliburton while hamstringing third world governments with horrifying debts, this book is not believable!I think that Perkins has channeled some alter-ego or something.

What makes a sex-obsessed young man in his early 20s psychologically unique? How important does this guy think he is, the \\"kindred spirit\\" to assasinated presidents?I wonder how hard the publishers checked any of these facts--this reads to me like Carlos Castenada or James Bond--a ridiculous, self-serving fantasy!Unfortunately for me, I share the author's political agenda.

Ask yourself why the bibliography, while interesting, is so sparse, and filled with books that a novice might have come up with in a quick pinch on researching the subject (if you are not academically inclined, trust me, it almost feels like a list of best-sellers).

It has the feeling of having been unedited, written in one pass and sent for publishing as quickly as possible. There are many repetitions of ideas which were entirely unnecessary, and insertion of personal anecdotes that are only vaguely connected to the story.Often Perkins spills into talking about his feelings of guilt and hesitance toward his actions, and pointedly trying to show he was allowed no choice in these matters. Overall the story has the taste of an apologia, talking about how he was taken advantage of, citing personal weaknesses [shyness, difficulty with women, being economically well-off, but feeling downtrodden in the face of those who were better off, etc. etc.], and this all becomes rather tedious after a while.There are chunks of good info as to the operating procedures of the powers that be, but even so, he writes so poorly, that you are required to decipher them for yourself, by seeing the pattern in his repetitious stories.Not to mention, very little of the information in the text is material that did not make the news over the last 35 years.For those of you who wish to know the jist of the book without having to wade through the personal sob story, here is my little outline of how Perkins implies the powers that be attempt to control the world:1) If anyone has anything you want, get them indebted to you. In the international scheme do this by:a) Getting economist teams to project huge changes approaching in the next few years,thenb) Use this to force the government to give large contracts to engineering firms to modernize the country, after taking loans from the government to do so.c) Now that the growth is nowhere near what your economists projected, the country is indebted to you for work you already did, and it can never repay it. Ta-Da, now they are in your pocket, and have to vote your way, and give you all the licenses for oil drilling, and lumber harvesting etc.2) If that doesn't work, engineer a coup d'etat, and install your own puppet dictator who will do everything in your best interest (see above).3) If that doesn't work, denounce the leader as an enemy of the world, manufacture consent of your citizens, and invade.That's all. Nothing we haven't seen before."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It is surprising that after so many years working \\"as an economic hit man\\" he doesn't have any concrete proofs for his claims.

His training as an economic hit man is vaguely described. The name of the corrupt Saudi prince he pleased is not stated.

Even before the recent news of America forgiving billions and billions in debt owed by poor countries, this book was very hard to swallow. It is based in decades past recollections that seem already distant, insignificant and contrived while suspiciously detailed and in real-time (e.g., as the author writes of times gone by, making up thirty year old dialogue from page to page, chapter to chatper, to fit his theme all too consistently).What's really wrong with the screenplay--a better word to describe the content--is that average citizens in third world, remote, disconnected countries are eloquently debating and discussing issues with John Perkins and in tones that only have come lately. He is having this repeat flavor discussion with young men and women all over the planet which is essentially the rote, extreme leftist trash that has swelled only in the past several years.A reasonable person just has difficulty digesting this blarney. It would not seem so outdated if Perkins did not try so awkwardly to connect these long past happenings with 9/11 and very current events in ways that don't quite work. They do not pass the most basic of smell tests.He makes no effort to establish credibility. His only characters that tie the conspiracies together are nameless or faceless. Outrageous as the claims are, there are no real situations even vaguely described that justify them within the work. I read through some of the reviews and see people applauding his courage and the import of this book. Frightening is the only word that comes to mind. I'm asking myself if we are reading the same book.Perkins is a tangential middle man. He's third string on this team he discusses. He was an \\"economist.\\" A numbers cruncher. He cooked the books so his consulting company could make more money. He was unethical then. He's more unethical now as he moves off the scales of delusion to the most extreme of grandiose claims. Along the way, he suggests that we should have lost prior wars and intimates that good Americans should root for our downfall.Mr. Perkins is lucky he lives in an overly soft America, this country he describes as bent on empire. If America were truly so inclined and truly this bad, you wouldn't being hearing this nonsense and this book would not be wasting so much time of so many people.I exaggerated above. It's not worth a penny."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This has to be one of the most nakedly false and politically biased books I have ever read. Perkins weaves a web of weak whinings about grand conspiracies, third world oppression, and the unseen dark forces of globalization.There is nothing to back up his claims. His roles were inconsequential. His facts are thin. His key characters, the ones he poses as real people, seem unreal, and where real, do not support his assertions.He will have all of us believe the United States is puppet mastering financial institutions and intelligence services to dominate the world. Please! Watch the news. Read a paper.The problem with this, if we focus on just one of the countless problems with this severely flawed set of false claims, it is the simple fact that the US is, if anything, besieged by powerful opposing interests on all fronts today. It is not dominant. Its conspiracies, if you buy into any of them, have not been too successful. Look at China, India, the EU, extremism and terrorism, Iran, N Korea.If Perkins is warning us of the perils of a dominant America, look around. Human civilization has always been trapped in king of the mountain syndromes. We have been at the top and one of the most magnanimous non-empires, the only one, in the history of civilization. And, we are being attacked on all fronts by friend and foe alike. Why? Because, they would be kings of the mountain. Not because we are bad, or our policies are corrupt. Again, please. Which nation is the better model? Just tell me, John. Which country should we emulate? Communist China selling our nuclear secrets to madmen? Formerly allied Europe, rebuilt by the US, protected by our military, now politicking at our consequence? How about Islamic law? Should we adopt that model?You may want to read about the perils of a world where America is beholden to nations and interests that care nothing of freedom, democracy, stability or your lavish liberties to write egregiously misguided hate books.The US does not need another Perkins. His lot is doing a very good job already of hollowing out this country from within.His book brandishes the ugliest kind of sentiments you can imagine.

Relentlessly justifying his inaction by:a) Claiming how his parents brought him up having to grow up \\"without\\" many material possesions (boo hoo!).b) His desire to protect my daughter's future (she's out of college now, so have you gotten her a job at Bechtel yet?)c) Your love of the indiginous peoples of the world and your desire to protect them and the charities of help them.The truth is that this author has never strayed far off the proverbial corporate reservation that has nourished him and provided him with countless opportunities. After \\"retiring at 45\\" with the oil company money from the sale of his corp sponsored alternative energy company...instead of using his knowledge and money to actually do something about the situation (like perhaps starting a legal fund to sue these companies in court, etc.)...the spineless author ran back to the jungle to assuage his guilt among the very same people he began his career by screwing! Nice work buddy!I find his \\"crimes\\" worse than those of the corporate masters he derides...for it was obvious to me that it was his ability to show true sympathy to the plight of the people he was there to plunder that makes him the true villan of his \\"confession\\"!You should be ashamed of yourself sir...for there were so many things you could have done with the wealth you accumulated off the sufferings of others...other than passing yourself off as just another New Age writer!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The book rightly insists on the importance of 3rd world debt in U.S. economic dominance / Third World economic slavery. A book like David Korten's \\"When Corporations Rule the World\\" is more detailed and factual about the corporatocracy that made it happen, but Perkins personalizes the history: when Roldos of Ecuador and Torrijos of Panama get \\"taken out\\" in plane crashes, they are not just names but friends who put the interests of their countries' poor first. The reviewers who pooh-pooh \\"conspiracy\\" probably bought the Bush administration's line on Iraq, too. When it comes to recent world history, Americans are amnesiacs; when it comes to foreign news, we're hapless consumers of P.R. I do wish Perkins were a better writer and included more details, but if this highly accessible book does anything to wise up the American public, it has done its job."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I see I am not alone in my response to being required to read this book. I thought I was taking economics, not extremist contemporary politics. This book is ludicrous. The author is a false-prophet, make-believe tattle-tale. I do not approve of knocking down my country in order to make book sales. I do believe in fairness, equality, human rights and all those values Perkins suggests he shares. And yet, I do not get the sense that we share anything at all. I believe in those things truly and do not banter them about as part of some self-serving, self-hating agenda. Anyway, this goof is no hit man. He's just another guy that did bad things and is atoning for them by doing more bad things."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I was struck by the many unsupported, negative allegations by the author throughout the book. One example, refering to the Summer Institute of Linguistics, on pages 142 and 143, the author makes several vague allegations against SIL. While I was not aware of SIL before reading this book, the author's allegations left me with an uneasy feeling because, as you may know, it is usually impossible to disprove a negative. What is missing from these two pages in the book is proof of guilt. The author should provide solid evidence of guilt. Who exactly fed food poisoned with laxatives to Indians? What is this SIL person's name? What Indian village? What date? When did this crime occur? What exactly were these \\"assortment of underhanded techniques\\" that SIL people used to trick the tribes to abandon their lands? The author does not support his vague allegations with a single footnote. He provides no evidence whatsoever--no documentation at all in his book--for these very serious charges.Out of curiosity, I performed a Google search and found a website for SIL. I contacted SIL and asked for a response to the author's allegations. A prompt reply came from: Thomas N. Headland, Ph.D. International Anthropology Consultant, SIL, and Adjunct Professor, University of Texas at Arlington; Visiting Professor, University of North Dakota (summers 2001-06); WebPage: http://www.sil.org/~headlandt/Mr. Headland wrote:First of all, the most salient error on these pages is where Mr. Perkins states that the five American missionaries killed by the Huaorani Indians in Ecuador in 1956 were with the SIL (p.142). That is incorrect. None of the five were ever members of SIL. There are several other errors of fact about SIL on these two pages: SIL was never in \\"sinister collusion\\" with the oil companies. There were no \\"missionary reservations\\" set up for the Huaorani in Ecuador, so it is false to state that SIL encouraged the indigenous people to move from their lands onto them. SIL never gave gifts to Huaorani under the condition that they deed their lands to the oil companies. The claim that SIL gave the Indians food laced with laxatives to cause a \\"diarrhea epidemic\\" is ludicrous."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I have been an avid listener to DemocracyNow.org (one of the only true sources for news in America) and I have learned tidbits of this and that about various atrocities in our world.

It is hard for us Americans to accept the fact that we are citizens of a country which has long been ruthlessly and relentlessly building its empire, and which is literally run by a military-industrial complex in the guise of government. But acknowledge these truths it we must if we want to put a stop to all the damaging hypocrisy and get back on the track to a true and healthy democracy.Most of us had no idea, for example, about the true history of Panama-that it once belonged to Colombia, that Teddy Roosevelt sent the navy to invade, that the U.S. then claimed the canal zone as an \\"independent\\" country, that Panama was thereafter for all practical purposes a colony of the U.S., that President Torrijos and Carter signed a treaty whereby the canal would be returned to the Panamanians, that Torrijos was most likely assassinated, or that Noriega is in most likelihood not at all the gangster he has been portrayed to be.Perkins' book is a logical follow-up to Stiglitz's \\"Globalization and its Discontents\\" and Chomsky's \\"Hegemony or Survival.\\" Don't miss it if you want to know what is really going on."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"All the time I was reading this book I couldn't help but think of that old confession joke. A young man goes into the confessional and proceeds to \\"confess\\" all sorts of pre-marital indiscretions. The punchline is the Priest remarks \\"Young man you aren't confessing, you're bragging.\\"I'm sorry I wanted to like this book but too much of it just struck me as untrue and an ego-booster. So much so I believe I uttered an incredulous \\"Oh come on!\\" at least once a chapter.What really nailed it home for me was the Epilogue. It felt like when C. Montgomery Burns wrote his autobiography (Will There Ever be a Rainbow?). In his epilogue Mr. Burns comments about how much the reader enjoyed reading his book. An assumption inspired by the author's ego rather than the story. Perkins assumes it too. He writes as if everyone who read the book was \\"moved\\" by it. I was moved, but moved to laughter. It just proved to me that this was not his confession but his bragging.I give it two stars because some of the stuff in was interesting. However, I would not recommend it to a friend."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone, particularly engineers or Economic Development career people. The tone set my teeth on edge a little - too many \\"culpa meas,\\" but I figured an exposure of our \\"Aid\\" machinary could only come from a professional self promoter anyway - it takes a scammer to expose one. The overall message is sound though like others here I don't agree with all the black and white points of view, demonizations, conspiritorial tones or Perkins' painting and degree of angst regarding who the innocents and villains are.As an Aid professional, a British citizen, born and raised in British Colonial Kenya, I recognized this book more as a description of the continuum of Colonialism. My opinion is that now we are in an age where the people, the global consumers and the peasants and the workers all can DO something about it. The biggest challenge Aid faces today is Poverty. Self sufficiency, sustainabiulity and trade issues are critical, how we spend our resources can be more effective than how we vote. Do it well and don't exaggerate how morally bankrupt the USA is or how innocent the peasants are because it only exacerbates and cements more deeply the victim/recipient and donor/exploiter role. As an immigrant to the USA I see this country as equally generous as misguided and ignorant. I see many 3rd world countries believing that THEIR solutions come from lighter skins and \\"first world educations.\\" I see Aid organizations believe that 3rd world solutions only flow from where the money comes from rather than where the problems are.Aid is an exchange. This book shines a light on OUR cooperation with meaningless, mindless, \\"do-good-ism\\" that does harm more than \\"THEM\\" - whoever the bad guys are."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is so unbelievable that it's entirely believable. An economic hit man? A guy dashing around the world and inflating loan estimates in order to leave countries in debt to the US? Wielding economic influence in order to build a reserve of countries who have no choice but defend us? Helping a country build themselves up only to take advantage of them? No way! But like I said, it's so unbelievable that it's believable.I saw this listed as a recommended book by the Tattered Cover, so I knew it had to at least be decent without even reading the jacket. At first, I was a little unsure about where the book was going because the author, John Perkins, was groaning about his privileged upbringing and high-powered connections, so I thought, \\"Oh, he's one of those guys.\\" BUT, because he at least recognized that he had said privileges, I knew he was off to a good start.. And I'm glad I stuck it out because I learned a lot and the author had the good sense to show remorse later on. You know, after he figured out all of the awful things that occurred in part due to his actions (but not after spending years battling his conscience and raking in millions).Regardless, the book is extremely intriguing. He spends a lot of time blaming (while accepting his part in it) the \\"corporatocracy\\" for how it is ruining lives worldwide. He's anti-Reagan and pro-Carter, which is evident in his explanations of the Panama Canal and oil dependence. Some of what he talks about (assassinations, the Panama Canal treaties, OPEC, etc.) are so sensational that I spent hours researching the conflicts he brought up. But it's definitely worth it.Anyone interested in international relations, the economy or democracy should read Confessions of an Economic Hit Man. Even if you don't agree with the author, the issues that he brings up are very pertinent to today's current events. I spent a lot of time doing my own research based on things that were mentioned in the book, and I can honestly say that I have a better understanding of how the international economy works now than I did before. And even if you aren't inspired to share the knowledge, it's information that you cannot un-know and ignore. So, go learn something!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is a very quick read. However, the content is incredibly shocking.

Williams) ReviewWhen I read this several years ago, I was very disappointed in the government that had recruited the author. I am sure this was the intent of the Economic Hit Man (EH). But, everything was too perfect. A sultry blonde recruiting him in a hotel room? There was backing by the U.S. government in economic meetings and negotiations? C'mon! It all seems too extraordinary. The EHM seems to have made a career of this with at least 3 books. I had problems. Why was he convinced his shadow backers could deliver? Why did he spend most of his book justifying his self-described nefarious acts and policies? Finally, as the book ends, I concluded it was too extraordinary to be believed. I then filed the book away. I never really got the thrust of his activity. His team pushed poor countries to undertake projects that required far more money than their analysis justified. The countries during the projects had to borrow beyond their ability to pay to complete the projects. Thus, they would never be able to pay off the loans. By golly, that sounds like our mortgage activity during the real estate bubble. The scam was to lure people to take so much cash that they could never pay it back. What a strategy! This is worthy of our FED.That sounds like a strategy by Alan Greenspan. Perhaps his CIA front fooled even the EHM. Maybe Greenspan was pulling his string and running him after all.This is an interesting read. It flows well and the narrative seamlessly follows interesting, and perhaps imaginative, stories."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Great book to show the roadmap of American politics and business, the constant blatant self-interest of a few very influential or/and rich. But the author is late. He should have come out many years earlier. The damage is done and new tactics are in the air. He is a has-been, and should be safe now. But many people suffered by his hand. He is making great money, I'm sure now. Plus he also has a cultic intrest-astral travel books that sound even scarier than his previous involvment. His book can lead to a loss of patriotism and lack of faith in gov't and people as happened in Russia during Glasnost and the Yelstin era. What good are confessions to the church, make them to the priest and go after the sins. Maybe he is doing that now, and definately I believe his life story. The Russians and other nations have long known what America is about. Americans themselves simply live in denial."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is a must-read for everyone who wants to learn how governments REALLY operate. John Perkins gives a detailed, insider's view of the corruption that is rampant in our own government (and others) and to the fact that the US will use all means available to gain world domination.Considering how fascinating this book is I was amazed at the number of one-star reviews. This book paints the United States government in a very unflattering light. It includes details on criminal behavior by past presidents and other government officials.

John Perkins goes a long way towards explaining the reasons for this widely held dislike. This book should encourage readers to look carefully at, and read between the lines when our news media and others, present us mere mortals with arguments in support of political, corporate or religious aggression, espoused by the priviledged few, especially if they happen to be American. A very good book which should become compulsary reading for all secondary school children throughout the world.

If you want to understand the world you live in, you MUST understand the horrifying, heartless, cruel, greedy, ugly and, frankly, stupid operators who invade, threaten, bribe, steal, destroy, and take--and then celebrate the fruits of their base deeds in their superficial, glitzy, super-rich lives of play, display, folly, ostentation, oceans of money, and gobs of power. They are murderers one and all. John Perkins received great benefits--if it can be said that money, travel, excitement, and prestige from destruction, plunder and murder truly benefit a life in any meaningful or real way. Mr. Perkins left the life of plunder and murder, and has courageously confessed--and is doing all he can to right the wrongs he committed and the horror and destruction he participated in creating. The change reminds me of John Newton, the man who wrote the song \\"Amazing Grace,\\" a British sea-faring slaver who woke up. May we all wake up and refuse to contribute to invasion, destruction, plunder, enslavement and murder with our indifference, passivity, ignorance, trance-like states, and mindless consumerism, and by our continued consumption of the steady diet of propaganda and lies we so eagerly lap up and repeat and repeat."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Author notes he resigned in 1980. His book was published in 2004. The recent course of events such as 9/11 in 2001 and the economic collapse of 2008 were much later than his active involvement in 1970's. An insider back in 1970's can provide important details of what happened then. I am not sure how easily it pertains to something so many years later. The author can provide insight and speculation, but lack details if out of the loop for so many years. Mike Ruppert and David Ray Griffin and Paul Rea provide compelling evidence of what happened on 9/11.

It opens your eyes to the realities of the world we live in, the sinister mix of US government and corporate interests and their exploitation of and interference with developing nations to suit their agendas to the extent of assassinations and war. Excellent insights into world events and what really drove them. Makes you start reading between the lines about current events, and being more sceptical about mainstream media reporting. Naomi Klein's Shock Doctrine-the rise of Disaster capitalism also covers US manipulation of foreign governments and the backroom dealings of government and industry, but this book does make for easier reading, more like a spy novel, which makes it all the more harder to believe that it is non-fiction.

The author's frequent bouts with guilt feel gratuitous (enough with the mea culpas; we get it already), but the fragmented tales of empire building draw the reader in. Perkins' lack of substance regarding several key issues, including those whom he calls jackals, creates deserved skepticism. By contrast, his first-hand experiences in the exclusive game of international shadow politics is sometimes revelatory (yet ultimately much like what many of us already guessed but never had the proof). Conspiracy theorists will read this book with Biblical reverence while the rest of us should simply admire it for what it is: a fascinating, if flawed, personal confession from a cog in an immense, ethereal machine."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Having just finished \\"Confessions\\" and then reading some of the reviews on this site, I'm wondering if I read a different book. I didn't find any dark, ominous conspiracy theories lurking in the shadows, or a \\"Smoking Man\\" reminiscent of \\"The X-Files\\". Nor did I find a left-wing nut job who hates capitalism and modernity. All I found was a 225-page mea culpa that presented a number of opportunities for self-examination and skepticism.Several reviewers were disappointed that there were not more hard-hitting facts and statistics in the book, or that Perkins wasn't a major player (arguable), or that links between the CIA and Halliburton weren't exposed. But this book is simply the confession of a man who understands the system he worked within and doesn't like it. That does get tedious at times, as he continues to share his guilt with us. But it doesn't dilute the idea that we all participate in economic and political systems that have negative ramifications as well as positive ones, and we rarely examine our culpability.How many of us lament the turmoil in the Middle East yet drive vehicles that only get 10 or 12 mpg? Or expect those countries to fall in line but don't support direct talks with them? How many of us want to provide good jobs in the United States yet shop for the cheapest goods \\"at any cost\\"? Every choice we make has consequences, and all Perkins wants to do is examine his, and suggest that we do the same.So, if you want to spend a couple of days reading about his self-examination, this book is probably worth it. If you want hard facts and a political bias, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The British wore their empire proudly, we as Americans try to deny our dark side. Whether you finally choose to play down this dark side or come to the conclusion that things must change, you should at least read this insider's story and weigh his conclusions.What this story reveals is painful at times, but Perkins writes with an engaging and deeply personal style. What some reviewers are interpreting as egoistic actually is breaking new ground. His work is a twist on the traditional Calvinistic \\"confessional\\" tract: a call for a secular spirituality that can embrace and make demands on capitalism for the sake of democracy.It is hard not to feel jealous of Perkins, however, as he travels the globe with all his power, money, and privilege. It is as if he is a successful Faust: he made his bargain with the devil and yet has never had to pay his pound of flesh.Perhaps he has now made a bargain with the Light Side to speak and write and lead us all to find a better way. He's got his work cut out for him, since most of us participate in some way in the present system. We all need conversions. I basically trust the guy, but each reader must reach his/her own very personal judgments about his story.The way to read his story is with an open mind and heart: does what he is saying help to explain things you have read and seen? What defensive reactions are you experiencing and why? What inner work do you need to do to free yourself from the mentalities of empire? Or would you rather go on denying, willing to make the compromises of a hitman even though the world has had enough of that game?Or, perhaps, his piece of the puzzle is too dark, too one-sided, or not exactly what we need as a world right now? Is the truth too hard to stomach, or can it motivate us to change? Those who disagree with Perkin's call to change need to come up with their own way to understand the failures of the West in our engagements around the world. The statistics of failure are too stark. The cries of anger and pain are too clear.Just as our international corporations have pillaged other countries, this same corporations-government has blatantly pillaged us in Iraq. I was deeply offended as an American citizen by the irresponsible \\"use\\" of money. Their(our) behavior made it clear to me before I even read this book that this was business as usual for them, so I was not surprised by John's confession. Much of what John reveals is actually crying out in the newspapers and around us day after day.Ultimately, this is a book about spirituality. If we reflect deeply on what each of us have experienced, read, seen, and know about the present state of our society, and our corporate, governmental, and institutional culture, we have to admit that we have slid down the wrong track over the last decades and need to embrace change with courage, a clean heart, and a new commitment to our deepest principles and values."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The work raises some interesting questions on globalization, and how fairly its benefits are distributed. Ultimately, no answers are offered.Perkins delivers a disjointed narrative of experiences in unrelated countries around the world, spanning over a decade, in which the only unifying principle among the events he relates is the fraud he claims to have repeatedly perpetuated. One of the major flaws in the book is the lack of detail the author provides, which leaves the reader to essentially take his word that, though he doesn't relay it, some really interesting backroom deals took place.The other major flaw is that Perkins spends a great deal of time lamenting what the work did to him, while also repeatedly pointing out how fabulously he benefited from the salary and perks. He comes across as someone who is bragging about how well he has done in his career rather than someone who feels he has actually done anything wrong. There is a disconnect between how guilty he claims to have felt about exploiting the people of the countries in which he works and his actions over a 25 year career. I was left doubting the sincerity of his change of heart when he repeatedly accepted the benefits of the system he describes as corrupt, accepting bribes (in his words) to cover up his story and to perpetuate the system, even after he left his initial position with his consulting firm. This includes several agreements to discontinue writing this book, which he claims he felt obligated to write, in exchange for personal gain.Perkins missed an opportunity to tell a better story, raise more fundamental questions, and contribute to the debate on globalization. We are left with a work that does raise some questions, but in the end you probably won't feel you have any better understanding of the ramifications of economic globalization."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Great read.

In Nicauragua and Honduras alone they lost over 100,000 people due to much of the things Confessions of an Economic Hitman talks about. Our death squad funding, asassinations, and bombing strikes. If you were to compare their loss of life to US population percentage wise, it would total over 2 million Americans dead. Sorry to ramble, but I just finished the book and I'm all charged up.John Perkins is not a professional writer, but he is a man who writes from the heart and is deeply troubled at the legacy he leaves behind for his daughter and all of us. His convictions and emotions more than make up for his technical prowess. This book is one that is hard to put down. I was stayed up all night reading it. What is in this book should be common knowledge, told to all of us on the news or in the papers... Instead, we get Martha Stewart and Scott Peterson while millions have died due to our inteference and covert operations. but of course the networks and the newspapers are owned by the corporatocracy that John Perkins was a part of.

In it the villains are the U.S. government, shadowy intelligence organizations, greedy American corporations, and as a hook to make the story more plausible than the usual pretense of investigative journalism, John Perkins himself. His claim is that the U.S. National Security Agency recruited and encouraged him to work for a consulting firm in which he falsified data to support large loans for projects which were planned to fail. According to his conspiracy theory, the inevitable bankruptcy of these projects then led to American access to natural resources, military cooperation, and political support.And who is this John Perkins, who claims he could confound the best economists of the World Bank and other aid institutions? According to biographical material scattered at random in the book, he majored in American Literature at Middlebury college, transferred, without a degree, to Boston University where he received a BA in Business Administration with emphasis in marketing. While the study of literature and marketing are quite apparent in his book, a basic economics course, which was surely required, was not. Oh yes, he \\"had taken a couple of intensive courses aimed at teaching executives the finer points of econometrics\\". It's nice to know that econometric modeling of developing countries is so easy!The author presents no evidence that he was recruited to be an \\"Economic Hit Man\\" by the NSA. He admits that as a consultant he had no communication with anyone who ever even claimed to be NSA, nor did he ever receive any money from the NSA. Instead of evidence we are referred to shadowy figures which, because no details are given, can not be refuted. One is the \\"Uncle Frank\\", who is the friend of his stepfather (who is also unidentified). The other is the mysterious Claudine Martin who mentors him and steals his heart in what can only be referred to as dream sequences. He admits that no records of her exist. She warns him that true hit men, which he colorfully describes in his book as Jackals (too many spy novels, John?), will kill them if they ever tell the true story of what they are doing. Later when she has disappeared, and no one seems to know that she even existed he writes, \\"An image flashed before me of Claudine flailing, falling in a rain of bullets, assassinated.\\" So now the tale has its heroine, albeit short lived. Assassinations play a walk-on role in two chapters near the end when two Latin American leaders are killed in plane crashes. These become assassinations in the author's view.The author's musings and speculations of what happened on the world scene in the 60's and 70's are liberally mixed in with quite accurate reporting with footnotes supplied from popular sources. John Perkins shows us that he understands this technique when he writes, \\"Outright lies can be refuted. Documents like those few were impossible to refute because they were based on glimmers of truth, not open deceptions...\\" Perhaps John Perkins meant this statement to be the review of his book.THE PROBABLE STORYMost books tell us if the author has written other books and lists them both as evidence of credibility and to sell those books. This book merely states that Perkins is \\"The author of five previous books.\\" A search shows that they are in the mystical, shamanistic genre. One, Shapeshifting: Techniques for Global and Personal Transformation, Sept. 1, 1997, was favorably reviewed this way. \\"He [John Perkins] tells fascinating stories of how he overcame his initial skepticism and doubt to become one with a chair, transform herbs into a newspaper, and travel through time and space as a blue ball of light.\\"If the author wrote \\"Hit Man\\" as a believer in not just the spiritual transformation of the mind, perhaps with some physiological effects, but in true super paranormal powers, then his motivation is easy to fathom. With a rich fantasy life, he could almost unconciously transform (I almost wrote shapeshift) his life experiences into a fantasy book. The Peace Corps exposed him to the poverty and injustice of the undeveloped world early, and the assumption must be that this would concern him even if he did join to avoid the draft. Consulting is a difficult profession ethically. You are often hired to tell the client what he wants to hear. The fact that you live well as an expatriate, who by accident of birth has a privileged life, while equally intelligent, hardworking people have little, increase the feelings of guilt. With these feelings, and little real grasp of the complexities of international development, it is an easy leap to a fantasy world to exorcize these demons. By transferring these evils to the government, shadowy security agencies, and greedy corporations, he and all of his readers who participate by believing him become almost guilt free. In several passages of the book he admitted to having lived in a fantasy world. Is he still living in that fantasy world?There may be, however, a (to use one of the author's often used words) sinister explanation. The author, John Perkins, is a con man. He admits that as a consultant he was a con man. Some less charitable reviewers would say that an author who preys on readers beliefs in super paranormal powers is a con man. His remark quoted above to avoid outright lies and base what you say on glimmers of truth are almost the credo of a con man. Perhaps the niche market for shamanistic, spiritual books is just too small and the market for conspiracy theories just too tempting (think The Da Vinci Code). Watch out for his next book now that he has written a lucrative best seller.SO WHAT?So what if a writer crafts a conspiracy theory blaming America, intelligence agencies, and greedy corporations for most of the ills of the underdeveloped world? Because it diverts the public from the real concerns of international development. There are many good books written on this incredibly complex subject. How can we explain how some countries with minimal foreign aid and scarce natural resources take off economically? How do we eliminate the most inefficent tax of all, corruption? How can we quantify those quality of life issues which, as John Perkins correctly notes, are not a part of GDP? How can we harness the efficiency, innovation, and drive of market economics while providing social safety nets and regulating adequately to keep the free for all from getting out of hand? Many very smart, well educated, dedicated people are seeking these answers and writing about them. Economic shape shifting is unlikely to get us to good solutions.Roger Smith, 3/16/07"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"An interesting read - Conservatives who are sure that it is nothing but lies should open their eyes a bit to the reality of America's perceived role in the world, but Liberals who think that every word is true should put down the bong and apply some critical reasoning.His basic thesis is that America deliberately ruins developing countries by convincing them to sign up for massive loans for infrastructure projects that have no chance of improving the economy enough to pay for themselves, thereby putting those countries into America's debt and ultimately, under America's control. As a self-described \\"Economic Hit Man\\", his job was to write the economic projections that deluded the poor \\"natives.\\"The book is a weird mixture of probably-true but boring stuff about travelling around the world and writing economic predictions for proposed projects, and a James-Bond-meets-Woodward-and-Bernstein collection of shadowy characters who recruit him then train him to...what?After all the superspy stuff about an NSA uncle, a hot babe agent who \\"instructs\\" him during long sessions in her apartment and apparently breaks up his marriage, and a mysterious contact who gets him a job as an economic analyst at one of the many beltway-bandit companies that specialize in analyzing developing economies, all he does is travel around and write economic projections. How exciting. He admits that he fraudulently inflated his projections so that his company's client would get a big consulting contract.Oh - but his work was part of a massive business/government conspiracy to create an all-powerful global American empire, which only a sinister clique of insiders are aware of. Supposedly he would be killed if he revealed it or even tried to leave it. But his only proof is his own stories, which require significant suspension of disbelief.Or maybe he just liked his job, his high standard of living, and his first-class perks when traveling on company business. Given his early Peace Corp service and his fairly-obvious political leanings, it would seem that writing this book was more of a cathartic apology for playing the game so long and so well. And he hasn't been killed yet.As he himself explains, his publisher first suggested that he turn it into a novel rather than publish it as a non-fiction expose. In other words, it needed spicing up. My guess - the James Bond stuff was added after this initial rejection. As he mentions, some of the characters are \\"composites.\\" He made them up.And in the end, I find it hard to believe that the James Bond stuff is factual, nor do I believe in a vast American conspiracy as he describes. It just doesn't make sense, nor does it match historical reality. Which third-world country now dances to the American tune because they owe us some money? Where have we reaped a vast economic windfall because of some papers stored in a bank vault somewhere? Instead they repudiate their debt and/or inflate their currencies which is about the same thing, and they nationalize our companies' subsidiaries and abrogate the contracts they've signed. And maybe they should - that is for others to decide. Either way, our \\"debt leash\\" is pretty weak.But, there is something here for all to consider, including Conservatives who've probably cheered my review so far. America does sometimes do more harm than good by \\"helping\\" developing countries. We do let our major corporations go out there and convince national leaders that if only they'd sign on the dotted line, everything would get better. And we do let \\"Economic Hit Men\\" offer projections about how great it is all going to be, but if it isn't, the poor countries are supposed to pay up anyway.It isn't just America - most \\"first world\\" countries have their people out there trying to do the same thing in the \\"third world.\\" France. England. Russia. Japan. Even China. It isn't necessarily bad, it's just good business. As long as it works as promised.But then again, look at the incredible improvements in the standard of living of people in most of the world over the last 50 years. India. China. Latin America. Eastern Europe. The world-wide rise of the middle class, a truly new thing in the history of the world. A lot of it is due to dams, and power plants, and electrical grids, and water supplies, and ports, and airports - all the stuff the \\"hit men\\" push.Yes, we should regulate our international companies and our global development agencies, making sure that they are not shoving dubious projects down the throats of nations that can't afford them in the end. But let's not imagine that they are evil monsters who've done nothing but bad. They are economic entities organized to make a profit for their shareholders, and most of the time that is done by creating and servicing a market. This improves us all, as long as coercive shortcuts aren't permitted.One more thing that smells wrong about the book - a major problem in the developing world has always been corruption. Leaders steal. A huge fraction of the money loaned to needy nations winds up in their filthy fingers and in their overseas accounts. It is almost a cultural thing - why become a leader if you can't make yourself, your family, and your friends wealthy? The book acts as though every leader of every developing nation - especially those of socialistic leaning - was a virtual saint who only cared about his people until an evil America corrupted him or replaced him with a more-pliant stooge.Sorry, but power has always attracted the people who love power and would enrich themselves given a chance. America didn't invent it. In fact, one of the reasons for our world economic leadership is that we've managed to reduce our own corruption to levels lower than ever seen in human history. I only wish that we could better export this precious commodity. We don't. That, I think, is the true tragedy of globalization."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book has been out since 2004. It is enlightening to read it in 2009 because there are some predictions made that have come true. Additionally, John Perkins has so much insight because he lived it. I experienced many feelings while reading \\"Confessions.\\" 1) Perkins has reaped the benefits of his actions and now he can speak out; 2) We must all get involved and do something to save all the people on the planet; 3) I have to look at my own behavior. Even though I am not the worst offender, I am a participant in this calamity.Everyone can learn something from this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Hugo Chavez, President of Venesula, recently called George W. Bush \\"The Devil\\" in an address to the United Nations. Now some people might consider and call Chavez a fool for such a so-called unprofessional verbal attack at President Bush. However, once you get through reading Perkins' memoir you'll understand why America is sneered upon by the developing world.The policies of his constituents (as indicated in this book) basically show that the American military-industrial complex that demands ever increasing levels of consumerism has raped the developing world, and men like Perkins were the sex assault specialists.There is a passage in which Perkins recounts at time when he was in Jakarta at a street festival, and it's worth the price of the book itself.I highly recommend this book for those wishing to get a better grasp as to why 9/11 happened, why there will certainly be another one, and what can be done to curb the policies and agendas that will surely hurt everyone's sense of well-being over the next 20 years."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This one was a mixed bag, too bad you can't give 3.5 stars, which happens to also be the consensus reviewer opinion. I was reminded of what I thought of The Celestine Prophecy - a book that touched on very provocative and interesting ideas but dropped the ball on plot, writing, character development - I really WANTED to like it just a little more than I ACTUALLY liked it but I walked away with something to noodle on.I applaud the author's efforts to publish some behind the scenes revelations about how nasty our foreign policies are and how beholden they are to the few and powerful who benefit directly *no bid* at the expense of the rest of us.I found the confessional and autobiographical aspects to interfere with the story. I lost patience with the protagonist. I couldn't handle how long he labored over quitting and how long it took for facts and feelings to percolate into action. When Perkins is writing about world events, he is captivating and can pull a succinct and moving analysis together (easy to believe he was a successful snake-oil pusher when writing up glowing economic forecasts he didn't even buy).When he is discussing his personal thoughts and emotions, his style, the quality of his communication and his self-awareness are more stunted. The personal anecdotes and any mention of interactions with women throughout the story line seem almost like they were written by an adolescent male.On balance, I would recommend the book as an eye-opener for anyone who has a creeping sensation that something's rotten in the way America acts in the world but can't put their finger on it. I don't think reading book will dramatically turn someone's worldview around - you are going to give the author some slack and let him weave his yarn if you're already \\"on his side\\"."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins exposes what we all knew all along. The Uniteds States acts exclusively in its own interest. We do not, as a matter of policy, establish altruistic policies simply because \\"its the right thing to do\\". In fact, according to Perkins, the USA is no different than the Roman empire and, just like the Roman empire, is doomed to failure and extinction. This world view expressed by Perkins, who lived and operated in this world, is frightening in its exposure and potential results. I would recommend this book to anyone who believes that the USA is the \\"Shining city on the hill\\", encouraged and inspired by God. We aren't anyone special. We don't hold a monopoly on good intentions and honest dealings. We will act in our own best interests regardless of who is hurt and/or harmed. Perkin's work is very readable although it can be tedious at times in dealing with his personal life and love interests. These relationships do advance the story but could have been shortened and, therefore, more time and energy expended upon the nuts and bolts of his work as a financial hit man. However, all in all, this is a must read for everyone. Really blows away the naivete."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is an insiders story of how the global multinationa institutions, the World Bank, IMF and private banks work hand in glove withglobal corporations such as Haliburton and Bechtel to undermine and assure the continued impoverishment of the nations of the Third World. Tho book explains how secret schemes cemented the intimate relationship betwen the US and the House of Saud. Also revealed are the hidden mechanisms behind the deaths of President Omar Torrijosof Panama and Jaime Rolodos of Equador who tried to stand up for their people."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I was loaned this book by a friend who believes the world is controlled by a conspiratorial group whose goal is world domination through a one-world government. Therefore, I was fully prepared to write off Perkin's story as just another conspiracy theory. But, in deference to my friend (with whose theories I DO NOT agree), I read it.Surprisingly, I found I could not put the book down. For me, Perkin's revelations were like having an insider's guide to a difficult jigsaw puzzle, one where I had many of the pieces but was having trouble seeing how they fit together.There have already been enough reviews written about this book and its contents. I will focus on what I can add by way of my own personal experiences. Incidentally, this book is definitely NOT a conspiracy theory, as the author makes clear.Since 1995, I have been cruising fulltime on my sailboat, visiting many countries south of the border. My travels include spending many months (in some cases, years) in Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Bonaire, the Dominican Republic, etc. I'm presently spending six months in Venezuela. I don't hesitate to claim that I've learned much more about these countries and their peoples than the average U.S. citizen. I don't stay in insulated tourist hotels and resorts, but much prefer to mingle with the locals, playing music on guitar and talking politics. (BTW, knowing how to play guitar will buy infinitely more good will among the common people of Latin America than all the Gringo dollars you can carry.)As far as Perkin's descriptions of events in the countries I've visited, I found him to be 100% credible; e.g., the unilateral invasion of Panama by the U.S., the role of United Fruit in the Latin countries, the devastating effects of U.S. big oil interests in Venezuela and Ecuador, his account of the ascendency of Hugo Chavez, the explanations of why and how Torrijos, Roldos and Allende met their untimely ends. Perkin's accounts of such things may be new and surprising to U.S. readers, but they are completely accurate and well-known facts among Latins.Having for a long time been a serious student of world history, I can also find nothing incorrect about Perkin's accounts of events in other parts of the world. In my opinion, this is a very important book. It should be made required reading at every high school in the U.S. Then we might have a chance of producing a new generation of U.S. citizens whose heads are not buried in the sand and who might stand some chance of reaching valid conclusions, DESPITE their incessant exposure to the U.S. mass media, about how the rest of the world lives and thinks.If you are considering buying this book, read the five-star reviews. Most importantly, don't be intimidated by the caustic language and attempts at character assassination evident in many of the negative reviews. It shouldn't require much of your critical thinking skills to see that most of those reviews are nothing more than irrational, vindictive mud-slinging by right-wing fanatics. The mere fact that there are so many virulent condemnations of the book, the author, and his message, should alone be enough to stimulate your interest.In sum, Perkins is entirely credible, the book is sufficiently documented, and his story is important for an understanding of the political realities surrounding \\"globalization\\" and the role of U.S. mega-corporations in that effort. It was also very well-written. I couldn't recommend any book more highly."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I recommend this book very, very highly. Mr. Perkins is aone-of-a-kind, \\"been there done that\\" person. \\"Confessions\\" is aneasy-to-read book yet covers very complex issues, so please excusewhat are clearly some contradictory opinions of the reviewer!On a much, much smaller scale I could relate to what Mr. Perkinsdiscusses in his \\"Confessions,\\" deservedly a NY Times bestseller. I hadto decide whether to sell out myself, and I did to a certain extent, andthus while working for BP I was given the opportunity to travel to anumber of countries, where at times I saw the horrifying differencesbetween the haves and the have-nots. And like him, at times I tried tospeak the language or at least learn about the culture of the country orI was visiting, and because of that and as well as having a certainopenness was given the opportunity to interact with denizens of countriesat a deeper level than those Americans who think that we are No. 1, andthe rest of the world should be subservient to our dictates. FortunatelyI was really just a \\"lackey,\\" I just did their bidding, I wasn't part ofthe huge money deals that \\"hit men\\" like Mr. Perkins were involved in.I don't think the author would be surprised to read that people whoread his \\"Confessions\\" can at the same or different times be amazed, feelgreat admiration, and anger! Thankfully he provides a fairly in depthbackground of his early life, specifically being a \\"poor underdog,\\" thatlater perhaps helps us to understand why he took great advantage ofbusiness opportunities given almost no one at such a very young age. Yethe doesn't \\"sell out\\" right away either. He spends 3 years working inEcuador for the Peace Corps, and as mentioned already, he is broad-mindedenough to learn languages and cultures. Throughout his career, even beforehe can no longer deal with the way he feels about his \\"hit man\\" activities,he is always learning about the places and peoples he visits, and (againas I have found) people in other countries really appreciate Americans whoare interested in them. I found these parts of the book very telling in thesense that a) even people who might resent EHM realize that they are justdoing a job in a very complicated world, and b) surely when we engage peopleopenly and fairly we can get along much better than when we force ourworldview on them.One of the other reviewers gave a link to an audio interview, which Iwould highly recommend, where Mr. Perkins states repeatedly that he wasseduced by money, sex, and power, and his handlers knew he could be seduced!As other reviewers have noted, the book is not consistent in thedetail of what is discussed. A number of chapters are less than 5 pages, infact I don't think that any chapter is even 10 pages! The shorter chaptersleave you feeling that a great deal has been omitted, though perhaps this isbecause the author had so much material to cover he only wanted to hit thehigh points. The chapter on the deals that were negotiated between (US)corporations and the Saudis after the oil embargo of 1973 substantiatedother material I've come across, and was the right length to me.One could easily imagine a movie made of the author's experiences, thoughit would take quite a few actors in different countries to do itproperly!Yes, most \\"idealists\\" certainly feel anger at what the author was apart of, making great profits for big corporations and himself, while saddlingThird World countries with huge debts, which they must service rather thanhelping the indigent, the ones we have been led to believe are helped by theoften false term \\"foreign aid.\\" Where I felt the most anger was on p. 154,where Mr. Perkins negotiates a deal where he is paid three times what he madeas an economic hit man for doing nothing more than being available as anexpert witness! I found it impossible to understand where his conscience isat that point, though he certainly makes use of his free time to work onissues such as alternative energy and taking people on tours of the Amazon.The best chapter for me is Chapter 30, \\"The United States Invades Panama.\\"On pp. 180-1, in very blunt language, Perkins writes about howbusinesspeople have become wholly desensitized to what they are doing andhow they are affecting the less fortunate, and yet convince themselves thatwhat they are doing is \\"legal\\" and thus justifiable. And how many of usprofit in our investments from these activities? Also, the chapters thatcover how leaders of countries who don't cooperate with the \\"corprotocracy\\"are killed are totally devastating!One thing about the book that I found somewhat strange is theauthor's constant use of the word \\"coincidence,\\" that our lives are greatlyinfluenced by certain \\"coincidences,\\" that even by his own admission happenoften at exactly the right time. Since he is an expert in indigenous culturesand shamanism one would think that he would be well acquainted with theterm \\"synchronicity,\\" though this is not exactly an ancient term, yet surelyit implies a connection with a \\"universal flow\\" we try to get in syncwith. In fact Mr. Perkins seems to go out of his way to use coincidencerather than a more \\"New Age\\" term!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"An entertaining recollection of pivotal economic and political events that helped shape our current global economy.Alas, if only any of it were true.Perkins does precious little to provide readers with any evidence that he met with the people he claimed to have met, performed the work he had performed, and most insulting, base his allegations on facts and academic integrity.Little surprise then that this was never picked up by a major publishing house (I know, I know, the right-wing publishing world is all part of the conspiracy).There is one thing that I found disturbing about the book. There is an arrogant imperialist undercurrent to Perkins argument. That is, the U.S. -our government and corporations- run the world and developing countries have no sovereignty or accountability in making decisions in the best interest of their people. That he, John Perkins, has swindled nations into accepting onerous debts that run counter to their national interests.Of course, none of this is true. If it was, Perkins could use the U.S. court system, international organizations like the U.N., or even courts of other countries, both affected or neutral, to secure justice for the alleged global victims of U.S.-orchestrated fraud. Surely, Enron hasn't escaped everyones' memories already?As a reader, I'm left with the conclusion that much of what he has written is either false, or at the very least, unsubstantiated. I'm not a fan of our foreign policy in general, but this book does little to champion causes that could actually improve the lot of those Perkins claims to champion."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I found this book to be one of the most enlightening commentaries on American foreign policy that I have ever read. It has opened my eyes to a whole new viewpoint on America's supposed altruistic leadership in the realm of global politics. While many of us citizens would like to view our efforts to \\"help\\" poorer nations to advance their standard of living as a charitable exercise Mr. Perkins makes it clear that our government has always been pursuing an entirely separate agenda.What is striking to me is that while these efforts appear to be directed in our national self-interest they are emphatically not in our enlightened self interest. The long-term consequence of our selfish pursuit of material resources at the expense of third-world populations and our ceaseless attempts to install puppet governments around the globe are the steady erosion of our nation's credibility and standing in the world. Perkins drives this point home clearly in the book.As a nation we seem peplexed when the United Nations fails to slavishly follow our agenda. Perkins' historical narrative exposes the reasons why other countries see that it is not in their interests to cooperate with the United States. Perkins' illustration of this point alone is enlightening and makes the book a worthy read.I agree with a previous reviewer that the book is short on analysis of events outside of Mr. Perkins' personal experiences. I too found that this book made me interested in the other works which the author sites (Getting to Know the General and House of Bush / House of Saud).I also believe that Perkins' \\"solutions\\" are naive and somewhat confessional. He seems to be a man who is trying to atone for his past by espousing a leftist agenda that has little chance of success and which seems utterly naive for a man with his experience. He doesn't provide any possibility for a modification or improvement of our capitalist system. Instead he states that we should just stop what we are doing and change our ways. I don't think this is a workable solution and that is my main criticism of this work.Nonetheless, I think this book is a must read for anyone who hopes to develop a deeper perspective on modern political issues."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book gets straight to the point of whats wrong with our great country.

I've worked in some of the places mentioned in the book, so I have some experiential basis for what I'm about to say.I think Perkins has an important story to tell, but in my opinion -- and obviously, I can't prove it -- most of the conversations with intensely politically-aware Indonesians and Panamanians are at best dramatizations, and at worst complete fabrications. I'd like to believe that Perkins is simply dramatizing and consolidating experiences and conversations in an attempt to add some flavor to his story, and that would be fine if he'd just be straightforward about it, but in the preface he states, \\"This is a true story. I lived every minute of it. The sights, the people, the conversations, and the feelings I describe were all a part of my life.\\" Your editors should have told you that when you make a claim like that, and then go on to quote supposedly real people, the quotes have to be accurate and documented.John, your story is important enough to stand on its own without making stuff up. I believe that you're being honest in the sense that you're relating your true perceptions of how US policies are/were perceived by people in other countries, and I believe that some of what you say -- like how you dealt with the Canal engineer on a picnic -- is how you'd like to remember things, but I do not believe that a Panamanian waitress in a strip bar/whorehouse engaged you 40 years ago in any kind of dialogue about the brutality of fascist dictators. When you put words in the mouths of the locals you ran across in your work, an intelligent reader has to wonder about how truthful you're being about the rest of your story, and that's a shame.Want an easy solution? Just throw a disclaimer in the preface that the dialogue is sometimes dramatized, and that sometimes the characters are invented composites of people you've run across. You'll gain a lot of credibility by being honest about your ability to remember the exact details of long-ago conversations, too. Personally, I could do without the dramatization. The real story is drama enough.As it stands, I regard this as a work of semi-fiction."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"As a 1st generation American from one of the worlds Perkins visited, I find his analysis fair, well-spoken and uniquely interesting. His creative writing, and personal accounts of United States policies and economic Consulting firm MAIN's Central/Southern American and Middle Eastern actions from 1965-1985 is quite incredible.I was however uncomfortable with the text's poor transition post 1985 to today and the fun but much less credible Fahrenheit 9/11 comments which begin in the last 2-3 pages of \\"Part II - 1971-1975\\". Parts I & II are entirely based in Perkin's personal experiences and his internal ethical dilemmas as an EHM. Yet Part II concludes in a departure from Perkin's personal journal based storyline to a controversial editorial on G.W. Bush's link to the Saudi family. To an avid & informed reader it comes across as a poorly inserted publishing ploy to briefly and vaguely discuss controversial points on G.W. Bush during and election year. Rather than entering into a more detailed analysis as the author does on other topics, many connections are made and then not well supported leaving the reader to believe its only point is sheer shock value with a goal of increasing sales volumes of an already controversial book to begin with.Overall, a great read. Definitely one for the list if you're interested in Globalism and even the effects of Outsourcing and Offshoring in the greater economic picture. I would recommend this book to all consultants out there simply due to the strong moral & ethical dilemmas the author addresses and in some ways doesn't."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Addendum: The original review is below. The reason for an additional comment is the rather surprising number of reviews cropping up that accuse those skeptical of the author's claims as working for The Man. For the record, my father was an executive who was the intended target of a botched assassination after he threatened to expose corruption in a Latin American country. Also for the record, I have always been leftish in my politics and probably know a heck of a lot more about Marxist thought than the credulous writers who believe the exaggerations of this book. The Marxist critic Walter Benjamin was once upbraided by a colleague who found him reading a right wing newspaper. To which he replied something to the effect of \\"Oh, sometimes it's much better than the drivel published by our side.\\" How true! Kudos to the other reviewer who compared the author to the great, but for a while utterly loony, mathematician Nash.Original review: I grew up squarely in the center of the American economic imperialism of the 60s and 70s that this book seeks to expose and can only say that I find the author's effort terribly disappointing. Some mysterious woman appears early on to recruit him as an \\"economic hitman\\", never to appear again; conspiracies seem to be hatched but one lacks all detail about the conspirators; dots just don't connect. It is very hard not to come to the conclusion that the author was just a garden variety cog in the gears of the American international business juggernaut who has painted and shaded his career in order to make himself into an international man of mystery. Overestimate electric demand for a power plant you want to build in a third world country! Push large loans! Yes! Isn't this awesome Mini-Me! Had he been a mortgage broker I'm sure he would be writing about his mission to mire homeowners in debt so as to control the vote.What's weirdly missing, except in flashes, is the real feel of this period. One of the things completely absent is the staggering corruption that American firms often ran up against. For every United Fruit there was some construction company that had to revise its geological studies (and the engineering) so a new plant could be built on the land of a politician's relative. That, or lose out to a German or Japanese company. I was personally acquainted with one of the most powerful oil executives for Europe and the Middle East. His skills would have made Machiavelli proud, but the remarkable thing was how he put them to use in order to stymie politicians on the make or clean up scams that afflicted local operations. Muckraking journalists would actually come to the guy because he was a straighter shooter than anyone else they talked to.The end of the book, where the author suggests forming study groups to discuss it is stunningly hilarious in its unreality. Study what exactly? I'm sure the author would argue that there's a million and one things he can't tell us or he'd be shot. Well, he should write the book that will get him shot. Braver people seem to be doing this every day. Until then there's really not much to discuss."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The stuff that John Perkins writes about is all true.

For that I'll have to wait to finish reading Chalmers Johnson's book Nemesis. John fails to deliver the broader vision that Chalmers does into the working of empire building and its relation to the failing republic."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I read a lot of books on global ecopolitics and world problems. A big reason is my feeling that the power elite may be figuratively preparing to play their hand and I want to somehow be a step ahead of them.This book is efficiently written. It is as if an editor went through and boned down a dull 600 page documentary while keeping the important parts. It encapsulates the start of our domination of international finance and development at Bretton Woods when the Marshall Plan was approved. The Marshall Plan provided US government funding for the rebuilding of war torn Japan and Europe.Rockefellers bank, the Chase Manhattan bank, has long specialized in multi-billion dollar loans to third world countries that pave the way for extraction of natural resources, especially oil. In order to more efficiently focus on this activity, the \\"World Bank\\" (really a US bank) was created with the IMF (International Monetary Fund).This is how the dragon works. The elite in Third World countries are presenting with overwhelming studies that somehow 'prove' that the elite and their country will benefit from borrowing tens of billions of dollars from the World Bank. The bank then sends most of this money to approved insider US construction and engineering firms such as Bechtel, Halliburton, Brown & Root, and Shlumberger. The elite who approved of the massive loans are taken care of but the debt is intentionally so massive that the country has no real hope of ever paying it off. Now the Bank has legal recourse to do what happens when debtors can not pay off their loans....they extract their pound of flesh.There are occasional leaders who prove to be incorruptible and are truly working in the interest of their people. If the economic hit men are unable to prevail against these leaders, jackals move in and the benevolent leader often dies in a ball of fire. Examples are Jaime Roldos of Ecuador and Omar Torrijos of Panama, whom the author was personal friends with. There are times when the jackals are bypassed and the military does the dirty work. Examples are Panama and Iraq.Economic hit men are paid very well and enjoy a lot of other perks as compensation for selling civilizations down the river. These civilizations lose their lands and quality of life as their environment gets torn apart and poisoned. Unemployment and poverty tend to skyrocket. Tin pot dictators are installed who are beholden to the interests of the international banks and corporations.I majored in economics for a long time. I know an ex-jackal, well I hope he is an \\"ex\\" anyway. An old 'girl friend' dated a man \\"close to the top\\" of a bank whose name I can not mention. In the 80's, that man complained of the exact same things that Perkins (book author)points out. His conscience also bothered him and he left after personally doing many loans to the LDCs (less developed countries).As of late, they are following a less gentlemanly approach. They are simply attaching countries via military conquest (strictly my observation).The reason this book receives so may one star ratings is because it is both highly effective and it takes aim at the biggest economic entity of them all. There is a very good chance that you work for the corporatocracy involving the international banks, corporations and the intelligence gathering side of the government. In other words, you work for Rockefeller (strictly my observation)."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins writes early in the book that a series of publishers offered to publish his book as fiction before he finally found one who had the \\"courage\\" (by which I can only suppose he means \\"obliviousness\\") to publish it as nonfiction. As I started reading, I thought that Perkins had been the result of horrendous editing; I repeatedly did double-takes, amazed at what the poor editor had let through.Eventually, though, it became clear that the book was fiction, and any editor who had the misfortune of trying to massage this (literally) unbelievable tale into nonfiction would, simply put, find himself overhelmed. The characters are caricatrues: the prep school, the Markov economic theory pioneered by the author (strangely absent from all the literature) and the vision of, I kid you not, Jesus, but with a automobile axle in place of a cross.And then there is the op-ed piece for the Boston Globe; their website does not yet have archives for the time period up, but even in the situation that he *did* write the op-ed, his explanation of why, in his situation, he wouldn't have been instantly fired, is downright lame, to the point that I literally groaned when I read it.I wish it were the case that \\"you can't make this up,\\" but in this situation, the conclusion any reader should quickly reach is that Perkins did. Suspension of disbelief is fine for fiction, and publishing this book as Fiction would have been an excellent way of making a few bucks off the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" phenomenon, and indeed that's probably a large part of the public's continued infatuation with conspiracy theories. But for any reader who doesn't suspend disbelief with this book will find themselves recognizing the constructed nature of the plot, the characters and the locales; any reader who does any fact-checking will find that Perkins' few solid statements are downright wrong.Don't waste your money on this book. Perkins does the cause of social equality a disservice, by treating it as a meme to make a few bucks off, rather than a fundamental human desire."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I understand the author claims these accounts are real but, having just finished the book, I find that impossible to believe. The characters feel fictitious. The dialogue sounds fake. The politics are ridiculously extreme. Everything about this book is wrong, exaggerated or hateful. I am very disappointed. I would like a refund."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I picked up the book in Abu Dhabi, where it was prominently displayed in that corprotacracy Western cultural imperialist bastion the \\"Virgin Megastore\\"... in Abu Dhabi Mall (built by Australian imperialist construction firms!!!)While I found part of the book interesting (he is a good storyteller, and his accounts of Trujillo in Panama in particular are fascinating) the book was incredibly disappointing as a whole.This is due primarily to:1. The lack of any substantive facts about his \\"EHM\\" work or the results of it, for which we are left to simply take him at his word;2. His deeply self-centered and dangerously oversimplified notions of how the world economy works, colored with further personal narratives of dubious factual quality and very weak sourcing; and3. The relentless self-aggrandizing and redemption-seeking that just kills the style and completely erodes his credibility.As a memoir naturally whole book is about the author, John Perkins, but this does not keep him from including an additional 4-page timeline of his life and his achievements, and 3 more pages about... himself. I mean, this guy has such an ego I am certain having lunch with him would be a nightmare, just from reading the book.Throughout the whole book, Perkins dubiously links himself to major world events, another reflection of his pathologically self centered world-view.In the chapter \\"Pimping and Financing Osama bin Laden\\", he somehow links his brief and negligible work in Saudi arranging an escort for an unnamed member of the royal family to Osama bin Laden.He links himself an his work to Osama via... a US News and World Report article and another article in Vanity Fair - which he probably picked up at a supermarket check-out isle.Overall the book weaves a decent story and provides an interesting look at some of the evils of US foreign policy - but it is by no means credible, and by no means well balanced or complete.Perkins, based on his numerous other titles on Amazonian spirituality etc, may have had a bit much ayahuasca to remember all of the events clearly enough and as such, his book makes for a bit of a waste of time compared to the many other titles on the subject."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"So Interesting.

He intimated how organizations such as NSA and such operate under cloak of lies and deception with valid points on how our own government brings wrath upon its citizens through its aggressive maneuvers throughout the world.Perkins discusses the validity of government sanctioned assassinations and hints that even American citizens are not off limits and suggests agencies out of control with no checks and balances to stop a few with agendas at the top from completely dominating the local and global scenes. He also obliquely describes the cowardice of such agencies in refusing to stand by the people working for them, doling out assignments while creating as much distance between the assignments and the people who carry them out. As an ordinary person with no 'connections', I repeatedly felt as if I was a chump and viewed as such by master puppeteers.Did Perkins lose his resolve writing this? Was he threatened?There seems to be no place a government employee can go to safely and anonymously reveal major wrongdoing for corrective action. This is apparent throughout government structure.Who will protect us from our own rulers?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book was great and scary at the same time. If you are wondering why countries around the world hate the U.S. and burn our flag in the streets, this book may shed a bit of light on the subject.John Perkins' book is simple, clear and easily verified through the footnotes and other public sources of information. Criticisms of this book seem to come from people who have not read the material and seem to be repelled simply by the subject being discussed.I would suggest this book to any member of today's gobal society. We need to get our heads out of the sand and make some serious corrections."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The book has 'economic' in the title and promises to discuss a team of people the world bank and the United States' sent out to do the economic bidding of US corporate interests. To potential readers: the book DOES NOT DISCUSS THIS. It details one person's life -- it is half autobiography and half sermon on anti-globalization. There are a number of stories about the author traveling to other places and hanging out with locals as he sneers at the classic american tourist stereotype. There is a lot of talk about the how, only US, businesses are ruling the world. But what is not honest is what is not discussed, such as why would the US government want these economic hit man? How did business and industry collude to create them? Simply put, no discussion in the book if it didn't involve (1) the author or (2) anti-globalization sermon. In his many ramblings, the author hints at some predisposing factors for this global conspiracy (Halliburton CEO becomes US vice-president) but doesn't present direct causal connection. For example, the primary occupation in the Senate is lawyer, and many lawyers hold high office in the US , but that is not evidence that lawyers are conspiring to run the US. Another criticism is that the author displays no small amount of american hubris, he describes america has having the ability to easily dupe the rest of the world into loans, etc that they can never repay. He never acknowledges the fact that: (1) all businesses around the world are greedy: many economic texts discuss how this leads businesses to deliver the best products to their customers and seek economic improvement of their customer base, (2) all countries and cultures are intelligent: that should at least be a part of the discussion, and (3) the result of geopolitics is a complex amalgam of many forces, some of which are corporate influence, in my opinion too much influence, but there are many other influences, many of them social. The lens he presents the world is just too simplified and too biased."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins' story, the personal story of a man that whored his talent on behalf of America's fascist empire with the purpose of ensnaring developing countries within the web of America's parasite class, is a worthy read for anyone wishing to understand what modern imperialism is all about. Like any autobiography, you must assume that the author exaggerates his own virtues. Thus, the reality is probably far worse than the text.This book has received many undeserved negative review on Amazon. Having personally spoken out against a corporation as evil as those described by Perkins, I find the personal attacks upon him convincing evidence that he speaks the truth, for if these corporate devils are apt at anything, it is sending their brainless minions to discredit those who speak the truth to power.Buy this book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"\\"I convinced myself,\\" the author writes on page 30 about his employment in a admittedly greedy company presided over by immoral men, \\"that if learning more, by experiencing it, I could better expose it later--the old 'working from the inside justification.'\\" I refuse to willfully disregard my bullshi* meter when reading a so-called \\"confession.\\" You should too."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The best book I have read on American Foreign Policy and Pure Greed. The same criminals from the administration of Bush Senior (Dick Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Perle etc) are serving under George Bush Junior Administration. They were the architects of the Gulf war.

STRANGE THAT DAYS &Aacute;FTER THE EVENT THEY MADE UP LIES AND SOLD IT TO THE WORLD. The neocons are controlling the American people by playing on their fears, and unfortunately, the average american does not understand the politics behind it. Their stategy in Iraq is a case in point. They threatend the European Countries who refused to be part of the war (Germany, France) that they will not get any rebuilding contracts in Iraq once the war is over. Why does the US think it has the legitimacy to give out contracts for IRAQ? They even tried to change the Flag (making it look like the Israeli Flag) early on after the invasion, but luckily did not succeed. I especially liked the chapter when John went to Indonesia, had a chat with the locals, and they descriped the US is looking for a new enemy as soon as the communist threat goes, and they will take on Islam..

We create problems and having big problems causing bigger problems.I am not being impressed by this Mr. Perkins or his stories. He presents to me more focus on himself and absurd types situations and conversation than to speak of real matters and information. He works my expectatons for big discovery at his introduction, but he delivers not much that I am not knowing and in ways I am not sure is the case as it is. I am liking when Americans show the real interest in our culture and friendship and not only worrying about power and control. Still issues are much or more complx than for what Mr. Perkins shows to us. His interest in other persons in other countries presents to me feelings of his interest is more about him than for the persons he is meeting.He is very big on him while he seems actual a small person with small things to say.I am thinking that some of these things he says are not exact in truth he wants all to believe.

Rather, his stretches of imagination elicit feelings of growing outrage as he displaces his wrongdoings upon an entire nation and economic system. I took off my cynic hat and switched off my BS radar early in the read, wanting to give him a fair hearing. Unfortunately, your every attempt to hear him out faces his further offense at your common sense and reader sensibilities.He comes across more as impotent than importent, quite literally. His feeble attempts to incorporate romance and intrigue leave the reader with this sense that his life has been without any romance and filled only with deranged dreams of power and intrigue. You almost get the sense that always being on the fringe of things he romanticized as he was being such a bad and unethical, and never being part of the concoctions he imagines, that all of this has made him vengeful. His \\"confessions,\\" therefore, come across as no confessions at all, but mostly a tell-all-tell-nothing finger wagging at corporations, banks and Western interests, primarily American.John Perkins book is a petty work by a petty man aimed at petty people who enamor themselves with the petty destruction of a nation's legacy and future, while mocking and spatting at informed thinking and reason along the way. The book belittles everything that is admirable about the United States.If you read this book and fall under its weakly cast spell, I advise you to stay away from hypnotists, door-to-door salesmen, QVC and any other point of vulnerability where the lamest attempt to persuade you or get your money will prove a success to your detriment.

From Clancy to Grisham to Le Carre, I have always loved the adventure of the behind-the-scenes goings-on here and abroad. The idea of reading a real-life account got me excited. I bought the book and quickly got home to read it.Enter the hit man. The only hit related to this book is the theft of my dollars used to purchase a falsely advertised, false story about spectacularly contrived personal experiences. I began to feel very uncomfortable every time Perkins says Thomas Paine would have collaborated with the Viet Cong or some other past or present American enemy. His assertions of IMF and World Bank intentions are so broad and so dark and so unsubstantiated, I felt a little like an unsuspecting cult-follower, preparing to tip back the cup of cool-aid and forever exit the world of sanity, and life itself.I might not be so bothered by all of this if it were not for recent news stories about America forgiving all third world debt. I allowed my mind to entertain the idea that somewhere in Perkins' fantastic stories, however poorly confirmed or defended, that at least somewhere there was a grain of truth. That all came crashing down for good as I realized his entire basis had just been repudiated. His bluff has been called by the game masters, persons with whom the author seems never to have had any type of real or relevant relationship with whatsoever. He is like the \\"mob hit man\\" who never actually works for the mob and never actually kills anyone on behalf of the mob, but is a dirty dealing, under-handed crook who acts like a mobster for his own interests. When caught, he blames the shadowy organization and turns evidence by talking about the mob writ large without naming names or offering any evidence at all. It's like a Cuban refugee who works the sugar fields, has never been involved in politics or been harrassed by the Cuban police coming to Miami and saying Castro personally wants him killed.Perkins message is poison. He has a messiah-complex. He's a dangerous, bad dude.There does seem to be some truth here, however. That truth is that John Perkins was a selfish, egocentric, greedy, unethical, lying, cheating rat when he worked at MAIN. Today, he's all of that without remediation to his character or morals. Whatever is lower than the rat on the food chain, that's where Perkins has gone since his rehabilitation. If you shoot somebody with a gun, turning your life's work againt the gun manufacturers may be laudible to some interest groups. To most, it's absurd. If you confess wrongdoing by wagging your finger and blaming invisible people and forces, you have hardly confessed anything.

It may cause stomach pains or worse."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins presents some interesting experiences, but he comes across as just a spoiled elitist crying about how unfairly he treated people and countries because he was manipulated into a career built on greed. Of course all the while he took full advantage of his opportunities, made a ton of money, and later says that all along his conscience knew better and he only wanted to be the noble whistle blower. He tries to tie different American presidents, government agencies, and companies to a lot of \\"crimes\\", but his writing is filled with fallacies and extremely circumstantial connections -not that I don't think there were some conspiracies, but he should have written about them better. Perkins WANTS to see a conspiracy behind every dollar spent by American companies or government agencies overseas. Perkins WANTS to see everyone or country as a victim in their purchasing decisions -somehow American companies have guns pointed at everyone or every other country's leader's head. I somehow persevered through to the end but found myself really irritated with Perkins when he became so morally outraged with his company that he resigns, and then comes back as a consultant at THREE TIMES the salary that he was making. How pathetic! This guy has a wet noodle for a backbone. Another irritating occurrence is when Perkins is sitting at a campsite in the Amazon and he leans about the 9/11 attacks. Perkins just comes across as a narcissist -he has to be a part of the story; he visit ground zero and changes the narrative from religious fanaticism to economics and his work in Saudi Arabia 20 years prior. Too many times Perkins demeans republican presidential administrations and their corporate connections, but he holds up President Carter as a savior of the Constitution whose only downfall was poor timing on being elected. Puh-lease! Anyway, I do not recommend this book if you really want a good read and care about storytelling or facts."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins, a man who has written mostly about his experiences with shamanism and only eluded to his \\"dark side\\", now comes clean in this eye-opening expose of how real people are paid to destroy countries economies in order to create wealth for the elite. But more than anything, this book for me is about one man's conversion experience - from selling his soul to the highest bidder (even while studying with indigenous shamans) to facing the human and environmental consequences of his actions. Eventually, he changed his life and stepped into the full potential of his heart.Despite the harsh reality Perkin's truth-telling offers, this book is inspirational in that it proves that anyone can change from a life of greed and domination to one of kindness and compassion. I highly recommend his previous books (such as Shapeshifting) which speak to his spiritual awakenings and the role of indigenous people's teachings in leaving the Hit Man life behind."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"You believe what you want to believe. If you're aware of America's history of disastrous foreign policies, you'll love this book. If you hate how mult-national corporations succeed at the expense of our environment, jobs and well-being, you'll love this book. If you admire Marx's theory of capitalist exploitation of the proletariat, you'll love this book. If you think Dick Cheney smells, you'll love this book. It's a matter of opinion and while this book may not be completely free of bias (even the author admits that he took his job partially to expose the actions of his evil bosses), it still is entirely fascinating.But for reviewers to say it sucks because it doesn't adequately back up its facts is unfair to say the least. After all, the author is working for an organization that has managed to keep itself secret for several decades. More than just showing the dealings of one company, we're introduced to the dark world of international commerce. Don't take everything written at face value, but even a little bit of research will reveal that the book contains some kernels of truth. If you can't get past the sociological and political ramifications, then enjoy the book as a brilliantly choreographed and pulsating action-packed novel.

Unfortunately the latter part of the book seems to go a bit to far into supposition, rather than hard fact, and does not make the distinction. If the Mr. Perkins had made this distinction, or simply stopped writing where his first hand knowledge ended, this book would seem much more credible.As it stands now, the latter part of the book focuses too much on the Altruistic agenda that Mr. Perkins would like to advance. While many of his opinions I agree with, such as reducing consumption of oil, and no longer shopping at mega-corporations, this book was not the proper venue, and his venting seems to discredit the firsthand knowledge in the first part of the book.However, the book is a good read, and I suggest you read it with an open mind."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This novel combines the excitement and secreracy of a spy novel in the style of James Bond with the beautiful locals,mysterous women, with intrigue and plot twists.

This strategy enriches American companies, and makes indebted countries obligated to serve US interests. In doing so, poor people become more impoverished, sensitive ecosystems are destroyed, and future generations suffer.All the while Perkins created inflated economic forecasts to justify irresponsible lending by the World Bank and other financial behemoths, he claims to have felt guilty.

So I spent the last week reading it, and very frankly I would like to say that in it there is nothing new that I thought I did not know. It merely confirms that a superpower will do whatever it takes to dominate and control third world countries. I'd like to hear of a successful Hit on a second world country by Mr. Perkins. In summary all I can say that the book is just another Hit, and a loan that cannot be paid back, on who you may ask? On all the readers of Mr. Perkins book. He is making money for many of his generations to come at the expense of our ignorance. As Mr. Perkins also mentions if he gets Hit by a Jackal, then he'll sell more books. Its just another Money Making project for the X-consultant who is making his last Successful Hit. The bit about what you can do for your country, is included so the reader would Pity Mr. Perkins, and say to himself, yes, the author is now clearing his conscience. Good one Mr. Perkins, a very well thoughtout and planned Hit on us all."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Many of my friends and clients regularly travel to dozens of countries. Seldom does such a trip end without finding a weird example of a so-called economic development that has been funded by the World Bank or some other economic development agency. One of my favorite loony examples is a multi-hundred-million-dollar paper mill built high in the Andes far from any trees that can be used to make good paper and the water that is needed to make paper. What were they thinking about when this project was authorized and built? Perhaps the purpose wasn't to make paper.In this memoir, John Perkins describes his covert role in expanding American economic influence by encouraging foreign governments to take on so-called development projects that they didn't need, couldn't afford and which wouldn't pay off for them. When the bill came due, the nations couldn't pay the loans and Uncle Sam was able to muscle the countries for concessions that independent countries probably wouldn't otherwise have made. Panama and Ecuador are the best developed examples in this scenario in the book.Mr. Perkins performed this role ably on behalf of Boston-based engineering and construction firm by creating inflated estimates of the economic benefits of potential projects. In part, this wasn't hard to do because he didn't have the educational background to do the work correctly. But no one in his firm cared. His career advanced because he was so malleable in his upward estimates.Who benefited? In the short term, such projects create lots of profits for U.S. manufacturers and engineering and construction firms like the one Mr. Perkins worked for and those that have employed so many people in the three Bush administrations (such as Bechtel, Halliburton and the rest of the usual suspects). These projects also help U.S. oil companies get access to new reserves. Wealthy families and politicians in the countries who do the projects often receive hefty amounts for their cooperation.Who lost? Just about everyone else in those countries. The results described for Ecuador are particularly appalling. Indigenous peoples often suffer the most harm. It can be like when Europeans first moved to the Americas.Mr. Perkins also makes unsubstantiated statements that if the economic \\"hit\\" didn't take the U.S. would follow up with assassins and/or invasions. That part of the case wasn't made effectively in the book. Conspiracy theorists will love the coincidences he describes though.Mr. Perkins describes in the beginning of the book how he was recruited by the National Security Agency and assumes that either NSA or the CIA was responsible for his training in how to perform his role of overstating economic projections. He offers no verifiable proof that the training he received came from those quarters.In fact, I found his argument a little strange in this area. In order to encourage him to be irresponsible in making economic projections, he was encouraged to think of himself as an \\"economic hit man.\\" How is that really the way to encourage a young, idealist person to do the wrong thing? I don't think so. It probably would have made more sense to appeal to his patriotism. I wonder if Mr. Perkins may not have been set up instead by a foreign intelligence operation which wanted Mr. Perkins to eventually repent of his role and share this story. Although I have no proof that this scenario might have occurred, it seems more logical than the story Mr. Perkins assumes is true. If you read the book, decide for yourself what probably happened.In any event, few readers will approve of the idea that the United States should overtly or covertly encourage countries to make bad public investments in infrastructure projects. This book will be an eye-opener for those who don't realize all of the harm that was done during the 1950s-1970s in this arena. The book itself doesn't provide a thorough look at the practices since then.With the situation over energy in Ecuador in the balance now, I hope that readers will ask their representatives to look into the role the U.S. has been playing there.The book isn't a particularly well written one (one of the reasons that I graded it at three stars). The book spends much too much time relating Mr. Perkins' hand-wringing about the ethics of his work over the years. I came away unconvinced about parts of his story. In the places where he describes what's going on as being a short-sighted attempt by his company to make more money, it reads convincingly. Where he ascribes motives to others, the book often doesn't have the proof to make the charges stick. His reasons for waiting so long to protest also seem inadequate to me.But the real lesson of this book is that we should each examine our consciences about our work . . . and follow the advice of that frontier philosopher, Davy Crockett: \\"Be sure you're right, then go ahead.\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you're interested in reading about \\"conspiracy theories,\\" this is a decent read.

Americans(the people of the United States) are not the \\"evil\\" being exposed here. The citizens of this country are just another group of suckers being bilked by a relatively small group of international bankers. These basic schemes have been going on since the beginning of organized government. What bothers me is that so many people in this country are so hypnotized by infantile nationalism that they are unable to discern between the people who want to protect our democracy and those who are striving to crush it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Since the end of WWII, American imperialism has been on a steady and successful march, according to John Perkins, not with guns, soldiers and bombs, but through economic manipulation, political subterfuge and enormous intimidation.What Perkins calls the \\"coporatocracy\\", a closely networked collusion of government, powerful banks and corporations, (MAIN, Bechtel Group, Halliburton, World Bank, WTO, NSA, CIA and The U.S. Department of Treasury) have infiltrated numerous key third world countries, (Colombia, Indonesia, Argentina, Panama and Ecuador) especially targeted for their abundance of natural resources (oil) or their particular military geographical strategic advantage, hoodwinked to accept enormous loans under the guise of vastly improving the country's infrastructure, creating massive debt, thus, the country is forever beholden, economically held hostage by the creditor, (U.S.) and bullied, intimidated to the extent where the few wealthy benefit while the majority of the country's population suffer in poverty.Perkins was hired by MAIN, with one primary objective, which was to justify to a particular country borrowing billions of dollars for engineering and construction projects that would be eventually funnelled back to MAIN, because the country would not be able to pay back the loan. This made the country an easy target for unusual favours, such as military bases, U.N. votes, oil and natural resources. Perkins was known secretly in this trade as an EHM, economic hit man, inflating economic forecasts on huge construction and engineering projects, with the single intent of bankrupting the particular country. The man was trained specifically for this task, evidently battling with his conscience for over thirty years until a few major world events, such as 9/11, caused him to break away completely.This book certainly reads like a good Robert Ludlum novel. Perkins' first training came from a smart and attractive woman known as \\"Claudine\\", meeting secretly at her apartment, and learning the strategies of an EHM, skilfully inflating economic forecasts on projects to foreign government officials, ensuring billion dollar investments, knowing full well that the country would be in debt in a matter of a few years. \\"Claudine\\" goes on to say:\\"We're paid - well paid - to cheat countries around the globe out of billions of dollars. A large part of your job is to encourage world leaders to become part of a vast network that promotes commercial interests...we can draw on them whenever we desire - to satisfy our political, economic, or military needs.\\" (P.17)Perkins cites many examples throughout the text, including the Saudi Arabian Money Laundering Affair, connecting the United States to a country that give terrorists asylum, yet will continue to keep the money and oil flowing, making the wealthy richer and our gas tanks full. Even more disturbing are the examples of Argentina, the illegal invasion of Panama, and lastly, the invasion of Iraq, where now the Halliburton Corporation (Vice President Cheney once was CEO) has the contract to \\"rebuild\\" this war torn country.This is an honest account from a man whom was threatened and bribed not to write this book, but could not stand his raging conscience after recent terrible world events that could lead to further crisis. My gut impression, after turning the last page, is that Perkins is not out to become famous, make more money or seek political office, but a man whose conscience required him to tell this story. This book is both enlightening and terribly disturbing, but a necessary read for all those concerned about the world situation, and where it is possibly leading."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins the 2004 New York Times bestselling author of \\"Confessions of an Economic Him Man\\" helped me understand the questions: \\"Why is Anti-Americanism growing around the world? How did America become a Superpower with minimal military action like former Empires?\\"Perkins'job as the Chief Economist for Chas. T. Main, an international consulting firm, was to convince strategic countries to accept enormous loans for infrastructure development and to ensure that U.S. corporations got the projects. Upon default of the loans The United States Government, World Bank, International Monetary Fund IMF, and other U.S. dominated aid agencies then have access to the countries' resources (especially oil), strategic land and the installation of military bases. Perkins says that international economists are in essence highly paid \\"Economic Hit Man\\" (EHM) hired by international corporations to hide the U.S. governments' involvement.In the 1980s U.S. corporations became legal international companies to minimize rules and regulations. Perkins calls the big banks, corporations and government a \\"corporatocracy.\\"Perkins says the majority of people in the debtor countries benefit little. For example when the wealthy ruling families in Ecuador accepted a billion-dollar loan (backed by the promise of oil revenues), to build roads, hydroelectric dams, industrial parks and other power projects they brought the country to virtual bankruptcy. In three decades the poverty level grew from 50 to 70 percent, unemployment increased by 15 to 17 percent, public debt increased from $240 to $16 billion and the natural resources allocated to the poor declined from 20 to 6 percent.Although oil accounts for almost half of Ecuador's exports since Texaco and Shell discovered petroleum in the Amazon in the 60s the oil companies receive $75 for every $100 of crude oil taken. Three quarters of the remaining $25 goes to pay off the debt by selling Ecuador's rain forest to the oil companies.The people of Ecuador are afraid of the oil companies as they are destroying the forests and poisoning the rivers. The Trans-Andian pipeline leaked over a half million barrels of oil into the rain forest-more than twice the amount spilled by Exxon Valdez in Alaska. Many people, animals and vast areas of the rain forest have died. Thirty thousand indigenous people hired American lawyers to file a $1 billion lawsuit against ChevronTexeco Corp. for dumping 4 million gallons of oil-contaminated wastewater, heavy metals and carcinogens into the rivers. The 350 uncovered waste pits continue to kill both people and animals.In August 1979 Jaime Rold&oacute;s became the first elected president after a long line of dictators. In May 1981 he warned the US foreign interests he would force them to leave if they did not help the Ecuador people and use the natural resources responsibly. He died in the fiery airplane crash a few weeks later. Newpapers blazed \\"CIA assassination\\" and Perkins said the circumstances supported the allegations. He says U.S. assassins are called \\"jackals\\" by the international consulting firms.Osvaldo Hurtado took over as Equador's president and launched an ambitious program to increase oil drilling by Texico and other foreign companies in the Gulf of Guayaquil and the Amazon basin.Perkins says most countries including Indonesia, Guatemala, Chile, Venezuela, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Panama are beholden to the U.S. global empire and have suffered a similar fate. Third world debt has grown to more than $2.5 trillion. The top one percent of third world households account for 70-90% of the wealth and real estate while over half the people of the world survive on less than $2.00 a day about the same they received in the 1970s.When Perkins finally admitted that only a few people profit when a country has a debt burden and felt guilt that U.S. foreign policies were alienating many nations and ultimately led to the U.S. attacks on September 11 he left Chas. T. Main.He decided he could no longer be a part of a system that uses fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortion, assassinations and war to foster impoverishment of millions of people across the planet, where citizens are used for cheap labor and deprived of health benefits, education and social services.He recommends that U.S. apply the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness to all people of the world not just Americans as history shows that communism and terrorism are predictable reactions to oppression and exploitation. In the long run no one benefits from world starvation, diseases, deforestation and water and air pollution. He also believes big corporations, banks and government can decrease terrorism if they used their resources to end poverty, disease, starvation and wars."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Skepticism is good. I personally believe that one should be skeptical and critical of everything you hear, even - or maybe ESPECIALLY - if it comes from a view aligned with your own. I admit to share an agenda similar to Perkin's, namely that I'm against global corporate dominance and imperialism, but I still wanted to bring in a dose of skepticism and ask: Is Perkins' book believable?I have a two part answer to that. You can separate the book into two layers: Perkin's life story (which are subjective), and historical facts (which are less subjective and can be further researched). I'm not particularly interested in Perkins life or his psychological struggles, nor am I interested in its precise veracity. As he admits, he had made some changes to the specific dialogues, and I suspect he might have made up some scenes that serve more rhetorical purposes, such as serving as a platform for discussion. This is just my speculation, and to the extent that those scenes are fabricated, I don't really care.Then there are the historical facts, which center on whether something actually happened. For the historical facts, I urge the reader (skeptical or otherwise) to look it up. If you live in a free country, these sources are readily available, although I would not start at a high school or even college history textbook. I would maybe look into something more reliable.Regarding whether such economic hit man actually exist, that's harder for me to prove here one way or the other. I HAVE tried to do research into it, and nothing has come up to disprove Perkins, although the burden of proof is on him. This is like someone trying to write about a government cover-up of extraterrestials: OF COURSE you don't won't find anything 'cause it's a cover-up! Well, I would keep an open-mind about it, and DO MORE RESEARCH. Read more, look up his sources, look into the history of corporations, governments, etc. I am more inclined to think the Perkins is telling the truth, namely because I grew up in some of the places he mentioned, and it \\"rings true\\" to me, but that's as far as I have.If nothing else, Perkins book may serve as a platform for dialogue, and whether you agree with his specific recounting of events, I think that globalization and corporate rule has had an adverse effect on the world can be substantiated.Perkins style is not particularly interesting, but then again he's not an author. In fact, if he wrote with the eloquence of Dickens, I might be LESS inclined to believe him.So, my final advice: Whatever your views, whoever you are, keep reading, researching, follow-up. We should be critical of all views, especially those we agree with, because we are more vulnerable to manipulation there. If you're interested in learning more about American foreign policy and globalization, I suggest the follow:\\"A Problem from Hell\\" by Samantha Powers\\"A People's History of the United States\\" by Howard Zinn\\"Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace\\" by Gore Vidal\\"Dreaming War: Blood for Oil and the Cheney-Bush Junta\\" by Gore Vidal\\"The Corporation\\" (DVD and book) by Jennifer Abbott, Mark Achbar\\"Wal-Mart - the high price of low price\\" (DVD) by Robert Greenwalk\\"Nickle and Dimed\\" by Barbara Ehrenreich\\"Understanding Power\\" by Noam Chomsky"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The book jacket and introduction lie about what is to come inside the book. And the book can be summed up in a few pages--if you just removed the repetitions and rantings.After a few pages, you figure out yourself that clearly Perkins did not study economics (he does proclaim this loudly through the book), for he has no understanding of the basics of trade and development.The title is misleading--by the end of it, he says everyone who works for a multi-national corporation, government or large bank is unknowingly an \\"Economic Hit Man\\". The term may have developed when \\"Claudine\\" probably told him, \\"your job is blah blah blah, something like, maybe, umm, kinda a hit man...in a financial sense..yeah, maybe like an economic hit man.\\" Well, he spun it into a nice, 007-style image for what he does. Or maybe he just invented the term, who knows?While the stories he narrates have truth to them and make for insightful reading, the analysis and intellect behind this book is lightweght at best and lies at worst. Somehow, blaming everything that is wrong in this world on a group of greedy, power hungry and manipulative US businessmen and politicians is simplistic and inaccurate.\\"Terrifying\\" is probably the most used word. He constantly speaks in very (annoyingly) emotional terms about his past and how he has been duped by the \\"corporatocracy\\" (another of his words), and his \\"tormented\\" conscience; this and constant references to the Founding Fathers of the US and how their words always echo in his ears, are enough to drive a reader nuts with irritation.Save the time and money--buy a serious book instead. If only his analysis were based more on fact and academic rigour, the book could have been genuinely useful.Well, he sure looks very happy on the back jacket, with all the money he had made through his job, and then spinning it into some half-baked books and websites."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I gave the book four stars for it's coverage of American empire in the 20th century. Although there isn't anything new in this book, Perkins does a credible job revealing how thinly disguised American foreign policy is for it's true purpose of gaining new markets for American private industry. His coverage of Latin America and America's intervention is truly insightful. I also enjoyed his portrayal of big oil's role in Asia, and our role in building the Saudi kingdom.I took away two stars, however, for the author's endless moralizing throughout the book. We have a saying in the west that \\"an environmentalist is someone who already has his cabin in the woods\\". The joke highlights the hypocrisy common in our culture. Perkins embodies this hypocrisy, but not in an amusing way. He begins his career in the Peace Corps, and ends it giving tours in the Amazon. In between, he managed to cash in on 30 years of enormous payoffs doing the very activities he condemns! He endlessly repeated how he knew what he was doing was wrong, but the money bought his participation. He left repeatedly, only to go back for the money. He even started an alternative energy company, only to sell it out to big oil for, you got it, huge money!In the end, I found Perkins' life story a detraction to an otherwise worthwhile book. I don't know the man and won't pass judgment on him, but the character in this book is easy to despise. I know a few people like this character, people who have million-dollar homes, 50' yachts, and millions of frequent flier miles who claim to be concerned with exploitation of the poor and world carbon emissions. Their concerns are genuine, but their greed and sense of self-entitlement is a far stronger passion. Their hypocrisy makes them as endearing as something I'd scrape off the bottom of my shoe with a stick.Well done Perkins, you bilked me out of 15 bucks for which I received very little in return. But then by your own account, you are a professional."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The book is amazing. It is a must read for anyone interest in the post war.

If you're interested in more details David Korten has done the best job documenting how rich powerful corporations with the help of governments get richer at the expense of the poor who get poorer.Our humanity is undermined when we benefit from that which hurts others. Undoubtedly most perpetrators have convinced themselves that what they do is OK and even that they'll be able to avoid consequence.

I thoroughly enjoyed his honesty about his life as an economic hitman and could feel the conflicting feelings he had about the moral ethics of what he was doing, even though it was \\"legally legal\\". It took him a while to finally follow his heart, but he did it, and that's what is important. I believe that the everyday folks should read this because it gives you a different view of the world. You realize just how naive and unsophisticated your small personal world is. He is right - we are the ones who have to change this!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The author has a decent writing style and tells a good tale, but I think his perception of his role in world events is over-inflated.

I was expecting some juicy personal insight into some vast conspiracy I was unaware of, but instead it's a boring diatribe by a new age junkie who thinks he is a corporate Jesus Christ. Be ready for a rambling lecture of his conspiracy theories, much of which are conjecture and unproven. You would expect a \\"confession\\" to mean a personal view on the events he talks about as in HE WAS THERE, but no - this book feels like it was written by my yoga instructor.

There are some historical facts regarding US foreign policy since 1951 however anyone who has read or researched these facts should not waste their time with this book. If you are looking for a brief overview of US foreign policy in the last 50 years then perhaps you may find parts of this book enlightening.The frustration I have with this book is that there are no confessions from the standpoint of an economic hitman. This book feels more like the author created a character that he thought might exist in the matrix of US foreign policy and then said he was this character. Again, this is due to the fact that there is no information in this book that is specific to what he did as an economic hitman."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins' book, \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" is remarkably similar to my own story. Growing up in a small town, I had a very difficult adolescence including pimples, a squeaky voice and parents who never understood me. This extremely rare combination of traits made me a perfect candidate for what awaited me later on in life (spy stuff!!) Later, while in college, I befriended a foreign guy (who was evidently placed in my dorm by the government because he was from China!!). Later, I worked for a global consulting firm and spent a lot of time traveling and sleeping in hotels, flying in airplanes and eating in restaurants. I didn't know it at the time, but after reading Perkin's book I've come to realize that many of the people I met while traveling were actually CIA operatives who were sent to guide my development as a secret agent for the government. All those analyses I performed ... the evil I must have done. In truth, I thought I was just performing due diligence on acquisitions and that I was just a mid-level goober in a suit. But, after reading his book, I now know that I was really playing a pivotal role in a massive plot by the government to take over middle-market companies (fastest growing and the employers of many potential spies, you know). I was a spy!!However, I am now wracked by guilt and am considering writing my own book to make myself feel better and to further substantiate the fantasy that I was not just some mid-level number cruncher but was instead just like James Bond.===================================================Don't read this book. If you happen upon it in the airport don't be fooled by it's very well designed cover. It has the appearance of a quick read for a cross-country flight. Perhaps it is a little spy book to give you something more interesting to do than reviewing the budget or writing a subordinate's review. It won't work. You'll be out $15 (money that will then go to help this guy recruit more freaks who actually believe they can travel through time using Perkins' shaman skills). And, you will still end up staring at the budget."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book disappoints right from the get go in its lack of depth and unlikely placement of the author. Knowing a bit about contracting abroad, I can't help but think this book is a sort of protest from an outward, though somewhat well read, point of view. I think there is a message to be given, but making up a story about a confessing facilitator, well...that seems like a lazy way to sell a book. Instead it would have been much more impressive if the author had researched, found some former executives who explained their real-world pay-off and negotiation techniques and revealed their contacts in government. Sometimes truth is stranger than fiction, but in this case I find make-believe to be far more boring than reality. Yes, the USA funds its own contractors as it \\"helps\\" the third world. If we were communist, this help would still be forthcoming but payback would be an even greater manipulation of the target country, much worse than a simple debt. If you have seen USAID contracting lately, you know that everywhere we go, we leave a trail of millionaires, and these often are not the top political leaders. We can't force the third world to be fair, equitable, and just. But we can extend a financial fig leaf and hope that the constant flow of immigrants back and forth between the United States and their home countries, sparks a kind of revolution that will help other countries find an evolutionary 200 years similar to our own first 200. You just can't promise any more than that and this author's whining \\"expose\\" can't change that basic fact."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"For those who like this book as non-fiction, please subscribe to the Economist for a year so you can get up to speed on how things work in this world.I'm guessing from the reviews/ number of sales of this book that most people need to work for a multinational firm or the like to be able to adequately gauge fact from fiction on the subject matter of this book. I am baffled by the author's nievete and can't believe the publisher would publish this book as fiction or even non-fiction. Example after example, I found the discussed scenarios and quoted conversations as fake. I found myself cursing throughout the book, angered by how simplistic the author described interactions and relationships between NGO's and governments. In the end, I couldn't make it through the fourth chapter and will now burn the book.Background on this Critic: My experience working for a large US multinational commodity company was limited to two years, but I had the experience of working directly under the EVP of the company and led many of the companies multinational programs. We had interests in western and 3rd world countries. Doing business in poor countries is no different then in rich. Things may look poor when you drive around and want to use a public bathroom (if they have one) but the fact is that all countries, rich and poor, have an 'elite' and these people have the business savvy of those guys who just graduated from Harvard and get a position at Goldman Sachs. There are too many examples to list about this author's fake scenarios, so just use your common sense. I do believe corrupt dictators of some countries are willing to pad their personal checking account by accepting international loans at interest rates that will destroy their country, but this is not the norm.China is a good example of how poor countries decide to improve their GDP. They accept foreign direct investment for programs they cannot afford(car industry, dams, roads, etc.) by giving the firm exclusivity to the market or even just access to that market, period! Host countries usual demand majority ownership of these companies or multinational subsidiaries for control or put a limitation of how long that company can operate in the country. If a dirt poor country can't pay back a loan for the building a new power plant they have more options than just letting the big bad US earn 99% on each dollar of profit generated by that power plant while they pay 30% on the outstanding debt for that loan.To immediate options I can think of:(A) Countries frequently nationalize industries and kick out the very companies/ countries who built the industry in the first place. Result: they retain full ownership and now 100% profit of the industry and screw the government/ company out of the remaining investment the country/ government had in the industry.(B) Default on the loan.Economics is not like monopoly (like the author would like you to believe)- If everybody else loses all of their money, the guy with all of it wins. Making poor countries rich makes the rich countries richer. Markets become saturated and company profits stagnate. One way to grow is expand into new markets, e.g. developing countries.If things worked in this world like the author would have you believe, then modern day Japan or Germany should look like a US shopping mall, full of US products. Post WWII Japan and Germany were rebuilt by its former enemies and now these nation dominate in several global industries.Strong nations and companies do seek dominance and frequently EXPLOIT weak countries but it is nothing like what is described in this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book hardly talks about economics and instead reads like a bad spy novel. Without proper citation or even a shred of evidence its hard to take anything in this book seriously."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is garbage. Worse than that, I think this book is bad for progressive economics. First of all, I am pretty sure Perkins is at best exaggerating what went on and at worst, a total liar. I don't doubt that there are people out there that make their living by betting against developing countries, and I don't doubt that there are people who have an economic incentive for progressive developing country leaders to fail. But I really doubt that the way these people ply their trade is by having beautiful blonds show young business guys (in this case, Perkins) the dark path by intellectually seducing them in Boston apartments while going around calling themselves hitmen. Perkins raises a number of good points regarding how third world debt is used as a weapon, and how the interests of the people in the global south do not always line up with their corrupt leaders, but his claims of conspiracy (and his role it in) stretches the realm of the believable.And no, just because no one has called him a liar doesn't mean he's telling the truth. It means that his argument is so insanely overdrawn that serious people in positions of power do not take him seriously.Which leads me to my next point. This book is bad for those seeking a more just world economic system. It feeds into the stupid left conspiracies that keep progressive economists impotent. There is a world wide conspiracy! They meet in dark rooms and plot our destruction! Nothing is that simple, folks, and until we give up on fairy tales and start looking at the global economy as it exists, meaning as a complicated world where many powerful people are at cross purposes and few grand conspiracies ever come to fruition we are bound to lose.There are very smart people writing about these issues in a much more serious way. Save your money and spend it instead on the works of Naomi Kline, Amartya Sen or Paul Collier. You're get a much smarter, more realistic view of the economic situation, and on top of that, it'll even be true."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Having just finished this book, I am compelled to write a review--which is something I've rarely done.I am considering buying enough copies of this book to send one to everybodyon my Christmas list--about 100!

I couldn't understand how I'd missed this book when it first came out, but now that I know it didn't appear until after the election, I understand. I was one of the millions of Americans who agreed with the headline in the Brit tabloid, \\"how could 55 million people be so stupid?\\" The outcome of the 2004 election sent me into a deep depression for months, and compelled my husband and me to search for property in another country for our retirement.

These elements are balanced very well with a very readable narrative style.The history in this book is somewhat controversial. It is the less-shiny aspects of history which may or may not be taught in US schools (I will not make assumptions here), but which is easily accessible if one only looks for it. It is also quite well-documented and supported by evidence. Perkins discusses American corporate and governmental involvement with Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Nicaragua, Panama, Ecuador and many other nations from a first hand perspective.What is interesting is that we see this history as the setting for a very personal story, through the eyes of a participant. As the title suggests, it is in fact a confession. Perkins was an important player in some of the darker aspects of subtle non-governmental foreign policy, and he is not an apologist.He shows a little bit of the psychology of people who commit evil acts on behalf of organizations to which they belong. For example, structures set up to do harm can generally find people with the personality characteristics that can be capitalized upon - greed, ambition, etc. What this means is, rather than simply provoking hate towards individuals who are perpetuating exploitation, Perkins reveals the underlying broader issues, such as the consequences of the misuse of power and profit. I think he very effectively places the specifics of historical facts (as well as his story) in context in a way that historical texts typically do not.Although it is not a prescriptive book as such, Perkins does offer some ideas and suggestions at the end as to what individuals can do if they believe in trying to ameliorate the situation he has presented.I found it to be both a compelling page turner and very factual at the same time. Highly recommended for the history buff, social activist, avid biography reader, news junkie, or really anyone who cares about the world we live in."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"On my desk is a pile of political books that I am slowly working my way through. I moved this one to the top of the pile after watching an interview with the author on democracy now by Amy Goodman. I was not disappointed! Since the seventies I have wondered why my country seems to support dictators in other countries. Even after reading most of the leading political books of the last ten years it still did not penetrate my consciousness that this could not only be planned but systemic and institutionalised. Call me an idealist but I just assumed that everyone operates from integrity at the highest levels of government. Not that there aren't some bad apples - LBJ, Nixon, Reagan, W; but that in general the founders made sure that some safe guards exist that would prevent a tyrant from easily taking over our government. But even they knew that ultimately the success of our grand experiment depended on the integrity of it's citizens.The gist of Mr Perkins book deals with how we as a people have failed to hold not only our leaders to high standards but ourselves as well. Back in 1975 this was illustrated in a conversationin, the movie Three days of the Condor, that Robert Redfords' character had with his boss about oil and the american publics' apathy . I didn't buy it then but I do now. It started in Iran in the first half of the 21st century and it continues to this day and we are complicit without any excuse available in our defense. We have murdered heads of government as well as men women and children in the tens of thousands who were guilty of nothing more than our founders were when they through off the yolk of oppression of the British empire. we have finally come to that place where no one in our White house operates out of a sense of integrity. in fact integrity might be viewed as the administrations Kryptonite. They pile lies on top of it any time it raises it's ugly head. Mad men and women walk the corriders of power in Washington and we put them there. Bush lies but we lie to ourselves. Our founders, who stood up to the British empire, were heroes but the poor people of the \\"third world\\" countries, who stand up to our empire, are terrorists because they don't want their children turned into slaves and prostitutes.They don't want their countries turned into garbage pits. Maybe they hate us, not because we're free, but because we've made sure that they will never be. Next time you stand in the checkout line at Home Depot or Wall Mart realize that you are paying a cheap price for your item because the line of slavery starts with the minimum wage earner checking you out, without union representation, all the way to Indonesia or bangkok or East Timor where some ten year old is being paid 10 cent a day with no union representation so you can buy a coffee maker for $15. Is that what those colonists envisioned when they stood before the mightiest army in the world, in 1776 and died? If you were born in Iraq you would be killing the oppressors too. . .if you had the courage.Read the book and pray that it's not too late. thousands of shipping containers come into this country every day and no one inspects them.THINK."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"In this last year, I've read many political books, including Al Franken's \\"Liars..\\" to Amy Goodman's \\"Exception to the Rulers.\\" Each was well written, topical, and informative. However, this book had more of an impact on me than all the others combined.Perkins was an agent for American businesses in their quest to globalize. This was not simply a salesperson calling on foreign leaders, it involved the creation of a network of US government agencies such as the CIA, NSA, and the military, large engineering firms like Bechtel, US media, World Bank, IMF, and USAID, to intentionally manipulate foreign economies and governments to create ideal business climates for American businesses. This involved, providing arms to \\"rebels\\", staging coups, stirring up dissent, and waging disinformation campaigns, not to mention the more mundane methods such as bribery, pimping, and assassinations.He carefully explains 9/11 as a \\"blowback\\" event; he exposes the coups in Panama and the attempted coup in Venezuela. He actively participated in the intentional destruction of the economies of third world nations by having the World Bank loan them more than they could possibly pay back, and then extracting austerity measures that deeply impoverished their already-poor citizens. In Ecuador alone, the \\"industrialization\\" brought by loans that resulted in their poverty level increasing from 50% to 70%, their foreign debt increased from $240 million to $16 billion, and now devotes nearly 50% of its national budget to paying off its debt - instead of helping its poor. Huge tracts of Ecuador's rain forest were ceded to oil companies; indigenous people were forcibly relocated or had no choice when their water sources were poisoned.This book was hard to read, as it made me angry but left me feeling powerless. The last chapter is devoted to helping the reader focus on what can be done. The book is terrifying, shocking, and too often conveys a feeling of hopelessness. But it's truthful, and that's more than we're getting from the mainstream media."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I persisted through this book to the end. It was not easy. I kept telling myself that some bias in me was turning me off from the author and the story. Then, I remembered I'm a centrist with no party on my voter registration card. I told myself that I also believe that America's dealings in the world are all too often less than admirable. I basically believe that our military-industrial complex needs a thrashing and comeuppance of sorts. However, none of this stems from a hatred of self or my country or perverted prejudices against American wealth and success. I just believe in fair dealing.John Perkins is not my kind of spokesman. His book feels much more like a B period piece movie where the budget doesn't allow for the sets, costumes or script to believably align with the time in which it is supposed to occur. Characters from thirty and more years ago seem to be debating mid-90s and later issues as if they were possessed of time machines. I might be able to swallow some of it if the work were advertised as fiction, but there is too much to do about its authenticity.It troubles me that works such as these do so much to damage a fruitful dialogue about America's role in the world. John Perkins is visited by Jesus Christ and seems to want to be the second coming incarnate. He's working on his cult following, but I'm not a whacko and I'm not moving to Waco.The events detailed in this book seem more like bad and false parables prepared by a disingenuous revivalist preacher with alternative and specious motives (financial) and agendas (power and politics of his own variety). That, or the product of a poorly funded, and more poorly staffed, propaganda machine for some antiquated Marxist state.This book is poorly written. The author/narrator forms a character you quickly come to disbelieve and eventually come to pity, fear and dislike. Take a look at his other work for a hint at what he really seeks - to be a Shaman and have a following of lapdogs with little by way of their own strongly rooted self-esteem or self-respect. He may recruit the ill-informed and more malleable types. I'm very glad to see he's not been overly effective with those who have taken the time here to call a duck a duck, and a sham man a sham man."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"To be honest, I am only halfway through this book, but I wonder if I will ever finish it. I had high expectations of it, but I am already quite disappointed.

Duh...So I was expecting a little more depth than this particular realization from someone who worked for a shadowy consulting firm (that I have never heard of, not that it doesn't exist) and... (pinkie in mouth a-la doctor evil)... the NSA. But no, it is all pretty predicatble (though not necessarily untrue) \\"America is evil\\" stuff you could recycle from any number of sources. Indeed, for someone who supposedly had access to the core of the US polico-economic power structure, his sources seem to consist almost entirely of popular and fairly recent mass-market books, articles from national newsmagazines, and data available on the Internet. For someone who in the 1970s was supposedly doing econometric forecasting of electricity requirements in Indonesia, I am surprised not to see data from more arcane sources.The fact that he wastes about 3 pages regurgitating US News and World Reports about US government connections to the Bin Laden family (it all connects to his time in Panama emphathizing with the locals in the 70s; really).Whatever.

This was NOT a politically biased book -- It was based on personal experience and firsthand knowledge and a balanced and thoughtful perspective.I admire the moral and intellectual courage shown by John Perkins and his publisher in bringing us this wonderful book!Thank you."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"While reading this book, one cannot get rid of a 'crocodile tears' impression.The author deplores what he is doing, but continues to be led by his wallet, and as another reviewer remarks, 'didn't change jobs'. The reason why he didn't, seems also unbelievable: ' I missed the true significance of my action'. (p. 179)Moreover, his role in the corporatocracy seems highly inflated, for he gives not many details about the concocted deals.At the end of the book, the author serves a list of practical hints, but that sounds very much like the adage 'Do what I say, don't do what I do'.So, why should one read this book? Because it explains the core of a pernicious system, which D. Perkins calls 'the self-destructive march to global empire' by the US. He depicts his country as a hegemon ruled by an extremely wealthy and greedy oligarchy, whose behavior has nationally and internationally harmful consequences.Nationally, 12 million families worry about their next meal. History's most powerful and wealthiest empire has outrageously high rates of suicide, drug abuse, divorce, child molestation, rape and murder.Internationally, financial organizations (World Bank ...) are used through Economic Hit Men to make other nations subservient by loans for all kind of works to be executed by US engineering and construction firms. The larger the loan, the better, for those countries become easy targets when the US needs favors (military bases, UN votes, access to oil and other resources).If the ruler of those countries doesn't cooperate, jackals (intelligence services) are sent in and if even those fail, a military intervention becomes unavoidable.The author gives some examples: the most probable assassinatons of the presidents of Ecuador and Panama, and the military interventions in Panama and Iraq.For the author, the corporatocracy constitutes the most blatant grab in history for the hearts, the souls, the minds and the resources of the people all over the world. One example: for less than half the amount spent for he Iraq war, one could provide clean water, adequate diets, sanitation services and basic education to every person on this planet.But ultimately, why is this onslaught still progressing?Like David Chandler in his terrifying book on Pol Pot's S21 death camp, David Perkins observes: 'We made it happen.' The corporatocracy is in ourselves.The great evolutionist G.C. Williams said: 'natural selection, albeit stupid, is a story of arms races, slaughter and suffering. We should at least think about it.'David Perkins thought about it after his uncomprehended actions.A very revealing book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"My fellow Peace Corp veterans, men and women who have had multiple in-country service tours each around the world, formed a casual book discussion club last year. Last month's reading selection was Perkins' Confessions. I was nominated to write our collective review.We all agree that raising awareness about these general topics is great. For that, we applaud the discussion if not the author. The persisent and unbroken cycles of poverty in LDCs must be redressed. Too many public works projects go awry or were poorly planned or unnecessary from the start. Local ministries and officials misuse, steal and \\"misplace\\" funds from international agencies way too often. In short, the right kind of assistance is too rarely the kind of assistance provided. This means our help (in gross) is inefficiently delivered (in net) and the problems we all know too well remain after we finish our tours, or get worse, or shift to other areas of equal or greater concern. Fundamentally, we are trying to stick our pinkey fingers in the dam and too often end up only with a jammed, broken finger. We continue undettered because we share a planet with those less fortunate than ourselves and feel an obligation to give of ourselves.Please excuse my diversion, but these thoughts establish the whole basis of our perspective here. John Perkins strikes all of us as a very disagreeable and unlikable character with none of the genuine motivations then or now that would be cause for an invitation to join us. He sheds light on a problem with suggestions of dark conspiracies and voracious greed, but he himself was the problem as much or more than the institutions he indicts. He seems to accurately observe some of the problems and stressors, but seems equally and more to overexaggerate the sources and causes with no offers of practical solutions.He is, essentially, romanticizing his unromantic experiences and shouting from the literary rafters about his uneventful roles in them. His Faustian struggles are very petty and private. They are not at the heart of the matters he relates, nor do they persuade us as his assigned confessors to forgive. He points fingers at ghosts and blames shadows all seeming to satisfy his own ego -- look at me; I was sooo important; I did dastardly things; American coporations are evil; our enemies are morally righteous; we are precipitating our doom and deserve every bit of it; I have come to spread the message; now, stroke my ego and buy my book and let's make the world a better place. Only this, his actions in sum have made the world a worse, not better, place. And, his confessions are egomaniacal and oftentimes quite difficult to believe. He puts himself at the center of a universe of misdeeds, but all of the deeds revealed are his and only his. We were left believing that Perkins is a bad guy now calling the establishment bad to suit the repair of his conscience. Whether or not the established institutions act badly, his is the character in question and his subtle and unseen accomplices seem more his imaginary friends and enablers than his ring leaders.We collectively apologize for our jabs, but this is all we could say in response to such a person's confession delivered in the tone offered and with the contortions of lessons related. His offer of contrition does not move us for his confession comes only with projecting his guilt less on himself than on the faceless many the reader has difficulty believing are really even there. And, we cannot assess the author without looking at his body of work. When we do, we see the suggestions of either a delusional person (shaman and psychic writings) or a person inclined to delude others. It brings us to a place where we can only describe him as shameless, and for it, more guilty than before for his wrongdoing.We offer no defense of the World Bank or IMF decisions when badly made. We offer absolutely no defense of Third World dominance, subjugation and pawn-handling. We are the people who give of ourselves to change these places for the better. John Perkins has stimulated a dialogue for clearly ulterior and dubious and shameful reasons, but along the way no reader should lionize him or his effort, for it is so obviously and awfully wrapped tightly with his own overblown ego, misdeeds done and not rightly attoned, and stirring of hatred for your country, its democratic institutions, its leaders and its entire economic framework. We ourselves have lively debates about these topics, but Perkins offers no rational debate. He would have you swallow his remedy that is ultimately no remedy at all--hate ourselves. Such a person is hateful and deserves only your contempt. If you want to make the world a better place, join the Peace Corp and go abroad and bring our goodness and values along with you. We are able to do this as a country, and often individually, because our country has given us so much. Tear it down and diminish its soul and attack it with hate and we may find ourselves one day hoping for a visit from the charitable institutions of other nations who sustain a character of national pride and positive living. Perkins is a bad example of a man, of a story and of a cause. He should see a real priest in a real cofessional and share the real story. It may not be too late for him."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you're looking for 1/s pound of side splitting laughs--at the author--with a table spoon of revulsion and half a cup of disgust, give this entree a try.

There is nothing altruistic about that move. It's kind of like a loan shark agreeing not to kill you after he has broken both your legs and your jaw, for not paying the usurious interest you agreed to pay under duress. Usury is illegal. Being desperate as so many of these countries were and continue to be, is not. The extreme poverty of the majority of the citizens of this earth compared to the wealth of a fraction in the U.S. did not occur by happenstance. Isn't it interesting that Wolfowitz is now the head of the World Bank? Not really.Finally! Perkins is an example of a man with a conscience. Reminds me of that slave owner who penned \\"Amazing Grace\\". Perkins tells the REAL story of why countries, inhabited by human beings, just like us, live in such gross poverty. It has nothing to do with manifest destiny. It is because the most greedy and power hungry in our society know how to identify and exploit the corruption and weakness of the most greedy and unscrupulous leaders of those countries; leaders who care nothing about their people, only their personal wealth. Avarice!As Perkins discusses, oil has caused grave misery around the world. In the U.S., oil consumption increases yearly and the average American is too blind to consider the source of the oil,or the majority of the people in the world who starve and die daily because of our addiction to the oil, or the destruction of rainforests and indigenous peoples. Our ability to turn a blind eye to everyone's \\"reality\\" but our own is uncanny.Perkin's explanation of the current situation with Bush and Iraq is perfectly logical. Does it not seem more reasonable that one would become a suicide bomber to protest unfair sanctions and imperialism as opposed to religious fanaticism? Let's wake up and face reality. Reading Perkin's book is the perfect eye opener!Having said all that, I still enjoy my 3000 square foot house,my gas guzzling SUV, my weekly trips to Starbucks, and my cheap Chinese imports from WalMart. I cope with my obesity induced diabetes and gorge myself while I know most of the world is starving because of my indifference.

It holds the reader's attention, provokes thought about the issues addressed, and would actually make a good movie. To call it non-fiction, however, is a stretch. The historical narratives are simplistic spin and at times are downright inaccurate. To argue that the U.S. has sought to enslave developing nations through heavy debt burdens all for the sake of world domination is nothing more than to feed into the fears of the most paranoid among us. I agree that our country has done, and is doing, some rotten things to other countries, but to weave this into a grand conspiracy of a handful of people bent on global conquest is too much to take. The author admittedly thrives on coincidence, which to me is the key to understanding that what he relates is too much of a stretch. It is too coincidental to be believed.To have purportedly profited heavily as an EHM, as the author claims he did, and then compare himself to Thomas Paine and Paul Revere for sounding the alarm about the U.S. desire to enslave the world is disingenuous at best, offensive at worst. To the extent there is any accuracy to what this author did, falsifying economic forecasts to justify loans to developing countries, I see no true remorse. He has his millions and apparently isn't giving the money away. Instead, in the latter part of the book he hectors the rest of us to hold seminars about his book and organize a revolution."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The book was good.

Economists, yes, do play a significant role by forecasting and or analyzing the impact of a project, but to assume that one as the \\"ultimate power broker\\" seems more fictional and Ludlum-esqe as opposed to a memoir.This book is more of an apology for inflating statistics or percieved misdeeds for fostering third world development."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It simply scares me to think that some who read this book will believe that what it says is true. While this theory of economic imperialism isn't technically impossible, it's the kind of idea better left to an ideological blog somewhere instead of a book purporting to be a true account. Books like this make the left look as naive and stupid as Ann Coulter books make the right look bigoted and, well, stupid. This is an incredibly implausible account, and books like this, claiming to be nonfiction, undermine good writing and reporting everywhere. Shame on the author and the publisher.

The historical record is really valuable, though disgusting, and I actually recommend reading it for that purpose. But the gorge rises in your throat about the human being. I'd encountered John Perkins in his persona as \\"shuar shaman,\\" actually once attended an all-day seminar of his in the nineties, and wondered where he got the money to live that life style. Well, now we know!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"In this book, a collection of memoirs of the authors experiences while working in the foreign aid racket, he asserts that there is \\"no conspiracy\\" being committed by the corporate entities who \\"enslave\\" third-world countries. Rather he calls it a \\"misguided philosophy,\\" or something to that effect.This raises a big question. If there is no conspiracy, then why did Perkins use the term \\"Economic hit man\\" in referring to himself? Is the mafia also \\"misguided philosophy?\\" It suggests that the author is neither entirely repentant of his former ways (if we are to believe he is not still actively pursuing them) nor telling the whole truth about what is going on.That Perkins is not telling the entire truth is evident in his book. He informs the reader that his job was to supply over-optimistic economic forecasts of third-world economies if such-and-such project were allowed to proceed using funds from sources such as the World Bank. Now why was this? He never explains. Well, the answer is, so to fool the \\"investors\\" into putting the money into said projects. Who are these \\"investors,\\" the wonks in the IMF? No, it is the US Congress, who \\"invests\\" our tax money (and our \\"social security trust fund\\") to fund the IMF, World Bank, Import-Export Bank, etc. Where did you think the money came from? The coffers of the CEO's and chairmen of the corporations whom Perkins accuses of \\"looting\\" third world countries? They are not stupid. Unfortunately many American taxpayers are. But you can't really blame them considering the abysmal quality of media reporting. I can only imagine how much popularity Bono would enjoy, if only enough people knew whose money it was that Bono was suggesting be \\"forgiven\\" to third-world tin-horn dicatators propped up by our State Department.I do admit however that Perkins is right when he suggests that the main reason for US foreign aid is to keep third-world countries dependent on the US. Unfortunately, he does not suggest that the solution is to terminate all foreign aid. I suppose what he really wants is a more socialist regime in the Oval office than the one we have now, and things will be hunky-dory. If only things were that simple.One last criticism of this book: the writing style is about on par with an average high-school senior. Perhaps above average considering the brainwashing which passes for public education in schools today."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Reading this book brought the following to mind with regard to the author:Diagnostic criteria for 301.81 Narcissistic Personality Disorder(cautionary statement)A pervasive pattern of grandiosity (in fantasy or behavior), need for admiration, and lack of empathy, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by five (or more) of the following:(1) has a grandiose sense of self-importance (e.g., exaggerates achievements and talents, expects to be recognized as superior without commensurate achievements)(2) is preoccupied with fantasies of unlimited success, power, brilliance, beauty, or ideal love(3) believes that he or she is \\"special\\" and unique and can only be understood by, or should associate with, other special or high-status people (or institutions)(4) requires excessive admiration(5) has a sense of entitlement, i.e., unreasonable expectations of especially favorable treatment or automatic compliance with his or her expectations(6) is interpersonally exploitative, i.e., takes advantage of others to achieve his or her own ends(7) lacks empathy: is unwilling to recognize or identify with the feelings and needs of others(8) is often envious of others or believes that others are envious of him or her(9) shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Many of the reviews here refute the truthfulness of this book because Perkins does not provide evidence for every one of his claims. But, this is precisely what makes the book an exciting and fast read. How can Perkins be expected to provide evidence for influencing events in other countries? Where should we expect to find documentation of these nefarious deeds? The inner workings of organizations like MAIN, Halliburtion, and Brown & Root are only ever known when a dissenter arises.From my perspective, it all seems to add up. I lived in Ecuador in the 80s. I was young (18), and I didn't know much about politics at the time. I personally saw many of the projects that Perkins speaks of in this book. I heard the complaints from my Ecuadorian friends about how the U.S. was bankrupting their economy by \\"loaning\\" money for extensive construction projects. I saw the jungle along Rio Napo being deforested by unknown (to me) companies. I spent time in oil towns in the jungle -- like Shell. I saw the dam that Perkins speaks of in his book.The only way to gather proof about the truthfulness of his claims is to see it first hand. Though I seriously doubt that most of us have the guts to travel to the places where these things happen. Denial, regarding these issues, seems terribly naive."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It is often the personal stories that tell the bigger truths. As with Barbara Ehrenreich's intensely personal Nickel and Dimed, Perkins' story illuminates a larger picture in a way that more scholarly treatises cannot match. I value the perspective I get from Noam Chomsky and Chalmers Johnson and many others who have written about our modern empire. None of these works, though, explains it from the ground up. Perkins does that.In this book, written in spurts since the early 1980s, Perkins really does tell it like it is. This is the book I have been waiting for, the book that fills in the blanks left behind by the writers of global theories, the book that tells us how it really happens. It is one thing to read that the United States engineered ousters of democratically-elected leaders who did not do the bidding of our corporations. It is another to read of the actual steps that led to these actions. As one who likes to be able to visualize all the steps, I found great comfort in reading a well-written personal story that allows me to do this.In this rightly-named confession, Perkins puts on his hair shirt and chastises himself as he explains how he gave in to temptation again and again over several decades, while he worked to build an American corporation's profits at the expense of third-world countries. He does not describe in detail the benefits he accrued from being Satan's handyman. We do not hear stories of his exploits with women, of his flaunting his power, the meat of a LifeTime movie. These fruits of his labor are glossed over in favor of greater descriptions of the occasional pangs of conscience.Take it as a given, then, that Perkins was right for the job of economic hit man because he was so easily tempted by material wealth, power, and adulation. There was, in his character, though, a little hint of conscience. He was interested in the world's people, happy to learn other languages and ways of living, open to old as well as new ideas. Thus he was able to make a more honest comparison of the world according to global corporations and the world as seen and lived by indigenous people. And he was able to see that his work only benefitted the few. There was in him, as well, the radical view that a benefit to the few was not much of a benefit.I can see this story translated successfully to the big screen; either as a documentary or as the story of one man. Two very different films; either would be dramatic and informative. There are scenes in this book that could have come from a Graham Greene novel (and let's not forget that Greene tells the truth through fiction): clandestine meetings, sudden flights to escape uprisings, epiphanies on the beach. By its nature, a memoir of this type cannot fully be documented. To the extent that it could be, it is, with many pages of notes and references. These private memories, though, may never be proven to be either true or false.It is my greatest wish that Perkins is telling the whole truth all the way through. Even the smallest of fibs could tarnish a work of great importance, given our media's inability to see bigger pictures.The real message, though, is clearly written and inescapable: this is not the story of \\"they\\", a \\"they\\" that can simply be removed from power. It is the story of us."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins gives a first-hand account of a world in which US corporations wildly overpredict the growth that will follow big infrastructure projects in the developing world, convincing aid organizations to give big loans for these projects, resulting in big projects (and big money) for American firms and crippling debt for poor nations.Part of the book tells of his own experiences, generating false predictions and both giving and receiving bribes. The other part is a history of the role that US corporations (and, more subtly, the US government) play in eliminating hostile but strategically important leaders of developing countries and co-opting their nations' resources. (Those same leaders, hostile to US business, are often the champions of the poor in their countries.)The history this book provides opened my eyes and made me want to read more on the subject. Thankfully, Perkins also provides extensive references for those who would like to read more on this, both providing an avenue for the curious reader and showing that he isn't the only witness to the new imperialism. The last few pages of the book also provide some practical suggestions for a reader to \\"do something\\" (and refuse to absolve us of collective guilt).On the other hand, while the book claims to be a confession, massive page space is dedicated to Perkins's misgivings about what he was doing as he was doing it, to the point that it really feels like he's trying to let us know that he's not that bad a guy. That tone and the amount of time dedicated to it really wore me down as a reader. (Okay, okay, you were really torn, I get it.)But overall, this was well worth the time, and I only hope I can carry some of its lessons with me."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins was interviewed by Leonard Lopate on WNYC Radio in New York.

It exposes the truth behind how corporate greed has hijacked U.S. Foreign Policy. You can find many more books on the facts and history but for a sound, engaging critique read it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I got Confessions of an Economic Hit Man yesterday and finished reading it today. It's a vital personal story that illuminates an entire global system. A system based on greed, power, and control. Others before Perkins have warned of this system, but usually not from an insider's perspective. If you're interested in more details David Korten has done the best job documenting how rich powerful corporations with the help of governments get richer at the expense of the poor who get poorer. This isn't a new idea. But in today's world, the major media refuse to report this story. Perkins understands the essence of the problem: empire, oppression, inequality, and greed can seem to bring benefits to some people in the short term ... but in the long term we all loose, even the rich. We are all spiritually harmed by the lies and rationalizations. We are all put at risk when the world becomes more polarized into haves and have-nots. Our humanity is undermined when we benefit from that which hurts others. Undoubtedly most perpetrators have convinced themselves that what they do is OK and even that they'll be able to avoid consequences. Their money and power will insulate them in their exclusive gated communities. John Perkins' real feat in this book is not exposing a corrupt system, but in providing an example of one person who was able to look into his life with a deep honesty and realize it was hurting him as well as prospects for the future of all people. All of us can learn from his awakening. Does driving a big SUV make us more secure? Happier? A better person? A better citizen?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I was intrigued by this book inasmuch as I worked in the international export field for several major American corporations. I had the benefit of traveling to most of the countries that were discussed in Perkin's book. Also, I was stationed in the Panama Canal Zone with the US Army in the early 1960's. In addition, I was born in Central America, and my father worked for the infamous United Fruit Company. To say the least, I agree with Mr. Perkins in most of his expose. Export products that I shipped overseas were often financed by USAID, WorldBank, or some other international lending agency. And of course, the USA was the prime funder of these organizations. Eventually, I was sent into some of these third world countries, and I was exposed to the working class as well as to the upper crust of these societies. If you had to get to the nitty-gritty of this tale, you would have to think about Darwin's theory of \\"Survival of the Fittest.\\" Ultimately, the USA will throw its weight around as long as it has the military muscle to do so. Unfortunately, history tells us that all world empires collapse, and the USA will follow that trend lend. There are no exceptions to this as history has recorded thus far. Surely, there must be a better way for capitalism to thrive, and the USA even with good intentions is like an elephant in a china shop. In all my years of growing up in America, I found that most Americans know so very little about their external world outside of their own country. While most Americans think of themselves as the \\"good guys in the white hat,\\" Perkins book will dispel that notion. And, rightfully so!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"To begin, I should say that, basically, the title is actually fairly accurate - the book is the personal confession of one John Perkins, one time \\"EHM\\" and successful businessman, and now author of a plethora of new age spiritual guides, of the shadowy role he and other EHMs played in the economic/political construction of what is now the defacto American Empire. The tale is starkly allegorical, charting his torturous moral and spiritual decline from angry young man of New England Puritan stock with the requisite Jeffersonian ideals to slavish technocrat, all the while detailing the mechanism by which America's post W.W. II elites manipulated international economic/political development. From Indonesia in the early-mid sixties, through Latin America, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Iran in the sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties, EHMs and their CIA muscle (referred to none-too euphemistically as the \\"Jackals\\" by the EHMs) traveled the world working ostensibly for engineering firms such as Halliburton and Bechtel etc. doing legitimate analyses of the developing world's infrastructure needs. The resulting economic forecasts however were consciously inflated, and ensured huge IMF and World Bank loans. These institutions structured the loans of course only to enrich American sub-contractors, and their partners the third world elites. In other words, the rich got richer and the poor got - well, you know the rest. But the real objective was to bankrupt the developing countries so that America - as the biggest creditor - could essentially run them as it saw fit. The only problem I had with the book is that the collusion between the NSA, the CIA, the IMF and World Bank, and other equally monolithic institutions, is hinted at but never quite substantiated beyond a reasonable doubt. But I suspect that will come, once other EHMs (or perhaps other conspiratorial acronyms we have yet to hear of) with the courage of Mr. Perkins, prompted no doubt by the same guilt and remorse, not to mention the very real after-effects of 9/11, crawl out from under their respective floorboards and into the light to confess their sins. However, I believe we as individuals should not scapegoat them, for a key subtext of the book suggests that the system functioned (and of course continues to function) because it was merely the logical extension/manifestation of our Western materialist values, values which Mr. Perkins comes to realize are in many ways at odds with (my example) President Bush's recent campaign platitudes of \\"freedom\\", \\"justice\\", and \\"democracy\\". The destruction of the American Republic therefore can be seen as a personal tragedy as well as a societal one, as it was not the result of a conspiracy or \\"plan\\", which had to be written down and disseminated through the ranks, something which could not be kept a secret for long in a democracy, but instead the inevitable result of our own individual failings and addictions. Mr. Perkins finishes his book reflecting on the world he will leave his daughter, a world in which many have legitimate reasons to hate America's guts. For me, this is the most important contribution Mr. Perkins makes to what I pray becomes a more public debate, that we as individuals - and not simply our corporate masters - are to blame for 9/11. Many reading this review will disagree with Mr. Perkins, if I may speak for him on this particular point. Nevertheless, one thing we cannot deny: leaving aside Bin Laden's Wahhabi insanities for the moment, the world is at a crossroads right now. Given the demographics, we can either help those more moderate voices in Islam (and elsewhere) by promoting economic justice for all; or we risk a global conflict with an enemy that will only continue to gain adherents while we grow fat (or should I say fatter?) and senile playing golf in Arizona. There will be no victory in that sort of conflict. There will be only victims, our sons and daughters. So buy this book. Read it. And take a moment to reflect upon what it means to be an American. I hope that you too will see that although God (or whatever you believe in) may indeed have blessed America, it is far from sure whether he/she/it will continue to do so."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Years ago I worked in a gov't agency in my third world country.

In this trade I met a lot of foreign consultants. Some of them very honest at their jobs and in their opinions, others (mostly working for private institutions) that we used to call the MAFIA were not as well intended.

I could not have been more wrong and more disappointed.I am embarrassed for John Perkins. I caught myself reading over passages again as I looked for some basis for his \\"EHM\\" title, or something to which he needed to confess that was worth the reading. I found myself gagging as he bemoaned his horrible childhood years with loving parents. I was crying out laughing when \\"Jesus\\" appears before him. Seriosly, I'm not making this up about his real life experiences. Our saviour comes to him, but not as our favorite white Anglo-Saxon type. Long before television and film made the shift to challenging this white man notion of God images, John Perkins is traveling in the third world and somehow imagines the media-molded perfect protest visit from a dark-skinned Jesus of the LDC variety. I am ashamed that my hard fought beliefs and values are sullied by this man's psychotic literary episodes. Who cares if Jesus is white, black or somewhere in between. But, there is no way I believe the author's account. Not because I was there, or because I know things like this do or do not happen, but because as a learned person and voracious reader, I know by reading that this story is completely untrue.If you get choked up over or tend to lament the agony and torment of cloistered, peaceful days in good schools, then this book is for you. About halfway through, or earlier, you realize that Perkins keeps on and on about these impressive, troubled years. You get the odd sense that it may be something chemical going on rather than his environment. I found his sexy secret agent friend to be just another curious manifestation of his Jesus creation.John Perkins is no hit man. His confessions are narcissistic and parochial all the while they pretend to be selflessly derived and cosmopolitan. His book is a sham. He is a sham. I am surprised that Amazon puts five star reviews at the top when I read down to so many repudiations of this book. It's very strange to find a work whose main thrust aligns so directly with my own positions while I find the narrator and protagonist to be so objectionable, and the throughline to be so fanciful and lacking in credibility. I would suggest calling this fiction instead of non-fiction. Unfortunately, as a literary work, its shortcomings are even greater."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book did well to expose the actions of the US government, international banks and the oil companies, especially in regard to Panama/Torrios/Noriega and Ecuador/Roldos, and Perkins is at his best when describing his personal experience in these countries. It is very disturbing that the U.S. Government assassinated leaders and invaded for revenge or to satisfy corporate interests, and clearly this must be brought to light.However, Perkins does not seem to be able to distinguish between valid international economic activity and that which he classifies as being Economic Hit Man (\\"EHM\\")-related. For example, if someone owned a firm that produced aluminum and needed bauxite ore that was available, say in Myanmar, how would they go about making deals to acquire the resources that their company needed? Wouldn't they need to work with government people and the local mining companies, and figure out how to best make a deal? Doesn't the fact that the bauxite miners then have one more customer for their product benefit them? The same thing is true of the oil companies that Perkins continually criticizes - they have certainly done bad things: payoffs, corruption, pollution, etc. but they have also done many good things as well. Their goal is not to screw people over (although they have certainly been guilty of that at times, and need to be brought to account), but to sell a product and make money for their company, and there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that. They are not the Satan that he makes them out to be. (BTW, I have no association with any oil company.)Another example of this from the book is Perkins' analysis of the deals done in Saudi Arabia. What is wrong with American companies trying to sell goods and services to the Saudis to \\"repatriate petrodollars\\"? He perhaps has a point about selling the deal by putting a gun to the Saudi's head, but he said very little about that critical aspect. However, his pejorative statements like, \\"we could then sell them things that required continual upgrading and maintenance\\" - how is that any different than buying a car, or installing a computer system from a specific vendor in your office? You will have to rely on that company to some degree for maintenance, and that is implicit in the purchase. Computer systems become antiquated, roads deteriorate, cars fall apart, and that is a fact of life rather than a conspiracy on the part of the manufacturer. Furthermore, it would make good business sense for the Saudi's to pick a few key vendors for building their infrastructure, because then if something goes wrong they would have fewer vendors to deal with and less finger-pointing.Thus Perkins' approach has no nuance, and no recognition of these realities; it was pure meat-axe, conspiratorial, and monochromatic. Latin America and the rest of the world in his book are simply helpless victims that are being raped by evil Americans, in one more feminist victimology play. For a man who was a chief economist for a major consulting firm, he certainly seem to be very ignorant of economic realities, and he comes across as the typical knee-jerk, clueless liberal who blames capitalism and corporations for everything.Or perhaps his purpose was something deeper? His analysis read like a marxist critique of capitalism - is that his real goal? If so, why didn't he just come out and say it?I also noticed how politically partisan he was. He had a few lame attempts at trying to try to show that he was bipartisan, but then spent many pages bashing Bush, and other republicans with little criticism of democrats. If he wanted to come across as even-handed, he could have, for example, discussed Clinton's extensive connections with international socialists, his Rhodes scholarship, and his support of corporatocracy. And interestingly, there was absolutely no word in his book of Heinz, another large multinational firm. Was that because John Kerry, like him, is another liberal from Massachusetts, and therefore was a little too close to home for him to discuss or even mention?However, my biggest criticism of Perkins' was his treatment of SIL (The Summer Institute of Linguistics), the parent organization of Wycliffle Bible Translators (WBT). Virtually everything that he said about that organization in connection with oil company activity in Ecuador were lies and false innuendo. The missionaries who went there and were murdered in 1956, predated much of the oil company interest in the area, and they were not even all with SIL or WBT. Their interest then, as now, has nothing to do with advancing any corporate agenda, and everything to do with trying to help the native people. The Huaorani (or Waodani) tribe were vicious killers who preyed on each other and carried out many vendettas - the missionaries helped them to change their lifestyle in positive directions, and conflict was dramatically reduced. When the oil companies came in force, the missionaries tried to work things out with the Indians for everyone's mutual benefit, and perhaps bent over too far in trying to seek accommodation. But to say that they did this because they were on the take from Rockefeller or any other oil company is a disgusting lie. They were in a very tough situation, caught between the forces of the Ecuadorian government, a variety of oil companies and other internal and external interests, and the varying attitudes of the various Indian tribal groups. If the missionaries hadn't been there, the Indians would have been much worse off in trying to cope with the realities of adapting to the modern world that would have encroached on their territory regardless of the presence or absence of missionaries. The missionaries may have made mistakes in the way they handled things, but their motivation was love, and they cared enough to give their lives to the Indians in Ecuador.In the same light, Perkins' uncritical acceptance of President Roldos and the Ecuadorian government is especially disturbing. For the most part they didn't give a damn about the Indians; the latter were often simply an excuse to get more leverage with Texaco and other oil companies, and this has been true throughout Latin America.Perkins' refers several times to a scene of an indigenous woman washing herself in the dirty stream as a paradigm for what American corporations have done to the world, and how he wrung his hands over his part in it. But according to his own words, this is his life:\\"In a strange turn of events, I succumbed to the corporatocracy when I sold IPS in November 1990. It was a lucrative deal for my partners and me, but we sold out mainly because Ashland Oil Company put tremendous pressure on us. I knew from experience that fighting them would be costly in many ways, while selling would make us wealthy. However, it did strike me as ironic that an oil company would become the new owners of my alternative energy company; part of me felt like a traitor.\\"In other words, at the same time he is crying about the woman in the dirty stream, he is sipping a margarita on his yacht and wiping his tears away with $100 bills. While he is wringing his hands, many Christian missionary organizations around the world are actually doing things to help people in these conditions with medicine, food, housing, and more importantly help to eliminate the demons of addiction, depression, poverty, and spiritual bondage; to give them hope for the future, and to be the hands of God that demonstrate His love and care.Perkins is not fit to shine the shoes of the people in SIL, and his book could best be interpreted as an \\"LHB\\" - a liberal hit book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I rarely comment on a book unless I feel that it truly deserves of praise or, in this case criticism.

It seems that the New York Times, Washington Post, and Boston Magazine share some of my observations.Caution: I'll try not to spoil too much, but references to the story are needed to make my point. The author confesses that he became wealthy from being rewarded by his company for manipulating economic forecasts. He indicates that he exaggerated potential growth for several countries for the express purpose of saddling them with debt, because these forecasts would be used to determine the scale of infrastructure projects. By inflating the estimates, the amounts borrowed from the United States for these projects would be so large that they could never be paid back, thus making them forever beholden to Uncle Sam. The problem with his story is that he never provides any evidence that the United States is behind his actions. He makes numerous references to what he suspects, but provides no evidence, making him sound like nothing more than a greedy man who benefited from shady dealings and now, late in life, is trying to blame the U.S. Government. His total evidence that the Government was somehow pulling the strings is, 1) He had an uncle in the National Security Agency who got him an interview with them before his economics career began. He tries to make the case that, because of this one event before his career began, they were somehow there throughout his career pulling the strings, even though he never indicates any further contact with them and admits his actions were his own. Moreover, the NSA is responsible for cryptography and signal intelligence. Economic intelligence does not fall within their responsibilities. You can look that up in numerous places. 2) When he gets his first job, he develops a brief relationship with a mysterious woman from his company (not the Government) who claims he is being molded into an \\"Economic Hit Man.\\" She disappears shortly thereafter and he never has any further contact with her. However, he would have us believe this event somehow guides his entire career. 3) Finally, he mentions that people from the Treasury department were in some of the meetings that he had with foreign governments, but doesn't say that they had any influence over him. It would not be surprising for them to be there if U.S. loans were to be made. From these weak examples, he tries to have us believe that his actions are the actions of the U.S. Government. Incredibly weak.As the story proceeds, his motive becomes clear. He provides a list questionable actions by presidents against foreign countries - not shy when it comes to talking about George H. W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, and George W. Bush, but neglecting as much as a mention of Bill Clinton. As the book proceeds, it degrades into a bashing of the Bush family and big oil. And this is the actual theme of the book. By his own admission, and without any meaningful interaction with the U.S. Government, he gets rich by exploiting several countries, all the while enjoying the praise of his bosses and the company of beautiful women. But when he starts to feel guilty about it, he blames the Bush family, the NSA and the oil companies whom, though may have also been involved with this exploitation, had no connection with him (except for the NSA, but the author still has no clue what they do).Instead of the details of the U.S. involvement in the economic manipulation of other nations as I had hoped, what I got was a book filled with guilty soul-cleansing. This book fails to be interesting in any way."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"For those who like this book as non-fiction, please subscribe to the Economist for a year so you can get up to speed on how things work in this world.I'm guessing from the reviews/ number of sales of this book that most people need to work for a multinational firm or the like to be able to adequately gauge fact from fiction on the subject matter of this book. I am baffled by the author's nievete and can't believe the publisher would publish this book as fiction or even non-fiction. Example after example, I found the discussed scenarios and quoted conversations as fake. I found myself cursing throughout the book, angered by how simplistic the author described interactions and relationships between NGO's and governments. In the end, I couldn't make it through the fourth chapter and will now burn the book.Background on this Critic: My experience working for a large US multinational commodity company was limited to two years, but I had the experience of working directly under the EVP of the company and led many of the companies multinational programs. We had interests in western and 3rd world countries. Doing business in poor countries is no different then in rich. Things may look poor when you drive around and want to use a public bathroom (if they have one) but the fact is that all countries, rich and poor, have an 'elite' and these people have the business savvy of those guys who just graduated from Harvard and get a position at Goldman Sachs. There are too many examples to list about this author's fake scenarios, so just use your common sense. I do believe corrupt dictators of some countries are willing to pad their personal checking account by accepting international loans at interest rates that will destroy their country, but this is not the norm.China is a good example of how poor countries decide to improve their GDP. They accept foreign direct investment for programs they cannot afford(car industry, dams, roads, etc.) by giving the firm exclusivity to the market or even just access to that market, period! Host countries usual demand majority ownership of these companies or multinational subsidiaries for control or put a limitation of how long that company can operate in the country. If a dirt poor country can't pay back a loan for the building a new power plant they have more options than just letting the big bad US earn 99% on each dollar of profit generated by that power plant while they pay 30% on the outstanding debt for that loan.To immediate options I can think of:(A) Countries frequently nationalize industries and kick out the very companies/ countries who built the industry in the first place. Result: they retain full ownership and now 100% profit of the industry and screw the government/ company out of the remaining investment the country/ government had in the industry.(B) Default on the loan.Economics is not like monopoly (like the author would like you to believe)- If everybody else loses all of their money, the guy with all of it wins. Making poor countries rich makes the rich countries richer. Markets become saturated and company profits stagnate. One way to grow is expand into new markets, e.g. developing countries.If things worked in this world like the author would have you believe, then modern day Japan or Germany should look like a US shopping mall, full of US products. Post WWII Japan and Germany were rebuilt by its former enemies and now these nation dominate in several global industries.Strong nations and companies do seek dominance and frequently EXPLOIT weak countries but it is nothing like what is described in this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"They may have trained him to become an Economic Hit Man, but obviously book writing was not part of the training course. The way chapters are organized does not make a lot of sense. He starts talking about Iraq, and a couple of paragraphs later, the story switches to Latin America.He tries to paint himself as a good guy by providing his regrets here and there, but he just keeps doing it. Overall, I also sensed that there are some degrees of exaggerations."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins lived the life he writes about.

First of all, he knows nothing about economics. Nothing. Not a damn thing. Secondly, he claims to have worked for Charles T. Main engineering (MAIN), a firm which no longer exists due to complete mismanagement at the time he supposedly worked there. Thirdly, in the beginning of the second chapter he claims that his secret trainer, a hot babe (of course), gives him a card and then at the end of the chapter claims he has no way to trace her back to MAIN. Uh, you got her card.The hot babe tells him he's going to become an \\"Economic Hit Man.\\" I'm pretty sure that no secret agency would come up with a name that stupid. His job is get the World Bank, or whoever, to loan countries money so that they'll let us build bases there, or some nonsense.The whole thing is funded by the NSA, supposedly, even though this would be the CIA's jurisdiction. Perkins doesn't even get the simple stuff right (his recount of the Iranian overthrow is simplistic and stupid), and his account of what he does lacks even minor detail.It's obvious that he's lying."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"By reading the first half of this short book, one can completely understand why the Left hates the US, and why it believes that governments rather than markets should control economic outcomes.I agree with the comments of Paul Andrews (of San Diego) with these exceptions/additions:1. I would only give this book one star. For a person looking for some impartial facts (I am capable of making up my own mind on these things thank you very much), it was very disappointing.2. Only the first half of the book is interesting, the second half is a pedantic diatribe rife with hypocrisy. A real chore to slog through- unless you're predisposed to believe the author's propaganda.3. The author fails to consider the effect of his solution on US society. If corporations are not allowed to explore for and find additional sources of oil, its price would increase and the resulting inflation would hurt the middle and lower classes of society, not the upper parts of society where he travels. The electorate of the US would not stand for that, and would vent its anger at the ballot box against whoever is in office. This is what happened in 1980 to President Carter, a man who the author calls \\"compassionate\\" and obviously admires."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"When I saw this book at the book store, I just had to buy it because not only did it look incredibly interesting, but the cover looked pretty darn neat.After the first few chapters, a few things became apparant. Not only was the book very vague, but John Perkins keeps referring to his moral tug of war. Which was so incredibly repetitive, that it just made me want to return the book and find something else to read. But I kept with the book to only realize that the dialogue was very poorly written and unrealistic. I then realized that his job as an \\"economic hit man\\" was no where near as interesting as the blurb on the back of the book leads the reader to beleive.This book could have been a masterpiece given the subject at hand. But the writing and amateur story telling leave this book a confusing mess."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The book got a bit too preachy/personal, but I liked the journey and I liked reading about the various countries where I have previously not paid too much attention to when it comes to globalization.

I'd heard someone describe the book and was anxious to get the inside scoop on how the world bank and other international lenders are screwing poor countries, but this book became less and less believable the more I read it. It doesn't feel like an honest account, it reads like fiction, posing as non-fiction. It's either the result of a horrible writer who can't get past his ego to tell what really happened, or it's a con, or disinformation. I feel cheated that I spent money on this book.Oh, and on the possibility that it is a truthful account, John Perkins is an unconscionable a**h*le trying to squeeze a little more profit out of his career of bad deeds."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":".....first, Perkins claims to have conned nations into plunging themselves into monster-debt scenarios, second, Perkins feels awful about it whilst touring the Amazon, third, Perkins writes a book, telling us how bad he was.If there ever has been a shallow, basic (if not simplistic) and hair-raising account of how the American corporate world conquers the rest of the globe - this is it.To trump it all: admitting to having made good money when acting as an EHM, Perkins now seeks to capitalize on his confessions. An utter waste of time."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I was happy with the purchase of the book \\"Confessions of an economic hit man\\" as everything went smoothly and effectively. The book was in the condition as advertised and it came in the timeframe stated."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I have no doubt that much, but not all, of what Perkins describes in this book actually took place and his telling can be interesting at times. What really clued me in to the fact that he is capable of stretching the truth were his descriptions of Ground Zero after 9/11. I lived at the corner of Liberty and West Side Highway on 9/11 and can say, based on my own experience, that this part of the book is pure fiction. Perkins wants the reader to feel his pain and guilt for having been an EHM but I never got the feeling he was being genuine. He kept going back for second helpings. He rambles while trying to be descriptive and the result is page after page of quite boring reading. This is an OK book to buy if you can find it used and cheap."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am strongly recommended for this book and the vendor is great book for all of us to understand who we really are."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Just finished the book and have to say the author's stories seemed very contrived. While many historical facts are presented like the Iraq War or the Control of Panama Canal, the author's stories of meeting \\"local people\\" seem made up and don't provide any useful evidence to the reader beyond attempting to help the author's own conspiracy agenda. I was hoping for a lot more from this book, but it fails in so many ways, and believe this guy is in the same category as James Frey."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"\\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" offers a compelling story and an interesting vantage point. John Perkins retells his tale as a chief economist, and his role in building of the new 'empire' - the economic kind - on part of the United States. The data is sparse, and at times the book borders on fiction, but I would not disagree that there many elements of truth in it as well. An interesting read, but also a book to be approached with a healthy dose of skepticism."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"A very good Read. Very Hard to put down."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I have read the book, however I did not buy it from Amazon.com, my son gave it to me, because he thought the subject would be something that would catch my interest, I am originally from Brazil and have been living in the United States for the last 34 years, my occupation is a real estate broker, and my area of expertise is real estate investments.While reading the book, I was looking for the \\"plot\\" and motivation of the writer who was also the perpetrator of the \\"scam\\" to get loans for development nations that fits the guidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. The writer tries to cast the United States as a willing party of the transaction, justifying that their utter motives was to build a world empire, and that the World Bank was not really a World Bank since it was controlled by American Bankers, and theexistence of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund was really to get loans to developing countries to build their infra-structure such as roads, electrical generation plants, agriculture or other types of public constructions with the condition that they use American companies to execute the work,which is nothing wrong since the goal of any government or country is to get projects that would benefits companies and the economy of said country. Now,what I do not believe is that the World Bank or the International Monetary Bank would willing make loans to countries that could not pay back the loans,in order to trap them, and then tap into their natural resources such as oil or other raw materials or otherwise take advantage of them \\"mafia style\\" as suggested by the author and here is my theory of really happened and what part John Perkins played in the scheme: It looks to me that the MAIN INC. was more a Mortgage Broker than an Economic Hit Man, this private company realized that there was big bucks to be made by contacting Developing Countries, including Brazil, which is my country, and cutting a deal with corrupted government officials offering them their services as an intermediary or \\"Broker\\" to obtain loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund or other similar outfit, since they \\"knew\\" the guidelines and requirements to get the loans, for a percentage their company would \\"create\\" a plan to guarantee that the loan would be approved, which would include \\"falsifying data\\" with \\"phony\\" projections to meet the lenders guidelines. The corrupted politicians, eager to get a cut of the amount of the loan for their personal account and at the same time get \\"credit\\" with their voters for work done under their administration were more than happy to participate by signing and providing any documents and guaranties in name of their governments, without regard that the actual project was or not viable,the scam worked for while, but after a period of time, the banks must realized what was really going on, and it was becoming more and more difficult to fool them, that is why John Perkins decided to quit while he was still ahead of the game, however when MAIN called him back as a consultant because one of the \\"customer\\" specifically requested his \\"expertise\\" in falsifying data and projections, he asked for three times his salary to continue as a consultant and doing what he knew best, this way he bought his own \\"conscience\\" again. The other time he says he was offered a \\"bribe\\" not to write the book, he agreed not to mentioned the company involved and not to write the book, about the loan \\"schemes\\" which he did anyway, because \\"character and integrity\\" is not one of his virtue to begin with.Now that he is retired he decided to write books and give lecture about his career, if I was him I would be concerned to be charged in falsifying or douctoring data in order to defraud financial institutions into giving bad loans.Please, stop using the title of Economic Hit Man and suggesting that the United States goes around the world, Mafia style, building an empire, here is a more appropriate title for your book: \\"Confessions of a Con Man\\" ..."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Brilliant, in an odd kind of way! The paradox of this book is that it often reads like an unbelievable and corny spy thriller, while simultaneously dealing with probably the most real and important issues facing humanity and the planet today. I am sure the author is well aware of this - a more academic, or more \\"credible\\" account would have reached far fewer people. Regardless of how much artistic license John Perkins may have used, the essence of this book has a sobering ring of truth about it.Perkins takes us through his autobiographical account of life as an economic hit-man or EHM. \\"We are an elite group of men and women who utilize financial organizations to foment conditions that make other nations subservient to the corporatocracy running our biggest corporations, our government, and our banks.\\" From 1971 to 1980, this found him working in developing countries (eg. Saudi Arabia, Ecuador, Panama), subtley and not-so-subtley building the global American Empire. The real-life politics is interesting.Perkins eventually quit his job, finally finding the greed and hypocrisy too difficult to deal with. This was partly a result of getting to know the natives of each country he worked in and his social life makes entertaining reading. Although he left the EHM job in 1980, it took the events of September 11th 2001 to finally inspire him to come completely clean and publish this book.The epilogue is a nice little wake-up call in itself."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is a great book.

The stories move so slowly. They're watered down with so much description of how pathetic, filthy, sick, poor, but intelligent people are in the third world. The book is a constant iteration of doing work he was paid for, feeling guilty for his actions, then self justifying his work to himself.He is constantly stating that this neo-colonialism was not a conspiracy, but a fraternity of people working together. What's the difference? At first blush you agree with him, but if you think about it, they are one in the same.This is a case of someone looking at the glass as half empty. He worked for a company that wanted to maximize its revenues. Now he chooses to see where the revenue was coming from and feel bad. I was a consultant for a long time too. Only I sold my services to the likes of Sallie Mae, AT&T;, Credit Suisse, and Wachovia. Do I feel guilty? No, but you could argue I was taking advantage of a need they perceived to have at the time.

I doubt that guilt was gnawing on him as much as he wants us to believe. Luckily, this lone shortcoming does not detract from the overall reading experience at all."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I was duped into buying this book by the title. The text that follows within shows me only another bragadocious, let's-talk-about-me baby-boomer whose qualified contrition combines with way overdone hyper-hype about his less than seductive, less than convincing role as some sort of economic spy.There are several fatal flaws in this work. One, Perkins never works directly with or in concert with any intelligence service. You get this gnawing sense that his vague references on this topic only reveal imaginary friends. Two, his every confession is pre and post-qualified with all of these rationalizations about how he was always better than the crook he is describing and mea culpas that are preceded and followed by blaming others. Three, his theme of third world oppression through debt has just recently been blown to shreds as the wealthiest nations prepare to wipe clean the debt of the poorest nations. Four, if this were all about his bad deeds and confessing them so as to make right and shine light on others who do now or then what he did, why does he spend so much time on idealogical nonsense - attacking free markets, corporations and America's very existence? Five, if I want to read about someone's sociopathic beginnings in an ideal childhood environment with loving parents and good schools, I will read Stephen King or watch a horror movie. Six, even if the reader were to give him a pass on proving any of this, his story itself is unbelievable even without the proof. Seven, the book is an awful knock-off of a bad movie plot. The dialogue across character maintains the narrative voice. There is no distinction or variation among voices across cultures and years. Eight, the entire agenda of domination he describes reads much more like his own greed and that of his consulting company. Never does the reader get any substantive sense that his money-grubbing ways had larger geopolitical motives. There is a nine and ten and on and on.If you are tempted by the witty title and all that it may imply, the above should give you some indication of the ways in which this book falls woefully short of delivering any of its at-a-glance promise."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Now we know how we ended up with \\"Shrub\\"!This book is so disturbing and a must read for all thinking Americans."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Whether or not you accept the premise of this book, its unfortunately not very well written.

Still, if you believe that the government killed JFK or was responsible for bombing the World Trade Centers, you'll find the book to be entertaining. Think of it like an economic version of the DaVinci Code.Here are just a few of my problems with Perkins' narrative-1. Perkins describes how he was recruited by the NSA to be an \\"economic hit man\\" that would encourage foreign nations to initiate construction projects that could not be repaid. In this way, the US government and corporations could gain leverage over Third World nations to advance their agenda. He doesn't provide any documentation to support his claim, but what is makes it truly unbelievable is that the NSA would have nothing to do with that type of operation. The NSA handles signals and cryptographic intelligence. Basically, they're \\"tech guys\\" that break codes and eavesdrop. Had an official \\"economic hit man\\" program truly existed, it would have been run through the CIA Directorate of Operations, possibly using the US Agency for International Development as a front if the operation had occurred back in the 70's. It might be plausible that the NSA shared intercepted communications with US corporations, but Perkins fails to provide any explanation for why the NSA ran what was essentially a human intelligence operation.2. Perkins talks specifically about the damage done to Indonesia. Yet by most objective measures, Indonesia's living standards improved dramatically over the time period to which Perkins refers. Literacy rates went up, infant mortality declined, access to safe drinking water expanded and life expectancy rose dramatically. Perkins fails to offer an explanation that reconciles these easily confirmed facts with his own perceptions and/or assertions of Indonesia as a victim.3. Perkins fails to explain why the Bush Administration agreed to forgive the debt of the world's 18 poorest Third World nation back in 2004. If the US policy called for intentionally trying to put Third World nations in debt, why would it then forgive 100% of the debt for 18 of those countries?There were just a few of the unanswered questions that I had after reading his book. Once again, I found the book entertaining, but anyone with a little knowledge of international affairs will be left doubting Perkins' yarn."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Author's unique position as an economic/development consultant enables him to provide a view of globalization that questions many conventional theories about benefits of international trade and its positive effects on citizens of poor nations.

Unfortunately it shows.It's frustrating that many revelations about exploitation of world's poor that could be much better understood by providing good data and statistics, that the author should be in a great position to gather, is missing.Confession can be a means to admit and accept ones failings.

Last, I found myself questioning the premise of the book in the first place which claims that EHM's exist as a new/special entity. It's not like we ever needed the NSA or any other intelligence agency to establish a corporatocracy, it was bound to happen on it's own. My 2 cents?

Having admitted to wrongdoing while engaged in his first profession, he asks you to trust the sincere intentions underlying his second - namely, his role as a best-selling author and speaker exposing the greed and perfidy of the United States. \\"I sometimes suspected some sort of conspiracy was directed at me,\\" Perkins writes. Indeed, he seems to live in an odd world framed by the cold reality of economic statistics on one side and a life in espionage that reads like fantasy on the other. This odd balance would seem to limit the credibility of his premise: that international economic consultants have formed a de facto alliance with the U.S. intelligence apparatus to economically and politically exploit the world's disadvantaged nations. The book is an interesting read no matter how much credibility you invest in it. Perkins offers rare insights into behind-the-scenes mechanics of Third World debt and development. We recommend it, with the caveat that it may reflect the influence of one of Perkins' favorite authors, spy novelist Graham Greene."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Just look at the passionate reviews here and you will know that this is a monster book. It has heart, treachery, lies, corruption, conspiracy, great characters, insight, you can feel his pain and anger page after page. This alone makes it a great book, but the fact he gives us a message of peace, of hope, while giving his ideas of what will make a better world is what sets it apart. I don't agree with everything, but he has me thinking of ways to make life better for the entire world.My thoughts:Corporations are here to stay, they need to be responsible for their actions, and they need to work with their own employees instead of exploiting them. How about mandatory daycare, lunch, housing, transportation... these all used to be part of corporate America, lets bring it back? Change the Corporate image to a family not an individual in the US and Internationally."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"the author really misses the mark when he doesn't factor in the Luciferian plan for world government and religion. That's a very big thing to leave out. True, greed does factor in to what is really going on in the world today, but bigger things are in the works than a few elites simply wanting to make a lot of money. It's naive to think that there is no motive to the actions of those at the top beyond simply wanting to get wealthier.Mr. Perkins appears to have new age leanings. What he doesn't seem to get is that the people he worked for - and now opposes - are new agers themselves. Surprise, surprise, and a little confusing I must say. How can someone be opposed to a world view, but share it at the same time?Some good information here about how our world works. Unfortunately, a lack of broader understanding of what's truly going on.\\"What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but loses his soul?\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"While Perkins claims to reveal the truth behind the Corporatocracy, he spends most of his time bragging about his multi-million dollar exploits, his philandering with women from wealthy families and his reckless disregard for the lives of the innocent, which he sold into modern day slavery. He continues to make a fortune from book sales, movie deals and treks into the Amazon while he professes to be on a mission to save mother earth. In truth, he is only interested in profiting from the misery of the millions he helped entrench into abject poverty thanks to his unwavering support for profit-seeking corporations. There is no true remorse in his confessions of being an EHM. He uses it instead as a platform for his ego to take centre stage and to brag about his days rubbing shoulders with the rich and famous while millions starved to death. He feigns remorse as he recites the Dalai Lama's wisdom, and yet there is nothing redeeming about his so-called confession. I am ashamed that I supported his tainted enterprise.

His actions then and now are a scar on our integrity."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I concur with all the one star reviews.

If you don't think the government could possibly have ill motives abroad, then you probably won't have the ability to read and listen to this book.

It does a good job of separating the credulous from the critical reader. It also does a good job of boring most of us with Perkins' shallow naval-gazing and contrived self-flagellation. If you read it, try to remember what a truly well-documented and supported work actually looks like. And, for heavens sake, make the contrast.

For liberals who read extensively, there's really nothing new. We already know that \\"economic development\\" is a raw deal foisted upon money-poor countries. We've known that for years. And it's a fairly commonplace observation that debt-servicing and import replacement are scams desgined to keep the rich finance institutions on top forever.But Perkins writes as if he is the first guy to actually break the silence and bring these startling revelations to the world. It just doesn't wash. I'm sure he's telling the truth about most things, and I would imagine that some of the dialogue is a bit artificial. But it really doesn't matter much. It just reads like a novelistic foreground account, written for folks who find reading background macro-material too stale.I would say don't bother."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Yep. That's right. This is the single worst piece of literature I have bothered to finish reading since Wuthering Heights many moons ago. In fact, if it wasn't for my absolute disgust for Wuthering Heights (Yes I know some people appreciate it, which is cool with me), this book would be the worst book I have ever read. It pretty much singlehandedly laughs at my career, spews out ludricrous, biased, unfactual information with zero valid references that boils down to the fact that the author is a complete and utter selfish, self-loving, con-artist. By buying this book you are only contributing to his con. I got conned into buying it. I am writing this review specifically to stop others from getting conned into buying it. No one that writes this sort of pointless conspiracy crap that basically suggests no solutions to the problems (which are obvious, and i'm not saying the problems identified in the book are wrong but that the whole premise of \\"economic hitmen\\" journeying around the world making up economics to destroy the world (basically this is him, making funky graphs in excel) is purely because this guy doesn't even have an economics degree, nor does he understand engineering, nor does he understand management.) So, to succintly summarise my anger into one point, I will say that if you tried to sell me this book i would burn it, jump on it and then feed it to a hippo, it is that bad!

As a economist with a Haliburton type corporation he could have written a thoughtful and informative piece. Instead he uses 250 pages to reinforce his self esteem. Much of the book describes how, despite not attending an ivy league school or receiving a PhD, he is still brilliant. He takes pride in accounting his quick climb to the top yet stops every so often to recount how he was some how (unlike all his coworkers) was able to feel badly about taking large sums of money to scam third world countries. Then after a change in company president he decides to resign because of his conscience, I wonder if perhaps he was forced out. Clearly this is a man who at 60 is still insecure and needs to justify his intelligence and existence. The book barely touches upon some of the more interesting aspects of the story regarding the world bank, IMF and the development of countries such as Panama and Ecuador. There is no real \\"history\\" or insight in this book. This is a man who conveniently waited 20 yrs to write a book at the exact same time when the American public is disgusted by corporate executives. Don't spend your money to pad this man's bank account and self esteem. There are many more works out there that have real substance (not to mention facts). This is an anecdotal and very surfaced story, nothing more."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Has anyone else made the connection of this memoir to John Nash's A Beautiful Mind?

The critique of U.S. foreign policy rings true, particularly in countries we've invaded for commercial gain.As to the alleged official goal of U.S. policy to bankrupt other countries, that is a long stretch; not that there aren't kernels of truth, but on the whole, the thesis and the James Bond intrigue is unconvincing.

At times that entire concept seems far-fetched, not in the fact that this couldn't happen, because it most likely does. But, the fact the Perkins offers almost no credible evidence to back him up, and claims that the company was very secrative about their work. You would think that through all his years with all the guilt he claims to have, he could easily have come up with some sort of paper trail to support his story.Perkins has a very detatched perspective in that he claims to feel bad about what he has done, and claims to have felt that way while doing it (also claims to have gone out of his way to learn about what the people of the countries he was out to destroy economically were all about) yet continues anyway. It seems that he now feels that all is o.k. because he wrote a book about his misdeeds to expose the system, 30 years later, that he claims to have had a major roll in creating."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"A MUST READ!

If you are credulous enough to believe that the debts and revenues associated with the energy business is indeed the core principle of the global economy, then the moral outrage of this book makes sense. But there's a whole lot to swallow.On the plus side, it's a fast and somewhat entertaining read. Otherwise it is a exercise in the slow revelations of a kind of self-loathing that takes about 20 years to surface.One of the things that I've had in mind as I was reading this screed was the sense of geography as destiny. As I look at the 20th Century, I think of most of it focused on the economics of . Perkins was one of the people who made the truth a narrative of economic exploitation. He falls in love with Socialist charismatics in Latin America, rues the lives of poor peasants, and bemoans the basic nature of corporate capitalism without ever acknowledging or even understanding the basic nature of socialism.Perkins is a perfect example of a cultural relativist. a perceptive reader can see how much he hates his hometown and parents and idolizes romantic ideals associated with revolutionary rhetoric. But you can't imagine that he even had the temerity to read Marx, Weber, Engles, Friere or anyone. Back when I was a bit more blackified, I referred to such people as culture vultures. If it's indigenous, it's good. But you'll never see him once talk about infant mortality statistics, literacy rates, crime rates or even inflation.I discovered a bit too late that this book would teach me nothing about the business of foreign direct investment or the workings of the World Bank except that he saw it as evil. Technically, you'll get a great deal more insight reading Wikipedia. Basically, Perkins assumes that his game was the only game on the planet, his company was smack dab in the middle of it and that it was all being subtley directed by the CIA and NSA and that this is, was and always will be the American way. You really get a foggy view of the Evil Empire of America from Perkins, who resembles nobody quite so much as a cynical wanker who is too soulless to quit the game. It's a confession all right.By the time I got 2/3rds of the way through, reading the book began to become annoying. The incredible vacuity of this man was staggering. There are no personal relationships in the book worth speaking of. He found loyalty only to his bosses worth mentioning. It is a stunning revelation about his character that he never once had a kind word to say or any personal quality worth mentioning about his staff that stands out in memory. We learn that he took one of his charges (female) on a yacht cruise to some isle in the Caribbean, but that when he got there, he was so sickened by his guilty conscience that he banged his head against the coconut trees.If you want to understand something about the life of an economist and high finance, the best book I've read is My Life as a Quant. If you want to understand something about the life of a reluctant spy, the best book to read is Larry Kolb's Overworld. If you want to get well-written account of a man who was too spoiled to find himself while being a toady in the economic hardball of the Cold War era, then this is your book. But it's nowhere near as good as, say The Quiet American.You can imagine that Perkins, who is a great admirer of Graham Greene, might have had aspirations to be such a character as Greene might pen. He is earnest to tell such a story that would portray himself thus, but he is to honest to consider himself heroic, and I suspect that he'll be working off his guilt for the rest of his life. In that regard, 'Confessions of an Economic Hitman' is (now prefaced and extended in the paperback edition) a blueprint for American liberal guilt. If there was ever someone who truly believed that global warming and a host of other blowbacks are destined to doom America to a well-deserved kharmic smackdown, it is John Perkins. He has always been a citizen of the world pretending to be a patriotic American, down to the repetitions of his undying faith in the words of Thomas Paine. You'd think, being a pseudo-economist, that he'd have some room in his heart for Alexander Hamilton. Ahh but that would mean that he'd have to admire courage.I didn't want to be a harsh judge of Perkins. I thought I might learn of an extraordinary life, one of conviction and then epiphany. Instead I learned of a small yapping dog who was always on a leash he lacked the spirit to gnaw through. Someone who would tell us in the end that we should use less oil and that 'corporatocray' is evil. This book has been a disappointment in many ways. I may well be very happy to read Thomas Friedman after this.Good parts?Yeah there are a few. He speaks about a few South American presidents who might have been contenders. He gives a few details about Saudi Aramco. But compared to Larry Kolb's fascinating and detailed portraits of Daniel Ortega and Adnan Khashoggi, this is Romper Room. If Perkins thought he was an agent... don't make me laugh."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I'm not going to waste time re-writing what everyone else had to say.

I didn't read it as an authoritive history book, as it looks like most other people have.This is one side of the story. There are others, but this one is the personal story of Perkins, which happens to be quite an interesting one."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins has accomplished at least two things in his book, \\"Confession of an Economic Hit Man.\\" First, and to his credit, he has shown, from the inside, the mechanics of how the global power elite have sabotaged our world by undermining or overthrowing the governments of underdeveloped countries in order to secure them in the march toward world dominion (he leaves out how they have accomplished the same with the industrialized countries). He shows the stages in which it occurs (and by which it had occurred long before he was recruited): initially the people like him come in with lies and seductions. If that doesn't work, the \\"jackals\\" arrive and produce \\"regime change.\\" If that doesn't work, the global empire elite send in our young men and women to die for their objectives (which is eventually to rule the world; anyone think Iraq, and the next foray--Iran--are something other than this??). Perkins maps this relatively well throughout. It's always more credible to have an insider spill the beans.But Perkins denies there are any conspiracies involved in the march to world dominion. Disingenously he attributes all of these murderous events to human \\"greed,\\" and greed's natural growth cycle (i.e., it just wants to get bigger, etc.). This denial is Perkin's lie, which has probably protected his life as well in publishing the book. He denies there is a conspiracy when he himself represented a portion of it. It's a bit like Brutus telling the Senate, \\"There is no conspiracy, really guys!\\" Perkins, oddly, has nothing to say about the Federal Reserve System's powerful role in keeping the IMF and World Bank running. He is strangely silent about the role of the central banks around the world and their cruel and continuous robbery of the people on the planet, including our own. He is mysteriously mute about 911 (he just happened to be out of town when that happened it would seem). The jackals, who practice regime change, with the abetting of our own government, surely wouldn't blow up the World Trade Buildings to accomplish regime change in the USA (meaning they surely wouldn't work to end our Republic and bring into existence the external and final establishment of fascism in the USA, as represented by things like the Patriot Act and other so-called \\"reforms\\" that the Congress--now almost completely owned by corporate and global elite interests--has passed to continue the redistribution of the wealth of the middle class to the very rich). No, the jackals are really just nice, somewhat misled, certainly misunderstood, new age type of people, as Perkins paints the picture in his lies. Oh, and, by the way, if all of what Perkins did was to establish a global empire, why is it he fails to inform us as to who is planning to run this global empire after it is built? Did he say it was the corporations that will run it? Yes, they are guilty of all the lies and chicanery of cartels (e.g., price fixing, inserting poisons into the food chain and environment, causing millions to become dependent, or dead on toxic chemicals and drugs, killing millions through a variety of other means in the name of profit and global dominion, and so forth), but can a few different cartels actually rule the planet? And one wonders why Perkins says nothing about the Council on Foreign Relations, the British Round Table groups, the way central banking steals from us, the way the Communist Manifesto has been incorporated into the governance of the USA, or the Bildebergers. Gee, that's some deafening silence from someone who (says he) once worked for these folk.So, read it for an insider's view about the reality of our time, but beware the lies he spins about there being no conspiracy. Within the global elite, he's just one small example of it. We'd better soon wake up to it, or we'll all face the jackals and the Army, both with orders to fire upon civilians."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"\\"Confessions of an Economic Hitman\\" provides further info and insight into what's really going on in our world and the motivations behind private and secretive governmental and corporate organizations. What these organizations do, occurs around the world. But the bright spot to this sad but true topic, is the autobiographical nature of \\"Confession of an EHM.\\" Perkins is open about his personal life in his childhood, with family, relationships, and professional life. This adds life to the book as much as his professional \\"hitman\\" duties.The book is divided into four parts based on time, in chronological order. Each chapter has its sources listed in the back and the index can allow the reader to further delve into these individual, organizations, and topics for further examination. In particular, the common strategy of sending in biased and lying economists that are on the payroll of these organizations (such as MAIN where Perkins worked). These economists carry out \\"studies,\\" and encourage the building of projects based on *loans* given to these countries of which it's already known they can never pay back. These economists are told what to report before they even go to these nations to do their research. If they don't provide economic projections and statistics they're instructed to give, they are fired. After these loans are provided and the debtor nation cannot pay, the US companies and US government force them to barter their natural resources (oil and gas) as a form of payment. If there is resistance by these nations' leader covert operation and/or counter-insurgencies are financed and support to assassinate of over-throw them. If this fails, the US goes in.All of these actions, at the expense of that nation's entire society and in particular its working poor and impoverished. The benefits and profits go to the US corporate elites. The dishonest and mercenary role of USAID is noted. Also, the IMF, World Bank and other governmental and private organizations: Treasury Department, State, Bechtel, Brown & Root, Halliburton, Stone & Webster, Texaco, Standard Oil, Shell, Chevron, among others. As for the individual players, the oil business and government are intertwined. One example is George Schultz and Casper Weinberger. They had powerful Presidential cabinet positions in the 80s after being President and Vice-President of Bechtel, respectively.Perkins has a conscience and this is evident from the very beginning. This is not a detraction, but adds the personal flavor and motivation behind his book. Perkins was was pressured and threatened for years not to write this. He had the honesty to print his falsified resume from MAIN in the book.He begins by noting the deceptions and lies when he went on his first assignment to Indonesia in 1971. As for his perceptions of American expats abroad, Perkins immediately saw the disconnect between the host nation and expats in so many forms. Yet when these expats work for the State Department, or other influential organizations (previously mentioned) it is truly disturbing.OMAR TORRIJOS of Panama and JAIME ROLDOS of Ecuador:Sadly, few know the story of former Panamanian President Omar Torrijos, what he tried to do, and how he was very likely assassinated by the CIA in a plane explosion and crash. Other foreign leaders have been assassinated because of the CIA-Oil interests. These leaders, like Torrijos are rarely if ever - mentioned by the American mainstream media. Jaime Roldos, the President of Ecuador also died in a fiery plane crash. Both leaders challenged the US oil companies.*Perkins often cites Thomas Paine and \\"Common Sense\\" in his (correct IMO) perception of the current state of the world. (Perkins does note a couple of times that he's related to Paine. :))*American settlers and the US government believed under \\"Manifest Destiny\\" that the conquest of North America was ordained by god - also convenient, was the expansion of the Manifest Destiny by Monroe in 1823 to extend American economic & military interests into the entire Hemisphere. Gold told them to do it. Convenient? (Note Arbenz, Torrijos, and Roldos in Central America, in recent history.)*President Carter and CIA agents on the ground in Iran thought the Shah was strong and supported by the Iranians, even though almost all of the Iranians knew his days were numbered and he'd be overthrown.*(SIL) Summer Institute of Linguistics was an Evangelical missionary group that secretly worked for the US oil companies. Ostensibly they translated indigenous languages in South America, while persuading these indigenous people to move off of their land to give more power to the encroaching US oil companies. SIL also gave these people tainted food that made them sick, then offered medicines to cure their illnesses.*Try find the logic and the real story behind the Panama invasion and Noriega (if you can).Lots of historical info and a comprehensive Index, so you can further delve into particular topics and historical figures.\\"Confession of an EHM\\" is an asset in making as many Americans as aware as possible to what is really happening in our world, and the the consequences of these actions. These sinister actions continue on to this day, and will continue in the future. The powerful greedy interests are difficult to thwart if at all, but by being aware the world is a better place.*In Saudi Arabia, another organizational acronym, JECOR (US-Saudi Arabian Joint Economic Commission) was created. The Department of Treasury oversaw the organization, but there was no Congressional oversight. MAIN was hired to seal the deals. The OPEC agreement to do all oil trades in US Dollars needed the Saud family to be on board. By providing a prostitute for one of the Princes, the Prince voted yes on the deal, and hence we have the Petro-dollar. Vital to the expansion of the American Empire, because it allows the US government to continuously run massive deficits to fund foreign wars without negative consequences.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The author John Perkins feels guilty for his role in suffocating the undeveloped world into debt.

It is very sad to come to grips that ones nation can do such a thing solely for profit. Yet that is the history of the world. Perkins has blood on his hands as an EHM, as he worked for two firms in essentially the same role. He also created an enviro energy company, which he sold to an oil company for profit. He tries to come clean regarding his roles, and implicates others for assassinations. He also implicates republican administrations solely. He is a turncoat to his two EHM firms, and doesn't implicate democratic administrations, which implies he is not completely honest. But that is the essence of an EHM (dishonesty, and immorality)"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins. A man driven to speak the truth about what a greedy, imperialist, ruthless bastard the US government is. I've known all along that our government was sneaky and evil but in reading this, I feel I have more proof. For the most part this reads like a gutsy, page-turning, confessional of a man who has been to the dark side, sold his soul, and somehow lived to tell the tale. He's like the Ghost Rider of the US underworld, using his demonic powers to fight the very demons he spawns from. Do I think he is honest? Yes. I think writing this book was the only way he could go to sleep at night and NOT see the third world children he helped starve, the rainforests he helped pollute, and the indigenous people he helped murder. Do I think he is the product of his own ego? Absolutely. However, by opening up about his involvement with shady organizations of corporatocracy and exposing them for their malicious intent of world domination, I feel he redeems himself. He has seen and worked on the inside and does have an insiders perspective that no one else has. Interestingly, the day I finished this book is the day Osama Bin Laden has been declared dead. With my newly minted Perkins brain, I am now, more than ever, trying to read between the lines."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins has written an entertaining book, which is also very informative. Those knowledgeable in geopolitics will recognize most of the events described, and the plausibility of Perkin's stories behind those events. There is no way to know if the details described actually happened; but if they did, then a lot of other domestic and foreign events make a lot more sense. I personally know that some of the facts in the book are true and I believe that those with which I am not familiar, are likewise true--at least until I become aware of credible information to the contrary.In reading through the reviews, it appears that many writers panned the book because it did not confirm their preconceived ideas. I would recommend to anyone who finds the description of the book interesting, to buy it and read it with an open mind. Afterwards they can come to their own conclusions, and will perhaps learn something about how America operates."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman is the story of the author John Perkins; this story describes his part in, and observations of, a series of events which take place over the last several decades leading to the impoverishment of various countries through the use of corporate policies including underhanded manipulation, bribery, improper statistics, etc to undermine those countries economies to such an extent that they would be beholden to their creditors and various corporations.The general formula would be to take a country which is rich in some resource that the U.S. deems to be valuable, but which has not been modernized and has little infrastructure, and conduct research into how much money would be loaned to these countries based on an economic forecast conducted by companies with a vested interest in the result. This research would always lean in a direction such that the country would receive a vast amount of money more than they could afford in loans which would be used to build out infrastructure in the country. Of course, the infrastructure would be built, maintained and designed by the U.S. companies which were in league with the economic forecasters and banks. In turn, the loans would be so large that the countries, after the initial investment of the loaned money used to build out the new infrastructure, would not be able to pay them off. The countries which received the loans would instead be pressured into giving out resource rights, favors, political asylum, etc.Throughout the account, the author at once tries to describe his feelings of remorse for taking part in these actions as well as describing how he, again and again continued to proliferate the agendas set before him. It is described how wars were deemed to be outdated during and after the cold war, so, instead of going to \\"war\\" we would instead conduct a sort of economic war on the countries whose resources would help determine the course of the future.I must say that my reaction to this book is not exactly what I would have thought. Although I enjoyed it, I don't know how heartily I would recommend it. The author's \\"confessions\\" seem a bit misplaced for someone who has spent the majority of his life as part of his own story of greed and corruption. It seems a bit to, I don't know, \\"to little to late\\" maybe? You can't spend the majority of a book telling me how evil you and your cohorts were, about how you had pangs of guilt for years on end, how you grew to hate yourself, and then try to convince me that you are really a good guy now. I am glad that, at least according to his own tale, John Perkins appears to have turned over a new leaf; That he now spends most of his time with non-profits trying to right some of the wrongs which he helped to create. But I still can't help but feel that this too (the book) is being used to help him profit off of a career which, in the very best of lights, should be despised.One thing that I must say is that this book helps to get the creative juices flowing, thinking about class struggles, corruption, corporate greed, and sanctity of culture. For that, I must certainly recommend it. But, before giving that recommendation, unless if Mr. Perkins and his publishers, distributors, etc are giving the proceeds to a good charity I don't know that I can honestly recommend anyone else to buy this book for fear that it is just another way to make money for a man who seems to have been driven by nothing more throughout a long career."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"First, I am baffled some retards are giving this book a 1-star. Its quite obvious they are paid hacks out to kill the 5 star rating of this book. Go back to your globalism nutjobs. Seems to be a trend lately on Youtube and now Amazon.As for the book, if you really, and I mean really, want to learn what globalism is all about, read this book. Globalism is about money hungry govt and corporate powers willing to sacrifice people and their culture and environments for wealth and power. I knew some of this already from personal experience with family members but John takes it to a new level most don't dare talk about.Globalism is a joke, fake, a ghost, a game corporations play to steal wealth from poorer countries who may be sitting on oil, gas or timber. By threatening their leaders or even killing them, they manipulate votes in that countries govt which allows our corporations, and others, to strip that country clean of their resources while driving them heavy into debt with BS infrastructure projects. As the leaders in those countries get rich, if they play along, the people suffer and some even have to defend their land from the corporate invaders who will stop at nothing.If you don't read this book, you are aiding and abetting these corporate crooks who think they have a right to do what they please, when they please. They stoop even lower when they use our CIA and NSA and other secret groups to do their dirty work and killings. If you want to really know why America is so hated around the world, you need to read this book. If not, go back to sleep and keep dreaming that Osama Bin Laden still hates us for our freedom. John Perkins is a brave man, we need more brave men who keep silent as these crooks rape and pillage foreign lands. Are you one?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Interesting, but a little overly dramatic. I've been able to meet and have a pretty in-depth conversation with a former assistant director of the CIA, it does not appear to me that such a large organization can have such a cohesive and well thought out master plan. That is simply not how large complex organiztions behave."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I cracked this book open with the hopes of getting an insider's view of how corporate manipulation of international loans works. Unfortunately, Perkins reveals little except his takeaway from the experience. The overall feeling of the book was not that he wants to educate us on the machine and how it works but rather issue a mea culpa. It's long on feelings and short on detail. I was looking for something more well researched and detailed like \\"Blackwater\\" by Scahill which gives a deep account on how corporate players make money from war and the US government. Unfortunately, Perkins was only able to vaguely confirm what I know to be true, leaving me searching the book racks for someone who can explain the nitty gritty to me. I don't recommend it if you want to answer the \\"hows\\" of this really big and complex issue."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"A riveting and disturbing expose on the greed and malicious intent of big business and the World Bank at the expense of underdeveloped countries to keep them forever in the debt of the major powers. It reads like a good spy novel. I bought several copies and shared it with friends."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Just quickly, this is an excellent, riviting book, and everything in it rings true with what I already knew to be correct. The USA is essentially run by government joined hands with big business, to create what the author calls a \\"corportocracy.\\"The book explains how the USA and the world bank loans billions to under-developed countries, who then use that money to fund energy plants, shopping malls, roads, you-name-it, BUT all built by American companies (so the money comes right back to us). Then, when these countries fall behind and cannot pay back on their loans, the US negotiates to acquire land, resources, and even U.N. votes. And, these third-world countries practically never become better off in the long run -- in fact, their overall economic conditions typically decline.In today's news as I write this we are seeing the corportocracy run its course in Iraq: the author predicted this would be the end-result of the US military's occupation of Iraq -- it was all about controlling the oil (apparently more abundant that what Saudi has), and being far less reliant on Saudi oil. In effect, the US corportocracy (a combination of government and big corporations) has become the new Roman empire, in effect conquering much of the world, but usually without the machinery of war."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you want to understand \\"why they hate us\\" and the real reasons behind the US foreign policies, read this book.It's very well written, I just wish the author gave more details sometimes. It's shocking, provocative, and makes a great case against US capitalism as a model of society."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an EHM certainly is one for the conspiracy theorists. It was an interesting read by a man obviously plagued by his conscience. It got too wishy washy for me about three quarters of the way through. He was trying to be both a philosopher and an economist and it would have been better had he just stuck to the facts of economics and politics (as he saw or knew them) rather than waffle on about eagle and condor \\"prophesies\\".Read 3/4 of it and then evaluate what he is saying. If you like the wishy washy stuff read the last 1/4To summarize in one sentence, \\"Humans are greedy and prey on the weak (most of them)\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is one of the most interesting historical \\"conspiracy\\" books I've ever read. Some of it was so unbelievable that it is completely believable. For example, Watergate is so far fetched that it would be hard to dream that up (Watergate is not in the book, just an example to illustrate the point). If you've ever wondered about all of the US recent wars and the motivation, this book will tie everything together, even thought this book is dated well before recent wars.I was honestly skeptical of the book's truth, even though it seemed plausible, until I met the author over drinks at a friends home. After many years, the author appeared to not be proud of what he did in his past and almost seemed uncomfortable talking about it. In my experience, people that have completely fabricated lies to make a name for themselves, relish the attention of their own story. This was not at all the case with Perkins. These were simply my observations and instinct and are not facts.A little background to the movie Shooter with Mark Wahlberg, the opening scene and underlying story of the movie was inspired by this book.I loved this book and highly recommend it. A modern day book that is SOMEWHAT similar is the Green Zone."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It would be fascinating to hear more of the actual numbers involved in all of these shady deals, not to mention the fortune that John raked in as an EHM. I don't think it was enough to merely confess about his morally unjust actions, if liberation of his burden was what he really wanted he should also give ALL the money back to the countries he pillaged.Everyone in the world should know the information in this book and be appalled. It is just a shame that Perkins waited until after 9/11 happened to write this confession. By then the corporatocracy was already planning their exploitation of the situation. Or hell even before the dumbass Bush was elected President. It might have saved Gore some votes if the public knew more about what Bush 1 was up to during his presidency or who Cheney really was. Too little too late if you ask me..."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins seems to write the story after some kind of spiritual awaking, many years later. Nothing wrong with that of course, but his remorse at times seems to inflate the importance of his somewhat lower-level role. Hindsight, at times, is beyond 2020, perhaps even able to connect the unconnected.The Author takes us through an enjoyable and largely credible account, a crash-course in the crimes of opportunity in international sovereign finance. As a delegated authority for the Export-Import Bank of the United States myself, I do see the history of the organization framed in these chapters. The motivation and dynamics, however, may be more related in retrospect than they were in plan.Very enjoyable, well written, enlightening and even exciting. Valuable insight from someone who certainly was in the trenches."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you are interested in understanding how international politics and business go hand in hand through dirty deals, and read interesting real-life stories which proves the points and shows how history is made, then this is the book for you. Those who write that this book lacks credibility because it has few or \\"vague\\" facts are obviously just trying to smear it for personal political reasons. This book can easily be compared and ranked with other factual and interesting books like The best democracy money can buy, No Logo, Stupid White Men, Fast Food Nation, etc."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I wasn't going to give this 5 stars until I read Gary's review from his sailboat. Then I decided, yeah this is not the most exhaustive analysis of the damage done by our hidden (from US) form of imperialism but it is essential reading nonetheless. It is a quick overview, through one man's experiences, of recent history we can neither afford to ignore ourselves nor be allowed by the rest of the World to ignore. We turn a blind eye at our peril - e.g., 9/11 and much worse, such as peril to our own souls (for want of a better word).I was bothered by the \\"fictional\\" feel to the book in that so many conversations were quoted and not paraphrased; I personally could not quote myself accurately from conversations that happened this morning much less 30 years ago. So, I guess one must allow some artistic license. To convey the events without quotes would bog down the book, make it less readable.Despite the caveat mentioned, I still feel 100% sure that the author is truthful and accurate in his representations of what's been going on with globalization. All that he says accords exactly with everything else I've read in books such as \\"Blowback\\", \\"Sorrows of Empire\\", \\"Global Class War\\" and so on. And the first-person narrative style of the book makes it accessible to more people than those other books, perhaps.So, in word, I'd say \\"Confessions\\" makes for important reading for those new to the subjects and with little time to spare (or little time they are willing to make) to read up on such a critically important subject.The message of this book is simple and as profound as it gets. We (you, me, investors, US in general, world elites) have blood on our hands exactly as did the slavers of old; and yet we have an opportunity to make right. If we don't, all the \\"advantages\\" we've exploited will come back to haunt us much as the darkest of nightmares - the \\"downtrodden\\" will bite back and/or Nature will teach us a lesson or two we will never forget."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"At first I was really loving this book. A guy with such power and connections was confessing it all. But about half way through, I realized he wasn't really going to give us any details. By the end of the book I belived the author was making up a lot of the book and overdramatizing everything. This would be ok for a fiction novel but this book isn't supposed to be fiction.The big letdown was that he doesn't give any details on what he did. He talks more about his affairs with women and his secret conversations with heads of foreign countries than he does about how an economic hitman does what he does. by the end of the book the term EHM sounded so rediculous. The author wants us to believe he was some type of James Bond parading around the world, when in fact all he did was come up with overestimated projections to sell company construction projects!That's another thing that I found hard to believe. How could this guy, who is not an economist, pull it off? How could he come up with overly optimistic projects and convince other assumedly real economists, that he was correct? We don't know, because he never tells that part. Too busy telling us about his women and his guilt!So.. why do I give it 4*? Because until I read this book, I wasn't very current on globalization and world politics. Yeah, ok the US is in Iraq for oil, but does it go further than that? While I don't believe the extend of the author's claims (like the NSA was involved with him etc.) I do believe there is lots of corruption and globalization is taking its toll on the planet. And finally, if you consider this book a book of fiction, it's no more ludicrous than the John Grisham novels, which I find quite entertaining.Bottom line: if you like fiction and/or are interested in globalization, then it's a good read."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Hmmm. While I was disappointed with this screed, I didn't know the author was also into new age spiritualism. That almost made me downgrade it a star. But I'll proceed.A friend who fancies himself an activist recommended this, though I don't think he'd read it. To be honest, it was difficult to get through. There were more mea culpas than in a confessional. After the 30th or so, I wondered: When will he ever learn?An interesting detail: Perkins uses the word \\"corporatocracy.\\" It's only interesting because I thought I'd coined the term. So I'll soothe my ego a little.There was a tone of braggary (is that a word? It is now...) when the author alluded to a sexuality with his \\"connection\\" early in the book. I could live with that, though it was out of place in an analysis of this sort.Perkins boasted of his many (many, many) accomplishments. then he added another mea culpa (again, again) because there was something morally dubious about it (and it, and it). He made many a statement with which I agree, about various assasinations, deaths of Central and South American figures, for example. But they're expressed as dramatized opinions. There are no footnotes, corroborative evidence. So the text came across as that of a left-of-center Ann Coulter. Anyone can express what they think happened. But show me some evidence. Otherwise you might as well be accusing those who disagree with you as treasonous, or any other Coulteresque porn on which the Right thrives.Frankly, it was hard to get all the way through because of that. I struggled with giving it three stars because, again, I didn't think it was very good. It's not very well written, it's almost more of a True Confessions resume than a report. But I decided I'd give it three stars anyway because maybe some college freshman will pick it up. And maybe that college freshman will be contemplating an eventual MBA and work with multi-national corporations making their hay off cheap labor in Korea or Nicaragua. And maybe, just maybe, he or she will get a germ of doubt if this book gives a hint of how the system REALLY works.But for those well-read on political/social/economic issues, don't waste your time with it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"For those who don't see the truth in Perkin's simplistic \\"confession,\\" then I must say you aren't paying attention to what is going on in the world today, especially in Bolivia now (June 2005).Check out http://www.democracyctr.org/ and read for yourself the results of U.S. and IMF policy with regards to the \\"corporatocracy\\" Perkins claims to have been a part of.While some have complained that Perkins book reads like a Grade-B movie script...well, isn't life just like that sometimes?

This is about money and power and a system of using the World Bank and IMF to leverage sovereign nations into debt by corrupting government officials. This is not some conspiracy theory but a conspiracy reality that has devastated much of the developing world. Astonishing.Four stars only as the author gets a bit repetitive and spends a bit too much time navel-gazing and wallowing in feelings of guilt for his role, his many decades of helping create the economic destruction of many countries and the further impoverishment of the very poor.This is a compelling and necessary read."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book will change your perspective on the world.Perhaps by reading recent newspaper articles on companies like Haliburton, you thought that maybe there was a sinister, uber-capitalist streak in America's foreign policy.

Perkins' first-hand account will take you step-by-step through the process of how America serves itself by pretending to help out the developing world.I highly recommend this book for skeptics and critical thinkers, as this memoir is not a screed or manifesto, but a compelling, detailed story of how the world works."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Length:: 3:59 MinsPerkins has shown us what we, the global elite, does not want to see.

I believe this book is \\"must read\\" for all involved in international affairs especially those from the third world."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man blends a personal story with established fact.It proposes that the CIA assassinations (all documented fact) of numerous foreign government leaders were preceded by attempts by US Corporations and the World Bank, etc. to inflate economic projections to get these nations in debts that they would not be able to repay, and enriching the corrupt leaders, thereby creating obligations to the US Government for imperialist goals. The premise of how individuals at corporations are given advancement and personal wealth within these corporations through some always unstated link to leaning a certain way that the government wants them to is intriguing, and the conspiracy theorists among us can easily see how this happens, but some could question whether this is how it actually happensMore importantly, the book shows very well how natural Corporate incentives and stockholder incentives in a pure capitalist society can easily result in further concentration of wealth at the expense of the most needy. I am part of this capitalist system and have profited from it, but it is a true moral dilemma that affects the way I work every day.All in all I'd highly recommend that everyone in Corporate America consider this book a wake up call regarding the results of your work, and make a decision of whether you want to be part of the problem."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book was published in 2004. The housing bubble was 3 years away, and the credit crisis was unfathomable. The first couple of pages predict that the global financial system, based on greed and consumerism, is not sustainable. Like many other self-reflecting, informed individuals, Perkins saw it coming.The book doesn't state anything new or groundbreaking. The vagaries of US foreign policy, its blatant support for tyrants in Central America and the Middle East have been public knowledge for decades. What this book does offer, is a refreshing personal perspective. It's a painfully honest, seemingly heartfelt confession. It recounts Perkins interactions with democratically elected leaders, who were vilified and/or assassinated by the US, when they had outlived their utility. He then puts this into the context of US corporate interest and some of the pieces of the puzzle start to fit together.While this book has excellent substance, I do feel Perkins resorts to a bit of self-aggrandizement. Its unlikely NSA especially profiled him to become an \\"EHM\\" and that they would send a liaison deep in the rain forests of Ecuador to recruit a 24 year old Peace Corp volunteer. In some other cases, Perkins alludes to a secret hand helping things fall into place to keep him from singing, like getting the funding for his company, or landing that generous retainership. These claims seems a bit too fantastical to me, but then, he did operate in a strange, deceptive world.Bottom-line: It's a 4-star book. Its engaging, honest and most importantly, takes solid aim at the US imperialism which has made the world increasingly polluted and unsafe."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Why has America's prestige in the world fallen? Why are we involved in costly international intrigues? This book's title is sensational-appearing but the subject is serious. The issues raised aren't hype they are happening today.Mr. Perkins' dramatic first-hand experiences relate closely to my observations as a national finance and banking executive in this country. The economic methods that he describes have been and are being used domestically. We are now experiencing their cannibalizing effects on our own economy.What should have been obvious to me, in the international setting, was made clear by John Perkin's book with the \\"film noir\\" title. The corprate-political machine described has no respect for national sovereignty including, I fear, our own.Please read, share and debate this very readable book.P.S. When I wrote this review: 1.) I didn't think that the economic crises that we visited upon other countries would come home so soon. Read the book to see what you may do! 2.)

Is there a connection between government aid and multinational companies developing infrastructure in underdeveloped countries? What's the big picture? How does it all play out? Who gets the cash and who gets the shaft? Perkins describes his take on the situation with the immediate sensibilities of a writer of adventure novels. After all, he was \\"there\\" as highly paid deal maker, an expert in the field of putting deals together to bring aspiring countries into the industrial age. As an avid follower of current events, I find much of what he writes rings true. It's a compelling point-of-view; I couldn't put the book down. It goes a long way in explaining what the hell we're doing, and why we're not being greeted as liberators. It's really not all that pretty. A must read!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins provides precious little detail in his work as an \\"Economic Hit Man.\\" First, the book is about making other countries dependent on foreign debt. This is not news and being the economist who creates the lofty projections does not a hit man make. There is none of the cloak-and-dagger intrigue that you might expect.Second, Perkins never discusses what he actually did. In nearly 300 pages he simply says he \\"cooked the books.\\" This gloss deadens a book that might have had some real meat. Indeed, an account of 1970s and 80s Jakarta is really neat and vivid, but that can be accomplished in 5,000 - 10,000 words.

If everything Perkins writes in this book is true, it is an interesting insight into multinational corporations and the foreign policies of \\"industrialized\\" countries. The book reads like fiction at times and some of the \\"facts\\" and information are questionable according to others in the field of economic consulting. To summarize the book, Perkins says that as an economic strategist for Chas T. Main, he was responsible for getting governments of 3rd world countries to agree to public works project that they couldn't afford and often didn't need. Then when these countries couldn't pay back the enormous debt, the U.S. government would step in and start dictating how these countries should run.

I'm not convinced it's entirely non-fiction, but it's an interesting read. Kinda socialist, but informative. I struggled through some of it, just because it gets a little repetitive and therefore a little boring, but worth the money. And I don't usually buy books."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I read this book during the election of 2012. Polls show the economy at the top of this list for issues the president needs to address. So, it was not surprising that both presidential candidates campaigned hard on economic recovery and jobs, jobs jobs. Both candidates promised to grow the economy and make more jobs. How do we do that? Well, John Perkins points out that, since the days of our founding fathers, the modus operandi for making the US economy grow is to exploit under-developing countries and their indigenous peoples. We have gone from Monroe doctrine to manifest destiny and now to globalization. For Perkins, imperialism is our DNA; our founding fathers depended on exploitation to make this country great. Perkins reflects \\"I had to ask myself why, given that I had been raised to respect such people, I should have qualms about exploiting countries like Indonesia, Panama, Columbia, and Ecuador. So Many of my heroes - Ethan Allen, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett, Lewis and Clark, to name just a few - had exploited Indians, slaves, and lands that did not belong to them ... (P. 172-173).\\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" tells several stories. On a personal level, John Perkins develops from a college drop-out to high ranking Financial Officer in a major international corporation. The parallel story, on the macro-level, is the story of the Untied States growing and expanding imperialism in Third World (underdeveloped) countries. John Perkins presents the Marxist dystopia where the rich keep getting richer and the poor keep getting poorer. He indicts the US government of manipulating economic resources using the suffocating influences of capitalism to perpetually make the masses of underdeveloped countries socially and economically depressed. How does it work? For Perkins, the US gains loyalty through coercion and favors, like The Godfather, Don Corleone. The deal that the countries can not refuse is modernization at the cost of insurmountable debt. Corporations like Perkin's former employer, MAIN, make money on the front end with contracts for engineers, urban planning, construction etc. Then, the US extracts it \\"pound of flesh.' With all the debt and greased palms, US is able to set up puppet governments and exploit the natives. For Perkins, the exploitation is oppressive to the extent that it is, in fact, slavery. Although US have abolished slavery in that US is no longer \\"importing\\" slaves, we continue to use slavery in other countries to produce high profits for corporate gain. Perkins sates that \\"The global empire, on the other hand, is the republic's nemesis. It is self centered, self-serving, greedy, and materialistic, a system based on mercantilism. Like empires before, its arms open only to accumulate resources, to grab everything in sight and stuff its insatiable maw. It will use whatever means it deems necessary to help its rulers gain more power and riches (p. 151).\\"For Perkins, the modernization of third world countries by the first world has actually contributed more to promoting their underdevelopment rather than their development. For Perkins, the US interest in \`foreign aid' is not genuine; rather, a scheme for imperialism. The US uses promise of modernization to get into the country, then, once entrapped in insurmountable debt, the county is subservient to our capitalistic desires. He tips his hand early in the book when he quotes a beautiful native he meets in a coffee shop: \\"Stop being so greedy ...and so selfish. Realize that there is more to the world than your big houses and fancy stores. People are starving and you worry about oil for your cars (p. 53).\\"I am sure that the $20 billion that the US spent on foreign in 2011 was not completely altruistic. But I am not completely clear on how the US is coming out so far ahead on the Don Corleone \\"deal you can't refuse\\" approach to world domination. The book is thought provoking and got me to do some of my own research. In particular, if the Don Corleone thesis was true, we would expect each of the exploited countries to be in deep debt while US was holding all the money? I look end up the debt and corresponding percent of GNP for each of the counties that Perkins focused on in his book: Saudi Arabia has $82 billion debt which comprises 13.3% of GNP; Indonesia debt is $222 billion (24% of GNP); Columbia is $153 billion with 41% of GNP; Panama has $13 billion (40.3%); Ecuador has 17 billion (24.6). If Perkins thesis is correct and USA is the world's Don Corleone, wouldn't you expect the US to have a surplus because all these countries owe the US money? Well, according to The Economist up-to-the-second tracker, in November 2012, the US has 11 Trillion in public debt which constitutes 73.2% of GNP! We have more debt than all the puppet countries put together! If we are pulling the strings on these puppet countries, who is pulling ours?! I would suggest the \`junky' analogy is more applicable than the Don Corleone analogy. As our debt rises faster than economic output (as it has been doing in recent years), the government will increasingly look for ways to feed our addictions (and our debt). Taxes, regardless of how high we ratchet them up, can not satiate our needs. To bring in big money, we must \`globalize' i.e., manipulate \`free trade' to work in our favor and imperialize foreign markets. The current cry of the voters is loud and clear... the beast is hungry, we want more jobs, so grow, grow grow!!! Looks like it is a bad time to be a developing country, especially one with oil."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is a good eye-opener from someone who has been in the field. It is a confession and an interesting peek into how the world works. The Wizard of Oz said to \\"pay no attention to the man behind the curtain\\", while John Perkins pulls back that curtain to a good degree. He explains how the use of exorbitant loans (which could never be repaid) cause third-world nations to be ever-dependent on the empire the US has become. Their public debt cancels out any real economic development which could occur of their choosing. If the loans fail, the national security CIA \\"Jackals\\" come in with threats. If they fail, the US military is employed.There are a few minor points where I disagree a little: He makes well the point that economic 'development' at the point of the gun is not development at all. But then he says (or indicates in places) that economic development itself is harmful to these third-world nations. If he didn't mean to word it that way, he did. Or that's how it came across.My point is that all trade should be voluntary, never forced. All domestic or foreign trade should be voluntary. As Mr. Perkins says, it is morally wrong for US companies to invade third-world countries under the ruse of 'helping' them economically - while assuring that the US companies get the contracts or make the loans. He's right about that. BUT if the weaker nation or society *wants* economic development on their own terms (or choose NOT to develop so quickly), that should also be their prerogative. There IS such a thing as positive economic development or advancement, IF it's voluntary. He hints that real economic development for the third-world is entirely possible in the epilogue. [He's right!] So he contradicts himself a bit.But to imply that all US companies care not for these third-world countries confuses the point. A for-profit company that is ASKED voluntarily by a third-world country for help is morally fine. All parties are in it voluntarily. There *are* helpful companies with good resources and good intentions who could genuinely help (voluntary). Please don't shoot them in the foot and kill off opportunities for real advancement.He also only briefly hints about the evils of paper money in the last chapter. He could learn a little 'Austrian Economics' from (say) Jorg Guido-Hulzmann, \\"The Cultural and Spiritual Legacy of Fiat Inflation\\" (seen here: [...]) on the great damage that paper money does. Hint: It is a primary source of the wealth disparity between the ultra-rich and the dirt-poor (something Mr. Perkins points out). But he makes little or no causal connection between that huge wealth disparity and the paper US dollar.At least Mr. Perkins does not come out swinging for MORE government intervention to solve this problem (which was caused by force, which IS government intervention in the first place).Keep up the good work, Mr. Perkins!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Before you start complaining and pointing fingers or better yet when you are finished complaining and pointing fingers please take time to read this.

I first saw John Perkins being interviewed in the Zeitgeist movie. I followed up his books from there. Being an old radical leftie, his book, his life and everything he exposes in this wonderful book adds up. With age I had mellowed, wondering perhaps in my youth I was just taken by the movement that was anti-uranium mining, anti vietnam war and anti corporate greed. Thirty or more years have passed, and John Perkins has vindicated all my so called paranoia. We were right, we should have kept on marching, shouting and throwing tomatoes at politicians. If the 'pollies' can't save the world, can we? With brave souls like John Perkins willing to stand up and reveal the truth, maybe it's not too late, maybe we can 'enlighten' society and we can change things for the better.

Individuals who write negative comments on the book belong to such corporations mentioned by the author or support them. Considering what they have done to presidents, it is very courageous and honest to disclose those facts in the name of ethics and honesty. Those who critize the book are acting like the US acted on the impoverished countries against their presidents. In a recent video I have seen cases describing Ecuador, Panama, Iran, and Venezuela.I can tell about the last military coup carried out by the USA in Ukraine, where I have half of my life. Back in November 2004, elections were taking place in the country. The preliminary results were not favoring the interests of the USA who wanted Timoshenko in the presidency as she was willing to be bought off to take the country to NATO. CIA instigated riots broke on the streets, thousands of protesters were paid and given a plot as to what to do. Every protester was given 100 US dollars if he gathered and yelled and threw stones for before the cameras. The international media was called and the image of social massive movements were broadcasted to make the international community believe that. Despite that, Timoshenko lost. But the IMF and the White House were not going to let that happen. The Supreme Court in Kiev was pressed and extortionated to rule against the results and the USA forced and forged such results shunning and mocking the vote of the Ukranian people. Since then Timoshenko has become one of the richest persons in the world, (as it happened with Gorbachov).Early this year the same elections were taking place and after 5 years of absolute corruption where politicians spent privately the 16.000.000.000 dollars that the IMF gave them, Timoshenko was losing again. She became furious and started to scream about a whole conspiracy of corruption despite that it was her own goverment who was in power. She did try again to overthrow the results by paying false witnesses about the counting of the votes, but this time the situation was so shameful that not even the international community dared to back up her lies, as every ballot had been monitored with a microscope by international observers.The modus operandi of the CIA in the East has always been the same since 1991. Conceive, organize, finance and carry out riots, buy off the local and international press, incarcerate the opposition and always build a statue in the middle of the square to symbolize the gaining of freedom. They are usually baptized as Svovodna Pamiatna, Independence Square etc. You find them in Tallin, Vilnius, Riga, Kiev, etc. Each has his.Therefore the book confirms by personal experience what the locals already know but the Western people never get to know.Now the questions. The Massive Media in the USA will cast shade on it. People dont read books and a movie about this will never be made because it is through movies and reality shows that the minds of the people are formed. It is not in the interest of the USA that these facts are known by the layman."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I would certainly say that this book is worth a read. If nothing else it is an eye opener revealing truths about a corporate culture that most Americans like to pretend doesn't exist. The beginning of this book is fantastically written and told like a suspense novel that is quite the page turner. However I only give 4 stars because it does seem to become slow towards the end as if the author is stretching the book out into more that it should be.Another reason I cannot give five stars is because the author repeatedly appears to be putting himself up on a pedestal as the one who did the right thing, when in reality he was one of the ones leading the charge and creating this culture.

It's those few captains of industry who are behind all of this, and that, I'm afraid, is all too familiar. I live in Manhattan & can think of 3 friends right off the bat who exhibit the same characteristics of pure greed who take advantage of the less fortunate on a regular basis (albeit on a much smaller scale). Our culture says wealth is good, the more money you have the more worthy you are as a person. Are most of us disgusted & annoyed by our greedy friends? YES. Maybe it's time we stood up, said to the captains of industry & others who do things like this, IT IS NOT OK TO FLEECE US, AND IT NOT OK TO FLEECE OTHER COUNTRIES. How come so many of us can't afford health insurance? How come the middle class keeps getting poorer? Obviously all those countries being taken advantage of - that money isn't coming to most of us. It's going to the wealthy 1% of our country. Oh sure, we can buy clothes for next to nothing thanks to H&M; and its slave-produced garments - but that's about the only benefit I can think of to US, the MAJORITY of the USA. With our inflation-adjusted shrinking paychecks we couldn't even afford clothes at a real price - if they cost what they used to cost (I remember paying $28, $50 for shirts back in the 80's) - then we might stand up & demand higher salaries. I hope this book serves as a wake up call - I no longer tolerate my greedy friends, I no longer make excuses for them. And I'm certainly not going to tolerate corporate greed, either. Let's stand up and say ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.Oh, and thanks to THEIR greed, we can't even safely & peacefully visit other countries. Other countries hate us, hate our foreign policy, hate our ignorance of it. And they're right, because we don't say NO, we just passively let the greedy few take over & ruin everything for the rest of us."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I always love a book that is not only informative but is engaging.

Stiglitz's \\"Globalization and Its Discontents\\".There are parts of Perkins' story that are hard to digest, but taken as a whole, whether or not you find him sincere, the issue deserves further scrutiny. I would recommend this book to anyone open-minded enough to take Perkins' message seriously.And to the 1-star reviewers who invoke the G8 summit, you obviously didn't read far enough: in order for a country to be eligible for debt relief, the World Bank/IMF demands that it has to privatize a public program, such as its water utilities or education system.

Doesn't sound like a great idea to me. I don't doubt that there are social and environmental problems associated with oil production and these should be addressed, but this book does not really make sense. Would the world be better off without globalization? How would backwards countries ever get started on the road to a modern state? Remember along with some negatives, a modern state means health care, education etc. The author suggests that corporations should have as their major goal helping poor countries rather than profits. Bet they wouldn't be major corporations very long with that attitude and by the way, What would the stockholders think? Bottom line, the author doesn't make his case."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is presented as a memoir of the author's time working for an international firm which collaborated with corporate power and U.S. intelligence to exploit other countries' resources, earn big contracts for American corporations and increase the U.S. geo-strategic position at the expense of indigenous democracy movements. Few readers who pick this book up will be unaware, abstractly, of the United States' opposition to democratic movements in much of the developing world and its collusion with corporate power in doing so; however, readers looking for insight and analysis of this theme, or even details of exactly what Perkins supposedly did, will be left disappointed.Perkins describes how he was lured into this profession through escalating contacts with an array of shadowy figures who trained him in unspecified acts of economic sabotage and dispatched him to various points on the globe to carry out his work. But for someone who claims to have played a key role in winning contracts for American corporations and undermining revolutionary movements around the world, he is able to provide very few specifics of what he did or exactly who it helped and how. Perkins is well read in history of U.S. foreign policy and its interventions around the world, and he offers some useful commentary on the role of corporate power in influencing foreign policy, but this is described only in the most abstract terms. Throughout the book, I kept expecting to reach the point where Perkins names the names, connects the dots and unleashes a treasure trove of classified documents, internal memos, or anything else that might give his story some credibility and illuminate the issues he has described. But this ostensibly tell-all book actually tells readers very little about the specifics of the international economy, and the role that people such as Perkins allegedly play.Perkins also offers a starry-eyed romanticization of indigenous peoples around the world, contrasting their connection to nature with the ethic of consumption that drives our exploitative foreign policy. While the over-all point is well taken, Perkins' amateur attempts at anthropology actually come off as contemptuous, presenting indigenous cultures as the \\"noble savage\\" figure that went out of style in real anthropological scholarship nearly a century ago. He also tries to present himself as the stereotypical rugged traveler who went off the beaten path and mingled with the natives, seeing the country \\"as it really is\\", but the narrative here is clich&eacute;d and lacking in insight, the writing artless and vapid. His contrast is superficial, and he provides no real solutions to global economic inequality or even a sufficiently wel argued explanation of it.The book is a quick read, and it does give attention to an important subject and offers a different perspective on U.S. foreign policy than we often hear. However, I read this book hoping for some detailed analysis and analytical insight. Instead, the book is nave and self-important, and its conspiratorial, detail-averse presentation offers little for anyone seriously interested in the subject. There are many extremely well-researched and highly analytical works addressing the subject of this book, and I would advise readers to turn to those instead."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The number of detracors of Perkins' work on this site only confirms its authenticity.

I would recomend this book to everyone, and especially to those who need an economical and political awakening."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins tells a sordid tale of the U.S. deliberately ensnaring struggling countries with economic \\"aid.\\" On the one hand, it seems highly implausible - especially with the World Bank forgiving so many loans that bog down struggling nations. On the other hand, his story certainly fits other facts and is far less Machiavellian than our having intervened or or encouraged the overthrow of Allende in Chile, Noriega in Panama, Mossadegh and the first Shah in Iran, Diem in South Vietnam, Chavez in Venezuela, Castro in Cuba, Arlenz in Guatamala, Hussein in Iraq, and the Iran-Contra affair.The basic rationale of an economic hit man (EHM) is to provide favors that help bring about very large, unjustifiable loans for building instrastructure (eg. electricity generation), with the condition that U.S. companies must be used. Upon default, the U.S. then extracts control over U.N. votes, installation of military bases in the defaulting nation, and access to its resources (especially oil).Perkins also alleges that most citizens in the debtor country benefit little - eg. Ecudador (one of his \\"clients\\") went from 50% poverty in 1970 to 70%, under- or unemployment from 15% to 70%, and public debt from $240 million to $16 billion. Meanwhile a few get rich from the benefit to their businesses, and strongly support the U.S. Specifically, for every $100 in oil taken out of Ecuador, only about $3 goes to help its citizens. Other examples include (from \\"Over a Barrel\\"):a)Nigeria - $350 billion in oil revenues from '65-'00, while those living on less than $1/day rose from 36% to 70% and a civil war killing almost 1 million raged; b)Venezuela - poverty almost doubled since '70, while 80% of national income went to business owners and between '88 and '98 those living below the poverline with 12 years' education rose from 2.4% to 18.5%.In a subsequent chapter Perkins claims to have worked on a secret Saudi Arabia deal. Supposedly they would step in if others threatened to cut off oil, and promised to buy U.S. government securities with its petrodollars. The U.S., in turn, promised military security for the Saudis and to spend the interest on those securities for U.S. companies to modernize Saudi Arabia. (Why Perkins - a private company consultant - would know all this escapes me.)My best guess is that \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" probably containes more truth than fiction"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you want to read a book that glorifies tin pot dictators and excuses terrorism this is the book for you.

If Perkins's ambition is to expose these important truths about the machinations of a global corporate stronghold whose presence is increasingly difficult to deny--and I see little reason to doubt the sincerity of this particular mission--then what does it matter if he profits from it or not?Everyone needs to make a buck. If not every line of Perkins's tale is true--and it's fairly obvious that Perkins does embellish a bit in this occasionally implausible tale that endeavors too often to elicit the reader's pity for the author himself--we are all, to some degree, guilty of doing the same. How many of us find ourselves having to embellish our experience or achievements in job interviews in the hope that it will bring us the money we need to feed ourselves and our families, for instance? C'mon, let's get real.The assertion that Perkins may be doing the same is both unverifiable and irrelevant to the message he delivers in this book--so much so, in fact, that it really defies logic to mention it, no less to make it the dominant theme of criticism against him. Some take this speculative criticism so far as to imagine that Perkins is a \\"professional liar\\" who sought riches by consulting with some sort of council of marketing strategists on perfecting a message that millions of leftists would happily consume, but what distinguishes this from the \\"conspiracy theories\\" so commonly and derisively associated with \\"the left\\"?It is terrifying to me to understand that the central focus of Perkins's book is inarguably true--specifically, that debt is used as a weapon of mass destruction around the world by a global corporate tyranny piloted by the World Bank--and if Perkins profits while inspiring ill-informed citizens to learn and perhaps try to ACT on that new knowledge, who really cares?So many important critical voices in our culture have profited from disseminating the same kind of urgent warnings and messages--the many best-sellers of Noam Chomsky, Chalmers Johnson, Michael Parenti and Ralph Nader come to mind--and the fact that they are able to feed themselves while doing so hardly tarnishes their credibility, and suggestions to that effect serve, at best, as shining examples of non-sequitur logic. Frankly, the fact that someone is able to make a buck on a book that so damningly condemns the very country in which it was written and published restores some of my dwindling faith in our first amendment rights as Americans in the 21st century."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Let's face it; unless you've had your head in the sand for a long time, Perkins is not revealing anything earth-shattering in his book. In fact, the level of significance he assigns to his role as a so called economic hit man borders on megalomania, and sorely ignores a myriad of other historical, political and psychosocial factors that have contributed to the current state of affairs. One may even accuse Perkins the environmentalist of trying to advance his agenda under the disguise of seeking atonement for his actions as Perkins the economic hit man. After all, here is a man who made a career of pretending to be one thing but doing another. He does not even put on the table a coherent strategy as to how one can remedy all the wrongdoings of people like him.On the other hand, the hit man's confessions are a sobering reminder that each and every one of us is, indeed, a servant of the \\"corporatocracy,\\" and a guilty participant in pillaging our planet's resources. Perkins is not the best writer around, but for a self-professed career liar, his cry for the disenfranchised as well as his love for our planet and its diverse inhabitants and ecosystems come through as surprisingly genuine. In that regard, the economic hit man is a moral compass and should be considered absolved of his past sins. All and all, the hit man is a hit in my book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Although Mr. Hit Man manages to shed light on some slimy, regretable and ultimately destructive forces which I am sure exist in this world (how else could we be in this mess?), the book suffers from several severe flaws, some stylistic, some more serious.Despite the information you gain from these pages, you simply cannot get away from the idea that Mr. Perkins' best friend is a gilded, ornate, yet portable mirror, one that he can whip out at the slightest bruise of his super-sized ego. In fact, he spends so much time patting himself on the back, (this non-flagalatory activity gets even more serious when he decides to \\"quit\\") that it really distracts from the points he was trying to make. Perhaps it was a lazy editor, perhaps the book already underwent a massive rewrite (horrors!), or perhaps, with an ego like his, it was impossible to sit him down and have him make changes.That being said, there are some good material and explanations contained here, and it certainly raises the issue of who truly controls the global economy. It is a pity that the flaws in the book take away from the story he obviously is equiped to tell."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It took a lot of guts for John Perkins to write this book, and while his soul-searching seems a bit maudlin and hollow at times, he is definitely concerned and apologetic about the profession he used to be in, and in which many otherwise conscientious Americans continue to be involved. Perkins was an analyst in the complex that he calls the Corporatocracy, in which American-based corporations spread economic imperialism into the developing world under the guise of aid, development, and security. The basic strategy is to convince leaders of third world nations to accept loans from the World Bank or other U.S.-controlled institutions, in amounts far beyond what they need and which their nations could never pay back. American taxpayers' money then flows temporarily into these nations to pay American corporations, like the ubiquitous multinationals Bechtel or Halliburton, to build energy and transportation infrastructure. The money hence goes straight into the pockets of these elite American companies, while the developing nations are ensnared in crushing levels of debt. Their inability to pay back the loans gives the U.S. justification to build military bases, appropriate land for the securing of energy supplies, fight wars against indigenous peoples, and even assassinate leaders who refuse to cave in to the American economic imperialism (Perkins personally knew the presidents of Panama and Ecuador who suffered that fate in the early 1980s).Perkins describes examples of these insidious practices in several different nations in which he had a hand in creating them, as a member of an influential international consulting firm, and ruefully looks back at the economic and social ruination that has resulted everywhere this system has been imposed. He also convincingly displays how this is not a conspiracy, but an inherent tendency in the American social and economic system, and that American-backed corporatism is becoming the most widespread political philosophy in the world, making all other economic systems (even traditional capitalism) obsolete. Next time you hear words like freedom, democracy, and development being used to justify American actions overseas (including current military efforts), think again. American money and lives are being expended to make corporations richer, and to make everyone else poorer and less secure.

It must pretend that its exploitation of the weak is in their own best interest, or their own fault, or the result of ineluctable processes beyond human control, or a consequence of the spread of civilization, or in accordance with scientific laws - anything but deliberate aggression by a hyperpower.\\"Enter John Perkins. Perkins has done a wonderful service to humanity by presenting the subject of U.S. economic imperialism in a way that maybe, just maybe, even Jerry Falwell will be able to comprehend it. Perkins is a self-confessed economic hit man. He and others like him, using the tools of fraudulent financial reports, rigged elections, payoffs, extortions, sex, and murder, have cheated third world countries out of trillions of dollars by funneling money from the World Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and other foreign \\"aid\\" organizations into the coffers of huge corporations and the pockets of a few wealthy families who control the planet's resources. Perkins felt bad about what he was doing but he also enjoyed his yacht.What are the results of these shenanigans? Third world debt is more than $2.5 trillion and the cost of servicing it is $375 billion per year. That's more than all third world countries spend on health and education and twenty times more than third world countries receive annually in foreign aid. Along with the 3000 people who died on 9/11 at the hands of terrorists, another 24,000 died from hunger and related causes, just as they do every single day.Perkins said he once had a dream in which Jesus appeared before him. He was not the traditional Jesus but had curly black hair and a dark complexion. He bent down to pick something up which Perkins assumed was a cross, but instead it was a car axle that He hefted over His shoulder. The wheel rim protruded over His head like a metallic halo and grease dripped like blood down His forehead. And Jesus said, \\"If I were to come today you would see me differently because the world has changed.\\"Recently I was watching the electronic device in my home as it transmitted the images that my masters hope will keep me ignorant and marginalized. I saw the image of a man claiming that the legalization of abortion has lead to the worst genocide in history; 45 million innocents have been ripped from their mother's womb. According to my sources this information is inaccurate. The European colonization of the Western Hemisphere lead to a \\"population decline... probably on the order of from a hundred million people to about five million.\\" Both genocides are ongoing but only one is deemed useful by our masters for image transmission. Information concerning the other will have to be gleaned from books like Perkin's. One can be used to mobilize the peasants behind their masters. Knowledge of the other could lead to a peasant revolt. Or is all the rhetoric about Christian morality merely a sham while in reality we are a nation whose philosophy more closely resembles that of Nietzsche?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It's also a very readable, first person account of Perkin's experiences as an economic forecaster, and ultimately as Chief Economist, at Chas. T. Main, Inc. during the 1970s. It's worth emphasizing that Perkins is not and never was an actual economist, despite being head of that division of Main, a large engineering and consulting firm-- he admits this up front-- so you won't find much economic theory here. Nor is Perkin's an historian in the broader sense, so you won't find detailed analyses of history in this book either.What you will find is a first person account of one man's awakening to the rise of international collusion between the U.S. government, greedy national and multinational corporations, and corrupt despots in the developing world-- a scheme in which \\"foreign aid\\" was cycled through developing nations to the coffers of U.S. corporations, enriching a few corrupt and powerful individuals at the same time, but selling entire nations into indentured servitude to international investment bankers at the same time. Perkins provides an \\"alternate history\\" of many of the events of the latter half of the twentieth century, and one that illuminates the seemy underside of greedy capitalism and imperial politics in the waning years of the cold war. Moreover, he names names-- many of the top executives of the corporations participating in this scheme cycled in and out of the White House and executive branch of the U.S. government, further enriching themselves and their cronies. This is a story of modern robber barons loose in the world with the financial resouces of the U.S. Treasury and the strong-arm muscle of the U.S. military behind them.I've given this book 5 stars because it is an important book, and because it is highly readable. Others have criticised Perkin's style-- yes, he dwells at some length on his own moral vacillation, and his first person narrative sometimes sounds a bit amateurish. \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" is not great literature. Nonetheless, it is enjoyable and readable, and it will scald the scales from your eyes about the nature of empire, and greed, during the last 50 years or so."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The truth is hard to swallow. Be ready to get most of what you have been taught about this country chopped to shreds. I've read more non-fiction these past two years than in the last fifteen and after throwing this one onto the pile, I've got a new opinion about who the real terrorists of this planet are. One fantastic read."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is an autbiography that details the career of John Perkins who worked as an economist for an engineering company that facilitates world bank and imf loans to third world countries to do infrastructure improvements to those nations. The work includes, but is not limited to, building roads, bridges, electric grids, and dams. The work of course is performed by Mr. Perkins' company or the company of the economic hit man that lands the deal. When these nations default on the loans, natural resources are exploited to recuperate the loss. The corporation that Perkins worked for (MAIN) did a lot of the same type of work that Halliburton does now. Of course the third world nations are not naive to this system. They have been manipulating it for years at the peril of their nations poorest and the benefit of the wealthiest and the politicians that serve corporate interest in many poor nations.The book is eye opening because very few books expose this system from a first hand understanding of it. The book has a self-reflective tone and is as the title implies, a confessional. The book could be longer and provide more information. It puts many questions to rest concerning how poor countries never seem to climb out of poverty despite a plethora of natural resources. This is the case in Ecuador, Colombia, and Indonesia and many other nations. The story could be a great starting point for a movie.A good book, and a greater story. I highly recommend it for its subject matter and insiders view of how US corporations do business in the world."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins speaks from first hand knowledge of participating in orchestrated State Crimes Against Democracy throughout South America and the world. The truth drips from the pages written by this man who has broken free of the bondage of fear and greed, in which he was trained to trust in opposition to his concience. The other reviewer (to date) is obviously a disinformationist who has no clue what really happens in the world and who would obviously much prefer you just reinsert your head into the sand with him than wake up to the unfortunate reality all around us. Do yourself a favor and read all of John Perkins books, 'Confessions of an Economic Hitman', 'Secret History of an American Empire' and 'Hoodwinked'. If you do so you'll be in closer touch with reality than Mr Nohr would have you believe. While you're at it pick up a copy of Smedley D. Butler's book, 'War is a Racket'. See how one of the U.S. Marine Corps' most honored General Officers relates his own dissillusionment with the U.S. government's global strongarming of foriegn states for control of their resources and how he broke up a corporatist, plutocratic revolt in the 1930's."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"While Perkins writes about a dark reality of our economy and that of the overall Global Economy, I was frustrated with his multiple battles with his own conscience (usually as he lays on a Caribbean beach) only to get back into the system that has hurt so many. He sheds light on the evils of the IMF and World Bank, but it's hypocrital in that he got his \\"golden parachute\\" before exposing the system."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"In a brief 200-page memoir, John Perkins broadcasts his mea culpa for 20 years as a down & dirty footsoldier of American Empire in places like Ecuador, Panama, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia. Despite the overly melodramatic style, Perkins somehow manages to read like a spy novel, with chapter-after-chapter of international intrigue and cloak & dagger business deals. How 'bout some personal anecdotes to complement all your Nixon tapes and declassified dirt on Kissinger? One thing's for sure, read this book and you'll need a shower.Problem is, Perkins is so over-the-top he's tough to believe. His seemingly-bold claims about CIA assasination plots or predatory international lending schemes are pretty simplistic and verifiable through other sources, but it's the ludicrous details that sink him. For instance, there's the reconstructed dialog from age-old conversations that comes off campier than Star Wars. \\"I am training you to become an Economic Hit Man,\\" says the mysterious Claudine, \\"but you must never use that phrase outside this room.\\" Of course the author gave in to the dark side -- but was it a difficult decision for our Mr. Perkins? Indeed -- the author's deliberations begin \\"Whether 'tis nobler of the mind...\\" (or somthing pretty close anyway).Perkins isn't even satisfied just being the David Brock of Cold War-era US foreign policy. In between divulging the skinny on secret Saudi money-laundering and classified Panama Canal negotiations, he can't resist every opportunity for self-glorification couched in woe-is-me language. Usually this takes the form of (i) anecdotes about the author's personal wealth (subtle as the typical popular rap song); (ii) grief-stricken, Freudian pontifications on why exactly Perkins just had to get all A's in school and perform so magnificently in just about everything he ever attempted; (iii) and (a lot of these) gratuitous romantic escapades. Thank god for editors, or we might even have wound up with graphic love scenes. Seriously -- Perkins devotes an entire chapter to his own resume, as blatant a gag-me-with-a-spoon time as you'll ever find in print.Juvenile as it is, somehow this one is still worth reading just for the juicy details on some standard public evil. Too bad Perkins had to let his ego get in the way of a perfectly good book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am so glad I read this book. While it has been critized for relying largely on the testimony of the author, John Perkins' book fits squarely into a lineage of books that are beginning to reveal the United States' plans for \\"global empire.\\" Like Chomsky, Perkins reveals the actions behind the double-speak and PR-sanitized language that occludes the economic domination that is really going on in the form of \\"aid,\\" \\"development,\\" etc.In the 1970s and 80s when Perkins was doing most of his \\"hit man\\" work, the ability for splicing words and meaning was not as sophisticated as it is today, but it still existed. To see the evolution of campaigns for \\"global empire\\" from shadowy, hush-hush work to \\"hiding in plain sight\\" activities routinely carried out by \\"development agencies,\\" \\"reconstruction missions,\\" or even \\"fighting for democracy,\\" is nothing short of fascinating.Having read this book, I feel much more able to read between the lines of most geopolitical events. Perkins also does a good job of connecting the dots between long-standing oligarchic relations (the Bush Family and the House of Saud) and shows how favorable contracts go to those already in the know. Even the appointment of Wolfowitz to president of the World Bank is covered.This book is highly relevant and timely and will give the reader a new perspective on US activities in Iraq, Afghanistan, and likely soon against Venezuela, Iran, and other nations that have rich resources we want."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This exposes globalization for what it is - a system set up to backrupt and steal the resources of third world counties. It been going on for hundreds of years - it continues to this day."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am suspicious of reviews that try to undermine this book. Mr. Perkins has enclosed a typed copy of his resume (on a typewriter) from that era with all the companies listed that he worked for then. There is little doubt that these confessions are the truth. In fact he probably left out a lot of the more sinister details that could endanger him and his family.John Perkins is a whistle-blower and an American patriot for coming clean on the hidden evil system unknown to most.A shocking revelation into who the real terror organization is."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is just a commentary on the reviews I'm seeing here.

I mean - what exactly do you THINK the World Bank and IMF DO??"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Thank you for talking John.Turn off your desperate housewives, and American idol long enough to see what is really going on in our world.Wake up people!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I read this work when it first came out. I was none much impressed at that time and set it aside, forgetting it and never discussing it with friends.Then last week, I'm watching the press conference with Prime Minister Blair and President Bush. I had to check my ears when I heard that they were agreeing/proposing to forgive tens of billions of dollars in Third World debt, mostly at the expense of the US and Britain. And then, over the weekend, the G8 has formalized this proposal to relieve something like $40B now for countries throughout Africa and South America, and plans to extend the forgiveness to most countries indebted to the IMF and World Bank, while they are also discussing $50B in annual aid (FREE MONEY) to Africa.The entire premise of Mr. Perkin's incredulous book is that the US, and these Western financial institutions, are only interested in the enslavement and domination of these nations through onerous debt. What, pray tell, are they doing forgiving debt if their only motives are evil and greedy and corrupt?????????Perkins has just been FACT checked by REAL people and REAL events, and busted for being the bogus, bad fiction-writer that he is. He should write an apology to the American people, to his publisher and to the IMF, World Bank and every other person and institution he slanders in pursuit of his own fortunes.I would continue my review into the play by play of the book itself, but it's all right here above. Perkins demonizes the IMF, the World Bank, and America's every intention in foreign policy for decades. And lo' and behold, the main theme of oppression via debt burdens is something so crucial to American objectives that it's all wiped clean in a matter of days.Hmm . . . makes you wonder . . . A LOT! I can't wait for his next book - \\"How John Perkins Exposed and Toppled the Third World Debt Scheme.\\" No doubt, he's already claiming responsibility."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The negative reviews have covered the reasons why this book fails. First, Perkins is no economist. His 'hit man' work had nothing to do with economics; it had to do with his own personal greed and ambition. Second, he happily allowed himself to be seduced by Claudine, money, perks, and exotic locales. Third, he had no scruples. Bad enough that he knew little practical economics, he was more than happy to make up numbers to please his bosses and maintain his lifestyle. He knew what he was doing was wrong almost from the start. Fourth, even hit man who confess deserve to be punished. It is hard to simply say \\"I'm sorry\\" and ask to be considered a whistleblower.The overall feel of the book is some sick parody of economic aid efforts or, worse, a tragic version of Austin Powers, Man of Mystery. If the results were not so sad, one could almost laugh."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I was very excited to pick up this book based on some other reviews and its continued presence in the NY Times business bestseller list. The \\"sales pitch\\" of the book obviously sounds promising, and like nearly any project involving more than two people, foreign aid is certainly not always 100% altruistic and this book promised to blow the doors off its true motives.If you don't know that foreign aid often contains a large level of quid pro quo (I give you aid if you buy some stuff from me), save your money on this book and get a subscription to a major newspaper. If you are shocked by this, look at every government project from a local stadium that is supposed to foster \\"job creation\\" to corporations that buy from each other informally or contractually. This is not a conspiracy and has been done since the beginning of time. The author inflates this to epic proportions, that only the \\"evil government/black helicopter\\" crowd could love and believe.The book is also reeks with the authors ego. He constantly compares himself to Thomas Paine, has visions of Jesus, and is smarter than any other economist at the UN, World Bank or person he encounters. He also makes it clear he is smarter than you, the poor, naive reader, who will never \\"see what I've seen\\" and just needs to trust what he is saying, since he is eminently smarter than you are. He frequently refers to his experience in \\"business school\\" (really just a BS from Boston University earned after flunking out of Middlebury), and his abilities to change countries with a snap of his fingers. 80% of the book is almost as enjoyable as listening to vapid celebrities tell Larry King how wonderful they are for hours on end. You are also forced to listen to his drivel on socialism, the evils of the corporation, and how all the terrors of the modern era are the fault of corporations and republicans, and he predicted the Gulf Wars (with no help from hindsight at all).I don't doubt the author actually thinks he could affect the fate of nations. As a consultant myself, I have met many others in this profession with overinflated self-importance that share this illness. The mysterious Claudette (it is conveniently impossible to verify her existence) likely was more likely someone he picked up in a bar than a NSA operative, and much of his commentary is likely based on what he saw through his self-importance clouded glasses.Save your money and get a subscription to the WSJ if you want to find out how the \\"evil\\" corporatocracy really works, unless you really want to spend $24.99 to have someone else do your thinking, and explain their conclusions as if you were a halfwit.This book gets two stars only due to the semi-interesting plotline burried beneath the other drivel."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"You won't know whether to laugh or cry after reading this. I agree people get shafted and displaced because of progress and natural reasources but I thought this read more like a gullible conspiracy through the eyes of a arrogant elitist with a socialist agenda than a history of American economic policy. I believe in the system and the goodness of American values that aids poor nations. How can nations rise out of poverty without help? I myself enjoy hot and clean water, and electricity. I would not feel hopeful if I had to bathe my children in a stream when someone upstream is deficating in it. He's making the case for regression. Take oil away and the world collapses in chaos, death, disease and destruction.There's little mention of other players on the global economic scene and motives behind anti-American propaganda prevalent in many of the countries he writes about. Basicaly his twisted vision of America is our corporations enslave the world and we are selfish and greedy. All other nation leaders are either our pawns or not our pawns. The world isn't fair, but to place so much blame for the worlds problems on the USA is shortsighted. I think this book is shallow and I describe it as a work of fiction."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I have not yet read this book. I logged on to read the reviews prior to purchasing it. I was struck by the fact that the negative reviews were like listening to Rush Limbaugh.

For politics that so well comport with my own, I have never been so put off by someone who might seem a kindred. The arguments and accounts put forward by Perkins are incredible or, incredulous.

The book is just kind of repulsive. Jesus appears before him?Perkins is just another greedy consultant tied in with world financing institutions. His retrospective does not reconcile with the historical facts or conventional realities.

His company wouldentice oil-rich countries, such as Ecuador andIndonesia, to \\"go modern\\" with huge capitalloans (for dams, infrastructure, oil wells etc.)but these were either stolen by corrupt officialsor were not planned realistically enough to beginto pay off the debt, so the hit man would say\\"Ok, you can't pay off the huge debt with dollars,give us oil (or other resources) instead.\\" Sosupposedly the US company would leave thempoor while it drained off its resources.The scenario may have some truth in it,but I don't see us draining off huge third worldresources for repayment of private debt.If so, why do we have so much private debtourselves ?

Typical of an unethical consultant. And I don't know anything about C. Mann, his employer, so it is possible that they were making inflated projections to get contracts.But trying to make this a vast conspiracy to impoverish poor countries to get them in our grasp is ridulous. It is in the US interest to have poor countries succeed, and become trading partners and customers. During the cold war, we were competing with Communism, and we wanted to make small poor countries more affluent.If there was this vast conspiracy, who was part of it? The Presidents (Nixon, Ford, Carter, Regan) during Hitmans tour of duty? All of the 635 people in Congress, or just some of them? USAID? the World Bank? Was the Inspector General and the Attorney General in on the conspiracy? Way too many people - someone would have spilled the beans.By Perkins admission and of his own free will, he was an economic hit man, lying about projects and getting poor countries to borrow money for projects that were no good and would not work. He essentially took our tax payer money, money out of our pockets, and took it out of the pockets of poor people from poor countries.After 911, he sees the light, feels regret for his missdeeds, andexposes the treachery of him and the evil World Bank / US for all to see. But I would feel better about him if he was repaying us and or the poor countries and people he cheated with the proceeds from his book.His depiction of the mysterious Claudine is ridiculous. Anyone who believes that should send me $100 in cash, and I will send you the title to the Brooklyn Bridge.The amazing thing to me is all the people who believe his fantasy.

I would not be surprised if they also riddle this authors body with bullets. You can tell them apart in that they give the review 1 star and say his book is boring. This book was written so that the average person can read it and understand it. Lets not talk about the style of writing, lets talk about the concept: America or the US is dirty. A reviewer said that this revelation to Perkins came from on high , much as Gabriel dictated the Qu'ran to the prophet Mohammed. How come we never ask where the revelatations came from to Matthew Mark Luke and John?There comes a time in ones life where he or she chooses a side. There is the side of good and the side of evil. You can stay in the middle for some time, but eventually you will have to make a decision. The evil acts coming out of this country's government would make Hitler and the Nazi's blush. Jews are not being burned in ovens, but countrys are being invaded, bombed, and robbed of their resources and people abroad are being worked over by the US like slaves in plantations. Ive seen pictures of an Iraqi boy who lost both his arms and was badly burned in Iraq and was taken to the US for treatment.That was very nice of the US, but there are thousands of other boys who have lost their arms and legs directly from US bombs and you will never see or hear about them. This is an example of the devil in uniform. There is absolutely no shame and no integrity anymore by the people who are in charge of our country. Americans are viewing the world from a dirty lens.

He said it was his daughter who finally pushed him to write it, and look, he's not dead! Sure, these events happened over 20 years ago, but according to Perkins, that doesn't matter; these people don't forget.Nonetheless, he habitually tries to portray that he was enslaved by this secret racketeering society. It almost seems like he wants to blame the organizations he was apart of for his wrong-doing."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"A first-hand look at the methods the American corporates and government use to rule over a big part of the world."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"After hearing this book mentioned and quoted in many other books and articles I have read, I figured I would give this book a read.

The book felt more like a way the author could purge himself of his past sins than writing an informative book about the \\"Economic Hitman's\\" role in changing the history of the world over the past 30-40 years.

At least here they are paying for something they need.As to whether the U.S. is justified in imposing his rule of government on other countries, it is certainly abusive and often counter-productive but should our planet remains backward with two-third in poverty and one third without access to potable water?I'd like to hear from the critics how they would proceed to obtain that loans be made to countries that cannot pay for them?The real problem is not there.

It gives a first hand account of how the top level of the establishment uses our government to destabalize other governments for power and profit.

Regardless of that it seemed to explore issues worth discussing no matter what side of the political spectrum you are on. It is a worthy and entertaining read and if nothing else gives some sources for other reads on the topic of globalization.As for those concered about wasting your money so much on the read, which seemed to be a recurring theme of those who did not enjoy the book, try stopping by the library. You can try the book for free and if you don't like it return it for then next person to use."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins had a job writing economic projections for a firm that sought contracts from the governments of developing countries to build electrical transmission systems. His employer used his projections to support their claim to potential customers that installing those systems would pay off in increased economic growth. Mr. Perkins claims that his projections were in fact part of a deliberate attempt to foist debt on foreign country, force them to recycle borrowed money through the U.S. economy, and ultimately leave them bankrupt and thus beholden to U.S. policy goals that the lender could dictate.Maybe there was a global conspiracy to use loans to the Third World to influence their policies, but Perkins, at the least, overstates his role and his employer's role. He talks about his position as a pencil-jockey as if he was the ultimate power broker, and strongly implies that his company was hand-in-glove with shadowy types from CIA and the NSA. The obvious truth is that his role was much more minor than he makes out, no matter how much he tells us about meetings with Graham Greene and Omar Torrijos. If his role was to provide convenient projections to support construction projects, there must have been much more influential \\"economic hitmen\\" on the office floors above his, deciding which projects to pitch and which countries to approach. And more powerful still would be the people with the money to fund the projects. That is, if the engineering firm that put the systems on the ground played an active role in the alleged conspiracy at all, it was a bit part.The flaws in Confessions of an Economic Hit Man seem to go deeper than overstatement, though. Mr. Perkins never explains why it would benefit the U.S. to make huge uncollectible loans, nor how influence could be exerted on defaulting foreign debtors. To take a real-world example, recall that when Argentina defaulted on its loans fifteen years ago, the last Bush Administration was not celebrating. Defaulting governmental debtors are unpredictable and therefore scary to their creditors.Worse than the gaps in logic, however, the credibility of the whole scenario is damaged by an unbroken sequence of made-for-the-big-screen moments. In a typcial scene, our hero is whisked from his ritzy hotel room by left-wing Indonesians to see a subversive puppet show in which the upcoming death of an Indonesian leader is eerily foreshadowed. Every episode fits neatly and cinematically into the moral message Mr. Perkins is trying to transmit. I sympathize with much of what he has to say, but the book feels more like a moral fable than a recounting of actual events."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I picked up \\"Confessions\\" at the airport and was drawn in by the summary on the back cover. I was hoping to find the smoking gun, details of decades of global conspiracy. I ended up finding a self-serving, empty confession with absolutely no detail whatsoever.Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the book is the fact that chapters 1-3 are captivating and compelling; the remaining chapters are a total let down. We learn of Perkins' Bond-esque recruitment into the world of the EHM, climaxing at the moment when Claudine, the mysterious trainer, tells him that once he is in, he will never be let out. The fact that the book is for sale completely destroys that entire premise. If Perkins and Chas T. Main truly did commit grand fraud around the world, bilking Ecaudor, Saudia Arabia, and others out of billions, then why is he a free man, busy writing self-help books? Why haven't, the Jackals (as the book calls the CIA thugs that enforce the will of the state) taken him out as he claimed they did to Torrijos?Perkins is arrogant in claiming that he was one of the most influential con artists in post-WW2 world economics, yet he gives not one detail of what he did. No smoking gun, no named names, no facsimiled documents proving this tremendous fraud. Just 20+ chapters of self promotion.The worst example of vagueness was the chapter about Enron and George W. Bush. The chapter is nearly six full pages. However, Enron is first mentioned in the middle of the 3rd page and Bush is not mentioned until the end of the 5th page. And, in none of the 6 pages of the chapter does Perkins do anything more than say that it looked like Enron was a bad company. Wow, what a revelation!I am a strong conservative, Republican, and a major supporter of American dominance. However, I am also open minded to the cold, hard, naked truth about the sometimes shady way that we assert our dominance. I love a good liberal conspiracy theory. I love a good Bush-bashing. \\"Confessions\\" provides none of this. What a waste (...)"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"first of all, im glad i didnt pay for this book and rented it at the library instead. it was a good read, but not worth the money. the book was well written and presented some insights into current issues that i wasnt aware of. he painted a good picture of how america was trying to maximize power and control over the world's poor countries. i didnt believe the whole economic hit man thing at all. it seemed that he was the only person in the world using that term and that becomes clear later when he says he didnt even tell his employees they were EHMs. he kept mentioning that he was recruited by the NSA, even tho he only took one test and never started working for them. this guy is trying to sound like some super spy, even tho he clearly is not. all he was is another corporate jerk that pushes debt onto others. it just makes perfect sense that you would try to sell someone as much as possible (happens all the time everywhere in the world). this guy was just fudged on the stats a bit in order to get bigger loans from the World Bank (which uses your taxpayer money) so that big corps like haliburton can get bigger contracts. nothing new. another thing that really pissed me off was that he kept on referring to Tom Paine and other patriots, kinda trying to make himself sound like one for telling us his story of being an EHM. Mr. Perkins, please never again try to compare yourself to these guys. As the story went on he quit at his company and wasnt an EHM anymore, rather he was a consultant (with 3 times the salary). the reason he quit his job was because he felt like a crook. so why continue consulting for the same industry. he spend about 20 years consulting after he quit his job, before he actually sat down to write this book, but meanwhile he goes on and on about ethics for about 100 pages (half the book). I almost puked when i read the last chapter, which was sort of a guideline for regular folks to get away from this corporatocracy. its a good read, lots of current (post 1950) event woven together nicely. dont get me wrong, this book was entertaining and easy to read, but this guy was clearly no confessing, he was bragging! he included a whole chapter about his resume that made no sense at all. i didnt get the point. borrow this book somewhere and read it. dont buy it, this guy doesnt deserve your money (he stole to much of it already)."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am so enraged that I got snared by this misleading piece of garbage, I just wish I could get my $15 back.

The people here that seem so enamored with this claptrap seem to be working for this man's PR department. I'm very glad to see not everybody is so easily seduced by this kind of nasty agenda.Tony Blair and George Bush, just yesterday, discussed forgiving all third world debt. Sort of blows one huge hole in this make-believe hit man's story about intentions to enslave LDC's. I guess their conspiracy now is to further oppress them by lifting their entire foreign debt burdens. Wait, that doesn't make sense. And, neither does this book from start to finish.I suggest all those interested in learning something valuable about globalization and US foreign and economic policy choose from any number of works by honest, subject-matter-experts, and stay far away from this self-professed shaman and his scary psychic abilities and encounters with Jesus. The story is not only impossible to believe, it lacks any real purpose other than to persuade you to despise everything about America past, present or future.It was very smart of Mr. Perkins to steer wide and clear of verifiable events.

Astonishingly bogus."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is an interesting book. Some of Perkins' conclusions in the last chapter, in which he sees cracks in the ability of the US to continue to finance continued economic dominance, are very insightful.The lessons he draws from his personal experience in the engineering and energy industries are also interesting and many of his conclusions are correct.Economic development based on public infrastructure has largely been a failure.Especially in countries where wealth is based on natural resources, this type of development has generally increased inequality and done little good for the bulk of the people.The forecasts on which these projects were justified have often proven in retrospect to be wildly optimistic, of course, because those who made them had an interest in their wild optimism.The development banks who fund the infrastucture projects share in the wishful thinking because their business models require large loans with interest income even if principal is not repaid, and large infrastructure leads to large loans.The US government, and to be accurate the Republican Reagan-Bush 1-Bush 2 administrations, essentially represent these corporate interests, and their willingness to use foreign and military policy to further them is increasingly open.He is correct that this is one of the reasons (among many unrelated ones), that our government is so hated around the world and our ability to accomplish foreign policy goals is becoming so limited.He is wrong, however, that economic development and globalization always, or even in most cases, lead to increasing inequality, environmental degradation or loss of freedom. In fact, the opposite is true. (He is also wrong that privatization has been negative.)He is also wrong that the aid, economic development and development banking institutions are on the whole slaves to the corporatocracy. The conventional wisdom in these fields has moved past basic infrastructure to projects aimed at development of local enterprises, reforming policies, education, promoting internet access and fueling innovation.He is also wrong that the solution is not within our system. In fact, it is. We need to better finance our own education system, really encourage research in alternatives to oil (an industry that could really really create jobs in the US), take far-reaching measures to purge corporate money from our politics, and retake the lead in the international organizations we helped create.I also found the tone of Mr. Perkins book a bit off-putting. Although he says there is no conspiracy, he clearly thinks there is - clandestine EHM training sessions, well-timed bribes and threats, great fear in telling his tale.I am not sure if this is self-serving or genuinely felt.

It reads like a novel or a suspense thriller. However, the focus on the Enron like economics and money going to the large developers sounds a little trite and like whining.To lend money to foriegn countries is nothing new. In fact, if you remember the 80s, many of these countries defaulted on loans because they could not pay them back. For the US to use monies to build infrastructure for poor countries, which actually used the money to build infrastructure made and makes actual sense. It used the best technology in the world to help poor countries build a basic framework in which an economy could prosper.We tend to have selective amnesia or simply are too focused on 'reality TV' and sports to remember how many leaders in countries wanted our money so they could do what they wanted with it, you know, pocket it.America was made all the richer by lending monies to Europe after WWII, Western Europe is prospering today because it lends money to foriegn countries with the expectation, in writing, that those funds would be used to buy products made by the EU.It would be interesting to track Perkin's history to see just how true it is."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"To All:Do not buy this book.

I don't want to exaggerate, but it is simply horrible. Totally contrived. Overtly bogus politics and a completely misleading message. This author is not credible. His book is fictional. It does not take much of a logical mind to figure this out--it's all too obvious. He is, therefore, lying to all of us.Also, something is very wrong here at Amazon.com. The average rating shows 3 1/2 stars. But, I found it very curious that the first several PAGES of the most helpful reviews are almost all ONE star, and mostly one or two stars for several pages after that. So, because apparently I have too much time on my hands and being a mathematician, I tallied the number of votes and their star ratings. This book is actually rated closer to 2 stars here by reviewers. Also, a plurality, near majority, of reviewers completely deride this work, and do not find it to be in any way on any level worthy of suggestion or praise or description as \\"spell-binding,\\" but rather, almost unanimously say, and eloquently so, that Perkins is an egomaniacal, self-diagnosed, hallucinating would-be messiah. His book is roundly panned by all informed parties here and by book critics nationally.Do not be fooled by the publishing company's staff and their PR people who obviously deposited many a bogus review at this site. And, don't be fooled by the re-visiting champions like Phyllis who question the ratio of real names to \\"pen names\\" among 1 star versus 5 star reviewers. The ratio is almost exactly the same for both. And, don't be fooled when the author himself comes here to review the book under his alias \\"Ronaldo Christ.\\" What is obvious is this: after the author's bogus PR campaign and get out the vote efforts to build book sales, the reading public stepped in and offered them a heavy dose of reality. The only way this book will not permanantly slip to 2 stars or less - officially - is if their lackeys don't come back and fluff up the reviews. That, or if Amazon has some algorithm problems that artificially keep the rating higher than the reviewers tallies reveal.Either way, do the math for yourself and think for yourself.

Often that year the question \\"Why do they hate us?\\" re-emerged. I wish Confessions of an Economic Hit Man had already been published; it would have been on our reading list.This book has galloped onto NY Times and Amazon bestseller lists, mostly on word-of-mouth from people like me who will tell you that everyone should read this book. If you share my interest in the wisdom of indigenous cultures, you may have read Perkins's previous books about his journeys to learn the shamanic practices of tribes in the Amazon and Andes. In those books, he briefly mentions a past as a management consultant or UN advisor. In Confessions he comes clean; he worked for a high-powered consulting firm where his job as Chief Economist was to insure that the firm produced economic projections so optimistic that multilateral agencies could lend huge, unjustified amounts to developing countries, thereby gaining their political loyalty to the US while funneling the dollars back to US companies (like the ones with contracts for the rebuilding of Iraq). He, like those he worked for, was conscious of this agenda.All Perkins's books, including Confessions, tell tales so incredible he takes pains to note: \\"The events described in this book actually happened.\\" Perkins is incredibly clearheaded and fair in his reportage. My advice: Read it. Digest it. Then, reread the Epilogue and decide what you are going to do about it. I'm starting with my own Confessions, as Perkins suggests (look for them under \\"Personal Reflections\\" at http://execukos.typepad.com and feel free to post your own post-Confessions confessions there).

First, I was to justify huge international loans (from the World Bank and the IMF) that would funnel money back to MAIN (Chas. T. Main, Inc.) and other U.S. companies (such as Bechtel, Halliburton, Stone & Webster, and Brown and Root) through massive engineering and construction projects.Second, I would work to bankrupt the countries that received these loans (after they had paid MAIN and the other U.S. contractors, of course) so that they would present easy targets when we needed favors, including military bases, UN votes, or access to oil and other natural resources.\\"Perkins discusses three steps to make sure this happens: 1-Economic Hit Men, like himself, would convince leaders of third world countries to take out these loans enriching themselves and MAIN and leaving the poor in these countries forever poor; (One country where they were successful was Saudi Arabia) 2- They send in the \\"Jackals\\" to instigate a coup or to assassinate an unresponsive leader (Allende in Chile, Mossadegh Iran in the '50s, Torrijos in Panama, Roldos in Ecuador, and unsuccessful, as of now, in Venezuela), and 3-Send in the Marines (Iraq, Vietnam, etc.).This is a painful story of a man who knew he was doing wrong, but it took him more than 10 years to break with the company. The rewards of money, power and sex kept him going.(...)Perkins could not get his first publisher to put out this book unless he wrote it as fiction. Likewise, he said on Amy Goodman's \\"Democracy Now!\\" that he can not get mass media outlets to interview him unless he states that the book is fiction. Then he stated that he could understand why people would think his book is fiction, but, he said, I lived it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Right off the bat I didn't like this book that I was hoping to enjoy.

When he made the statement that we invaded Afghanistan and Iraq because our EHM's and Jackals failed in those countries I just wanted to put the book down, it's just false information.

So naturally the average customer review is pretty much in the middle.For myself, I felt that it worked well as a personal confessional, and that at its core is a very simple message, or a very simple question, if you will: What are the consequences of our actions? Our individual and collective way of life here in the United States has a number of repercussions both locally and globally; Perkins offers a window into some of those consequences. The gas we pump into our cars comes from somewhere; where? What price did others pay to give it to us? How can any of us be certain that crimes were not committed somewhere along the way?Reviewers like D. Mackenzie miss the point. This book has a broad aim: to illustrate, in fairly basic terms, the violence that the author has witnessed and committed in the name of empire, and thus to demonstrate his complicity in the cycle of violence around the world -- and further, to suggest that his is not an isolated case, and that the complicity stretches further than a single misguided individual.Perkins does not, in the end, believe in conspiracies. He states this clearly: \\"It would be great if we could just blame it all on a conspiracy, but we cannot. The empire depends on the efficacy of big banks, corporations, and governments -- the corporatocracy -- but it is not a conspiracy. This corporatocracy is ourselves -- we make it happen.\\"He offers relatively few answers, too, as the solutions are difficult: \\"How do you rise up against a system that appears to provide you with your home and car, food and clothes, electricity and health care -- even when you know that the system also creates a world where twenty-four thousand people starve to death each day and millions more hate you, or at least hate the policies made by representatives you elected?\\"This book is important and helpful as a starting point to deeper explorations of many of these issues. Others may criticize the writing style, or specific conclusions, or (this was the strangest) the veracity of his account of Javanese puppet shows, but I believe these overlook the primary issue of crimes committed by our government and corporations -- and ourselves -- in the name of progress."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Whether one finds this book believable or not, Confessions reveals the modern method of colonialism which most people I know thought had disappeared with the British and European Empires by the end of the 1950's. According to Mr. Perkins it survives through the imposition of unpayable debt on resource rich undeveloped countries. The prominent tactic for accomplishing this is to force countries to agree to overpriced construction projects whose financing could not possibly be payed off from the project's resulting economic benefits. The methods of force used are deceit,thuggery, and corruption of political leaders. He describes how he was personally involved in this and also claims that it is an unspoken policy of the US Government.While many of the anecdotes are sketchy, lacking not only documentation but also thorough detail, I kept in mind that this man was repentent and writes this book as a passionate confession not as a scholarly tract. For me, this made him believable. He reminded me of Robert De Niro in the movie, Mission.And I took the trouble to check some of his claims about oil company shenanigans in Ecuador and found them corroborated.Most important for me though, whether or not eveything in this book is literally true or verifiable, was that this thesis about enforced debt for the control of key resources and to award US corporations the landfall profits of overpriced construction projects - gave me a plausible explanation for many historical events and for the first time, a way to see through the thin official rationalizations I have heard in my life - which I kinda knew didn't really hold water but I couldn't refute them. Like why did we invade Panama? Did you really think we bombed Panama City to get one drug dealer(who was on the CIA payroll)?Mr. Perkins claims, taken as a working hypothesis, provide me with a framework for questioning current policies as well as post-war history.Taken by itself though this book can not be viewed as sufficiently informative. One needs more. But it is a start.I wish everybody would read it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"September 11 dramatically altered many people's perspectives on life and the world around us. The horrific events which occurred on that beautiful mid-September morning in 2001 changed John Perkins, author of \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man.\\" Mr. Perkins, a highly respected economist, had once worked as chief economist at Chas. T. Main, an international consulting firm in Boston. Even though he worked for a private corporation, he was sent abroad under government contracts to convince leaders of developing countries, places of strategic importance to the US, such as Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Panama, Ecuador, etc., to accept enormous \\"loans\\" from the United States. The money would then be used to pay American companies to build local infrastructure and other projects. So while American corporations were profiting from these \\"loans,\\" the countries were sinking into overwhelming debt. The poorest people, who benefited least from these projects, were the ones stuck with the responsibility for payment. These countries usually became US puppet regimes, open to American corporate manipulation. If a leader refused to play the game, the consequences could be lethal. This is blatant economic blackmail - where your best buddy turns out to be the vindictive loan shark.Perkins resigned from the job about 20 years ago, because morally and ethically, he felt it was \\"wrong to play such a key role in creating an international empire at the expense of the poor and less advantaged around the world.\\"The author was paid extremely well to be an \\"economic hit man,\\" as he describes the position. He worked alongside the heads of the IMF, World Bank, and other notable global financial institutions. Perkins began writing a book shortly after he resigned, with the working title, \\"Conscience of an Economic Hit Men.\\" He wanted to dedicate the book to Jaime Rold&oacute;s Aguilera, former president of Ecuador, and Omar Torrijos Herrera, former president of Panama. He had enormous respect for both men, held them in high esteem, and thought of the two as \\"kindred spirits.\\" Unfortunately, Roldos and Torrijos had both been his clients. They both died in fiery plane crashes. According to Perkins, their deaths were not accidental. They were assassinated, targets of the CIA, because they opposed the goals of corporate, government, and banking leaders, which were, and are, to build and maintain a global empire. The CIA has long assisted American corporations to remain dominant in foreign markets, by overthrowing governments hostile to unregulated capitalism.In the early 1970s, the Royal House of Saud agreed to send most of their petro-dollars back to the United States and invest them in U.S. government securities. The Treasury Department used the interest from these securities to hire U.S. companies to develop Saudi Arabian infrastructure, and the House of Saud agreed to maintain the price of oil at reasonable limits. In return, the US would use its resources to keep the House of Saud in power.After attempting to implement something similar to the Saudi policy in Iraq, and failing, US industry, in concert with government, wanted to depose Saddam Hussein. Saddam did not play ball. When the \\"economic hit men\\" were not able to convince the infamous dictator to cooperate, CIA \\"jackals\\" went in to foment revolution or a coup. It was not so easy, however, to overthrow or kill Saddam. His bodyguards were too good and he used doubles. Perkins draws the conclusion, based on his experience, knowledge and hard facts, that the present Iraqi war was our next step. He cites the billions of dollars in US government contracts awarded to US corporations, like the Bechtel Group Inc., and Halliburton Company's subsidiary Kellog Brown & Root.The author was persuaded and even bribed to refrain from writing this book about his professional experiences. And, although he began to write on various occasions over the intervening years, he did stop. World events, such as the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1980, the first Gulf War, Somalia, and the rise of Osama bin Laden, convinced him to put his manuscript aside, again and again. Perkins stated in a recent interview with Pacifica Network's Democracy Now program, \\"When 9/11 struck, I had a change of heart.\\" He concluded the interview by saying, \\"I believe the World Bank and these other institutions can be turned around....We can change that.\\"Perkins' tale is a gripping one and the international and political intrigue involved gives the non-fiction book the feel of a suspense thriller. The narrative is very well written and fast-paced. I am only a reviewer reporting about what I read. I didn't write the book - just the review. If you are unhappy with the author, or his point of view, please don't blame me, the messenger. I do highly recommend \\"Confessions Of An Economic Hit Man.\\" Whether you like Mr. Perkins or not, he has some very valuable information and insights to share. One cannot help but benefit.JANA"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"One man's wake-up call to the evils of empire, and a must-read book. Minimize the sometimes soap-operish overtones, or the occasional tropes that make it feel like the first draft of a Hollywood screenplay. Minimize too, a lifetime of soul-searching that appears to have advanced little beyond New Age totems and an idealized version of the Founding Fathers. Instead concentrate on the volumes an inside man reveals about the workings of modern day empire. Debt-trap literature has been around for years, but now an insider confirms the tale and a sorry tale it is: The purposeful distortions, the inflated statistics, the systematic prostitution of professionals, the gilt-edged sewer. This is a pipeline of money whose only object is to fatten those who live off the trough at the same time entire countries are indentured into a hopeless future. Think about what's really behind the super slick p-r images that bombard us daily, or the way Rush Limbaugh and Co. divert attention from corporate America. Thanks Mr. Perkins for the gutsy expose' , and the next time someone complains about Third World conditions, or Washington's largesse, refer them to this, the real story they'll never see on the 6 o'clock news."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This was a fascinating read, if only because I disagree with much of what the author says.The bulk of the book is Mr. Perkins' retelling of his days as the Chief Economist of a major international consulting firm, during which he inflated his projections in order to justify larger infrastructure projects and therefore larger loans to less developed countries. He claims this was part of a well-orchestrated plan by the US government to achieve political control of these countries since they could never repay these loans. He also feels tremendous guilt for his role and laments having kept millions of people poor.I have lived in Central America for 11 years: ten years in Guatemala and one year in Nicaragua. I have witnessed first-hand the positive changes that have taken place in Guatemala over the last 20 years; the people are better off now than they ever have been, although there is still a long way to go. I also see first-hand how desperate the situation in Nicaragua is and change has just barely begun here. I believe the kind of change that Mr. Perkins and I both hope to see takes two or three or more generations to accomplish; perhaps his vision is too short-sighted. For him to expect significant change is just ten years is nothing more than wishful thinking.Mr. Perkins' story leaves a number of questions in my mind. First and foremost, if less developed countries are not to accept loans and other aid from developed countries in order to avoid becoming beholden to them, how are they supposed to develop? His argument smacks of Fidel Castro in Cuba and the current leaders of Venezuela and Bolivia and - particularly close to my heart - Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua, all of whom propose to isolate their economies and grow only from within, a plan which dooms the poor, if you look at history. Nowhere in his book does Mr. Perkins propose an alternative plan for development.Mr. Perkins' treatment of the subject is very one-sided. What about other countries' loans and aid to less developed countries, and what about debt forgiveness? Those are not even touched on in this book. What about the Cold War and the US' desire to keep less developed countries loyal to American interests, instead of selling out to the Soviets? That is mentioned only very briefly. What about the value to the global population of the oil in Iraq and the canal in Panama? Perhaps those pieces of real estate are special cases and are simply too valuable - to everyone on the planet, in terms of global economic stability - to risk letting them fall into the wrong hands, which is very possible if governed by a young and unstable democracy left to its own devices. Finally his selection of aggregate global statistics to show that poverty has gotten worse, not better, since these large US aid programs began is misleading. The statistics are probably inaccurate and based more on political motivations than hard data, just as he manipulated the numbers in his own work; I saw this in my days at the World Bank some years ago. I believe that to really answer the question of whether or not people are better off one needs to look at each country individually and to look beyond simple sums of income and concentrations of wealth.Perhaps Mr. Perkins has contributed more to the world and done more to help its poor than he realizes. Perhaps he could feel proud of his work instead of ashamed and guilt-ridden. Many of the projects he worked on - indeed, many of all international aid projects - may be far less than perfect, but they are a start, and surely some of them will come to fruition in the fullness of time. Unfortunately neither of us will live long enough to see the results."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Mr. Perkin's book is worth reading. I'm not sure how much of it is true - it is hard to back up all these stories when many of the characters are now dead. But it tells a story that it so compelling and lines up with so many facts that it is hard to ignore.Perkins travels to Ecuador, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Panama and more exotic locales, all as an economic \\"hit man\\", which is really an economist/businessman trying to sell his product. His observations and experiences are quite unique and offer an inside look at what is really going on. At the very least, this book will make you appreciate international news and modern history a little more. It also helped me to understand why the US doesn't have a very good reputation abroad.It is a quick read - 225 pages, and while the story kind of jumps around a lot, it does keep you hooked and will cause you to ask a few questions about US foreign policy. Well worth your time."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"First of all, I am always suspicious of tell-all books that coincide with current political issues, so I wonder about the author's motivations - is he really coming clean, or grinding an axe?That said, I found the book an easy read, especially for someone who has been keeping up on current events. The author makes some pretty serious claims that, if substantiated by independent sources, could prove newsworthy.Specifically, the author's main story is one of conspiracy and intrigue that reach to the top levels of both government and industry. He claims to have been a loan agent whose task was to mortgage the future of third world nations in order to make them more pliable to US interests. Yes, pretty spectacular stuff - if true.Time will tell..."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I read this book based on the recommendation of a co-worker. I was very disappointed.This guy was part of this supposed corrupt system for years and years. He fed the beast he claims and every time he thought about quitting, he went back and did it again. Why? Did he need to make a house payment. Did the motor on his yacht go on the fritz.I got tired of his \\"looking back I feel bad about all the things I did but I kept doing it\\" dialogue.If you did it and you knew it was wrong, then you should have stopped doing it. This constant back and forth really damaged his credibility and made me think... was it really as bad as he said it was.... probably not.I'm quite sure the U.S. government does some underhanded things, but I also doubt it is on the level that this man claims. And, I doubt that it goes on today because if it did our press would be all over it and they usually are by the way.It screamed of political agenda the entire way through.I hate to say it but you need some sort of corruption to make the world go round or nothing will get done. We all know it and it happens, but it also keeps folks employed around the world.You may feel sorry for the person in India that is making a $150 dollars a month, but when you remember that person is probably now living a much better life because of the infrastructure improvements that resulted from our intervention. And, when you figure that individual pays 10 cents not $1.50 for a hamburger at McDonalds, life isn't that bad for that individual compared to what it once was.I get tired of having to apologize in the U.S. for our prosperity. Maybe it is the capitalist, democratic system we use and the fact we've been using it so successfully.Should we feel bad about that Cpt. Communist? I don't.The world is improving and the U.S. does more to help than hurt and I think this guy is way off in insulting the system that he openly participated in for so many year."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I found this book to be utterly disappointing. As many have written before me, it wasn't credulous, it lacked any real insight, and it got progressively more boring as it went on.Having said that, I'm not surprised that it is a bestseller. People who have a hard time discerning truth and fantasy, particularly economically challenged people looking to back up anti-capitalistic sentiments with \\"reason\\" rather than just emotion, will enjoy the read, however spurious the reason."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Now that this book brings to light the final sordid details of America's drive to global domination, it can be stated what the chief players, such as Mr. Perkins himself, must do to atone for their colossal sins. Beginning with the Subaru Outback mentioned on page xvi., and proceeding through the yacht on page 147, and the proceeds from sale of Main stock on page 165, and the \\"spectacular retainer\\" from Stone and Webster Engineering Corp. on page 171, and the \\"lucrative deal\\" causing obscene windfall profits from the sale of Independent Power Systems on page 185, and all retirement plans and benefit packages from Main, and finally, all royalties and speaking fees stemming from this fabulous Amazon bestseller----all must be liquidated and put into a fund that will provide the indigenous people of Ecuador with solar panels, lifetime subscriptions to Mother Jones, Kerry bumperstickers, yachts, free Middlebury tuition, and unlimited blow dart replacements.Consider yourself lucky, John, that your atonement does not include prison time. It should, considering you knew about and did nothing to prevent, and in fact substantially abetted, the following:1) Rape of the Amazon rain forest (p. 124)2) Iranian revolution and hostage crisis (p.118)3) Assassination of Omar Torrijos by the CIA (pp. 158-61)4) The rise of Osama bin Laden (p. 81-98)You can no longer conceal these crimes from the world, John, for they found their way into your book. Your professions of guilt and self-loathing are not enough. For full atonement on #1 above, you must go to the cacique of the Quechua and wash his feet with your tears, then dry them with your hair. Repeat this process on several Shiite mullahs for #2. For # 3, go to the north bank of the Panama Canal and shoot a live webcast with you proclaiming the names of those responsible (we know you know, for you are an insider of long standing). And for #4, you must of course, find Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice, as you have brought to justice by your courageous outspokenness George Schultz, Caspar Weinberger, and all the others in the Bechtel cabal.Do these things, John, and the world will be lenient. Neglect to do them, and the world will know you as something akin to OJ Simpson vowing to find the murderer of his wife--not so much an economic hit man as an egomaniac blowhard."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Try doing a little research around alot of the events he talks about and you will find that what he says is true.

I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I read the reviews here and assumed that a right-leaning bias was informing most of the reviews of the book. They seemed too harsh to be fair and I dismissed them as coming from the flag-waving \\"America Does No Wrong\\" demagogues.Let's forget the topic and just address the writing. It's sophmoric- almost embarrassing- to the point I was saying, \\"I can't believe his editor allowed this.\\"The emotional confessions are so one-dimensional it reminds me of a third-grader writing, \\"I am happy. Today is good for me and my dog.\\"I'm not going to comment on the reliability of the content. Fact is, none of us know for certain so it's all speculation. But the style is awful. I couldn't finish the book.Skip this, even if you're a radical-leaning, capitalism-hating anarchist. Read something better, as recommended by other reviews."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I enjoyed the story and learned some interesting stuff about American capitalism in the 70's and economics in general. Makes some sense that the USA would loan a poor country money to help them build their infrastructure. Seems helpful and neighborly. And, I suppose if someone owes you money, they will be nice to you in return. Economics, right? So, whats the problem? The author stretches this logic into a sinister and diabolical conspiracy where govt and big business operate hand-in-hand to force countries into debt to make them do our will. All at the expense of the poor. Fascinating anecdotes give the book the feel of an inside scoop; such as his trip through Indonesian slums, visits to Panamanian dance bars with the locals and schmoozing with high-level govt officials from different countries. Truly engrossing stuff. I found this to be an easy read, but the narrative is based on the authors negative attitudes toward big business and does not have enough facts to be a true expose on American imperialism in the twenty first century. The book succeeds as an entertaining diary (I don't doubt that many of these experiences actually happened) based on the personal insights of a young man early in his career as an economist for a large, international engineering company."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is a slow and painful read.

Not give him a million (which would still be paltry considering...).What? were they going to pay him $100,000 per year and after a while that would \\"make him\\" a millionaire. This guy was a mid-level manager at best. From there he constructs his grand delusion. Only people who already believe the the U.S. is the cause of all evil in this world (college students, professors and incomprehensibly naive adults) could actually think this book represents reality. If in fact we are enslaving the world to us through debt, then we are enslaving ourselves to the Chinese. Think people think."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions is poorly conceived, poorly expressed, and poorly lived. My strong recommendation is that you do not waste your time with this political diatribe.If you must, pay attention to the dialogue and ask yourself if you, or any reasonable person, can believe any of it all. Pay attention to the author's inability to offer even the slightest of details that lend to his credibility. Pay attention to the lack of balance between his conspiracy theories and other, much more practical, if ignoble, motivations and explanations of profiteering and political real-politick. Ask yourself if there is something greatly delivered here or whether this author is full of himself, naive, a bit untrustworthy, and using his past misdeeds as an excuse to point a wagging finger at invisible forces all to profit at your expense at the bookstore.Globalization, hunger, poverty, debt--all of these topics are very serious matters. Trusting your opinion to this source will prove unproductive. Keep you ear out for formal announcements from the G8's upcoming meeting, where they will forgive most, if not all, third world debt. Perkin's conspiracy of third world domination just collapsed in the face of current, actual, factual news."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I just finished reading this tremendous book and I am a little shaken-Perkins has set out a vision of how the world works that is staggering, even for somebody like me who looks under the carpet of contemporary events. I have made it my business over these past years to attempt to come to grips with the world we live in and most importantly to try to see how the world picture is put together-how does the world work; what makes it work; who is pulling the strings of this planet at the turn of the third millenniun.As opposed to previous commentators I take all that Perkins has written at face value. I don't think he is a mad conspiricist; I don't think he is an embittered man who is raging because of missed promotions; I don't think his story is fiction and I don't think that he was low on the totem pole of power and really had no clear picture of all that was taking place. All of these accusations against his book have been cited as reasons for discounting what Perkins writes and I believe those conclusions are ludicrous.I virtually used up a marker underlining passages from this powerful book. Perkins admits early on page 15 that his job was to convince developing countries that they could afford the massive debt burden needed to buy the infrastructure for their economic expansion. I could never understand why developing countries put themselves into such massive debt-debt so large that they could never pay it off. Countries are not stupid-they would not do something so heinious to their people's future. Now I see why it happened-Economic Hit Men [EHM] like Perkins cooked the books. They were trusted to provide accurate economic forcasts for those countrie's future expansion and the Empire then ensnared them because of this false data. These countries will never pay off this monstrous debt. As perkins points out-they are not supposed to pay it off because that indebtedness is what binds them to the Empire.Perkins writes about those leaders who have recognised the ploy and refused to play the Empire's game: Arbenez in Guatemala, Mossadegh in Iran, Allende in Chile and Torrijos in Panama. As Perkins writes, if the EHM can't pursuade you, then the Jackels move in to eliminate you and if that fails then invasion happens. The pattern is all too obvious in our contemporary world.If you read no other book for the remainder of your life, read this one. Every person alive deserves to know what is happening."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hit ManJohn Perkins \\"writes and teaches about achieving peace and prosperity by expanding out personal awareness and transforming out institutions\\". He uses the phrase \\"economic hit man\\" to describe his work as a confidence man in arranging loans that can never be repaid. Loan Shark? He says the presidents of Ecuador and Panama were deliberately killed in separate plane crashes, not by accident (p.ix). The events of 9-11-2001 caused him to publish a book he had been writing for years. Corporations, banks, and governments use their financial and political powers to spread their ideas and culture (p.xiii); but this is not a conspiracy, he says. Perkins says we must all help to change these policies.The 'Prologue' explains how the scam of \\"foreign aid\\" works. Money is loaned to a foreign country. Most of it is given to Big Corporations in America. When this money can't be repaid, the debtor is forced to make policy changes to further benefit the global empire (p.xvii) by exploiting the country's people and natural resources (p.xviii). These modern conquistadors are disguised to look like normal people (p.xx). If they fail, men of action (\\"jackals\\") are brought in to overthrow or kill the leaders. As a last resort the US military is sent in (p.xxi), as in Afghanistan and Iraq. If all else fails, US taxpayers will be tapped for the funds. This book gathered various topics and news to present a tutorial on imperialist exploitation that is very readable and educational.Part I tells of his youth, education, and early career. Perkins took courses on economic statistics, and learned that statistics could be manipulated to reach the desired conclusions (p.13). A country could be manipulated in a similar manner (pp.18-19). Perkins uses the word \\"corporatocracy\\" to refer to the corporate ruling class (p.26). [Not \\"corporatism\\"?] Part II tells of his job in Indonesia; he visited a puppet show (pp.43-44). Did Arnold Toynbee predict today's conflicts (p.45)? [Who did he work for?] Perkins summarizes Panama's history (pp.58-60); it has a wide-open banking system (p.63). OPEC was formed in response to the power of the oil refining companies (p.76), and their attempts to keep prices down (by shifting costs to producers). Perkins notes examples of the military-industrial complex (p.79). The high prices for post-1973 oil ended up in the pockets of Big Corporations (p.89). Did Reagan and Bush support Osama Bin Ladin (p.97)?Part III notes how he used applied mathematics to create the desired results (p.102). Perkins supported the transfer of the Panama Canal, and tells how he benefited (p.104). Perkins went to Colombia to create massive developments and debt to exploit its gas and oil (p.122). The sweatshop factories in poor countries only increase their poverty (p.128)! Do some missionary groups work for oil companies (p.142) and swindle natives out of oil-rich lands? The firing of a superior led to Perkins resignation (pp.146-150). Part IV tells how he traveled and wrote. Then he rejoined his company for a higher wage. PURPA created laws that allowed utility companies to buy up smaller companies (p.168), and municipal water systems (p.169). Why was there an unprovoked assault on Panama (p.175)? Why was Noriega a prisoner of war (p.177)? Is globalisation the equivalent of the slave trade (pp.180-181)? After 9-11-2001, and the events in Venezuela, Perkins started writing again (p.198). Ecuador was looted and impoverished (p.203). Chapter 35 has his comments on the War on Iraq. If you bomb a country and then rebuild it, the biased \\"sciences\\" of econometrics and statistics will show great economic growth (p.216)! Perkins finished and published this book, comparing it to the warnings of Paul Revere's ride (p.218).

In this well-told story Perkins reveals the inner workings of a new imperialism and illustrates how corporations, the U.S. government, and the World Bank and IMF combine to chain less developed countries to the world economy in such a way as to guarantee their governments' compliance with the industrialized countries whose laissez-faire visions of economics drove and shaped 19th-and 20th-century European empires. Indeed, the portrait of the coporatocratic empire jibes perfectly with the history of the modern empires of the previous two centuries . . . its crafters' vision extended by military might, political will, and technological advances in mobility and communications. The United States has inherited the imperial mantle. But, where 19th-century imperial powers used military might and gunboat diplomacy to ensure their hegemony in their colonies, the U.S. uses economic hit men to extend its control over less developed countries through gargantuan loans made to their corrupt and/or nave leaders. Mr. Perkins was part of this system; and this confession, an insider's snapshot into the workings of the IMF, the World Bank, and modern imperialism, is his expos&eacute;.I very much enjoyed reading this book, it is a portrait well painted. Perkins's prose is clear and his story compelling. As a scholar of modern world history, this book connected many dots for me. True American patriots will heed the warning implicit in Mr. Perkins's book: if the United States is to become a model republic and a moral as well as economic leader in the world, then informed citizens must help to change the way we do business. Education is key to changing the future. In his closing, Perkins offers some suggestions on how to effect real, positive change.As a student, I learned much from \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man.\\" As a teacher, I will be using it as part of an imperialism class that I teach in high school. Kudos, Mr. Perkins, for your enlightenment and confession, may it have the positive impact you desire."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins is a self-confessed professional liar. He enjoyed a long and lucrative career doing little but producing cooked economic numbers to justify pillaging the resources of developing countries. Now he has a best-selling book that isn't worth the paper it's printed on. I guess he figures if you're going to be a con man, might as well be a successful one.I don't for a second buy any of the fake angst and bouts of conscience that he supposedly suffers along the way. If Mr. Perkins really hated what he was doing, a very simple solution was always available -- change jobs.I found the sections of the book particuluarly odious when he brags about his ability to become friendly with the 'locals', knowing full well the devastating effects that his bogus economic forecasts would produce for them and their offspring for generations.My recommendation -- don't be conned into buying this book. Get it from your local library, if you must."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins claims this to be a whistle blowing autobiography. If true, its content is explosive. He claims that in 1971, after Peace Corps work in Ecuador, he was recruited by the NSA to work undercover as an economist in a private firm of international engineering consultants (Chas T. Main Inc.) His recruiter/trainer \\"told me that there were two primary objectives of my work. First, I was to justify huge international loans that would funnel money back ..to US companies .. through massive engineering and construction projects. Second, I would work to bankrupt the countries that received those loans so that they would be forever beholden to their creditors..\\" He goes on to write about his involvement in the application of these deliberate policies to subjugate Indonesia, Panama, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Ecuador, etc. In Indonesia's case he details how he produced a plan to finance electrical infrastructure that would enable a 19% growth rate when he knew that realistically the requirement was for a maximum of 5%. The US printed the dollars, the US controlled, international financial agencies lent the money. The vast proportion of the money went to the Bechtels and Halliburtons. Some of the money greased the palms of the developing countries' ruling elites. The huge mass of the populations received no benefit. They remain mired in perpetual poverty (and corporate pollution) as their nations struggle to keep up with the interest payments. Where leaders could not be suborned, as in the case of Torrijos of Panama or Roldos in Ecuador, they were eliminated and replaced with leaders more amenable to American interests.It could be, and is argued by anti-globalisation campaigners, that this impoverishment of the developing world is a lamentable side-effect of American corporate \\"vigour.\\" It is however a quantum leap to make the argument that this massive, global, humanitarian disaster, (resulting in premature deaths over the decades on a far greater scale than those resultant from Stalin's policies) is the intentional outcome of a policy of economic empire being deliberately pursued by decision-maker factions within successive American administrations. The key question is whether or not the author is writing a true report of events he participated in. Though supported by ten pages of references, the book is written in a fairly lightweight, populist style. This choice of style will not give much comfort to academic readers. It could, though support the author's claim that he is writing to gain maximum public traction for his arguments for a change in US policy towards developing countries and the environment. Descriptions of the author's going through the culture barrier and losing confidence in the vision of \\"his country right or wrong,\\" ring true to a reader who once found himself in a mildly analogous situation. The facts quoted that lend themselves to relatively simple verification (such as the author meeting Graham Greene in Panama City - the dates check out) appear accurate.Perkins claims that the US invaded Iraq because Saddam refused to succumb to the same inducements successfully offered to the Saudi royal family for US control over their economy in return for protection. An indication of the possible truth or otherwise of Perkin's claims can be found in a reading of the commercial legislation passed by the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq and which in effect handed over the Iraqi economy to the American corporates, (Orders #12, #17, #39, #40 being particularly relevant.) These early pieces of legislation would indicate that the USA, on taking control of its new conquest, though not prepared for fighting an insurgency, was fully prepared for a take over of the Iraqi economy."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Guys, if you have time to just read one book, this is the one. If you read this book, I guarantee, you will be able to answer these questions:- Why we are at war with Iraq- Why people in other countries don't like us- Why we have and still do support dictators- Globalization- Our foreign policy- Why the problems inside our country are going to take much more effort to solve than simply voting for a candidate to be PresidentThis book is about a man who wanted to make money, feel prestige and travel all over the world. Him and his company purposely would make exaggerated economic forecasts to make poor countries indebted to us. Basically, once these countries signed onto our projects, they would have to keep paying us back and they wouldn't be able to spend that money on their own people so those people would get poorer and poorer. If we later needed favors from these countries or needed their military space, they would have to give it to us. The author says that there are many people like this in many American companies who hold prestigious titles but what they do is wrong. Of course, in our country if you make a lot of money, you are thought of as \\"successful\\", if you don't question the morals and ethics of companies and our countries dealings - you are rewarded.If you are not sure if you want to buy the book, you can read an excerpt at this website: www.bkconnection.com or go to www.johnperkins.org to find out about the author. Or you can read it from the library or the bookstore.Here are some important parts of the book:1. Did you ever wonder why we went to war with Vietnam? Why was communism so bad? - Because we can't do business in a country that has communism (unbelievable!!) (And if communism was so bad, why does China hold up our U.S. economy now? That is pretty hypocritical isn't it?)2. The highly popular, democratically elected Iranian President, Mohammad Mossadegh was overthrown by our CIA. The reason for this was that BP (British Petroleum) wanted to exploit Iran's oil and sought the help of the U.S. President Mossadegh would not allow the British and Americans to exploit Iran's oil and nationalized all of the oil. So an American CIA operative went into Iran and won over people through payoffs and threats - which in turn led to street riots and violent demonstrations that gave the impression that President Mossadegh was not popular. In the end Mossadegh went down. (Again, for all our talk of democracy, we certainly don't let it happen in other countries)3. In retaliation for U.S. aid to Israel, Saudi Arabia imposed an oil embargo on the U.S. The embargo did not last long but Wall Street, our government and corporations decided that never again would they tolerate an oil embargo. Immediately our government made Saudi Arabia an ally and offered all sorts of technical support, military training, etc. (Even though the women there can vote or drive and one person is (still) beheaded every week for a \\"crime\\" like drinking alcohol) Guys, Idi Amin, this brutal dictator from Uganda who ordered the killing of 200,000 civilians was exiled from Uganda in 1979 and he lived happily in Saudi Arabia until he died in 2003. The White House protested slightly but not too much because, hey, we don't want to make the Saudi monarch angry.How does this relate to Iraq? Well Saddam played our game throughout the 80s. So when he gassed the Kurds, Shiites and Iranians (with weapons we gave him) we didn't mind as long as he was generous with Iraq's oil. Then he crossed the line when he invaded Kuwait so we put sanctions on the people of his country. We tried to persuade him, hey just give us your oil and we'll leave you alone. But he didn't want to play our game anymore - so out he goes. Pretty scary, huh? If he shared his oil, he would still be in power.Finally, here's a good quote from the book:\\"Stop being so greedy and so selfish. Realize that there is more to the world than your big houses and fancy stores. People are starving and you worry about oil for your cars. Babies are dying of thirst and you search the fashion magazines for the latest styles. Nations like ours are drowning in poverty, but your people don't even hear our cries for help. You shut your ears to the voices of those who try to tell you these things. You label them radicals or Communists. You must open your hearts to the poor and downtrodden, instead of driving them further into poverty and servitude. There's not much time left. If you don't change, you're doomed.\\"After 9/11, if we really wanted to prevent another terrorist atrocity, here's what we should have done:1.Caught Bin Laden2.Created forms of mass transportation and reduced our dependency on oil as if our life depends on it - because it does.3. Given our foreign policy a massive overhaulAnd please, before you call people from developing countries \\"backwards\\", read this (this happened to me): I was in a developing country and this boy who was severely disabled and could barely walk was selling pencils for one rupee (a couple of pennies) each. I gave him some money but told him he doesn't have to give me the pencil. Then I went on my way. About a mile later when I stopped, the boy was running after me (or more like wobbling as fast as he could). He told me that he wasn't going to just take the money like that, and he gave me a pencil. This boy could barely walk and he was about 14 years old."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this book. I was looking forward to a description of how the World Bank, IMF and the 'aid industry' was collaborating to keep LDCs from actually realizing improvements in their systems.Instead, John Perkins gives us wild speculation and claims with absolutly no facts to back them up. He describes his first assignment in Indonesia, tells how he 'cooked the books' and then completly ignores any further discussion of the matter. As a reader I have no idea if his economic estimates:1) actually resulted in any loans, economic programs, etc.2) if his inflated projections ended up being right or wrong3) if (or how) internation institutions then used this situation to bend Indonesia to their willInstead, Perkins just tells us (over and over again) about his guilt.I do have to admit, I didn't finish reading this rubbish. I did skim the rest of the book hoping to actually find something of substance to substantiate his claims but couldn't find anything.The most frustrating thing about this book is that I believe the author's claims might be right. It's just very unfortunate that he didn't do anything to prove them.If you must, pick this up when it's in the dollar bin."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The only revelations in this book are of the author's inflated ego, absent moral compass, and simplistic view of global governance and decision making. In an attempt to justify his own professional misdeeds (which apparently brought him substantial personal wealth), he has written a book that places himself at the virtual centre of a global conspiracy. Unfortunately, Mr. Perkins makes no serious attempt to offer any substance to back his world view. Save your money and time."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of An Economic Hit Man is one insiders view of how the global empire has successfully created itself to keep the cycle of U.S. wealth, self serving. John Perkins has found the courage to share this dark past in hopes that it is not too late for us to change our dreams and re-shape with immediacy the future of this planet.Those who express disdain or lack of evidence of this greedy global game have clearly missed the point.John Perkins offers the reader an informative and enticing journey through the shifty ways of economic and political manipulation. Caught within the web himself, this book clearly calls attention to our individual responsibilities in our daily actions, no matter what we do or where we live.What I find so courageous about this book is John Perkins had clearly shape shifted himself away from the greedy world of EHMs into a life of helping indigenous peoples in the world: specifically the Shuar of the Amazon. In unveiling these hidden dark truths, he is now fully owning his past actions. It is with this level of accountability that we are able to create new openings for global transformation. Read his other books. You may understand what he speaks of in a different depth.This book is about changing our dreams. It is a wake up call to change our intentions.

The truth as is expected is very disturbing.

If you want to know why so many other countries hate us, this book explains why. We all need to look at the power and global reach of large US corporations and decide if we want their style of business to effect our future and to represent Americans. US businesses need to get back in touch with a moral compass and let integrity guide their every move. We need to start with politicians who are often \\"big business\\" themselves or in bed with large corporations and make sure , in the future, that they represent all Americans, not just the rich and powerful ones.

It is a real page turner."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Looking back upon the books that I've read over the past year this one was the single most memorable. Perkins is a corporate salesperson working for the government. He describes his relationship with foreign leaders with brutal honesty - perhaps because of a sort of endearment Perkins has with the information world - his only true conviction. Perkins compares himself to foreign leaders and sees these lack of convictions. He describes the hesitation he has in writing the book - how many times he started writing and quit - and finally published the book over the objections of friends.While Perkins is no hero, he is indeed a writer with fleeting fortitude and a conscience that won't sleep. In this book he finally does it. For those who choose to think for themselves Confessions offers more than politics and heroism. Instead, Confessions is an introspective illustration of how a man grows to be the imperfect cog in the machine."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Good book, tells it the way it is, and might help some people wake up.Similar to the matrix analogy where humans are used for batteries, the electrons in a circuit board, it shows the architecture of this said board resulting in control and power.For those who have read the book, you can now compare the methods with what is going on with the economic situation in the United States. Large budget deficit, Large current account deficit, easy credit... All the same lures and hooks used and described in this book. Good luck finding out where its coming from. But if you're rich and have plenty of time on your hands, why not try to take over the world...'May you live in interesting times'"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The author's expose of how the eastern establishment greedily manipulates third world peoples is brilliant. It helps one understand the appeal of demagogues like Venezuela's President Chavez.Unfortunately, in order to get the book published, the author had to strike a Faustian bargain with a left-wing publisher. All through the book someone has inserted anti-American private conversations making it appear that Perkins allegedly held with various third world leaders now conveniently deceased. Even if these talks, which all sound alike, really took place, no responsible author would include them, as they undermine the book's authenticity. It is like reading two different books, or reading a fine book with annoying margin notes penciled in by some student radicalized back in the 'seventies."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"OK, imagine reading this book about our nation's supposed wrongdoings across the globe, primarily hearing about misuse and abuse of debt vehicles to lesser developed countries as a means to entrap and enslave their leaders as American yes-men.

If so, just read this book and allow John Perkins to pull away the curtain that conceals how America pursues its global empire.

Want to know what's really going on in with the American presence in the Middle East? This is where to start. The Middle East is just the latest stop as America picks up where the British Empire fell apart and the Cold War ended. If you are an American, you'll have a choice: Embrace the feeling the citizens of Rome had when they were an empire. Or become an agent of change at your own risk. But by all means, don't stop your research with this book. Buy and read Robert Baer's \\"See no Evil\\" and \\"Sleeping With the Devil,\\" add Arkady Babchenko's \\"One Soldier's War,\\" then start reading Ahmed Rashid's quartet -- \\"Jihad,\\" \\"Taliban\\" (2nd Edition), \\"Descent Into Chaos,\\" and \\"Pakistan on the Brink.\\" Then the veil will have been lifted.

I believe he is telling the truth about his moral failings (which enabled him to help impoverish much of the third world) and that he has \`seen the light' and reformed (to do good for the downtrodden) now that it is too late to help the thousands who die each day of starvation and other preventable causes.Perhaps it is the writing style, which tries to make his story part spy/adventure yarn (favoring Sir Richard Burton - the explorer/linguist, not the actor) and part serious expose, which gives the book a Hollywood feel. Perhaps it is only me, angry at his every encounter with world leader, counter revolutionary, shadowy \`money man', former US Secretary of Defense, even Graham Green in a futile attempt to save one of his Central American reformers from CIA assassination.Most dismaying is Perkins' assertion that there are really no conspiracies at the root of all this criminal activity, only amoral ambitions operating in a \`criminal capitalist' but legal system set up at the end of World War II. It revolves around the World Bank, which claims to lend money to Third World countries in order to improve their standard of living. Actually, (Perkins was part of this process) the leaders of such nations are bribed, coerced, blackmailed, etc., into accepting huge \`loans' which are used to hire American companies to do the work of water, electricity, refuse and military projects. The money never actually goes to the people or economy. After a few years X nation finds itself unable to repay the \`debt' its rulers accumulated, so they are at the mercy of oil, mineral and other predators who rape X's natural resources without responsibility for clean up, medical care or even compensation for the population they hold in virtual slavery. Rulers who resist are overthrown in coups or die in all too coincidental (hardly concealed CA fingerprints) flaming plane crashes. If that does not succeed, then our military is called in ... Is that how we maintain our vaunted standard of living? Sadly, I believe it is so.Reluctantly, I do give this book five stars, if only to encourage readers to discover what a draft evader can (and did) accomplish for his country/empire while so many of us were \`playing dominoes' in Southeast Asia in the Sixties and early Seventies."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Reads as if the author is remorseful and his reflections are now skewed looking back."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"After reading this book I am confused as to why this person want us to believe that he was able to to fool so many people around the world.

Yes I wrote America so the people living in the USA will finally comprehend that America is a continent not a country, people please check your map!!! Well let me tell you why, is because the USA always interfere or sticks her big nose in the business of her American neighbors, just to name a few examples/ Guatemala 1954 and Chile 1973, and also a big part of the real problem is that the USA is not governed by the President, he or she is just a pawn or an employee of the big corporations, and the person in the Oval Office will do anything in his or her power to keep the big CEO's happy. You want proof of this? Think about these recent events, 9\\\\11, the wars on Iraq and Afghanistan, the tax payer's money given to big corporations to cover the losses caused by their satanic greed and Guantanamo. Also I'm tired of hearing that illegal immigration has ruined the USA, let me tell you that if you keep your nose to your own business and leave the rest of America alone, you won't have a big immigration problem and just to keep in mind that the USA was built by immigrant hands. Please the USA has enough problems, public education, public health, a failed economic system and social disintegration just to mention a few, for the United States' Government to start thinking about building a global empire. FYI I'm not a leftist or a USA hater, I like the USA and its people very much but I don't have affection for the neoconservatives and the capitalist pigs that think in big profits before their fellow human beings.

My question usually is, why did it take you so long to leave this life behind. This book starts by telling you that the money he got paid and the power he wielded was addictive, but he did break away. With that said, you will hate all that he did and you will ask, is this still going on? The real shock is not what he did, but that this whole scenario is still being played out today with a new, different Economic Hit Man.

We drive cars, but do we really know how we get the gas?A lot of these organizations/corporation operate in ways that are imaginable to you or me. Those who read/those who watch tv will never be exposed to this type of information because it is simple unimaginable.

Reads like a good \\"cloak-and-dagger\\" novel, but cast with real events and history... even economists can be spies.I can't speak to the facts that Perkins occurred behind closed doors, but a compelling story that seems to stick together, especially as it spins through Vietnam, Panama, Iran, Iraq, Columbia, Venezuela and those events surrounding 9/11.

These LCD's end up taking loans from the company the author works at. These loans are so large they are almost impossible to pay back making these countries indebted to the corporation, in turn the US government.This book, although slow, is filled with insite about the major corporations in the US deal with foreign policy issues, these issues mainly have to deal with economics, and money. Because they are practically cheating countries out of trillions of dollars this could eventually lead to war. This man's experiences as an economic hit man and his ways of dealing with increasing amount of poor people growing in the LCD because of him are very compelling and interesting and makes you think \\"Would I be able to do the same thing this man has?\\"The book shows how Perkins became an Economic hit man, and how he did his job in Panama, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia. It also explains his conscience and how he deals with the fact the he is ruining countries. I believe this book should have been named conscience of an economic hit man because, although he talks about what he does, I feel like the book revolves around him feeling awfully about his job and what he does.All in all this book is very revealing and almost mind blowing about how these corporations greed and lust for money, goes beyond human morals, putting money in front of people.

As an economic hit man, Perkin's job was to stabilize or destabilize leaders in foreign countries. At this point the book may seem only vaguely intriguing but when you throw in that often times these leaders aren't backed by the US for the good of the foreign country but instead chosen for the benefit of the US the story becomes more interesting. Often times U.S. economic loans and gifts to foreign leaders for infrastructure development were given knowing corrupt leaders sympathetic to us would benefit, our construction corporations would benefit, and it would cause hardship to the receiving country's poor people who would suffer under the debt load of their country. You get a thrilling, and informative page turner as political leaders start disappearing. I was skeptical regarding his change of heart and believe that this man who benefited by manipulating people for so many years is now seizing another opportunity to make another dishonest dollar. I still believe that this book is worth your time regardless of the author's true motives for writing it.In conclusion i found Economic Hitman to be a good book.

He says that he helped destroy countries and cultures by going into these countries and convincing them that they \\" needed\\" what the USA has to sell.

However, this book is less about the merits of policy and more about one man's struggle with conscience. He sees through the smoke and mirrors around his profession and must reconcile that he has been manipulated into contradicting the essence of his own values. A figurative pawn in the game, albeit a very effective one.One of the biggest ways people refute 'conspiracy theories' is to assume that the operations require too many people to all keep it a secret. This book shows that some of the really pivotal stuff gets accomplished by no more than a handful of very diligent, capable people."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"People often ask \\"why do they hate us?\\" Of course they're thinking about the widespread opinion of the United States which seems to dominate the scene. Reading this book simply shows how it's done, that is what we as a culture have captured from the old line empire builders and added our own special approach which avoids the appearance of empire, but makes sure we have established it. The technique is so elegant that it makes us feel superior, but really shows how evil we have become. The result is that we have essentally raped and pillaged the rest of the third world, making our lives so fruitful while insuring the slavery we have inflicted on a large part of the world. John Perkins documents his part in the process, realizes what he has done and how he has benefited, and now must expose theplot.

If he didn't want to swindle all these countries he would of found a way to help them rather than destroy them. I just can't believe the whole oil thing and how people are so gullible.

I have no doubt he believes what he writes and Americans will surely be reviewing with more than a passing glance the foreign policy decisions, past and present.I can appreciate this author's guilt by his role in \\"empire building\\" but he continually dedicates small portions of the books to self reflecting judgment and, more of less, implicates his upbringing, NSA profiling and a myriad of other BS excuses for why he continued to do what he did. Tell the story but please don't defend yourself to me."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is a significant book and I highly recommend it.

In addition, Perkins' narrative and literary talents make the book a super-exciting piece to read: once you pick it up, you almost can't put down. The nature of the assignments that the author was given during his career as an EHM, and the fact that these missions took place all over the world give his painful and sincere confessions at times the character of a thriller or an adventure novel in real life. As if this isn't enough, Perkins did not write an angry book, and never preaches. He concludes with suggestions in how we can all begin to make a difference, starting on a modest scale, and his inspiring conclusion has a profound impact on my current outlook."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I think everyone should read this book.Explains how American economic interests trump everything,and how \\"third-world\\" countries are forced into taking bad contractsagainst the well-being of most of the populace."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"In preparation of serving in Ecuador for the Peace Corps, I thought Confessions would be a wise choice of reading to inform me about Ecuador and economic development. Unfortunately, I have finished reading the book and am left with little but conspiracy theories with little substantiation. Everyone knows that western governments and banks have dumped decades of misguided policies on developing countries, especially when it comes to financing of large economic projects such as roads, energy extraction, and electrification, but on this subject Confessions showed remarkably dearth. For example, the author mentions how the Agoyan dam in Ecuador funnels money to wealthy families and has been the source of \\"untold suffering\\" for local people. Well, how was the dam financed and what were the economic forecasts pertaining to the construction of the dam? When the author goes to Indonesia, what were the projects that resulted from his economic forecasts, and how have they played out in the country? Shortly after this point, the details become even more brief, of course because the author was no longer working as an economic hitman. He may have insightful commentary about Noriega, Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, and Chavez, but little personal involvement in these affairs. It should be obvious that it is impossible to give a suffucient account of economic developments in countries as diverse as those mentioned in Confessions; Perkins is most familiar with Ecuador and the Amazon; why not focus his book on this area? The author does include fascinating anecdotes of his time in all of these countries, but Confessions is not found in the travel section of the bookstore.I am disappointed because thousands of college students and young people will read this book and become full of negative ideas about international banks and agencies but poorly informed in practicality. Better to focus this attention on specific mistakes that have been made and what exactly those actions caused in result."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Written as an autobiographical account, John Perkins, reveals that it was following the events of September 11, 2001 that he owned up to his part in U.S. empire-building. I came across this book after reading The Wal-Mart Effect, which first cracked open my denial about American corporate actions. The Confessions of an Economic Hit Man explains the subtle and ruinous, though legal behaviors, that corporatocracies employ to advance their own interests at the expense of our Republic and peoples around the globe. Following the release of this book, other economic hit men and women came forward with their personal admissions of similar accounts in another book, The Game as Old as Empire:The Secret World of Economic Hit Men and the Web of Global Corruption. And thereafter in John's 2007 book, The Secret History of the American Empire: Economic Hit Men, Jackals, and the Truth About Global Corruption, he continues to reveal details of the worldwide damage done by the machinations of the few. While some may still find these revelations unbelievable and prefer to continue in the path of denial, I believe most of us are waking up to our part as silent accomplices in the demise of our Republic as it is overrun by corporate and banking interests. For those who want a quick introduction, John Perkins speaks of his experiences in easily found You Tube videos -- search for Economic Hit Man. One of my favorites is the one from Talking Stick TV.Nothing woke me out of my media-influenced stupor faster than reading these 4 books. I give them 5 stars for this reason.

Compulsary for any conscient individual in today's world."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Mr. Perkins has a great thesis and great angst about his role in the world. His thesis is simple - American engineering and oil companies go to third world countries and give hugely inflated estimates of growth potential. Using those inflated numbers, they induce the countries to get loans so they can hire the American companies to do the work. The country then is unable to repay the loan. The theory implicates American companies, the many politicians with ties to them and the World Bank, IMF and other financial institutions.Unfortunately, Mr. Perkins fails to come up with the proofs. His outline appears feasible, but he never gives any instances of the loan and default portion of the thesis. There is nary a number or statistic to back him up. He does not cite a single defaulted loan.Further, Mr. Perkins often draws parellels to the American Founders and our Revolution. His grasp of American history is sophomoric at best. He uses a cartoonish image of 1776 that one would expect from an elementary school student, not someone indicting corporations, international banks and presidential administrations.Mr. Perkins does have some sources and they are noted. Again, they occasionally show his sloppiness with the facts. In one instance, he states with firmness that the Reagan and Bush administrations had been proven to have dirtied their hands in this corporatocracy (his term) scheme. The text said this was proven by testimony. When one checks the note, the testimony was by John Dean in 1973 and 1974 - six and seven years before the Reagan and Bush administrations. Such errors in fact and use of bad history undermine the reader's confidence in the basic theory of the book.That all having been said, the book does show how America's corporations have gone into Third World countries focused only on their own bottom line. Their is no altruism in the corporate world. This pure greed is aided and abetted by connected politicians.Most interesting are his accounts of the American-Saudi relationship where the corporate scheme worked with oil money rather than World Bank funds. Although Perkins seemed to criticize the plan, it worked well for both sides. It was a true win-win. Somehow, the author tried to tie in the Saudis' support of terrorism with its modernization and westernization. The parallel did not work - especially since he had given Saudi Arabia's history of being founded by fundamentalist Islamists long before the corporations came in. Mr. Perkins then tried to draw another parallel to Iraq. Unfortunately, he could never explain why the system that worked so well for Saudi Arabia did not work for Iraq.There are some alarming aspects of this book and it really does read, in parts, like a novel. Alarm is what Mr. Perkins expects to raise with his \\"Confession\\". There is a lot to look at behind his accounts. Sadly, Mr. Perkins just did not deliver the goods to prove his points."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This has got to be one of the best books I've ever read!

I'd been a libertarian/ free market capitalist proponent and hadn't come across much to make me think there were any options better out there.

It is the story of America's march to dominate world politics and commerce told by an insider, a man who was there when the deals were struck. Although he may upset readers who want to believe that our leaders always wear white hats, the author's stated and obvious intent is to educate. In the end, he helps us see a way to realize America's Founding Fathers' dream of \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\\" for all people everywhere.

They can even make OBL look like a freedom fighter.Personally, if I thought we could really pull off this empire business, I would not be so alarmed.

In this book, he verifies the West's control of the world's resources through diplomatic warfare, financial warfare, economic warfare, covert warfare, and, when all that fails, open warfare. A penetrating analysis of this global system agreeing with Perkin's personal experiences is laid out by J.W. Smith in his book, Economic Democracy: The Political Struggle of the Twenty-First Century. These are excellent books vital to concerned world-citizens' efforts toward building a new and decent world order. Dr. Glen T.

The machinations behind global empire have been exposed by Greg Palast in his wonderful book, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy. What makes this book different is that it reads like a spell binding and absorbing spy novel. Mr. Perkins takes us on a wild ride and succeeds in masterfully connecting the dots. The origins of terrorism become more clear. The reasons for the abject poverty in developing countries can be seen as a direct result of greed at the very highest levels--not only in the corporate world, but in our own government as well. It would be easy to feel cynical after reading this book, but Perkins redeems himself throughout by constantly questioning his mission. He has subsequently done much to give back to those who suffered under the system that spawned him and other EHM. Visiting his website and learning how we as individuals can help alleviate the inequities in the world gives me a renewed sense of hope. Well done Mr. Perkins!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"An uncle of John Perkins's wife had an executive position with the National Security Agency and was able to pull strings to give him a position that could have led to enormous riches, but in the process the New Englander developed conscience pangs as he saw predatory global economic activity from a participant's perspective. The ultimate result was the writing and publication of \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,\\" one of the most important critiques of global economics to surface in some time.Shortly after leaving Boston University John Perkins was groomed in the late sixties to become an economic hit man. His journey began as a member of the Peace Corps where, ironically, rather than enhancing the lives of the indigenous Indian peoples of the Ecuadorian Amazon, the rain forest, and the Andes, the experience proves to be a stepping stone to another important position in which the objectives were anything but altruistic. Global corporate giant MAIN assigned Perkins to a new position. He returned home to Boston, where an attractive young woman taught him the ropes as she bluntly informed him that he was being groomed to become an economic hit man.Perkins soon learned that the role he was assigned to play was one in which he posed as a friend to peoples of other nations, only to serve as an enthusiastic promoter of the World Bank and its loan policy to underdeveloped nations. He meets Robert McNamara, then the World Bank's president, and is promoted rapidly through the ranks by preparing reports that masquerade as frank economic assessments but in reality are propaganda messages extolling the loan process of the World Bank.The resulting process is simple and devastating. Heads of governments are implored to take out huge loans, all the while setting into motion a kickback process enabling cooperating heads of state to pocket enough to make themselves fabulously wealthy at the expense of the general citizenry. When the national treasuries are unable to keep up with exorbitant payment schedules the global economy barons exert control by taking charge as the corporate world assumes command, led by giants such as multinational Bechtel. In the process the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Perkins was on hand as the rain forest was plundered, causing him to develop grave misgivings about the predatory enterprise of which he was a part.One head of state Perkins met, became a friend of, and greatly admired was President Omar Torrijos of Panama. He established a working relationship with Torrijos in which beneficial construction services were provided that aided the Panamanian economy and its people. Torrijos was a vanguard in seeking to have the Panama Canal turned over to the country where it was situated. This happened but not long thereafter the incoming Reagan Administration exhibited grave misgivings about the treaty signed by President Jimmy Carter and Torrijos.Perkins holds deep suspicions about the plane crash that took Torrijos's life in 1981. That same year another leader who had impressed Perkins with his selfless pursuit of economic justice for his people, President Jaime Roldos of Ecuador, who successfully campaigned for election on an anti-oil platform, also lost his life in a plane crash. Perkins states bluntly that both \\"fiery airplane crashes ... have all the markings of CIA assassinations.\\"Perkins is highly familiar with the manner in which the CIA intervenes on behalf of the global corporate community. He provides details on how CIA operative Archie Roosevelt, Theodore's grandson, launched a successful coup in Iran to overthrow the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mossadegh after he had moved to nationalize the nation's oil deposits in retaliation for what the incoming president deemed exploitation of the nation's natural resources by the predecessor of British Petroleum. This brought to power the Shah of Iran, seen as a reliable bulwark of western economic interests. It was the Shah who initiated a repressive secret police known as SAVAK, which in turn infuriated large segments of the Iranian people, leading to his ultimate overthrow and the installation of the Islamic fundamentalist Ayatollah Khomeini regime.Another important area covered by Perkins was the CIA's activities in Guatemala under the democratically elected government of President Jacobo Arbenz. When Arbenz instituted reform at a point when a few large commercial interests and families controlled the vast majority of land, with less than 3 percent of Guatemalans owning 70 percent of Guatemala's terra firma, he was stoutly opposed by the United Fruit Company, one of Guatemala's leading landholders. A propaganda campaign was launched accusing Arbenz of being a Communist agitator. A CIA campaign brought him down. A repressive right wing totalitarian government replete with death squads replaced the popular Arbenz.It took tremendous courage for Perkins, a former consummate corporate insider, to pen a volume citing the gross misconduct and international power plays of the CIA as well as the rapacious dealings of the International Monetary Fund in concert with the World Bank. This book should serve as a wakeup call to the international community among those who seek justice and oppose exploitation of people in the interest of serving the cause of international monopolistic greed."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Edit of 20 Dec 07 to reduce links to ten.This book should be read simultaneously with two others books: David Callahan'sThe Cheating Culture: Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Aheadand also William Greider's,The Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy.The alter ego of this book, in this case from Latin America, is Alvaro Vargas Llosa's \\"Liberty for Latin America: How to Undo Five Hundred Years of State Oppression (Independent Studies in Political Economy)As populism sweeps across Latin America, and Western corporations are expelled, as Hugo Chavez in Venezuela works to extend European concepts of Social Democracy and egalitarian distribution of wealth, this book (\\"Confessions\\") can be said to be the equivalent of Martin Luther's posting to the cathedral door--it outlines all the reasons why Americans--US citizens--must heal themselves and retake control over their own economy, ceasing the transfer of its plagues to others.At root, this book is about what we teach in our schools and practice in our daily lives: values, or a lack there-of. Together with other related books, such as Clyde Prestowitz'Rogue Nation: American Unilateralism and the Failure of Good Intentionsthis book makes crystal clear the fact that we have abandoned our original morality and focus on a Republic offering hope to all mankind, and instead created an Empire, by, of, and for the 1% of the American population that is now in super-sized wealthy elite status.Most upper middle class and wealthy elite Americans will be made uncomfortable by this book. Having been educated by largely marginal educational systems where cheating is tolerated and rote learning pays lip service to the concept of developing independent intellects, most will find this book shocking to the point of wondering if it is false. Instead, I would join the author in suggesting that it is we who are living the lie, we who have lost faith with our Founding Fathers.According to the author, there is a clear and present danger to all Americans, and to the rest of the world, of continuing a system of \\"off the books\\" national security practices which revolve around \\"independent\\" corporate activities that seek to subvert and impoverish Third World nations for the enrichment of a narrow elite in America, and a narrower elite within each of the countries being targeted.One cannot help but be impressed by the commonality of themes between this author, and the fatwa's of Bin Laden and the charismatic populism of Hugo Chavez. Indeed, the author goes so far as to suggest, obliquely but clearly, that Bin Laden and others who oppose US multinational imperialism are closer to the spirit of Tom Paine than those who claim to represent America. ReadingVice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American PresidencyandRunning on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About ItI must agree.What I see, having specialized in predicting revolutions many years ago, is that we have reached a tipping point. The author treats 9-11 as his own tipping point, an event that caused him to overcome a vow of silence and bring forth his story for public consumption. On a larger scale, what I see, both at home, where cheating is epidemic across all the professions and in all walks of life, and abroad, where legalized looting of countries takes place in the guide of \\"free trade\\" rather than \\"fair trade,\\" is an impending spontaneous combustion of populations and economies.Three side notes:First, the author highlights the role of the Department of Treasury as a national security and foreign affairs actor. Those who have read Sterling and Peggy Seagrave'sGold Warriors: America's Secret Recovery of Yamashita's Goldwill have an easier time understanding how Treasury might maintain \\"off the books\\" national security funds that can be used to corrupt foreigners and fund covert action campaigns so secret even the CIA is not privy to them-truly a form of White House influence that needs to be better understood.Second, the author underscores how little Americans actually know about what is going on overseas, in part because the capital city newspapers overseas, the mainstay of what the US government and US media read, ignore the provincial papers, and in part because we have no truly independent objective Open Source (Information Agency that can collect and integrate \\"ground truth\\" on behalf of the public. His depiction of the differing perspectives in Latin America-those we call terrorists consider themselves patriots fighting immoral actions to dam rivers and destroy forests as well as entire tribes-is provocative.Third and finally, the author illuminates the unholy alliance between corporations intend on taking over foreign territory with unexploited gold, oil, or other riches, and certain religious organizations, chief among them the mis-named Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), that use a variety of dirty tricks, including laxative-laden food gifts and duplicitous \\"land grabbing\\" techniques, to move tribes away from the riches and to obtain land grants under false pretenses.As China and India woo Latin America, along with Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, I anticipate a clear and present danger to America: our immoral carpet-bagging is setting the stage for us to be thrown out of the region, with consequences for our economy that are staggering. Morality does matter. This book drives a stake into the heart of the devil we have allowed to dominate our global relations, to pillage and loot \\"in our name.\\"Published since this was reviewed:The Battle for the Soul of Capitalism: How the Financial System Underminded Social Ideals, Damaged Trust in the Markets, Robbed Investors of Trillions - and What to Do About ItThe Soul of Capitalism: Opening Paths to a Moral Economy"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"\\"Confessions of an Economic Hitman\\" is a great book in terms of describing how the global banking system snares poor countries and keeps them in chains of debt. The broad themes are true and Perkins describes them in a way that makes them seem more vivid to me than all sorts of dry news stories and frothing polemics have. However, after reading the book, I have questions about whether Perkins is making stuff up. His employer, MAIN Engineering, is long out of business so there's no way of verifying specifics about his work there. Ditto with his \\"alternative energy\\" company (which burned dirty coal, something that doesn't seem too alternative to me.) The seductress who made him into a hit man -- she disappears early in the book, leaving no evidence of her existence. The powerful political figures with whom Perkins says he socialized -- they're conveniently dead, so no one can say \\"I never heard of this guy.\\" A number of other points can't be easily substantiated. So while I agree with the book's big picture, I'm skeptical of the small details. The book was published by a house that specializes in anti-corporate topics. That's a good thing, but I wonder whether anyone there fact-checked him first."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am a Panamanian, who lived his whole teenage years under dictatorship until the Americans ousted Noriega from power. The author dedicates a couple of chapters on Panama, a country I know a thing or two. I am an economist and am also involved in politics, so I may know a bit about politics in the tropics.First, Perkins portraits Torrijos as a hero, when in fact he was a dictator. I won't even mention the people who \\"misteriously dissapeared\\" under his dictatorship, but I will mention something about Perkin's logic. According to the author, the corrupted governments of third world countries were innocent when they indebted their countries, and the real gangsters were the IMF and World Bank that looked for any justification - real or not - to make loans to these countries in order to control them. That sounds ok for a fiction novel, but it is simply not true. All these dictatorial regimes wanted the money and wanted the loans to perpetuate their populist regimes, increasing social programes and infrastructure projects that benefited their cronies and political symphatizers. The only fault lies in these governments and not in the institutions that lended the money.I read serious stuff, so I could not finish the book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"In many ways, Perkins' _Confessions_ is like McNamara's _Fog of War_--where an older man, now well-off financially, confesses his past sins to resolve internal issues of guilt. However, unlike McNamara, Perkins tries to do a foolish balancing act: he wants to project a compassionate James Bond image despite his former profession as an economic mercenary who inflated numbers to justify plunging underdeveloped countries into massive, unending debt.Still, the basic premise here is interesting--the U.S. and the CIA, World Bank, IMF, etc., are committed to spreading free markets around the globe at any cost and in a way that causes most people in the target country to be worse off. Perkins' job was to go into these countries as a biased economist and provide forecasting reports to convince countries and their citizens that going into massive debt to American corporations would produce benefits and growth in the future. The problem is that Perkins inflates the numbers in his reports, meaning that forecasted growth is unrealistic; thus, once countries sign on to U.S. debt, most of their economic output goes to pay interest to the U.S. and to U.S. corporations, and only a small percentage goes to the average citizen. Rather than actually spreading freedom and free markets, the author believes that U.S. economic intervention in a country is designed to corrupt leaders of countries, especially those with natural resources, and hold their citizens hostage to massive debt. The author also sees the U.S. as encouraging leaders to live opulent lifestyles, which leads them into an ivory-tower existence, which creates an incentive to promote non-native corporate interests over long term, stable, and diversified growth. Perkins' revelation of how economic numbers are manipulated brings to mind Disraeli's comment about \\"lies, damn lies, and statistics.\\"Perkins also expresses his concern for the environments of these various countries and tries to point out that a small country's rainforests and indigenous cultures are probably worth preserving more than KFC-style food courts. However, one of the frustrating aspects of this book is that Perkins does not come out and say exactly this. Instead, he writes about meeting an Iranian who enjoys the desert climate, how he enjoyed living in Ecuador, with its natural beauty, and how he laments the changes that have happened as a result of his forecasting. It seems a bit meandering at times, but somewhat understandable because the author isn't a classically trained economist, which makes the fact that he was issuing economic reports that advocated massive debt for underdeveloped countries all the more distasteful.Some counterarguments that are not discussed are the following: 1) Don't countries benefit when the U.S., Russia, China or India upgrades their infrastructure, especially if more modern technology is brought into the country? (the author himself points out that Saudi Arabia's infrastructure was dramatically upgraded as a result of trade with the U.S.); 2) Isn't it safer in the long term for a country to have economic ties to the U.S. or any other military superpower rather than being isolated economically? (i.e. the Thomas Friedman McDonald's hypothesis); 3) Isn't it possible for countries to question the economic projection figures and create a more equitable partnership? (the author points out that the former leader of Panama did just that); and finally, 4) What is the alternative? Most people in the U.S. must now go into debt (i.e., student loans, SBA loans, etc.) to earn a higher quality of life. Isn't it true that these countries are engaging in the same process of \\"debt now, maybe rich later,\\" but on a macro-level?By approaching the subject from a singular U.S. perspective, Perkins does not do a good job explaining the real issues of globalization. But taken together with a film, Life and Debt, about Jamaica's experience with the IMF, the book starts to sound wiser and more foreboding and more serious. Still, the flaw Perkins cannot escape here is that we don't know whether to believe him, because although he wants to sound sincere, his actions indicate that he was unethical. Emerson comes to mind: \\"What you do speaks so loud I cannot hear what you say.\\" Unfortunately, Perkins may be one of the few people who could tell this story, but his actions make it hard to trust his words."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"As someone whom the CIA tried to recruit, and who has worked for 26 years in Energy, the last 6 of which have been in the international arena, I can only say this book finally explains what I and my colleagues have been up against.Read this book.

These countries become dependent and lose their economic sovereignty and become join the list of the many countries that are now part of a global empire.

Many of the author's complaints about how much of the \\"aid\\" given (or, more often, lent at interest) to developing countries ends up back in the pockets of the donor country's citizens and treasury are valid and deserve greater public attention.That said, the author completely torpedoes much of his credibility by expounding on the \\"prophesy of the condor and the eagle\\" whereby the ancient wisdom of indigenous Americans will be combined with the intellectual achievements of Western culture to create some sort of \\"new age\\" of spirituality and harmony or, as Perkins puts it, \\"as human beings we can truly wake up and evolve into a more conscious species.\\"Perkins further calls his credibility into question by positing some sort of pan-government conspiracy to force the poorer nations of the world into perpetual servitude to the United States and, more specifically, into hosting unwanted American military bases on their soil. No doubt ALL countries \\"give\\" aid only with the expectation of some sort of furthering of their own interests, but to believe a government that couldn't even save hundreds of its own citizens from the completely foreseeable New Orleans flood of last year can somehow coordinate every single branch of government and hundreds of thousands in the private sector (where Perkins worked while operating as a \\"hit man\\") in a vast plot for world domination is beyond laughable.While Perkins' book brings to light many of the injustices and much of the hypocrisy within American foreign aid policy, it is larded with so much new-age nonsense and so many preposterous assertions so as to completely rob the author and, by extension, the book, of any shred of credibility. \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" contains some good points, but read it with a grain of salt -- or don't read it at all.For those in search of a more credible voice on foreign aid and its adverse effects (as well as some possible ways to improve it), \\"Globalization and Its Discontents\\" by Joseph E. Stiglitz is an excellent and highly readable primer."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I'll start by saying the negative (which there is little). First, I think this book repeats itself too much. In the context of what he is saying, I understand that referencing certain parts over helps in keeping things clear, but I think Perkins does this a bit too often. Other than that, this is a well written book.I also think Perkins shows a little too much \\"liberal\\" agenda. I don't know if it's intentional or not, but he praises or never mentions Democrat leaders at all, but opens up on Republican leaders with both guns. Perhaps this is the way it should be. Maybe Nixon, Reagan and both Bush's are more responsible, but I thought there was considerable bias.All that being said, this was a phenomenal book. Not being happy with the way things were going oversees in Iraq and Afghanistan, I finally decided that maybe I needed to educate myself better about what is happening in the world around me. Confessions of an Economic Hitman was my first step, and man, was it a big step. As each chapter passed, I couldn't believe the extent of what I was reading. It's very easy to try and pass it off as liberal extremist propaganda, but when he quotes several subjects and footnotes all his resources, you have to believe that at the very least, the base of his story is true. If even a small portion of this book is true, that's still a scary realization. However, I believe that the entire book is valid. Even when Perkins makes predictions about what is happening in the middle east and what will happen in the future, I think his experience makes his points extremely valid.Overall, this book is enlightening, and to me personally, enfuriating. I'm angry at myself for not being more educated, but hopefully, if you're reading this, you'll find out for yourself."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The author argues that he has been doing shady stuff as an economic consultant for various aid oranization. Why? Because he was under secret order to promote the advancement of US businesses, and make US into some global empire.That sounds scary. How did he (and other hit men like him) do this? By swamping the poor countries with debt under the name of aid, so that they would have no choice but to give in to any demand that the US gives. Keep them poor and ignorant and unhealthy, don't allow any good projects that might (god forbid) make them wealthy in any way.Wow, that sounds really bad. Except...that doesn't seem to advance US business at all!Think about this. Suppose you are an American business. Say, IBM, GM, Nike, whatever. Which is better for your business, the current Afganistan, or current Malaysia? You can't make sweatshops in Afganistan, or car factories, or anything in Afganistan (no infrastructure, workers are not educated enough). So there's not much exploitation that you could do. You can't sell anything there, because they are too poor. Malaysia, you can do a lot of things. Good infrastructure, relatively cheap and sophisticated labor, somewhat wealthy people that can buy your products and services.The author argues that he tried hard to keep Afganistan (and other countries) poor, in order to advance US business. But US Business gains nothing from doing that. Yeah, you may be able to bully them around, but what do you get from that? US business (and Japanese, for that matter) would much rather see more Malaysias springing up around the globe.It should also be pointed out that third world debt hurt US business more than they did the recieving countries. Citigroup really went through tough times with defaulting debts in Latin America during the 1970s. Remember Brazil? If someone owes you 200 billion dollars, they practically own you! Driving the opponent into to heavy a debt is VERY bad business, especially when you can't force them to repay at gun point.So the whole book is extremely suspicious and unbelievable. Some of the stories are understandable, like people wanting more optimistic economic forecasts. There may be specific cases where you want to crush countries with debt. But not many. The whole thing sounds like an anti-globalist conspiracy day dream, and even as a work of fiction, you'll get bored very quickly."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins' work is an excellent view from the inside of the goals of corporate capitalism, motivated by greed, with no concern for the people of the developing countries or for the ecosystems of their lands.

And the answer ain't \\"because they hate our freedom.\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Mr. Perkins is not the best writer, and I think he has perhaps embellished his story somewhat to make it sell better, but the essence of the story is correct - this really is what is going on in our world today with globalization. As a foreigner, it is somewhat easier for us to see what is going on, especially if we happen to be on the receiving end of the tentacles of corporatocracy. From within the USA, however, it is really difficult to see through the fog, or the veil, that has been placed in front of our eyes, to keep us all in line, to keep us shopping, to stop us from questioning what exactly it is we are doing internationally. I mean, we have listened to them tell us that globalization is best for us all, while the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. If you look at what is going on in the world, you can't help but want to question if this is the road we want to be going down. If we continue to piss people off so they want to strap bombs onto their backs and try and blow us up, when are we going to stop asking why do they hate us so much and take a real good look at what we are doing to them? Mr. Perkins is just touching the tip of the iceberg, it goes much deeper. And this road or corporate greed can only end in disaster. You can only squeeze so much out of the poor. What happens when they have nothing else to give? They resort to whatever it will take to get some attention."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins novel is an excellent and well written book that tackles issues rarely seen or heard of in literature. Economic Hitman (EHM) are a phenomenon that probaly have never shown up in mass media or been published anywhere. However, the last chapter could have been written a lot more clear and concise as well as the epilogue."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Although I don't disbelieve Mr. Perkins' premise that first world countries and institutions lend money to the third world to enrich the first world at the expense of the third world, his book lacks details behind his specific work as an economic hitman. In addition, some of Mr. Perkins' alleged conversations with persons in the third world (the bar scene in Pananma, his conversations with young people in Indonesia) seemed contrived to make his point. It also seems like Mr. Perkins has tried to have it both ways by continuing to receive money from the corporations that harm the third world and through his obviously comfortable lifestyle. Therefore, its hard to take his \\"confession\\" seriously.That being said, the book is a good introduction to how the United States has interfered with legitimate democratic governments in central and south america. In addition, the book made me rethink the invasion of Panama by the United States in 1989. Therefore, I would recommend this book to persons as a good introduction on the United States' policy towards the Third World."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I have recommended this book to a lot of people, and loaned my copy out; not because it is the best written or most informative about the subject (IMF, World Bank, globalism, etc.), but because it is a quick read, interesting story, and gives a nice intro into the subject. It gives somewhat of a personal view into the sitations, and is so easy of a read, that its great for someone looking into the subject that has incited so much debate across the earth. But if you are well-educated about the subject, this book will be of no interest to you."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is a must read for anyone who seeks the truth about the world we live in. As you read the book, light bulbs will go on and all of the little inconsistencies and falsehoods that you have been taught over the years will start to unveil and reality will come into focus. U.S. intervention in other countries in the name of corporate profits and power for the super-class are becoming better known as classified documents are unsealed. The Nixon/Kissinger melee in Peru that resulted in assassination and the seating of the brutal Pinochet is now well documented fact. It was undertaken by request by ITT to Nixon because ITT feared that Peru was about to nationalize the copper mines from which they so handsomely profited.After reading this book you may also want to read \\"Petrodollar Warfare\\" by William R. Clark. It is the perfect follow-on to bring you up to-date with current events. Additionally, the DVD documentary \\"Life and Debt\\" solidifies the truth of Perkin's book by demonstrating how the World Bank has decimated Jamaica.The fact that there are so many reviews by naysayers is a good demonstration as to why we still allow our governments to perpetrate these crimes against the poor countries of the world."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"For all the reviewers who wrote that this is \\"typical liberal\\" propaganda or b.s., I have one thing to say: Read the book before you write something.John Perkins is not a liberal looking to increase paranoia or push an alarmist agenda. He is someone who has seen the underbelly of our government, and who was in fact part of it, and who has come out from under the rock and into the mainstream to shed light on some of the dirtiest and most rotten secrets of the United States' imperial regime.I won't go on to repeat what others have already written about this book. But if you're interested in learning about our \\"real\\" government and being inspired to work for social change, then you should definitely check out Confessions of an EHM.If you're interested in hearing updates from John Perkins, he regularly appears on the radio show Democracy Now. (www.democracynow.org)."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Fascinating and compelling account of how our government and corporations have aligned themselves for several decades in order to exploit resources and individuals throughout the planet for the benefit of a select few. They have taken empire building to new heights that threaten us all.This is a must read for it is crucial that America wake up and see what the world has known all along before it is to late."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is a disturbing, disappointing book. It's frustrating to read because for the most part it's a string of mea culpas that come too little, and too late, to help anyone who has been harmed by the global economic shifts of the post-World War II era.John Perkins seemed to have lived a charmed, dashing life-trips to exotic countries, meetings with the movers and shakers of the world, the frequent company of intelligent, beautiful women. To read him tell it, though, in the flat style he uses, he experienced discontent knowing that what he was doing was wrong, that his work brought greater misery to millions of people living in poverty throughout the world.His basic premise is that he was an \\"economic hit man,\\" trained to develop economic studies that would convince the leadership of developing countries to take out loans that would leave them perpetually indebted to the United States and other developed countries in return for a series of power plants, roads, railroads, etc. He always refers to economic hit men in the plural, as though there is a group of such people trained as he was, but he mentions no others who received such training or used such titles, and his own training was one-on-one with a woman who dropped out of the picture the minute she had snared Perkins as an economic hit man.What's disturbing about this book is that whatever Perkins' part in the situation has been there's no question that developed countries are taking advantage of Third World countries, exploiting their resources and labor, and destroying indigenous cultures and the natural environment in the process. And there's no question that those at the top of this pyramid have undertaken questionable tactics to ensure that this system continues. The reasons for that can be reduced to one: greed. But the unbelievable air of this work detracts from Perkins argument that this exploitation has been deliberate and well planned. And Perkins' constant carping that he knew that what he was doing was wrong beg the question-Why did he spend his career doing it? Could it be that he is as susceptible to greed as those he criticizes now?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"What a truly disappointing book. If John Perkins really is who he says he is then it is a terrible shame that his book was so completely unimaginative and one dimensional. In this book the US is the \\"boogey\\" man and communists and muslims extremists are the poor victims. What an incredible misrepresentation. As someone who has spent some time in the third world, I am shocked that Perkins would rather deliver the poverty stricken masses into the grave than see a US corporation profit from building infrastructure in the third world. I'm really shocked. The only sane reaction one could have when presented face-to-face with the tragic living conditions of the majority of the world is that we should do ANYTHING to help them. So Perkins basic message is not one of a sane person. The dialouge in the book is completely contrived. Third worlders in this book speak like college graduates. I can barely believe that Perkins has done all the things he's done, talked to so many uber-resentful third worlders and has come to the conclusion that the United States is building a neo-colonial empire. I'm more likely to believe that John Perkins is a communist sympathizer and saw an opportunity to sell a lot of copies of his poorly written book. Pass this one up for a more compassionate, even handed dealing of the problems in the world today. This book has an agenda, and it's anti-USA."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Mr. Perkins certainly has an interesting story to tell in his background as an economic consultant. This entire book is his \\"confession\\" about how he personally manipulated economic data to get huge investment projects in third-world countries. While he does seem to have had an in with many of the top leaders in third world countries, I believe he has an overwhelmingly smug view of his own importance and impact on the government and the people of these countries. He is bothered by the fact that American companies make a PROFIT by bringing industry and infrastructure to third world countries. He completely neglects the positive impacts that these types of projects have had, and what happens when that investment dries up (for example, what happened to the poor workers in bangladesh when Nike was forced to close their plants there).While his backstory is interesting, the entire book is overwhelmed by left-wing political banter, and makes one doubt most of his conclusions. The man sincerely believes that Jimmy Carter was one of our best presidents. Enough said."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"What an incredible pompous twit. I wanted to strangle this guy, just from his writing style. Its as if he saved the world by writing this (really, really poorly written) book.The story is interesting.

I came away with the conclusion that Perkins is an utter charlatan.Put aside the big whoppers (that Perkins was secretly working for the NSA because he once interviewed there, that the CIA killed two Latin American leaders within a three-month period recently, or that the U.S. had no evidence against Manuel Noriega, who was tried and convicted in a public trial in Miami.) It is the small fibs that give him away.Perkins claims that he went to Brown on an athletic scholarship. This would make him the only person who has ever received an athletic scholarship from any Ivy League college, in history. OK?What does the U.S. hope to obtain when it coerces third world countries into signing crushing loan agreements that will bankrupt them with debt? To Perkins, it is leverage to obtain these countries' votes at the U.N. Huh? Since when does the U.N. vote on something in which the U.S. depends on the individual votes of Latin American and African countries? It's not like the U.N. enacts legislation that the U.S. is pushing. Perhaps Perkins was referring to the U.N. Security Council, where any member country can veto a proposal. Problem is, the third world countries he discusses are never on the Security Council.How about this one: the reason American economics professors do not teach the truth about what the U.S. does in the developing world is because American colleges are run by multinational companies, and these professors would be fired if they taught the truth. Seriously, I am not making this stuff up. Has Perkins ever heard of tenure? How does he explain Noam Chomsky or Howard Zinn?In the course of \\"Confessions,\\" Perkins is visited in a dream by Jesus, who is actually a South American peasant. Shortly after 9/11, Perkins has a mysterious conversation with a Afghani pedestrian near Ground Zero in New York, and he explains the truth about American peridy.This is an utterly goofy book. I suppose it is what one would expect from someone who thinks that illiterate cultures can teach us how to travel through time. (My one star reflects that fact that I found myself engaged as I noted how many unbelievable claims leaped off the pages.) In the preface, Perkins described how one publisher recommended that he publish this as a novel.

Where should I begin? This book was a HUGE waste of time. First of all, I found Mr. Perkins' discussion of his own internal moral conflict as self-righteous and BORING.Second of all, Mr. Perkins is no economist and as such, his denouncement of free trade and over-simplified views on US monetary policy should be treated as trash. I feel sorry for people who read this, do not think beyond the surface and take all Mr. Perkins says as fact. For real economic analysis, I'd suggest reading something else.Finally, as far as Mr. Perkins \\"shocking\\" conspiracy theories... unless you've been living under a rock, you will have read these all before in Vanity Fair and/or in the New York Times.

This book was supposed to enlighten us on what one will do to go after the bucks. I must admit, I did get the answer to that question. Write a piece of trash and market it as an expose of the exploits of capitalism. Oh, excuse me, this book was an exploit of capitalism snaring the wary reader who wanted to learn something about the clandistine activities of big business.

I cannot believe that huge companies belive that their false and rosy economic forecasts is the truth. It is asinine to think that the government s of the third world countries blindly buy into this just for thier own corrupt purposes. So what if these EHM did not do it.

Pekins was an unhappy child, who became be an unhappy man, as a result of his own inability to stand up for his own beliefs, the pages bleed with it.While contributing nothing of his own wealth to help the poor he professes to champion, he rails against the capitalist system, continuing to milk this very system he so despises (enough so, he writes a second book, same theme). In a nut shell: This book is an anti-American (anti-capitalist) diatribe, he lauds Jimmah Carter \\"for all the wonderful things he does\\" and faults Israel for the troubles of the Mid-East.He blames corporate America for getting the third world into debt.

Once the country became dependent on our largess and could never become self sufficient we had them where we wanted them. Now America would call on them for payment when we needed a vote in the UN to, say, take over the oil fields in Iraq. Perhaps the leftists should realize the right wingers have been saying the same thing about their welfare payments to the poor in this country. The people receiving those payments become addicted to the free money and never go out an get jobs.When the Author praised Hugo Chavez for standing up to America's trying to destroy their economy by paying them $100. a barrel for oil I closed the book.Life is too short to waste it reading this garbage.

As Resident Engineer of a $300 million project in El Salvador I observed how mystifiedly local officials would describe how U.S. reps, mostly twenty-somethings like the author, packaged their offers. \\"Soft loans\\" they called them; suggesting that they would not have to be repaid. Such official \\"generosity\\" baffled us, but Perkins' book explains the evil intent. And we now know the deadly consequences.

As to whether he was a egotistical in his younger years and devoid of doing the right thing; yes he was...So what, none of us were mature enough in our 20's and 30's either..But what he has to say now is still very invaluable eventhough it might be born of guilt.His solution is simply the conservation of our resources and is not asking for anything more. So, what are you afraid of from this book. The truth or that the you may not get my money?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is written in the form of a memoir. Perkins frames the story of how he was recruited as an Economic Hitman (and the recruiter used that specific terminology, Perkins isn't making up the name himself) within his life story, beginning in New Hampshire, through college rebellion, the Peace Corps, a failed marriage, overt sexism throughout, and the birth of a daughter. But it is actually a story of redemption, as Perkins seeks ways to make up for helping to cause so much suffering in the world.As a fellow Returned Volunteer I saw another theme in this book - how his service as a Peace Corps Volunteer led him to be open to experiences with local people that ultimately caused him to have a change of heart on his profession.So, what is an economic hitman? These were and are the men and women hired by private construction companies, including Bechtel, Halliburton et al. in collusion with government agencies like the National Security Agency, who in the 1960s and 1970s, and continuing to the present, PURPOSELY and CONSCIOUSLY overstated the potential economic growth rate of Third World Countries to get them to qualify for enormous loans that the US GOVERNMENT KNEW THEY WOULD NEVER, EVER be able to repay! Why do this? Well, these countries either have to agree to give us their natural resources for cheap (read here oil and such) or tow the line politically. If they do not, another set of characters steps in, the jackals (again not Perkins' word), who get uncooperative Presidents like Torrijos of Panama or Roldos of Ecuador killed. They tried more recently in the case of Hugo Chavez of Venezuela too, but it didn't work, for reasons you'll find out in the book, even thought it was orchestrated by an individual who is well known internationally for his evil deeds in Latin America and the Caribbean (and at home as well).This connected the dots for me in a way that nobody who was not an insider could have. OUR government has been responsible for the suffering of millions of people on the planet, all in the name of empire, NOT FREEDOM and NOT democracy!!!! Perkins shows that this seemingly coincidental meeting of interests of oil revenues, international banks and governments was NOT a coincidence at all. He calls this collusion a corporatocracy, which is a great word. And this includes THE MEDIA.You must read this book in order to understand what is behind the Iraq war (if the jackals fail, the soliders are called in), our support of Saudi Arabia, and the deaths of two presidents of Latin American countries. You will never see the Third World debt situation or World Bank and IMF actions the same way again. Perkins also points out that there are a honest people in those agencies who have been totally duped by us, that is U.S.I found this book totally gripping. Please, please read it. You NEED to know this stuff about our government before believing one more thing that comes out of ANY government representative's mouth!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins spent most of his career working for the economic colonialists, having to suppress his own conscience in order to destroy entire economies of developing countries. Here is an insider, who after 911, reached the apex of his moral dilemma ....choosing to expose the fraudulent and corrupt world of banking, finance and government coercion. 'Confessions of an Economic Hit Man' is that story. Notably, it is fascinating and factual, yet Perkins crafts each chapter in such a way that makes it tangible, and at times even humorous. He is a skilled writer who makes an otherwise bleak subject an enjoyable read. I have recommended this book to many friends with whom I share these topics. Every single one has had the same stunned reaction. This is a must-read for anyone who is seeking the truth about where and how our tax dollars are spent for. Peace."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Barbara Tuchman, for top-notch historical perspective, and John Perkins, for up-to-date crucial history in the making, should be required reading for \\"World 101\\", a also required course for all americans who have been na&iacute;vely duped by seriously compromised (by the age-old military-industrial complex) media into sincerely believing that the US really is the world's arbiter of peace, freedom and democracy, striving for the good of all mankind, imposing the \\"right values\\" through soldiers with the \\"right stuff\\". Yeah.Perkins's book is simply an extremely important, very well-written, conscientiously researched and analyzed look into the reality that afflicts the rest of the world being \\"aided\\" by the US through the IMF, USAID, the World Bank, etc. All efforts, at least on the surface, well-intentioned. But we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Yeah.There must be a reason why the US, after a short burst of 9/11 support, returned to its relatively recently acquired status as possibly the most despised country of the world. Something happened after the golden years post-WWII.Read that book and you'll be informed, in the excellent recounting of the Indonesia chapter, that Arnold Toynbee predicted that the wars of the 21st. century would not be between capitalists and communists but between Muslims and Christians.Barbara Tuchman, with extraordinary insight into the past from Troy onward, clearly shows the effects of cognitive dissonance in the march of folly typical of heads of state (you do remember that the insurgency is in it's \\"last throes\\" and critics who write reviews that trash an unpalatable work by skirting the issues and attacking the author.Eleazar Grynbal"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins real life account of his adventures and intrigues as an economics consultant has opened my eyes and has certainly raised my concerns of how theories and concepts gained from taking classes in respected disciplines do not always work the way they are presented by textbook scholars. Perkins, an economist by training, documents thorougly the close ties between economics and poltical realities often with adverse consequences for the majority of the world's citizens while benefiting certain elite groups who are determined to build a new global order. I could not put this book down for a moment as I was reading because I was glued to its amazement and thorougness.I am an economics professor myself and try to conduct my classes using a real world approach rather than asking students to memorize esoteric graphs and charts which practical economist such as this author would scoff at. Perkind gives a new meaning to international economics and the corruption of policies by politicians and special interest forces who could not care less about principles and values as long as they are profitting from such policies. This author exposes superbly how data and forecasts can be manipulated by the power brokers trying to implement certain policies giving more credibility to the centuries old adage that \\"there are lies, damn lies, and then there are statistics\\"!I highly recommend John Perkins' breathtaking work to any student of economics or political science. He/she will be amazed at how reality differs from theory. One of first the questions I ask my students is why economic and business theories may not always work in the world of ours. Perkins' book is an excellent answer to this open-ended question. He deserves a Noble Prize in Economics for this expose!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is a courageous book, a behind-the-scenes look at one of the most important historical developments of the 20th century, and a compelling personal story.\\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" should be required reading in every business school where international business is taught and in every institution where U.S. candidates for overseas service study the history of their chosen work.Over the years, I have traveled in nearly 100 countries, and I have witnessed the fruits of the ill-conceived policies that John Perkins helped to promote as an Econoic Hit Man. I have spoken with hundreds of people who have learned, through bitter personal experience, the truth of his assertions. Still, I found this book to be hugely revealing. There were surprises for me in John Perkins' artful exposition of his personal experience.This book makes a major contribution to public understanding of the true nature of the U.S.' role in the world over the last third of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Author describes first hand experiences of motives surrounding the us aid programs, peace corps etc. as expanding the international markets of the major u.s. corporations. A weakness of the book is its global statements as to the capability of the U.S. to accomplish the broad goals the author describes...and the responsibility of the USA for the unintended negative impact of technological progress in third world countries. Nevertheless, the book is well worth reading and hard to put down until fully read."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I have had an interest in economic development for many years, and was most pleased to come accrossed this book. The author skillfully lays out his experiences as a EHM (economic hit man)in a very compelling manner. He includes many examples where he has personal knowledge to prove his thesis. He is able to take what could seem like a dry issue and makes is very enjoyable and educating read. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you've ever wondered how our government can promote \\"democracy\\" so vehemently in one place (Iraq) but embrace a totalitarian regime in another (Saudi Arabia) or have wondered how we can be friends with two countries who seem to be enemies (both Israel and Saudi Arabia for instance), if you've ever wondered why we really invaded Panama, or wondered why the mainstream media has ignored the parallels between the Iraq invasion and the Panama invasion, well this book fills in all the gaps.This is one of the best books I've ever read, as far as \\"connecting the dots\\" -- the dots which seem to sometimes contradict one another.This book is as frightening as it is revealing -- it shines the light on who truly runs the United States and its empire, and shows, sadly, how futile any sort of political \\"opposition\\" in this country really is. You will learn why it is nearly impossible to oppose the empire, why it is so dangerous, and why so many have failed to do so. You will learn why third world countries just can't seem to get their acts together, even with massive \\"help\\" from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. You will learn how and why large international companies are taking over the planetI cannot recommend it highly enough. It should be required reading of every high schooler America, and possibly in the world.You will realize how silly the political discourse in this country is, what a deliberate distraction it all is, created by the corporotocracy, to keep us at each others' throats so that we will not recognize, or fight, the true rulers of this nation.This book is an epiphany."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am still not sure what to think of this book.On the one hand, the author is either delusional or is simply comfortable dramatically embellishing the truth. He tells stories that are just too convenient be true: about the sad-eyed Afghan immigrant that he just happens to encounter while sitting on a stoop in the WTC area of post-911 Manhattan, about the way that he was \\"recruited\\" by the NSA, about his relationship with the sister of a FARC guerilla in Colombia, etc. The book is full of odd stories that, when added together, make this guy's life sounds like a clumsy work of fiction. Even the term used in the title of the book \\"economic hitman\\" is hard to swallow: apart from his repeated self-identification as an \\"EHM\\", nobody else in the book mentions the term apart from the shadowy figure that the NSA sends to train him. On top of his questionable story, the author is so concerned with self-aggrandizement that he somehow forgets to provide any evidence to back up his claims of global conspiracy. It seems that he expects us to believe his because he has such great credentials (according to him) and because he was such a key player in the conspiracy (again, according to him).On the other hand, he highlights some real issues with how developed countries have interacted economically with the developing world. It is certainly true that the United States has a strong track record of imposing its view of correct economics on the people of the developing world: a view that implicitly or explicitly promotes US business interests. It is also true that loan packages have been extended and used as political leverage against poor countries who find that the US model does not provide the promised benefits in terms of development. This book highlights these inequities as well as a number of US actions (mainly assassinations and coups) that are well documented elsewhere but virtually unknown to the American public. In this sense, the book does have value.In summary, I feel that the author gets in the way of this story. Since his narrative is so hard to believe, it calls into question the authors contention: that there is some conspiracy between the security and business establishment of this country to undermine the stability of the developing world. Indeed, the only credible evidence that he provides for this theory is a list of historical facts that are available outside of this book and, in themselves, don't prove the type of global conspiracy that he describes. By providing us with such a flawed account, the author reinforces the opinion of those predisposed to believe him, vindicates those who would dismiss him and muddies the waters for those of us interested in reading about the truth."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I notice that I rate this book higher than many other reviewers. It was enjoyable reading. John Perkins fancies himself as James Bond and has had some interesting adventures as an operative for Corporate Imperialism. Then,out of guilt,he tells us he turned into a Knight of the Ecology roundtable. Now,he writes a confession that smacks of profiting from his misdeeds and takes it all the way to the bank. That's Capitalism for you!"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The book (on CD) is great so far. Very eye opening, and an excellent reader. I was disappointed however with the quality of the used CD I purchased. I didn't realize it was a former public library copy, though that info was available in the fine print/clicks I found after receiving it. The audio quality is poor and skips in many sections, and it is a bit on the grimy side too.

Before you buy this book take a look at his other book titles."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Great personal story of a EHM really an eye opener. But Instead of a good book on the real issues of economics, John Perkins gives a pitifully self-serving fiction-autobiography about his misdeeds as a EHM. Perkins works real hard to justify his actions and misdeeds with remorse and guilt, as a priest of deception, while condemning those around him, giving sermons that belong more in the Sunday homily than in a book of economics, how can anyone taking seriously.Anyone serious about understanding modern economics must read the the 2008 \\"Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics\\" Paul Krugman a professor of Economics and International Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, and stopped reading Perkins sorry apologists.See the US of America is taking out of contect by Perkins, he forgets all about the bitter cold war fought between 1950-1992, I know I lived through it. Im a latinamerican and his stories touch close to home, especially the ones about the coup in Guatemala of Jacobo Arbenz Guzman(a socialist), who was overthrown in a coup orchestrated by the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat. After his land reform, the CIA intervened because it feared that a socialist government would become a Soviet satellite nation in the Western Hemisphere, such as Cuba and Nicaragua during the Sandinistas rule;Panama\`s President Omar Torrijos a leftist dictator died when his aircraft, crashed. It has been widely speculated that his death was a CIA assassination due to his resistance to renegotiate the Panama Canal Treaty, negotiated under the Carter administration, with President Ronald Reagan; Torrijos died shortly after the inauguration of US President Ronald Reagan, just two months after Ecuadorian president Jaime Rold&oacute;s died in strikingly similar circumstances. Those stories Perkins talks about touch close to home but I can never thank and bless the USA enough for stopping the spread of communism, if you knew anyone escaping from Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, the former Soviet republics you\`ll know that the USA saved the day. Communism was the worst ideology that walked the face of the Earth, those people were murdered, alienated by their leaders from the rest of the world and Stalin and Mao Zedong who BTW murdered over 75 millions of their own citizens.One more point, about Israel, Perkins is wrong in this book and on his second book \\"American Empire\\". The USA support for Israel come with a heavy price but still the USA does it because is the ritgh and moral thing to do after centuries of antisemitism by the Europeans and second grade cityzenship in the Arab Muslin world. Never Again should we allow another holocaust, bravo for America for standing for the Jews even though it is offending the powerful oil lobby.Also there\`s a lack of documentary or testimonial evidence to corroborate the claim made by Perkins that the NSA was involved in his hiring to Chas T. Main.Lols the NSA \\"is a cryptological codemaking and code-breaking agency, not an economic organization and that its missions do not involve anything remotely resembling UFOs, alien abductions or placing economists at private companies in order to increase the debt of foreign countries, the third world have corrupt governments who do it for free, I know I\`m from there, borne and raise. Economic historian Niall Ferguson writes in his book The Ascent of Money that Perkins's contention that the leaders of Ecuador President Jaime Rold&oacute;s Aguilera and Panama General Omar Torrijos were assassinated by US agents for opposing the interests of the owners of their countries' foreign debt \\"seems a little odd\\" in light of the fact that in the 1970s the amount of money that the US had lent to Ecuador and Panama accounted for less than 0.4% of the total US grants and loans, while in 1990 the exports from the US to those countries accounted for approximately 0.4% of the total US exports approximately $8 billion. According to Ferguson, those \\"do not seem like figures worth killing for.\\"Also if the US is so good at having EHM\`s abroad, why are we in this mess since 2007, which included a huge bubble in the US housing market, a subprime mortgage crisis, Wall street gone wild enjoying the deregulation era with Over-the-counter derivatives (OTC), also fueled by soaring oil prices, Lehman's bankruptcy that created a change reaction and moral hazard which followed with the troubles of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, AIG which was up to its nose with toxic assets A.K.A credit default swaps (CDSs), and many, many more giants of the fiancial system that drunk the Cooley such as Goldman Sachs, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, JPMorganChase, that needed financial help ASAP. A $787 billion economic stimulus package was needed aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening recession cause by ex-Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and his non-sense economics, where he BTW find a flaw!!!...Presuming that self-interest of organizations, specifically banks and others, were such that they were best capable of protecting their own shareholders and their firms...Well deregulation rings a bell, Mrs Brooksley born of the The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC) advice everyone back in the 90\`s about it,..\\"The market grew so enormously WITH NO or little oversight and regulation\\"... but no one listen!, we all drunk the cooley!!!, the CFTC regulation was strenuously opposed by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, and by Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and Lawrence Summers, with Congress in their side, the result was the RECESSION OF 2007-2011 and going...Their response then was to dismissed Born's analysis that CFTC regulation of swaps and other OTC derivatives were unneed in a free market economy, WRONG!WRONG!, and yeah more WRONG!!!Warren Buffett famously referred to derivatives as \\"financial weapons of mass destruction\\" in early 2003.Needless to say the both Bush and Clinton administrations were ill advice by Mr Greenspan, with unbridled deregulations that came to define the Clinton and Bush eras (1993-2009)and pave the way for disaster. Also did not helped the taking away the Glass-Steagall Act of 1932 provisions that prohibited banks to glamble with the commercial banks regular savings acc., small loans and mortgages, making the new mortgage-backed securities (MBS) into a commodity, enabling them to be traded on futures exchanges with little oversight by any federal or state regulatory body, adding to that, the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2004 waived its leverage rules, under the new regulations, 5 companies - Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and Morgan Stanley - were granted an exemption, which they promptly used to lever higher...GREEDY too big to fail..See the Glass-Steagall Act was set to protect us from the TOO BIG TO FAIL CORPORATIONS AND BANKS, which was sadly repealed on November 12, 1999, by congress by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, named after its co-sponsors Phil Gramm (R, Texas), Rep. Jim Leach (R, Iowa), and Rep. Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. (R, Virginia), under the presidency of Bill clinton. Under Mr Greenspan G.W. Bush enacted the biggest tax cut for the wealthy(165 billions a year, 1.6 trillions so far in 2011), and it was kept through 2 recessions(2001 and 2007-09) and 2 wars, unthinkable!, as a result of that, we own now 14 trillion dollars in debt, we lost our triple AAA credit score by S & P.Explain that one Perkins, I do not see any smoking gun, otherwise all of us, would be laughing our ..... to the bank!!!, Gee, what a failure did the NSA to sucked the worlds richest for all of us in the USA.Instead of a good book, John Perkins gives a pitifully fiction-autobiography about his misdeeds as a EHM.

Within a few hours, I couldn't continue reading. I was expecting an informed and engaging expose - instead, it turned out to be a very typical and painfully obvious rehash of the old \\"global conspiricy\\" tale. The story outlined in this book is based not so much on economic theory and current events as it is on tiresome, outdated B-movie plots.Consider the following statement from \\"Claudine\\", Mr. Perkin's shadowy \\"trainer\\":\\"We're paid - well paid - to cheat countries around the globe out of billions of dollars. A large part of your job is to encourage world leaders to become part of a vast network that promotes U.S. commercial interests.\\"Here's a hot tip for all of you armchair global manipulators out there - there are no shadowy corporate scions sitting in a dark room, rubbing their hands together and cackling about \\"cheating countries out of billions of dollars.\\" The fact that Mr. Perkins can write something like this in all seriousness points to the fact that his business acumen is not at the level that he attempts to project.I certainly don't mean to say that rampant global capitalism and the newest incarnation of American imperialism are figments of the author's imagination. In my opinion, and in the opinion of many millions of people around the world, these problems are very real, and very dangerous. But they reach far beyond Mr. Perkin's sophmoric narrative, and it's a shame that he can't treat these issues with the gravity and thoughtfulness that they merit. As such, one can only feel embarrassed upon reading this book; embarrassed for Mr. Perkins, and embarrassed for the people who will mindlessly absorb and rehash the misguided and uninformed message contained within."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you care what happens to our world read this groundbreaking book.

This book is an insider's account of what actually goes on under cover of such propaganda.John Perkins' autobiographical account elaborates on how he ended up in one of the most criminal, though legitimate enterprises, namely that of an Economic Hitman. Perkins tells how he was recruited how he started his work in Indonesia and how he got heads of countries to make loans to US interests, default on those loans, and then have the US virtually take over the country's economy. The EHM is the missing link in a policy that aims at protecting interests of corporations to the detriment of other countries, as well as most Americans.Perkins has the courage to come forward with the story just as Richard Clarke and others.

He pretty much confirms what American statesman Lyndon LaRouche and others have been saying for 40 years. The phenomonen of the economic hitmen has been around for centuries, and exists today more than ever. Their greatest deceit is that the public doesn't know about them, because if they did, they wouldn't accept them. Their looting of 3rd world countries only benefit the big corporations, and not the population of the Western World in general (which would be no excuse either).A brave and honest book, that puts a face on some of the real \\"bad guys\\" of Western Civilization (George Schultz, Zbigniew Brzezinski and the Bush Family)."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Here's a great scam. Offer up a large scale construction project to a country, something along the lines of a new dam or a power plant to supply electricity. Send in an economist to inflate the potential economic growth in GDP generated by the project. Lend the country the money to build the project and when the anticipated growth in GDP doesn't materialize and the country defaults on its loans you now own a country. Is this the way the world works or is it just the paranoid ravings of John Perkins?Perkins assertion is that the United States government works in collusion with the World Bank, IMF and large construction companies like Bechtel and Halliburton in order to set up a system of dependency or financial entanglement with third world and oil rich countries in Africa, South America and the Middle East. The goal is to extend the U.S. global empire and, in the past, to halt the spread of communism. With the fall of communism the goal has transformed into plain old greed and domination.Writers like Robert Kagan and Thomas Barnett have argued that there are two worlds out there. Barnett calls it the Core and the Gap. In the stable democratic Core we live by a certain set of rules, in the Gap we live by a different set. Barnett sees the U.S. involvement in the Gap like a cop walking a beat in a bad part of town, Kagan calls it the jungle and when in the jungle you need to fight by the laws of the jungle. The problem is, who decides what constitutes the Core and the Gap and how does this relate to business? Did the United States have the right to invade Panama, kill thousands of people and dispossess the lock because we didn't like Manual Noriega? Do indigenous people around the world not have the same property rights as American's if they live on valuable land? Do American corporations have the right to exploit people in poor countries and have them work under conditions illegal in the U.S.?John Perkins book is an apology and an attempt at atonement for his self perceived sins for the thousands of lives he's harmed. It's also a realization that he himself was responsible for his actions, not his parents, not his school not the people at MAIN who introduced him to the business of Economic Hit Man.In the end Perkins sees the United States standing at a crossroads and as on September 11th we may see more of the windfall of the anger fomented overseas. Perkins mentions that Asian countries might switch from the U.S. dollar to the Euro which could have disastrous effects on a U.S. economy that relies on Asian loans to support our lifestyles. This seems a bit off topic since Perkins never mentions U.S. corporations abusing Asia. In fact financial entanglement is one of the things that probably stops China from making such a move since American companies like Wal Mart import more from China than most entire countries including industrial powerhouses like Germany. Still, exposing the dark underbelly of globalization is a noble cause if only to try and improve our actions in the future. As Perkins says the United States is the one country on Earth that has the money and resources to do the right thing and improve the world for everyone and not just a small group at the top of the economic ladder."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The modus operandi of the American empire has always been a lot more subtle than that of our imperial predecesors, like Britain and Rome. We don't send in the army and install puppets, except as an absolute last resort (Vietnam, Iraq). That looks bad, it's expensive, and it's too much trouble. All we really want is to control other countries' economies and get what we want from them, particularly oil. As much as possible we try to use private companies (with close ties to our government) to do this--that way we can even deny we are an empire! John Perkins shows exactly how this works, the diabolically brilliant way we snooker gullible foreign leaders into taking out huge loans that they'll never be able to repay--this is what Perkins did. He was part of the con job. Then we have them right where we want them--through our proxies we dictate repayment terms that pretty much allow us to run their economies to our liking. I notice some reviewers have questioned how believable the book is, but it doesn't seem particularly outlandish to me. This isn't 007 stuff. There are no secret weapons or mind control drugs or super villains here. Perkins just shows, step by step, how America gets it's way through far less flamboyant means. But it's not just cold analysis--it's Perkins own story, written in the first person, of how he came to see how evil this all was and finally got out of the game. It's a fascinating, sometimes appalling, but ultimately hopeful story."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Ever wonder why Paul Wolfowitz was promoted to the World Bank, the answer is in John Perkins',intriquing Confessions of an Economic Hit Man. It lays bare the system of corporate imperilism. It is also a good read and will broaden the readers mind."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I was introduced to this book on Free Speech TV. Before purchasing the book, I read the user reviews on Amazon. There were over 100 reviews in all. I was most interested in reading the negative reviews. Although they varied in content, several of the harshest critics repeated three common themes: 1. The book is not backed up by facts and figures, 2. The book is based on circumstantial evidence, and 3. Although the book is short on fact much of it is probably true.Confessions of An Economic Hit Man is an eye-opening and harrowing insider's view (confession) of the United States government's role as chief architect of a corporatocracy based on an unholy alliance of major corporations, international banks, and colluding governments. The game, as described by John Perkins, is to use debt to draw poor countries (e.g. Ecuador, Panama) into the global empire. That is, the US loans billions of dollars for infrastructure development with the promise of long-term economic benefits to the disenfranchised (poor people) living in these impoverished countries. The role of the author, a self described EHM (economic hit man), is to forecast (inflate and distort) the long-term benefits. Once accepted the loans are funneled directly from the US government to hand picked US corporations (e.g., Bechtel, Halliburton, and others) in what amount to no-bid contracts. Although the recipient countries never touch the money nor participate in choosing who the contracts should be awarded to, they then incur billions of dollars in debt for loans that they will never be able to repay monetarily. The loans can then only be repaid in votes in the UN that are favorable to the US, granting the US land for military bases, allowing their natural resources to be exploited, or for any number of other nefarious purposes. In the end, none of the impoverished or disenfranchised reaps any benefit from the initial deal. In other words, it is a sophisticated shake down scheme - extortion that is long on increasing the wealth and power of the wealthiest and most powerful, and short on professed human rights.The author explains that when this doesn't work in countries that have leaders with some integrity, the \\"jackals\\" (i.e. CIA) are sent in. He offers the deaths of President Jaime Roldos of Ecuador and General Omar Torrijos of Panama, just two months apart in 1981 and both in airplane \\"crashes,\\" as examples.Finally, Perkins asserts, when the jackals are not effective, a premise to take military action follows. In sum, the progression Perkins presents is: economic hit men, jackals, and military action.He also goes on to describe EHM's role with countries that do not need to incur debt (e.g. Saudi Arabia) and how they fit into the global economy and become strange bedfellows with the US. All of this provides some insight into current world events and how the US is viewed (detested) by much of the rest of the world.Is this book simply a guilt-induced confessional that is short on facts and long on the confessor's self- flagellation and US-bashing? as some of the critics suggest. Or is it an accurate treatise on US foreign relations and empire building? Read the book and decide for yourself. As for me...Confessions of An Economic Hit Man offers a window that most of our media, controlled by huge international corporations, will never provide us."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"\\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man,\\" by John Perkins is a glaring look at a funding system aimed at outfoxing an unsuspecting customer. This is a true story...Perkins was a highly paid chief econonmist sent out to cheat countries around the globe out of billions of dollars. The author comes face-to-face with the fact that he was a financial slaver...he inflated forecasts to enhance his firm's profitability and to saddle nations with debt. Moreover, the system he promoted encouraged world leaders to become part of a vast network that promoted U.S. commercial interests.Perkins coins a term, \\"corporatocracy\\" which basically revolves around the concept that the rich get richer...and the poor get poorer. He admits the system is based on corrupting public figures abroad and that it did not take kindly to public figures who refused to be corrupted. He cites the cases of Ecuador President Jaime Roldos (who was killed in a helicopter crash on May 24, 1981) and Panama President Omar Torrijos (who was killed in a plane crash on July 31, 1981) as two leaders who stood for the right of their countries to determine their own destinies...and infers they became casualties of the \\"jackals\\" who enforced the system.Executives in the author's firm had a mentality that they, \\"milk the cow until the sun sets on our retirement.\\" Perkins concludes that the system fostered a global empire of powerful American firms who where self-centered, self-serving, greedy and materialistic. Ultimately, Perkins hated his life as a chief economist and loathed who he was. Hence, he wrote this book to cleanse his soul. On a balanced note, it is hard to swallow all of Perkin's \\"confessions.\\" However, there is enough highly credible evidence to support the strongest allegations in this book. Recommended.Bert Ruiz"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The early chapters of this book tell a vivid and compelling story, the middle chapters provide an eye-opening view of the geopolitical role of the US in South and Central America. At the end of the book, however, this former \\"economist\\" misses an opportunity to make a closing argument for a more enlightened foreign policy that addresses the problems he identifies.He might have tried to assess the quantitative impact (remember he was an economist) of all this forced development on natural resources and poverty around the world. Or he might have cataloged the ongoing projects that we should be concerned about. Or he might have suggested how the US, the World Bank and the many other public and private agents of progress might go about bringing real quality of life improvements to developing countries while minimizing the resulting ecological destruction and economic servitude. And he might have offered specific solutions for the pollution and poverty he describes in Indonesia. Instead, he recommends some laughably nave new age community activities such as \\"expressing feelings triggered by this....book [by e-mail]\\".Ultimately, this author comes across as another self-absorbed frat boy who makes friends in high places easily, eventually sees the error of his ways and repents with endless mea culpas throughout this book. Yet much of this book is well worth reading as a sketch of some of the pernicious effects of unbridled development on more primitive and fragile cultures than our own and of the driving forces that cause them. But I suggest you look elsewhere for solutions."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins' book joins a long list of anti-American pamphlets from this publishing company. All devised to look like some sexy tell-all full of back-story and intrigue, they are all poorly written, entirely unsubstantiated, overtly bogus fictional pieces designed to tear down America, American businesses and truth.If you believe this book is actually about some guilt-ridden ex-spy for American global interests, think again. This guy had no affiliation with any US government agency and he basically tells you so. The crimes he details were his own. If you read it, you will get heavy doses of commentary about how the author met Jesus - yes, the one and only - and his suggestions that we should have lost our past wars and that our founding father would be rooting for our failure today. Perkins should be deported. He is no American.The success of this book is a fluke not likely to be repeated by this company or this author. The truth is out. Everything in this book is a TALL tale. Everyone closely associated with its publication should be called to answer for its horrible lies."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is a compelling account of economic imperialism conducted by global corporations from America mostly. If author John Perkin's claims are true, that he and other economic hit men ensnared poor countries with debts that they would not be able to repay, then I think that it would be fair to forgive the debt. I don't know how exactly that could be done since the loan was done by a corporation, not government.I had reservations about his suggestions that America should save or feed the world. I think other nations are ultimately responsible for taking care of their own, and would rather do it on their own, as a matter of pride. From what I've read, western countries have been helping poor countries with food and medicine, which has caused the population explosion because the aid was not tied to birth control. The result has been that millions starve, instead of thousands.The book is an interesting character study of the author's own personality. On the one hand, Perkins is the peace corps humanitarian who ventures beyond the tourists areas, the home away from home insulated from the slums and the poverty in the poor countries. On the other hand, Perkins is the corporate raider who wants to seal the crooked deal by any means necessary, and then rationalize later that he's not doing anything too terribly wrong. --And the MONEY! Oh the MONEY! He can finally move into the ranks of the upper class, whereas before he was just barely middle class. He struggles with himself as to which persona will win out, the raider or the humanitarian. Gradually, as he gets older, he becomes less the raider and more the humanitarian, following the vision he had of the \\"Black Jesus\\". He also struggles with what class he will ally himself with. Will he support the efforts of the poor to live well or will he just concentrate on doing the bidding of the corporate class and keep moving up the ladder with his own self-interest in mind. He represents what the American personality may be like, wanting to help as he exploits and give and as he takes away.Some may even say that this is how the rich Anglo man does his crimes, as opposed to how others do it. He doesn't have a monopoly on evil, but he does his share. A lot of what is done is legal, but unethical, and by impoverishing countries with debt, it robs the poor of even the basics for a good life: decent food, clothing, plumbing, housing, jobs, and education. Poor countries spend most their money paying off debt to construction and engineering companies such as Perkin's own Chas T. Main, and others like Bechtel, Brown and Root, and Halliburton through loans given by the World Bank and the IMF. They don't have much left over for the basic needs of the populace. Although I reasoned the countries were probably poor before the economic hit men arrived, Perkins makes the argument that they have become even poorer since the arrival of the new conquistadors. Part of the reason for the strategy of getting poor countries into debt is to make them subservient to the will of global corporations who wish to have a reliable source for resources from a country totally beholden to them. In this sense, Perkins is anti-globalist, rather than against what he fears is the making of an American empire.The process of exploitation begins with the economic hit man who tries to convince the poor country to build more infrastructure than they can afford, then goes to the World Bank and convinces them to make a huge loan that the country will not be able to repay. The wealthy families in the poor countries will get their cut of the money, but the governments and people will be saddled with huge debts. If a leader of a country refuses to accept the deal that will benefit the global corporation, then the CIA \\"jackals\\" are sent in to assassinate him. Leaders who stand up for the interests of their people are ones who are assassinated. Such leaders are often labeled communist, socialist, or terrorist, whether they are or not. If attempts on his life fail, then the US army is sent in, such as when they invaded Panama.Perkins has a global perspective on what would be good for the world, not just America or corporations. He also liked Jimmy Carter's Panama Canal deal which gave it to the Panamanians because he thinks it was good deal for everyone, even though Americans had to swallow their pride and it give it up.A lot of the media in the US gives us a distorted view of what is going on in the rest of the world, not getting the full story, and not talking to average people in other countries about how they feel about their governments and the American government. They often just talk to those who rule the country. Often the viewpoints that we get from the news support only what \\"the powers that be\\" want us to believe.This is a greedy white man story to be eaten up at campuses everywhere. They like this sort of thing there.War Is A Racket is also a similar book in which a former general finally realizes he was fighting \\"to keep the world safe for United Fruit\\".I bet Noam Chomsky keeps this book right by his bedside. It supports his views about America's economic imperialism.America may one day become a poor nation because of the machinations of international banks and corporations, governments, and wealthy families, and may experience some of the injustices other people have to put up with. Until then, I don't expect much empathy with their cause. Enemies of the common people act globally, therefore we have to be aware of what is going in the rest of the world."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I hate to say this, but book reviews of \\"Confessions of an Economoc Hit Man\\" all miss the most important fact staring them in the face - that Perkins is obviously a paranoid schizophrenic. And because this lapse lent apparent legitimacy to his ramblings the book became a best seller. The entire book is about a conspiracy, describing how a hidden elite, the \\"economic hit men\\" or EHM, have been manipulating huge foreign aid programs to the advantage of a \\"corporatocracy\\" over the last half century. Once you become an EHM you are \\"in for life\\" and are not allowed to talk about what you do. You deal with heads of state, forcing them to accept huge infrastructure loans from IMF or the World Bank and thus put their countries into debt to the corporatocracy and keep them obedient to the will of the US. This makes the United States \\"the greatest empire the world has ever known.\\" When these EHM fail to coerce a foreign leader the CIA \\"jackals\\" will kill them, as happened to Panamanian president Omar Torrijos and others. And if the jackals fail too, as happened in Iraq, the United States armed forces will step in. But he gives us no inkling of who the higher-ups might be who have orchestrated this conspiracy for the last half century. And except for his encounters with locals he does not give us enough specifics for any particular operation that he himself participated in. Plus, any evidence that other EHMs actually exist is missing. But most revealing is his story about a mysterious \\"Claudine\\" and how he became an EHM. While sitting in the reference section of Charles T. Main, his employer,\\"an attractive brunette\\" suddenly appeared and sat across from him. \\"I've been asked to help in your training\\" she said to him. But it turned out that this \\"training\\" did not take place at the office. \\"Beginning the next day, we met at Claudine's Beacon Street apartment\\" he says. \\"During our first hour together, she explained that my position was an unusual one and that we needed to keep everythng highly confidential. She told me that no one had given me specifics about my job because no one was authorized to -- except her. Then she informed me that her assignment was to mold me into an economic hit man. I confessed ignorance about the role of economic hit men. \`You're not alone,' she laughed. \`We're a rare breed, in a dirty business. No one can know about your involvement -- not even your wife.' Then she turned serious. \`I'll be very frank with you, teach you all I can during the next weeks. Then you'll have to choose. Your decision is final. Once you're in, you're in for life.' About the hitmen Claudine had to say: \\"We're a small, exclusive club. We're paid -- well paid -- to cheat countries around the globe out of billions of dollars.\\" The membership of this club was determined by the US intelligence agencies who identified prospective EHMs to be hired by international corporations. After being \\"trained\\" by Claudine he goes out to Indonesia. When he returns he wants to see Claudine again but Claudine has disappeared. \\"I was dismayed to find that her phone was disconnected, with no forwarding number. I went looking for her. A young couple had moved into her apartment... they professed to know nothing about Claudine. I paid a visit to the real estate agency... they had never rented to anyone with that name... MAIN's employment office also claimed to have no record of her.\\" And, of course, all the meetings took place in her apartment, not at the office. We are asked to believe here that an elaborate deception to cover her tracks has taken place from day one when he met her. A much more likely explanation is that he fabricated the entire Claudine incident himself. If you saw the movie \\"Beautiful Mind\\" which is based on real life you will remember that the protagonist, who was a schizoprenic mathematician, imagined that he had meetings with a secret agent who gave him assignments to fulfill. There is an eerie parallel with this secret agent and \\"Claudine\\" who first told Perkins that he was to be an economic hit man. If the rest of the book were more believable you could take the incident at face value but I am not. It fits the conspiratorial tone of the rest of the book. Schizophrenics can appear normal except when the topic involves their particular delusion. Much of what is in the book is true but common knowledge. But read it at your own risk: when it comes to his interpretation of hidden meanings expect ingenious distortions by a schizophrenic mind."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I heard John Perkins twice on Democracy Now! (KPFK) in Los Angeles, and he tells a compelling story, but the book is not a good read. He vacillates between self-aggrandizement and self-deprecation. The book seems like it could have used a better copywriter or a ghost writer. It simply did not present well. It could have been presented in a third the space or less.That being said, I feel the concept set forth in the book is one that should be articulated. Kudos to Mr. Perkins for the attempt. During the interview I believe him to have said he had considered writing a fictionalised verison. My advice: Do it, but please, o! please, get a ghost writer."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"anyone who is even remotely interested in why there is terrorism in the world and what we can do about it, should read this book.

I bought this book for my dad, a die-hard Republican, in hopes that maybe, just maybe it'll open his eyes to the way our government operates.

As someone who has been working in economic development and foreign direct investment for the past 6 years the material was especially interesting on a number of levels. The stories about developing electric infrastructure in developing nations are interesting, and seemingly plausible, but a little light on details. Certainly there are some covert deals being made behind the scenes between big multinational corporations and governments. However, as companies are now more international than ever before it is implausible to believe that these firms are still only concerned with supporting the home country's strategic interests abroad (take the current situation with China for example). What's really surprising is that Chas T Main, the economic hit man's employer, who seeming had so much power and influence on global development during the past 50 years no longer exists (was acquired by Parsons in '92). Overall, this book is an entertaining read offering a good balance of anecdotal stories, economic development, and geopolitical history."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It was a good story, possibly worthy of an Atlantic or Vanity Fair printing, but to make a whole book of it was a great stretch. The last half of the book was interminable; I only finished the book because I started it.Perhaps had this book been ghost-written it would have been more tolerable. But once the novelty of the story wears off (about halfway through the book) the amateurish writing style becomes grating. This is nothing new. I've read books by several successful businessmen who thought they were authors, and they just don't have it. Give me Fitzgerald or Dostoyevsky anyday.

From the first few pages of the book, Perkins reveals himself for the propagandist that he is -- not to mention the fact that his writing style is trite, unintelligent and riddled with cliches.He seems to take great pains to explain the unbelievable weaknesses in this book. Like when an \\"editor\\" supposedly asked him if they really call themselves \\"Economic Hit Men.\\" His answer (paraphrased), \\"Well, yeah. Only we just use the acronym EHM.\\" COME ON. GIVE ME A BREAK! Are we in elementary school here? They're going to call themselves EHMs? That's when I knew this book was just a big, fat lie from cover to cover.Just by the way he writes, you can tell that this book is not only pure fiction, but pure fiction with an agenda. He writes like a five-year-old talks when he's trying to convince his parents that he didn't break the lamp. Only, he didn't really break the lamp and he's trying to convince us that he did.Too much unbelievable information, too little credibility and \\"facts\\" that are impossible to verify. His vignettes are so outrageously unbelivable, one can only surmise that he thought they'd be so unbelievable that most people would believe them.If you still want to read this book, do yourself a favor: go check it out from the library.

He refers to things in the past that he thought were coincidences at the time - this book is a collection of delusions that evolved these real life \\"coincidences\\" into this far-fetched, paranoid story. His faith in the efficiency of U.S. government and corporations (evidenced through his \\"recruitment\\" - which is hilarious - and employment during the book) is naive at best - I wish America to be as efficient and calculating as he seems to think it is in this book - the country could only hope. He also totally ignores the roles of the \\"victim\\" countries themselves in their troubles, and provides few facts in any argument. If you want to read another book about how America does everything wrong, and every other people of the world is our victim (without any concrete facts), this would be a good choice."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Not For the Serious-MindedI read this book because I was intrigued by a claim that the author had influenced the economic policies of other nations. Unfortunately, it is clear from the start that the author has little formal training or education in economics. In fact, the whole book has little to do with economics. If it were just about consulting, politics and an accurate description of historical events, it might still be ok. Instead, it's just a heavily-embellished narration of one man's mundane life.Some parts are glaringly absurd. On page 54 he asserts that the old-timer Howard was fired because he \\"only\\" forecast an 8% annual increase in electrical demand for the island of Java over the following 45 yrs, or a 3000% increase (a figure that turned out to be about right), while the author decided in Faustian fashion to forecast 19% x 12 yrs followed by 17% x 8 yrs, followed by 15% for the twenty-five years thereafter. Fine, but could no one reviewing his work perform simple math calculations? A 93,000% growth prediction?! On the other hand, hundreds of reviewers gave this book five stars, so there doesn't seem to be a shortage of people lacking critical analytical skills.Reviewer Barry Khan got it right; Claudine Martin was a simple affair, turned into a character in a spy novel by the author's fertile imagination."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Although the economical imperialism that he describes could be accurate his role is obviously exaggerated and much of the book seems to be made up in order to make his boring job as an economist seem more important than it was.

Obviously anti-Christian, Mr. Perkins rejects the doctrine of total depravity and chooses to believe that the mostly good, environmentally sensitive population of the earth is oppressed by a complex conspiracy run by a few evil--mostly republican--men."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"PRO: At the end of the book, he says you, the reader, are the reason the world is the way it is. After listening to his nonstop bashing of corporations and governments, I expected him to conclude with a final \\"coup de grace\\" on those two entities, but I was wrong! He puts the blame where it should be: all of us. We are those people in the corporations and the governments reflect what we want. If we want to blame someone, let's start with ourselves. I commend Perkins for saying that. \\"Any fool can criticise, and most fools do,\\" said Andrew Carnegie. Those few paragraphs almost took the book to two stars. Unfortunately, the rest of it was terrible.CONS: Many other reviewers will point out the myriad of flaws and shortcomings of this book. I'll illustrate how Perkins would read all these one star reviews. He would say:- They're written by jackals, government officials, and corporate hitmen trying to discredit me.- They're people who are so naive that they don't understand how the real world works. They say this is a fantasy. It's no fantasy, baby, this was real life!PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT OF PERKINS: Perkins is a man filled with regret. He dreamed of living an exciting life, but ended up living just a mediocre one. For example:- He wanted to go to Ivy League Schools, but went to a ho-hum schools.- He wanted to be an executive, but he never got beyond middle management.- He wanted to be a spy for the NSA, but all he got was an interview.- He wanted to live a glamourous life, but he got all the pedestrian glamour of a typical international corporate job.- He wanted babes, but he just got a divorce and a few flings.In short, he feels like a failure. He's frustrated by that so he's decided to reinterpret his whole life, make it more exciting, boost his ego a bit by writing a book that makes his life seem more interesting than it was. He fills it with cloak and dagger intrigue, but there's really nothing there. It's obvious that it's all in his mind.He depicts himself as an \\"insider,\\" but offers scant interesting insider stuff. Most of his theories are backed by his daily news source: the NY Times.His opinion that construction projects drive our economy and decisions is wrong. Foreign infrastructure projects make up less than 1% of the US government budget and not even 0.1% of our economy. Furthermore, he says that \\"very few\\" benefit from the new electricity plants we build in Ecuador or Indonesia. Really? So we build a multi-billion dollar plant to power three rich people's homes? Wrong. Thousands of poor people benefit from the roads and electricity plants. That's why they invite us there. Duh! Do we also benefit? Sure! We probably wouldn't do it otherwise! DUH!The other irritation about this book is that he thinks he's making novel arguments, when they're usually obvious to all. For example, corporatations are self-interested. Wow. I never would have guessed that. Let's add: humans are self-interested. What do you expect Exxon to do? Sell oil for less than it costs them to make it? Do you expect the salesman of a construction firm to not try to get the best deal he can get for his company? Doesn't he want to get a bonus and send his children to a good college?He whines about people working for a dollar a day in \\"sweatshops.\\" Are we holding them at gunpoint? No. On the contrary, people in Asia work at Nike's factories to earn their $1 a day for two reasons:1. It's better than getting 50 cents a day, which is what the local companies pay. Working for a foreign company is PRESTIGIOUS and coveted.2. Their daily costs are 90 cents a day. Some love to focus on how little people in third world countries make, but they often forget how little it costs them to live. Imagine their conversations about us: \\"It costs $100/day to live in America. How do they do it? We're much better off here because it costs just 90 cents per day.\\" There are two sides of the equation, Perkins.CONCLUSION: There were only two reasons I listened to this misleading and overrated book till the end. First, my friend recommended it. Second, I was curious to see what SOLUTION he proposed. It's easy to complain. But what do you think we should do instead?As I mentioned at the beginning, he places part of the blame on you and me. Great. Well said. Now what? He tells us to drive less. I bet he drives and flies much more than any of us because he's promoting his book. He tell us that we should have a more fair world. That we should have medical services available for all, information should be widespread, and that we should think of the consequences of our actions. Blah... blah.. blah... as you can see: no specifics. Why not? Because it's nobody would like to do what would need to be done. He's asking us to change human nature. Sorry, Perkins, it's ain't going to happen. And Perkins is proof that it won't happen because lives in a nice house, buys food from corporations, votes for the political establishment, doesn't send 50% of his income to third world countries, etc....Get this if you want to laugh."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"A unique perspective on US foreign policy. I just couldn't put this book down."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is so eager to unmask the imperial project of the last 35 years that it has prompted USINFO.STATE.GOV to put up a page about it in its \`Identifying Misinformation archive'. So far, so good.Much of what the book says about the shared imperial aspirations of state and business flows logically, with a capitalist eye for self-interest, profit and market dominance. Therefore, the author's frequent early references to feeling guilty about his deeds does tend to sensationalize his role in an approach to money-making which is still current - in occupied Iraq, for example.For me, the book really comes alive when Perkins recounts the sights, sounds and smells of Indonesia - his first destination as an economic hit man. Perkins writes very well here and draws you into his world. I actually finished the 225 page story in a day, but frequent breaks in the narrative do break its intimacy. That said, this book is full of little-reported insights, personalities and acts from history which crystallize a truth. Government, military and intelligence services serve the interests of big business and profit.Who benefits from this deceit? Well, there in lies the dilemma; arguably most Western citizens... through cheap oil.'For every $100 of crude taken out of the Ecuadorian rain forests, the oil companies receive $75.

The 277 pages or so of the new, revised edition are excessive when Perkins could have told his story in less than half that. He spends most of the book hinting at scandal, but gives few real details. I will give him credit for stating the relationship between the economic aid distributed by World Bank and the IMF to the \\"Third World\\" and how their politics keeps these countries impoverished (something that should come to no surprise to anyone in this day and age). However, this book is nothing more than a self-serving \\"tell-all\\" by Perkins who repeatedly says he knows he's doing wrong but decides to stay in for the money, until he has enough to get out. The book is repetitive, too obsessed with his repressed sex life, and definitely not worth buying.

Its chief flaw is the ease with which it misleads the reader. As the title indicates, the author says he is an 'Economic Hit Man,' and the description suggests that Perkins was some kind of special covert agent of the United States government, taking direct orders from a government conspiracy to hurt other countries' economies.Once you begin reading the book, you discover that Perkins' story is nothing like this. What you discover is that Perkins was not part of a conspiracy. He simply had a lucrative business career in international development and feels guilty about it.For reasons that are unclear, Perkins exaggerated estimates of the development potential for various countries. The result was that the countries became indebted to the United States. This is what Perkins is referring to when he says he was an 'Economic Hit Man.' He exaggerated estimates in plain view of his clients and employers. His clients and employers apparently didn't call him on it, and may have actually approved of what he is saying.When I discovered this, I had a gut check: He compares this to being a 'hit man'? Looks to me like Perkins actually had very little authority over the development projects in his career. He provided advice -- advice that could be freely analyzed, accepted or rejected by anyone receiving it.Perkins was hardly the only one giving advice on these subjects, and he never claimed to be anyone other than an employee of a private sector company that stood to benefit from high estimates. If there is a \\"hit man\\" in these scenarios, it isn't Perkins -- its the foolish leaders who didn't second guess self-interested men like this author.This isn't the only example of highly misleading content. Perkins also says that he was \\"bribed\\" and \\"blackmailed\\" into staying inside the conspiracy. It turns out that the 'bribes' and 'blackmail' he experiences are quite prosaic and should hardly count as blackmail at all.For example, one of his later employers asks him not to publish anything political. To Perkins, this is 'blackmail' -- the government conspiracy threatening him by speaking through his boss. To me, it looks like a normal employer who doesn't want employees embarrassing his company by publishing diatribes. For anyone with a business career, it is quite commonplace. Perkins offers no reason to think that the employer was asked to do this by the government.At various other points in his life, Perkins is about to publish his memoirs when someone asks him to join a firm. The pay is good. To Perkins, this is a deliberate attempt to distract him from his tell-all by the higher powers. To me, it sounds like a company needed a consultant. Perkins offers no reason to suspect that a government conspiracy was involved. In fact, it is quite astonishing that he would refer to these occasions as 'blackmail' and 'bribes' on such flimsy basis.I wanted to read this book because I have never heard of 'Economic Hit Men.' I am thoroughly educated in the US intelligence, military and diplomatic history and bureaucratic structure over the past 50 years, and had never heard of something like an 'Economic Hit Man.' Countless spies, special operators and diplomats have published memoirs. I've read most of them. None of them mentioned anything like an 'Economic Hit Man'. I picked this book because my curiosity was piqued.It was disturbing to discover that Perkins offers no evidence for such a conspiracy whatsoever. The closest he comes is to describe a brief, secret relationship with a mysterious female employee of his international consulting firm. This employee \\"trains\\" Perkins to be an \\"Economic Hit Man\\" but Perkins never asks who she works for. He is provided no incentive to do the work -- no salary, bribes or anything. He knows the woman for a month and never sees her again for the rest of his life.Nonetheless, we're lead to believe that Perkins goes along with the conspiracy. First of all, it is highly disingenuous for Perkins to suggest that he'd go along with this. As though he's that stupid -- a mysterious person appears in his life, tells him to wreak havoc on the developing world and he just goes at it, no questions asked.More importantly, no US government agency would do this. It would be incredibly bad tradecraft for a US covert operative to offer no incentive or money to Perkins or to fail to follow up with him throughout his career. Why would a government agency visit Perkins in such a way? They risk having an operative exposed without any reason to suspect he'll perform. They have no way of confirming that he'll make the right decisions in the future or guiding him. Why would they never visit him again -- even though he hadn't even started the most important cases in his career?On the positive side, the book does give an interesting perspective on the last 50 years of economic and geopolitical history -- although one highly sympathetic to the anti-establishment American and European left. Most frustrating, however, is the author's inability to take responsibility for his own actions. According to Perkins, he knows he's a part of an evil conspiracy for nearly all of his career -- but he just keeps playing along.In the end, this book appears to be the memoirs of a man who became rich in spite of being mediocre and destructive. It is much easier for Perkins to blame his destructiveness on a \\"conspiracy\\" than to simply take responsibility -- which he NEVER does. As a result, we get this highly misleading and dishonest book. Save yourself the trouble and don't buy this book.There is absolutely no reason to. If you're worried about the spread of capitalism, \\"corporatocracy\\" and the role of the United States government in enhancing these trends, there are much more honest accounts. If you're looking for a sober look at how the United States achieves its foreign policy objectives, you'll find nothing reliable here and a lot of highly suspicions suggestions. That's right, I said \\"suggestions.\\" The author doesn't even have the honesty to spell out many of his claims. He prefers to make most of them suggestively via innuendo rather than with evidence that can be verified through other sources. Do not buy this deeply dishonest book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am willing to believe that Dan Perkins believes everything in his book, and I don't believe that he thought he was telling an outward lie, and largely, there are parts of the book, I am sure are true.Those parts, are the sections that are easily checked by history books, with multiple reliable sources. The invasion of Panama, the creation of Panama as a state, Allende's political destruction and so forth. These events which serve as context of Perkins book, are historical fact. Furthermore, the memoirs section of COEH which serve as a narrative, are also hard to dispute.What Perkins does, and in a awkwardly clumsy way, is an argument of the progression of force. He says that these EHM (Economic Hit Men) come in to countries and try to push crippling economic models onto unknowing countries to lure them into debt. The words written here are as much proof of that as anybody who read this book will ever receive. He never, at any point, provides any evidence to support this argument. These deity statements are so prevalent in this book, that it becomes exhausting. The thesis itself is not an impossible one, although is never actually \\"proven\\"The book only grows more ludicrous from there. The book suggests that if the International Economic institutions fail, then the CIA attempts to assassinate the troublesome leader and failing that, the army invades. He highlights South America as his thesis. This in itself is unfair. The backdrop for this period reflects a time of massive imperialism by the United States. In the context of the Cold War, the US was acting in a completely irrational manner, that lead to our own age of Imperialism. Although it seems fair to argue that both military and economic policies were being used to disable these countries, the idea that they work in collusion, seems unlikely.I take special exception to the same argument being made in Iraq 1. The first Iraq war had the unity of even Muslim and OPEC states, including the Arab League. The idea of pushing an army out of another country as an example of economic imperialism is bizarre. However Perkins and his incessant use of the term \\"pound of flesh\\" pushes forward, demanding that this is the truth.Lastly, this book is stifled by an attempt to assure Perkins' self worth. Perkins, admittedly has trouble with his own life and the decisions he made. He does however, in this book, come off as egomaniacal. I believe that he works very hard to assure that everybody thinks he is important, and it is because of him that economies crashed and burned. He speaks extensively in this book about threats he received, and dangers to his life and his family's. He documents one of these threats, as a negotiation where he was offered millions of dollars to serve as a name in a company to help them sell to clients. The shivers that go down your spine at such a threat like that would likely scare even the smallest of men. Perkins often becomes so self involved, that he highlights these small accounts, and acts as if they were the greatest events that ever occurred in History.Perkins desperately wants to be important, and maybe this book made him that. Good for him, too bad I wasted the money reading the book helping him get there."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I am a 20-year-old American female and heretofore not the least bit interested in politics. I wanted something fictional (or at least fun) to read. A friend had to promise me an \\"easy read\\" to get me to read \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" --and it was.I think this book was written exactly for people like me: Americans just trying to enjoy the American way of life and wondering at the back of our minds what people in other countries are protesting so vehemently about. Why are there so many \\"insurgents\\"? Why are we kidnapper-bait all over the world? I mean, why does someone I've never met hate me (and other Americans) so much?I've often wondered why people in other countries were always fighting and couldn't seem to get it together until we came in and decimated them. Now, I have what seems to me to be a viable explanation: the international construction companies (with headquarters often housed in the U.S. embassy) can't make their unconscionable profits until the war-torn area needs to be rebuilt.This book also offers explanations that seem to make sense for why the conservatives were so mad at Jimmy Carter over Panama, what the deal was with NAFTA, and why the oil companies and other multi-nationals don't act like kindly American businesses just trying to help our neighbors in distress.I have to say though, CONSERVATIVES WON'T LIKE IT. (Especially if they are Christian conservatives and still pretending that world-dominance-at-all-costs is in keeping with the spirit of the bible.)I think people in other countries should read this book too. They need to understand that the reason many good-hearted and decent Americans don't understand their issues is because it is very hard to get news (health care, jobs, or disaster relief)here.Now I understand how the liberal issues of child slavery, world destruction of natural resources, fair trade, and disappointment with the World Bank are all part of a reaction to the conservative right's brutal drive for world domination.I have to hand it to John Perkins for writing this book. A lot of Americans have participated in some capacity in the subjugation of other people. Most of them do NOT have the integrity of a John Perkins who admits what he did, that he did it knowingly, and that he did it for money and power.This is certainly not the best book you will ever read.

In this book, Perkins gives an account of his days as an Economic Hit Man (EHM). Essentially, EHMs flew around the world in the Cold War era and convinced lesser developed countries to borrow enormous sums of money from the World Bank, IMF ADB, etc. based on erroneous and overstated economic statistics. This borrowed money (or sovereign debt) then went to finance large energy and infrastructure projects that ultimately benefited the pockets of large U.S. oil and engineering companies. As employees of private companies, these EHM would never be traced to the U.S. government, but Perkins maintains that the ties between the private and public sector were too close for comfort most of the time. Although the idea behind the book is believable, some of the scenes in the book are not. Yet, Perkins insists that every word and event was true. Some of the more interesting parts of the book explain the U.S. government's deal with Saudi Arabia from behind the scenes and the government's decision to later invade Panama.The later half of the book describes the guilt that Perkins developed while as an EHM and his career after he quit life as an EHM and became a consultant that eventually sold out to the private sector again in the name of greed. However, the tragedy of September 11, 2001 motivated Perkins to come out and tell his story. Even if you choose to not believe every word in this book, much of what we have learned about the U.S. government (and the Bush family) post September 11 ties in closely to the author's thesis. More recently, Perkins has been intimately involved in fighting for the rights of indigenous peoples and the environment, perhaps out of some guilt regarding the irreparable damage that he has helped achieve. All in all, this is a quick and interesting read of a secret lifestyle that many believe continues in the shadows today."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Follow the life of a man who thinks he is going to go help the world but is recruited by the CIA to help them take it over.Easily read book, Author is a very talented writer.I sprung for the hard-back but its worth having either way."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins does a very good job at telling his story.

However, the way the author ends the book, which includes shallow descriptions of his feelings and advice on what \\"you\\" can do to make things better, makes me feel like it should be in the self-help section.The book could be read as two: one history, one a character study (nothing much of a confession.) The author is clearly imaginative, a master at marketing, and an expert at self-deception. He would be an interesting character study, like a modern Boswell, if he were honest enough with the details of his own actions to confess something worth the scrutiny.This book would be better if it were either a historical perspective on US foreign policy or a self-help book for people overwhelmed by and distrustful of the demands and policies of capitalism. It fails and annoys in its effort to be both historical and therapeutic. This was on my Christmas list, but by the last quarter of the book I was so overcome by the author's inflated ego I was just glad I read it as a loaner and didn't willingly give him any of my hard-earned money."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The making and reflections of a manipulator at the service of US Impreial economic and political forces. A good introduction for the deceived, but too narrow for the well informed."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"From the reviews I've read, I must conclude some people just don't get it. To separate politics from economics is a false dichotomy. The accumulation of capital is predicated on private property. Property relations are enforced by governments. Governments are the local monopoly on violence. Governments act in the interest of the factions that control them. The first order of business of a powerful faction is to protect its base of power, which is its property. Thus, the ultimate economic force is violence in the interest of private property. This may be a mystery to most Americans, but for the vast majority of people on this planet, it's an everyday reality. They see the violence in crushing debt, starvation, low commodity prices, foreign goods below the cost of production, unemployment, poor or nonexistent medical care, and the thousand other things that make their lives miserable. When in the course of their human events they rise against their oppressors, they meet with corrupt militaries or death squads.John Perkins' story of an EMH is one of the few that puts the pieces together. He tells why corruption, violence, and the IMF and World Bank seem to show up in the same place at the same time. It's no coincidence. It's IMF and World Bank policy. These institutions are not charities. They are the shaft of the spear. John Perkins was the spear point. This isn't speculation from some ivory tower. Mr. Perkins shook hands with people who bucked the system and paid with their lives.I would have preferred to see the book written in the style of Noam Chomsky or Howard Zinn, so I'll nick a sliver of a star from my rating. Mr. Perkins gives us an account of the nuts and bolts of how poverty is thrust upon people who have the misfortune of living on top of resources coveted by outsiders. The outsiders being of course people in nice suits with way too much money and power. His book dispels the fantasy that capitalism and global economics are about prosperity for all. For that it should be required reading."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I read Confessions a few months ago. It felt all wrong then. The story seemed contrived. The claims seemed false. From an enjoyment or thought-provoking perspective, there wasn't much there either. I put it out of mind until this week when I read the news about the G8 deciding to forgive billions of dollars of debt owed by the poorest nations. Apparently, almost all third world debt is being eliminated.NOT MAGICALLY. It is being eliminated primarily because the US is agreeing to shoulder the burden of unpaid debts and broken commitments by corrupt dictators and false revolutionaries--the men and countries Perkins hails as the persecuted. Turns out his whole basis is nonsense. I understand he and his work is being widely repudiated by people of all political stripes.It's nice to see this man's smear campaign and personal agenda has been BUSTED by real and current events that everybody can see. Perkins should return to the third world and hide out. Not because anybody in the US cares about him, but because nobody in the US cares about him.

Mr. Perkins does not simply state the facts, letting the reader arrive at their own conclusion. Instead each \\"confession\\" is glossed over allowing the author to focus on his main objective: vilifying the US domestic policy and capitalism. The utopia he envisions of wealth distribution to the poor is shared by Karl Marx. Although appealing, this system has been disproved by time.Even if the author is telling the truth I find it convenient and hypocritical that he would wait until after the \\"corrupt\\" economic system had made him fabulously wealthy, and then point the finger back at the rest of us telling us how evil money is. Whenever anyone says that money is evil they usually already have enough of it. I doubt that before Mr. Perkins had his multiple houses, yacht, and money for his exotic vacations to see the rain forests that he loves so much he would have \\"confessed\\" to his sins. He enjoys and condemns his capitalistic life simultaneously. I did, however, find this book to be an interesting, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"John Perkins' \\"Confessions\\" is certainly a welcome relief from the hype and self-justification that has defined the prevailing mood of the country since the \\"Greed is Good\\" Reagan era. Perkins defines that attitude as the \\"gospel\\" that \\"all economic growth benefits humankind, and that the greater the growth, the more widespread the benefits.\\" Perkins does an excellent job of dispelling that myth as well as some of the other major myths surrounding our foreign aid policy--the primary one being that \\"aid\\" equals \\"help.\\"Confusing \\"aid\\" with \\"help\\" is logical error considering the fact that the two words are synonymous. However, as Perkins explains, the grants made to mostly third world countries are actually loans. They require repayment, often at disastrous interest rates. To compound the problem, the huge construction projects for which these loans are made (dams, electric plants, etc.) are not only unnecessary, they don't actually help the counties in question. First, the money goes to giant American construction firms, like Bechtel, which are contracted to build the costly projects, not to local builders. Then huge repayments are siphoned out of national treasuries, thereby further impoverishing the citizens of these countries. And who do these costly, draining projects \\"aid\\"? According to Perkins, a mere \\"handful\\" of wealthy families.So, how is this sleight of hand accomplished? Perkins defines himself as an \\"Economic Hit Man (EHM),\\" the person responsible for \\"cooking\\" the statistics justifying the loans which ultimately bankrupt the debtor countries. His job was to convince third world leaders and international banks that the growth forecast for these countries was two, often three times more than could be reasonably assumed. We are a number-driven society, and when it came to convincing skeptics, Perkins' numbers, his self-assured demeanor, and his \\"credentials\\" (ostensibly working for a private corporation) washed away the objections. Also, as Perkins points out, if his \\"reasonable\\" argument did not prevail, there were always the \\"jackals\\"--the CIA. When presidents of insignificant third world countries disagreed, they died under mysterious circumstances. If this sounds a bit cloak and daggerish, it is because Perkins makes it clear that being an EHM is not much different from being an assassin--only without the bloody hands.Throughout this saga of international theft, deception and corruption, Perkins portrays himself as a likable, if somewhat insecure, fellow--a volunteer with the Peace Corps, an idealist. He is a touch nave, but unlike other \\"ugly Americans\\" Perkins seems to genuinely care about the people whose countries he is helping to ruin. In the end, it was that caring that forced him to take stock of his own role in furthering the goals of the \\"monstrous machine,\\" or, what Perkins calls, the \\"corporatocracy.\\"Even as a skeptic, and fully armed with most of the information that Perkins presents about the USAID and IMF, I found this book to be an eye opener. It showed me exactly how young people get sucked into a system that does real harm in the name of good. My only critique of the book is that I wished for a little more detail. (More numbers!) While Perkins does an admirable job of taking us into the shadowy world of EHMs, he doesn't provide a lot of solid backup as to how he managed to manufacture the stats all these banks, leaders and agencies based their decisions on. His explanations of what was happening in the larger world of economics often rely on popular accounts. For example, his description of the 1973 OPEC oil \\"embargo\\" (Chapter 14: Entering a New and Sinister Period in Economic History) is the very stuff of myth which his book seeks to explode. According to Perkins, the \\"embargo\\" brought the \\"industrialized giants to their knees.\\" As an explanation for the economic woes of the 1970s, this is patently false. The supposed embargo was largely symbolic, representing an actual cutback of 5% of oil exports from two countries, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In 1973, the US imported 28% of its oil, 14% of which came from the entire Gulf. (A 5% cutback of this amount isn't even a slap on the wrist, let alone an act which brought the world to its \\"knees.\\") The subsequent price hike in \\"posted price,\\" (resulting in gargantuan profits for the major oil companies as well as the convenient elimination of the independents), was set by US oil refineries, not Saudi Arabia. (See \\"Making Democracy Safe for Oil\\" a book written by Christopher Rand, an expert on the Middle East and former oil industry employee for an excellent discussion of the 1973 \\"oil embargo.\\") Reliable economists usually point to the floating of the dollar in 1971, and the recession that followed in the wake of the Viet Nam War as the primary causes for the upheavals of the mid- to late-70s. Perkins' lack of understanding of these economic facts introduces a sour note in an otherwise compelling tale.However, in spite of Perkins' somewhat paradoxical shortcomings in understanding world economics, this is an invaluable tool for anyone interested in the inner workings of how US aid to foreign countries actually works."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I always knew, this type of Subversion was practiced by the Corporatocracy and the United States Government.I never Really Knew EXACTLY how it was done, until I read Mr. Perkins's Book.The detail, and inside information is such, that it has to be real.A Classic text in Economics, and Hegemony...Well written, and fast paced...The Author goes to the dynamics of our world.A Masterpiece...."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I spent most of my working career overseas on behalf of the U.S. Gov't.There is no such thing as an economic hitman, or any job resembling what Perkins claims he did.This is a total fabrication and Perkins is a con man."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I picked this up at the airport to read on the Shenandoah Valley Regional Airport-Dakar shuttle, and I must confess it didn't live up to my expectations.

In my opinion, he was a pawn in a much larger chess game. I believe it is true that there are influential people and organizations like the World Bank and others that want to get underdeveloped countries to borrow more than they can afford and thereby bring them under their domination and control. As Solomon wrote in the book of Proverbs, \\"The borrower is slave to the lender.\\"Some lesser developed nations can be convinced by outsiders that they can catch up with the developed nations by borrowing lots of money and have the economic benefits of lots of jobs and an expanding economy. The part that they don't quite understand is that they not only become dependent on the lenders, but that their economies cannot grow effectively without an established \\"work ethic\\" within their population; a legal system that is fair; and that there be very little corruption in their national economic system. As CEO of a telecommunications manufacturing company selling products all over the world, I see the bribery, cheating, lying and corruption all the time. It's pathetic.I believe that there is a cosmic spititual presence behind the \\"world system\\" and that the things we see happening now on the international economic scene are all part of a plan to bring about a centralized world economic system under Satanic control. Ultimately, this control will include a centralization of political power, religious power AND economic power. Things are moving in that direction. I believe that there is a worldwide \\"conspiracy\\", but I also believe that the human conspirators are hardly aware of their individual parts in this program. After all, humanly speaking, a strong case can be made to do away with individual nations and have central political control and a single world military to end national strife and end war; a strong case can be made to have a single world wide currency to eliminate trade barriers and currency variations to make international trading easier; and a case can be made to end religious conflict by establishing a single world religion with a \\"World Religious Leader\\" to be the final authority in religious matters\`.

I can see in these reviews just how many other readers resent this author and his message--not because they are part of his imagined conspiracy or somehow politically biased against HIM or somehow naively patriotic or ultra-conservative, but because they have a sense of themselves and can smell dishonesty. I have so many criticisms of this book, I do not know where to start. Instead, I am copying and pasting a very old review (March) that seems to capture my sentiments exactly:\\"This book did well to expose the actions of the US government, international banks and the oil companies, especially in regard to Panama/Torrios/Noriega and Ecuador/Roldos, and Perkins is at his best when describing his personal experience in these countries. It is very disturbing that the U.S. Government assassinated leaders and invaded for revenge or to satisfy corporate interests, and clearly this must be brought to light.However, Perkins does not seem to be able to distinguish between valid international economic activity and that which he classifies as being Economic Hit Man (\\"EHM\\")-related. For example, if someone owned a firm that produced aluminum and needed bauxite ore that was available, say in Myanmar, how would they go about making deals to acquire the resources that their company needed? Wouldn't they need to work with government people and the local mining companies, and figure out how to best make a deal? Doesn't the fact that the bauxite miners then have one more customer for their product benefit them? The same thing is true of the oil companies that Perkins continually criticizes - they have certainly done bad things: payoffs, corruption, pollution, etc. but they have also done many good things as well. Their goal is not to screw people over (although they have certainly been guilty of that at times, and need to be brought to account), but to sell a product and make money for their company, and there is nothing intrinsically wrong with that. They are not the Satan that he makes them out to be. (BTW, I have no association with any oil company.)Another example of this from the book is Perkins' analysis of the deals done in Saudi Arabia. What is wrong with American companies trying to sell goods and services to the Saudis to \\"repatriate petrodollars\\"? He perhaps has a point about selling the deal by putting a gun to the Saudi's head, but he said very little about that critical aspect. However, his pejorative statements like, \\"we could then sell them things that required continual upgrading and maintenance\\" - how is that any different than buying a car, or installing a computer system from a specific vendor in your office? You will have to rely on that company to some degree for maintenance, and that is implicit in the purchase. Computer systems become antiquated, roads deteriorate, cars fall apart, and that is a fact of life rather than a conspiracy on the part of the manufacturer. Furthermore, it would make good business sense for the Saudi's to pick a few key vendors for building their infrastructure, because then if something goes wrong they would have fewer vendors to deal with and less finger-pointing.Thus Perkins' approach has no nuance, and no recognition of these realities; it was pure meat-axe, conspiratorial, and monochromatic. Latin America and the rest of the world in his book are simply helpless victims that are being raped by evil Americans, in one more feminist victimology play. For a man who was a chief economist for a major consulting firm, he certainly seem to be very ignorant of economic realities, and he comes across as the typical knee-jerk, clueless liberal who blames capitalism and corporations for everything.Or perhaps his purpose was something deeper? His analysis read like a marxist critique of capitalism - is that his real goal? If so, why didn't he just come out and say it?I also noticed how politically partisan he was. He had a few lame attempts at trying to try to show that he was bipartisan, but then spent many pages bashing Bush, and other republicans with little criticism of democrats. If he wanted to come across as even-handed, he could have, for example, discussed Clinton's extensive connections with international socialists, his Rhodes scholarship, and his support of corporatocracy. And interestingly, there was absolutely no word in his book of Heinz, another large multinational firm. Was that because John Kerry, like him, is another liberal from Massachusetts, and therefore was a little too close to home for him to discuss or even mention?However, my biggest criticism of Perkins' was his treatment of SIL (The Summer Institute of Linguistics), the parent organization of Wycliffle Bible Translators (WBT). Virtually everything that he said about that organization in connection with oil company activity in Ecuador were lies and false innuendo. The missionaries who went there and were murdered in 1956, predated much of the oil company interest in the area, and they were not even all with SIL or WBT. Their interest then, as now, has nothing to do with advancing any corporate agenda, and everything to do with trying to help the native people. The Huaorani (or Waodani) tribe were vicious killers who preyed on each other and carried out many vendettas - the missionaries helped them to change their lifestyle in positive directions, and conflict was dramatically reduced. When the oil companies came in force, the missionaries tried to work things out with the Indians for everyone's mutual benefit, and perhaps bent over too far in trying to seek accommodation. But to say that they did this because they were on the take from Rockefeller or any other oil company is a disgusting lie. They were in a very tough situation, caught between the forces of the Ecuadorian government, a variety of oil companies and other internal and external interests, and the varying attitudes of the various Indian tribal groups. If the missionaries hadn't been there, the Indians would have been much worse off in trying to cope with the realities of adapting to the modern world that would have encroached on their territory regardless of the presence or absence of missionaries. The missionaries may have made mistakes in the way they handled things, but their motivation was love, and they cared enough to give their lives to the Indians in Ecuador.In the same light, Perkins' uncritical acceptance of President Roldos and the Ecuadorian government is especially disturbing. For the most part they didn't give a damn about the Indians; the latter were often simply an excuse to get more leverage with Texaco and other oil companies, and this has been true throughout Latin America.Perkins' refers several times to a scene of an indigenous woman washing herself in the dirty stream as a paradigm for what American corporations have done to the world, and how he wrung his hands over his part in it. But according to his own words, this is his life:\\"In a strange turn of events, I succumbed to the corporatocracy when I sold IPS in November 1990. It was a lucrative deal for my partners and me, but we sold out mainly because Ashland Oil Company put tremendous pressure on us. I knew from experience that fighting them would be costly in many ways, while selling would make us wealthy. However, it did strike me as ironic that an oil company would become the new owners of my alternative energy company; part of me felt like a traitor.\\"In other words, at the same time he is crying about the woman in the dirty stream, he is sipping a margarita on his yacht and wiping his tears away with $100 bills. While he is wringing his hands, many Christian missionary organizations around the world are actually doing things to help people in these conditions with medicine, food, housing, and more importantly help to eliminate the demons of addiction, depression, poverty, and spiritual bondage; to give them hope for the future, and to be the hands of God that demonstrate His love and care.Perkins is not fit to shine the shoes of the people in SIL, and his book could best be interpreted as an \\"LHB\\" - a liberal hit book.\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Contrary to so many opinions so poorly expressed by so many hired or cajoled Perkins' apparatchiki on these review pages, this book is a load o' . . . (fill in the blank). I'm going to go with, yes, you smell what I smell. It is refreshing to see that every few reviewers know the difference between regurgitating nonsense and thinking for themselves. It is comforting to know that not all of the reviewers are on the publishing company's dole or putting their name to Perkins' self-reviews.Apart from his awful writing, weak logic, naked arrogance, delusions of holy visitations, blatant fabrications and nasty, child-like finger pointing, and so much more I am still reeling from BS vertigo, apart from all of that, it's just bad politics. All of the \\"secrets\\" he purportedly uncovers, all of the dastardly deeds--it is Perkins who is dastardly then and now. That so many people buy into this stuff is what is worrisome. Woefully so.THIS BOOK IS SOBERING IN ITS WILLFUL HATRED OF WESTERN CIVILIZATION. We need to worry less about terrorists and radical Islam and more about these self-hating destructionists who live among us. Yes, I said it. Perkins sows hatred without any positive harvest. He shines a spotlight on false problems and offers only darkness and no solutions. He is an anarchist without rationale purpose or any proposition but revolt. He is pandering to fools and the fools are applauding.I would point-counterpoint his \\"thesis\\" and his \\"facts,\\" but it is all so very clear that you either \\"know and understand\\" him to be false or you \\"see, hear and feel\\" that he is right. It is troubling to see that the percentages in the wise, informed and reasonable categories are losing to the uninformed, psuedo-intellectual masses. We have been warned of the dangers of false images by the great philosophers in history--you know the ones--the ones most of the positive reviewers here would seek to ban from required curricula. Plato, Aristotle, Socrates. Bacon, Kant, Hobbes. Perkins is the shadow dancing across the cave. He is insistent. He imparts. He does not teach. He has learned no lessons of value. He lives in the cave and dares not step into the sunlight. His message has no audience there.If you haven't read this book, know that you will love it or hate it. Hope that you hate it. To be among the former is a pitiable place for the human mind to reside."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The premise for \\"Confessions Of An Economic Hitman (COHM)\\" couldn't be more intriguing and the book did after all sell tons of copies and has remained on most booksellers' recommended reading list for ages. So my expectations were high for John Perkins' blow out confessional, the product of a conscience that struggled with but manfully prevailed against the temptations of a financially lucrative and high flying career as an \\"economic hit man\\".In a nutshell, Perkins tells of how he had helped the US government, and various supranational and multinational corporations connive in fleecing third world countries by making them borrow billions of dollars for over ambitious projects that would never pay their way. The object was to enrich themselves and make political slaves of these poor countries, whose corrupt leaders they would prop up and render beholden to them. From time to time, these countries would spawn revolutionary leaders whose ideas threaten the status quo but they would be bumped off unceremoniously by men in black working for the establishment. The victims would invariably be the world's poverty stricken millions. COHM promised to be non-fiction fare that reads like a spy novel and ostensibly appeal to readers from both camps.Sadly, Perkins' heartfelt sincerity cannot alter the fact that the book is appallingly written and a yawn. His revelations about what the first world is doing to developing countries isn't new to those of us with half a brain. Read Joseph Stiglitz's \\"Globalisation and Its Discontents\\" and you get some real insight into the issue. But that's not the problem. Without any hard evidence to back up his claims, the book lacks substance and credibility. Is he writing a serious book or looking for release ? The tone of his book is disconcertingly shaky. One moment we're into some real serious stuff, the next he's dissing his parents for their so-called fake values, acquiring some new girlfriends as he climbs the corporate ladder - who cares ? - or simply repeating himself. Quite honestly, the book often reads like the unbroken whine of an undergraduate liberal who's just discovered his conscience. Sorry, Perkins' heart may have been in the right place but his execution left much to be desired.Don't waste your time or money on this amateurish effort. COHM is definitely not the book it's been touted to be."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I have never written a review, but this book deserves some scathing criticism. As someone who loves international finance and politics, I was excited at the prospect of learning about it from the perspective of an insider. Unfortunately, Mr. Perkins is not an insider and his claims are highly dubious. Examples include:1) That the NSA, without his knowledge, planted him in a private engineering firm to do the government's bidding. Even if it were the CIA (the NSA is a codebreaking organization), how would they benefit from placing someone in a private organization when that person isn't aware they are even working for them? His further claims of being seduced and trained by a beautiful yet shadowy company employee over wine and sex, all while being an EHM is 'for life', are plain silly.2) If the vast network of EHMs (which is what Perkins claims they call themselves) exist, why haven't any others come forward and admitted to the use of the term?3) While the relationship between the military-industrial complex, international finance organizations, and infrastructure/energy companies is certainly complicated and, in many instances, corrupt, he provides no concrete evidence to support his claims other than innuendo or coincidence.4) He massively overstates his role. Why would a 24-year old with no economic training be placed in a situation where he is developing economic plans for major developing countries like Indonesia and Saudi Arabia? I have no doubt that he lucked into a decent analyst job producing electric load forecasts for projects in developing countries, but like all entry-level analysts these were just data points that were used by actual decision-makers higher on the food chain.5) He claims that Congress provided his alternative energy company with specific subsidies as a 'favor for his past service'. Why would Congress concern itself with a small, poorly funded start-up to help an former mid-level guy at a construction/engineering firm? Isn't it more likely that these subsidies were to develop alternative energy, and applied to all firms in the sector?6) He was 'bribed' not to right a book about his experiences. Actually, he was asked to sign a NDA when he accepted a job at another energy firm- that's pretty standard. My first job was buying commercial real estate for a pension fund, which certainly isn't a matter of national security. That said, I had to sign an NDA and I'm sure would've been sued had I gone on to write a book about it. Welcome to the real world, Mr. Perkins... if you do transactional work, you're probably going to have to sign an NDA. Construing this as a 'bribe' and not standard operating procedure is yet another delusion.I could go on, but each new chapter of this book requires the reader to take another massive leap of faith. When combined with Perkins' irritating writing style (the pages of guilt-raddled rambling wouldn't seem out of place in a Hallmark movie soliloquy) and a complete lack of any scholarly documentation or in-depth economic analysis, the end result is a dumbed-down conspiracy novel masquerading as non-fiction. Books like \\"The Blood Bankers,\\" Rajan's \\"Fault Lines\\" or \\"Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists,\\" Zakarhia's \\"The Post-American World,\\" or even Thomas Friedman's recent work all expose how complicated an issue economic development really is. Perkin's trashy confessional serves to oversimplify the debate, and distracts readers from far more worthwhile material on the topic."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"It is too bad that of all the books that highlight globalism's seamy side this is the one that became a best seller. Perkins, who no doubt plays fast and loose with the facts, purports to be \\"confessing\\". Hardly. It is more like issuing one long excuse for his behavior. Although I do not doubt the central thesis of the book-- that the IMF and World Bank serve corporate interests more than those countries is claims to help-- I found his claims for the reasons he became involved in such behavior disingenuous. It is difficult to believe that he spent ten years working for the engineering/consulting firm he did with the hopes of one day exposing its evils. Really, ten years? Did he really need to spend a full decade in a position that he found so distasteful, especially considering he was on to them from the very beginning? Did he have to wait another 20 years after leaving his profession to come clean?Perkins comes across as a silly, silly man. The cloak and dagger stuff is all a bit much and strains credibility.

He writes in a boring, plain way that can only appeal to B-spy movies enthusiasts. Key historic facts are recounted in two pages, while his personal recollection of pseudo-mysterious meetings take 4 or 5. There is no serious analysis, and no serious investigation. This is just a hotchpotch of personal recollection (maybe true, maybe not) and anti-globalization rant.Mr Perkins is clearly self-obsessed, and he clearly show us that even if he wants us to believe that he is atoning for all his past sins, he still thinks he is very smart and very cool.

And you can really see Mr Perkins day-dreaming about all the women he slept with during his \\"tenure\\" (but he also takes care of not disturbing us with too much detail).His personal conflicts are also badly described, and scarcely credible. He is the good guy at page 50 in Panama, and then again a bad guy at page 60 in Colombia, and then once more a good guy 10 pages later... The whole story reads like a diary about a 50-year period quickly written in one month to meet an editorial deadline.Besides, are we really discovering anything new, here? The Saudi royal family has a \\"secret\\" deal with the US (oil vs protection)? Big deal! I knew that, and I am no intelligence insider. It's an open secret. The CIA has been involved in political assassinations? Noooooo! There are countless of well researched books on this. We did not need Mr Perkins.This is a badly written, boring book on a terribly important subject, and it made me angry. Not because of what it says (pretty much all already known) but because of the total lack of serious references/investigation. This book won't convince anyone to move away from the \\"dark side\\", and it won't provide much evidence in support of anti-corporation activists (unless you think that \\"Mr Perkins said it\\" is enough as a source of knowledge). Besides, even if some of the good guys in the book are described as non-communists, we should not forget that the alternative to no-US corporations/military during the cold war would have been unlikely to be \\"peace and prosperity for the world\\". There is no balanced analysis here.I reached about page 150, and then I decided to move on to something more useful and more deserving of my attention. I am reading now Seymour Hersh's \\"Chain of Command\\" on the Bush Administration and the \\"war against terror\\". This is serious \\"anti-system\\" work, which also has the merit of discussing how the \\"system\\" also included many conscientious individuals willing to fight right away for they believed was right, instead of enjoying the benefit of \\"getting along with system\\" for 30 years, and then \\"repent\\" later. If you want to read a serious and useful left-leaning book, don't buy Mr Perkins' book, and give your money to more deserving authors."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"From 1963 to 1981 Perkins worked for an international consulting firm where his main job was to convince third world countries to finance infrastructure improvements by taking out loans from the US government. Basically Perkins and his colleagues would convince the country to take a loan out from the US government, World Bank or another source for foreign aid. The money was intended to improve that country's infrastructure and help it to advance in general. Perkins and colleagues engineered the plans such that the infrastructure improvements would be done by US companies. So the money would end up mostly back in the US economy and the country would be left in debt. Perkins and his colleagues privately referred to themselves as \\"economic hitmen\\", a term that illustrates their job. According to Perkins, the debt also implies a certain amount of control by whoever had issued the loan in the first place.In Confessions of an Economic Hitman, Perkins describes specific cases in which he was involved including Indonesia, Panama and Columbia. He also focuses heavily on the middle east and various machinations there. Oil is vital to first world countries so that was an area that got and gets heavy focus. Perkins eventually left the economic hitman job because he was morally against it. Since he left quite a bit of time has elapsed. This is both a strength and a weakness. It could be argued that Perkins' information is stale. However the elapsed time reveals the long term effects of the system he describes. He spends one quarter of the book following up (and speculating) on countries which he helped \\"hit\\" Basically the infrastructure improvements weren't a panacea and now these countries are in debt.One factor left out of discussion is the issue that when country A owes country B money, then country B will tend to support country A in the hope of being paid back one day. For example early in US history Alexander Hamilton worked at getting credit for the US and putting the US in debt simple to get the non-financial political support that came with the debt. So debt and credit is very complex. (Also the US government is currently in debt.)Confessions of an Economic Hitman describes a situation that more people should consider. Especially we should examine foreign aid more closely and not just assume that it is given altruistically. However, as described above, the US' past strategies in handling seem to go against Perkins' views."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I had high hopes for this book and it started out alright but by the end I had come to believe that this book was more fiction than fact. Having worked for one of the international construction companies mentioned in the book, I knew Perkins had some things correct but the further into the book I read, the more I questioned his credibiility. Its really too bad that Perkins' agenda got in the way of an important story but his political leanings really took over the text and veered further into \\"ax grinding\\" territory. When, on page 183, he refers to \\"Osama bin Laden's war in Afghanistan\\" I could see that Perkins had left reality and gone fully 'round the bend (bin Laden was a very minor player during the Soviet invasion). Lots of slanted \\"facts\\" and silly dialog that I can't believe actually took place.I hope someone with a similar background and a healthier mental aspect can tell the story of American international debt leverage, but Perkins is more about HIS political agenda than anything else. The chance meetings and discussions Perkins lists as actual events certainly don't ring true and it seems to me that he was either making stuff up or combining occurances and people to get his message across. In short there is enough shaky drivel in this book to get it shifted over to the Fiction shelf.I'm just as inclined to believe Chuck Barris' book \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\\", which is closer to what Perkins should have titled this muddled mess - but I guess Chuck beat him to the title. Come to think of it...I've never seen the two of them in the same room at the same time..."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you believe this book is about secret agents and spies and power politics around the world, think again. This book is all about the repressions and regressions of a disturbed man child who does the most peculiar gymnastics from childhood events to adulthood daydreams. Self-importance and some anti-capitalist agenda are the only themes of this book. John Perkins should look in the mirror and say, \\"I am a big boy now. I like me and people do, too. John will be a good boy today and tomorrow. And, he is sorry for being a bad, bad boy up until now.\\"That would be more medicinal and helpful than this nonsense of a book. Nothing here instructive. Nothing here quite believable. Nothing here entertaining. Plenty of negative stuff and America bashing if that's your thing."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"If you want a sober, credible, and unforgiving insider critique of the doings of organizations like the IMF and World Bank, get Joseph Stiglitz's \\"Globalization and Its Discontents\\" instead of this bizarre little book. Stiglitz was the World Bank's chief economist so he knows how policy is shaped, and how it fails, at the highest levels. Perkins was just a consultant, one among hundreds, who get paid under contracts funded by organizations like the World Bank, USAID, etc. Somehow Perkins has suffered horrific delusions of grandeur, thinking that he was a principal agent in the downfall of a number of governments, and his cloak-and-dagger stuff is just too much. He was but a foot soldier in the consultancy army, stationed in faraway exotic places--a bit too long for his own good, it appears."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Ever notice how aging rock stars find religion after years of partying and then go around telling young people not to party - AFTER they've had years of fun? The author got rich after a lifetime of exploitation and then goes around telling others not to do the same, instead of selling his posessions and giving the money to the exploited countries. Plus, he makes even more money from this book. It is an interesting book, but I could not get over the preachiness. 3 of 5."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"A strange book indeed. Aside from the amazing feats Perkins accomplishes with such mediocre intellectual capital, one should also be impressed by the flower child in him who endured for so long the role of an international pirate extraordinaire. One can also feel a Bond complex behid all this. There is a surreal feel to the whole book not to mention some really bad writing.Of course Corporate America aims to enrich its coffers first and above all. Is anyone really surprised by this revelation?The grand scheme of US generals of capitalism and \\"deep state\\" to control and conquer the World is blown up to impossible proportions. If only these people had displayed a fraction of these skills in managing their corporations and our wars.Unfortunately many of the events and tragic fates of various leaders of countries who tried to resist the US hegomonic policies are closer to truth than fiction. In fact, much of this is printed in your newspaper everyday in gory detail."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"The current barometer of 3 of 5 stars gaging the calibre of this review does the customer a horrible injustice so much so that this writer is compelled to call out this deficiency. My only misgiving is that this brief narrative by Mr. Piston offers to Mr. Perkins a politeness and slight degree of respectibility absolutely and completely undeserved. This collection of first-source, unsubstantiated, all encompassing collection of elite global power-brokers and their associated antics chronicalled and catagorized as \\"current affairs\\" (which implies credibility) has left this reader questioning what is fact and not fiction. So much so that this reader had to call into question the criteria bywhich a book becomes a New York Times best-seller. \\"Confessions\\" is simply another degree of \\"The DaVinci Code\\" albeit in a different arena. My apologies to Mr Brown for any slight having aligned his name with Mr. Perkins in the same paragraph. My appreciation to Mr. Brown for recognizing and noting on cover the appropriate classification of text...Fiction. It's clear in the absence of any listing of references in \\"Confessions\\" that this too is clearly a similar work. The betrayal to the reader is that once the reader has achieved the appropriate boiling point of outrage and readiness to envolve oneself at least in the debate, one is immediately directed to buy several copies of this book then collect a small group and discuss. This directive is noted in the last few pages of the text and on the author's website. The miscarriage of justice here is that assuming a degree of access not afforded the average person, Perkins could have tap volumes of references, lent credibility to publications buried or destroyed that brought true light to this allusions of global conspiricies, and laid waste to the barriers of transparancies that allow these manipulations to fester. If in the beginning Mr. Perkins was compelled to act out of guilt, one would have to ask the question by who's interest does this text truly serve. If this reader's only directed course of action extending from this text is to buy more and discuss among others, then as Mr. Piston has closed with his review, this text \\"cannot be treated as a serious contribution to the debate on globalization.\\""},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This is an interesting read. It deals more with American politics and the effects on economies around the world as a result of certain loans given by the IMF and World Bank.My problem is, we all know that the U.S. has been involved in very shady dealings, beginning with the Slave Trade, but why put all our dirty laundry out?We all benefit when other countries are at our mercy economically. We all benefit when we have the world as our cheap labor pool. The author of this book definitely benefitted, and he's benefitting now from the sale of this book detailing all of his disgusting, dirty deeds at the behest of American International Corporations and the U.S. government. In this book, the author seems to feel that morality trumps nationalism and capitalism.Anyway, this book clears up confusion about why other countries are leary of the U.S. I just say, why bash the country that enables you to be so filthy rich and free?"},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"\`Confessions of an Economic Hit Man' informative, but its author misinterprets the facts of international lending. John Perkins has inside information from when he worked for an international consulting firm that examined various foreign lending programs. This put him in a position to see how this process really worked. The author does not provide much in the way of credible independent evidence to support his claims. This book, as the title implies, consists of his own personal recollections. Yet, even if his personal recollections accurately reflect the most relevant aspects of international lending and US Foreign policy, his interpretation of the fundamental causes behind these events is inaccurate.The story he tells goes like this- institutions like the World Bank, The Inter-American Development Bank, the IMF, and the Asian Development Bank would give loans to developing nations. The projects that these schemes funded often caused dependency on the US and environmental degradation, especially where the oil industry was involved. Also, the CIA and US military supported and even installed dictators who would go along with these financial schemes. Supposedly benevolent rulers, like Jacobo Arbenez in Guetemala and Omar Torrijos in Panama were replaced by tyrants like Castillo Armas and Manuel Noriega. Perkins insinuates that the US used coups and assassination to achieve its imperialistic aims. His role in these matters was to concoct economic reports that supported these schemes.Local elites and US corporations profited from how these loans were spent, while the burden of repayment was distributed more equally. One exception was in Saudi Arabia, where he worked on plans to funnel petrodollars back to the United States, instead of loans. Perkins confesses to deliberately inflating projected benefits from these projects.Perkins claims that his book is his confession. It is far more than that. His book is an accusation. Perkins charges Americans with living gluttonous unbalanced lives. American gluttony imposes poverty and environmental degradation abroad. Americans are also misinformed. The corporate media perpetuates and strengthens the imperialistic corporate system that exploits people the world over. Misinformation is not the main problem. We let ourselves be fooled because imperialism is good for us. The attacks on 9-11 resulted from US imperialism towards the Islamic world. Resentment of the US is building and could result in disaster worse than 9-11, unless we act to stop this process. How can we do this? Perkins challenges Americans to make their own confessions. We must face up to our own moral failings and educate others to do so. Once we face up to the truth radical change will be possible. Companies like Nike and McDonalds could then pursue feeding and clothing the world's poor as their primary goals. This would be no more difficult than putting a man on the moon.Perkins suggests scientific research into alternatives to oil and moral education as solutions to the problems of Globalization. In fact, his examples point to inherent flaws in the politics of international aid. The fundamental problem with this book that its author does not understand how imperfections in the political process lead the problems he describes. Narrow and concentrated interests can organize and lobby government far more easily than large and diffuse interests. Special interests simply face lower costs in organizing and acting to influence public policy. This theoretical proposition implies that international organizations will favor politically connected special interests, like US corporations, at the expense of large and widely dispersed interests, like farmers and sweatshop workers across the less developed world. This is exactly what Perkins describes. Instead of telling a moral tale, Perkins should have questioned the efficiency of the process by which international aid policies are formed and implemented. If the people who are wronged by the policies could organize and act with the same ease as US corporate interests, then they could not be exploited so easily. Of course, these people are not US citizens. However, one does not need rights of citizenship to lobby. Perkins points to examples where narrow groups of foreigners partook in the exploitation of their own countries.Perkins also ignores the possibility that many of the problems in Third World countries are largely internal. He lauds particular national leaders who resisted the American Corptocracy and their scheming economic hit men. He does not explain why supposedly benevolent and wise leaders, like Torrijos, also failed to lift the masses of their countries out of poverty. Perhaps these leaders are not so benevolent, or maybe their benevolence was misguided. While it would be unreasonable to deny any responsibility of the American \`Corptocracy' for any problems abroad, the author comes across as if US interests are solely responsible for poverty and environmental degradation abroad.Confessions is informative as an account of how aid policies benefited politically connected corporations. It is also misleading because it portrays an efficiency problem involving special interest bias as a moral failing of the American public. Special interest bias is an inherent defect in activist government policy. Perhaps the solution to the problems described in this book is to end or severely limit foreign direct aid. Confession may be good for the soul, but sound analysis requires valid theoretical concepts."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Every time I read a controversial book, I turn to the Amazon reviews. Not for the praises of the book for the criticisms. Every critique I read is about the man's credibility and the fact that he is a hypocrite at times. Every person has bias in his thoughts about personal experiences and if people want to disregard this book for those reasons than so be it.What people should not disregard are the facts of the situations that he is describing. We must take an honest look at the country we live in. Can someone honestly say that the plunging of oil in Latin America and around the world has not negatively affected millions of people? Has the Panama Canal and its opportunities for US commercial interests affected our political judgements there? Is there a striking coincidence between the deaths of the past leaders of Ecuador and Panama? Was the invasion of Panama in 1989 a worthy action for the unspecified amount of deaths that ensued? However, people need to go beyond this book. Research the government sites and other factual sites. The information is all there. For too long Americans have refused to look. The list goes on from countless situations post- World War II. We must look at our own interests and our own leaders with the same skepticism that we give to every other leader around the world. The moral relativeness and ethnocentrism that plagues this country's leaders and citizens is going to eventually catch up with us. Eventually this country is going to have to realize that like slavery, certain aspects of policy are simply wrong and not merely a partisan issue. Slavery is not remembered as a democrat or republican issue, but simply wrong. The exploitation of nations for their resources to fill our needs is simply wrong. Mistakes in the past have been made by BOTH republicans and democrats. Until we realize there is a true problem that is not being told, this nation will continue to be admonished around the world and suffer the consequences. History is being told by the winners. This book successfully gives insight into this dilemma that all Americans face."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Yup...Dad, my good conservative Republican father, told me the world worked just this way, but I wouldn't listen. Surely, I thought, people wouldn't do this to each other on purpose.I don't know how to respond to reviewers who doubt the credibility of Confessions. No red flags were raised to me, but then again, I have no background in the field.All I know is that this book was a riveting read. I could not put it down. And, with due respect to other reviewers, you do not have to be a paranoid leftie to think the world operates like Perkins describes. Not by a long shot."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"given the importance of the subject matter presented in this book, it is highly disappointing that it is written with such poppy sensationalism, in a style that immediately makes the author and his story less credible. in a time when so many of the united states' interests abroad are tangled up in natural resources and huge loans to developing countries, it is critical to understand how our country is manipulating some of the poorest nations in the world to serve its own interests. if you can wade through the amateurish storytelling, what emerges is an interesting, not entirely surprising account of just how this happens. again, important, but just so poorly written."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"First off let me just say that I don't care about whether everything in this book is true or not. Had it just been a good book that was all that I was looking for. But instead of a good read I got an autobiography about some guy who thinks WAY to much about himself and works hard to justify his actions while condemning those around him. I was constantly annoyed by him blaming much of his faults on his 'terrible' childhood. Seriously? Does the opportunity to go to good schools and get a great education boil down to a difficult upbringing? Surely, he had his hard times, but I don't think they warrant justification for his actions later in life. It was also laughable that he blamed his failed marriage on the fact his wife didn't want to move in or have sex before they were married. Wow, what a jack ass. And then to top it off he claims that he only followed along with his unethical lifestyle in order that he might 'tell the story' later on. What a noble man.I would suggest avoiding this book."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Here's one of the best lines from this book: \\"As chief economist, I was not only in charge of a department at MAIN and responsible for the studies we carried out around the globe, but I was also expected to be conversant with current economic trends and theories.\\" (P. 87, paperback edition) You don't say!Mr. Perkins is a strict adherent to the George Costanza maxim of \\"Remember, it's not a lie if you believe it.\\" He writes like a tenth grader blazing through a term paper the night before it's due, frantically cutting and pasting from whatever internet source he can find. What you get is a sophomoric and imbecilic narrative. Better yet, Mr. Perkins is like that creepy cousin or uncle every family seems to have, you know the one, he's done everything and knows everyone, name dropping, talking in vague generalities and acting as if he's imparting earth-shattering revelations. But all he's really doing is making an [...] of himself.This is terrible stuff.

I read the critiques, took a shot at the introduction. I'm usually a fairly good judge on books.This book is an exception to the rule. Very poorly constructed for fiction. Very implausible for non-fiction.If Perkins had just told of a life transacting falsely and confessed his role among others and within a larger framework of geopolitical intentions, this may be been a more informative and enjoyable read. This is not at all what Perkins does. The majority of this book is an extreme leftist, quasi Marxist, wholly anti-American tirade. If Michael Moore and Dick Cheney are your idea of idealogues on opposing extremes, Perkins would by comparison become the extremist further to the left still and make them both appear middle-of-the-road."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Perkins has writen a good yarn about Economic Hit Men and how they affect American foreign policy. The book is a fairly easy read and his writing style is engaging. Chapters are fairly short, which enable you to read it in snippets if you wish, although it's interesting enough that you'll want to continue. Perkins also details examples from numerous countries, providing scale and scope to the story as well as variety.However, as many other reviewers have mentioned, this book lacks many citations. Some chapters have 6-7, while others may have only one, or none. Likewise, the citations are typically attached to overall statements on major occurrences, and many of the accusations he makes are unverified. While this can be attributed to the fact that the source material for the story largely comes from his own experiences, it also introduces some doubt in the mind of the reader. Likewise, while his points and conclusions foreshadow later world events, such as the Iranian Revolution and the Gulf War, it's easier to draw conclusions and connect the dots in hindsight as opposed to forecasting coming storms. Finally, all of his stories point to the same conspiracy, when in reality foreign policy is likely to be far more complex and unique between diferent countries and regions. It's therefore conceivable that Perkins took an inch of truth and stretched it into a foot in order to make an interesting story and pursue his point/agenda.Overall, Confessions of an Economic Hitman is an entertaining and engaging read, and it succeeds in getting the reader to think twice about American foreign policy. However, I would not consider it to be a conclusive summary of the nature of all American foreign aid or economic dealings, but rather a very readable alternative suggestion to American motives and actions."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone that approaches business from a point of social responsibility.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I'd wanted to read this book for a long time before getting my hands on it -- especially knowing that it inspired very interesting conspiracy theories/documentaries like Zeitgeist. On a 12 hour flight from Beijing to San Francisco, I finally got around to reading it. Did it live up to my expectations?Yes, and no. This book has a definite identity crisis, a distinct confusion about what it wants to be. Is it a tell-all? Is it a documentary? Is it a moral tale? Is it a dramatic novel? There are a few chapters where the book seems to want to switch among these possibilities, or try to embody them all at once. Of course, no book can be all or more than a couple of these things.Whatever it is, /Confessions/ has a lot of interesting food for thought to offer you. I think if Perkins had stuck to just one or two genres for his writing, the book would have had more of an impact. As I read through it, I had this feeling (and hope) that just around the corner there would be some big PUNCH: an explosive insight or horrifying revelation or dramatic twist out of the blue. But alas, upon reading the last word of the last chapter of the book, I had to admit that the PUNCH was not going to come. This book lacks \\"oomph\\", as my mother would say.But all that does not detract from what you can get out of this book: what I consider to be a healthy skepticism about the mainstream media, big corporations, big government, and the American lifestyle in general.

I don't believe this is fair criticism, as this book is a personal account. It is engaging because it is about John Perkins. It's like criticising an apple for being an apple. However, I do admit that including a three page resume about himself was a bit much. That's way too much ego! That said, I would still recommend this book to people seeking answers to why the world is in the state that it's in, and for anyone else in fact!Confessions of an Economic Hit Man is an extraordinary story of a modern man facing his inner demons, with the backdrop of a world gone mad.

I was spellbound by the article, so I had to get this book. The title \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man\\" is appropriate for what is written inside the pages.Although this is a non-fiction work, the material reads almost like a diary, and sometimes even as a thriller, and yet includes enough historical facts and names to make it credible. John Perkins' intelligence and courage shows through as he writes first-hand knowledge of his job as an economic hitman. Rarely does one get to see the inside workings, the brutal honesty of what goes on in this field of work. Mr. Perkins' job sent him to such countries as Indonesia, Panama, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Columbia. His job was to forecast the economic feasibility of building up the country's infrastructure (e.g. electricity), and thus helping its economy grow.The catch was that the labor and resources for the projects were ultimately paid by the country to the U.S. corporations involved in building the infrastructure, and not to the locals. The country's poor people did not benefit from this growth, as government money was siphoned into these projects (to the U.S.) rather than into helping the country's poor people. This was a recurring theme in Perkins' book. If a country was approached, and did not go along with these ideas, the consequences were very disturbing. Torrijos was an example.Perkins' courage in writing this book is commendable."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I definitely found this book worthwhile reading. The author tells of how debt through legitimate means is used to keep other nations subservient to the developed world, the U.S. in particular. It was a little tiring to keep reading about the author's dislike of his job while he did not do anything about it. But the story of \\"economic imperialism\\" is one that we should all be aware of and think about. This book is particularly timely post Iraq-war as read about the contracts Haliburton and KBR have gotten."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"Let me say that I am a liberal and I agree with the basic economic premises of this book. I expected to like this book and learn something from the author's experiences. Instead, I was terribly disappointed by the book's lack of substance and cloying self-centeredness. I expect this will not be a terribly popular review, but I have to call 'em as I see 'em.The plot line is classic. Man makes pact with the devil, sells his soul for money, power, and beautiful women, experiences occasional frissons of doubt but rationalizes them away while enjoying the fast life, and ultimately realizes his tragic mistake in selling his eternal soul for a few transient pleasures. In CONFESSIONS OF AN ECONOMIC HIT MAN, the devil is identified as a vague \\"corporatocracy\\" and a woman named Claudine is his representative. A few decidedly female angels periodically whisper hopeful encouragements over our hero's shoulder, but he mostly demurs and follows the money. Unfortunately, our hero is no Faust, and the story he tells comes across as a dreary and annoyingly repetitive confessional with all the substance of a daytime soap opera.With his ostensibly insider's status, John Perkins is well-situated to offer a juicy and revealing tale of pernicious economic imperialism. Regretably, what Perkins delivers in CONFESSIONS OF AN ECONOMIC HIT MAN is long on self-serving confessions, bald rationalizations, and nave realizations, and short on details, insider or otherwise. He gives us plausible (and likely true) Time Magazine-like accounts of American-sponsored economic power grabbing in Saudi Arabia, Ecuador, Panama, Colombia, and Venezuala, suggestions of a mysterious force of trained EHM's (Economic Hit Men) without a shred of supporting evidence or detail (unless you accept the name of his trainer, Claudine, as evidence), and virtually none of the insider details such a book would suggest. There's simply no there there.Worse, Perkins' direct involvement as a supposed EHM ended in 1980, making his entire story badly dated and twenty years late for publication. The author scrambles to find a way to make his book seem current, but in the end, he clearly still doesn't get it. He sees CNN and New York Times stories about Bechtel and Halliburton in Iraq as the truth \\"reluctantly\\" leaking out when the fact is that the his corporatocracy has won. They no longer have to hide. Americans hear the stories, yawn, and go back to watching \\"Survivor\\" and \\"American Idol.\\" At least in America, the forces of global empire are now institutionalized - they are the norm, inextricably wedded to the government and military. Ho hum - is it time for \\"Desperate Housewives\\" yet? How's the runaway bride doing lately?Perkins' writing is full of shallow, undergraduate-level \\"wonderings\\" and \\"ponderings\\" coupled with self-serving crises of faith and a bizarre (and truly unconvincing) dream of a talking, Third World Jesus. A laughable scene in Panama has the author meeting his self-proclaimed \\"favorite novelist,\\" Graham Greene, who proceeds to encourage Perkins in high school English teacher style to write a book because \\"It's in you, but remember, make it about things that matter.\\" Sadly, the scene is marred by getting the title wrong of Greene's THE POWER AND THE GLORY. Maybe Greene was also just punning on his own novel, THE HEART OF THE MATTER; if so, Perkins didn't get it. The writing is also insufferably self-centered. There are just too many nights \\"I shall always remember,\\" \\"that I will never forget,\\" and \\"that catapulted me to a new level of thinking and feeling.\\" And too many \\"feelings of guilt,\\" \\"haunted me's,\\" \\"paroxysms of guilt,\\" \\"detest myself's,\\" \\"soul torn aparts,\\" \\"sense of depressions,\\" \\"horrified by the extent of my own corruptions,\\" and plain self-hatings and self-loathings, Perkins' repetitive guilt pangs and crises of conscience become mere carping as he keeps taking the money and looking the other way. What could have been a revealing expose of insidious, power-driven globalization inflicted on Third World countries barely passes for another weepy episode of Dr. Phil.Late in the book, Perkins suggests that Stone and Webster (SWEC) \\"bribed\\" him, paying him off with a lucrative, low-work consulting contract to stop him from writing his tell-all book about EHM's. By any measure, Stone and Webster overpaid. Don't make the same mistake - take a pass on this one and donate the $24.95 to the Nature Conservancy, the Sierra Club, or Greenpeace."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"I really loved this book. The author opens the doors to a world I had heard about, but never understood until I read this book. I often wondered what the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund did. Little did I realize they fund the imperialist take over of indigenous people's lands, with the help of the religious right, all at taxpayer's expense. Who benefits? Who else but the Haliburtons, Bechtels, plantation owners, CEO's, and the politicians that subsidize this activity. I especially liked the part about how the Bush family has been in the tropical fruit palntation and oil business for a long time and how all the various businesses work together to make sure that the people who originally lived in these areas are kept in check by US military and covert operations, often with the help of the US Congress.

I whisked right through it like Lance Armstrong on the Tour de France, only occasionally stopping to make a note of something especially shocking or amusing. When the book was done, I sat back as though exhausted.I expect that Perkins is correct in many of his assertions, but his story as a whole isn't very easy to swallow, even on a cursory level. But I did enjoy his encounter with the disgraced man whose nose was clipped off by the Iranians in punishment for having brought shame on his nation. No matter how many times the tortured man tried to hide his non-nose from Perkins, the cloth covering kept slipping away. You could tell that he (the mystery man) was embarrassed about having the hole in his face revealed. I wonder why no one thought of buying him a pair of glasses with the nose attached like you see kids wearing on American Halloween. Perhaps that would be disrespectful to the Muslim people.Another chapter I enjoyed was Perkins in Panama, admiring Omar Torrijos in the 1970s, and he reads an article in the New York Review of Books by his favorite novelist, Graham Greene, and he looks over at the next breakfast table and he rubs his eyes with astonishment for there, applying butter to his toast like a well bred Englishman, is his idol, Graham Greene himself. He cadges an introduction and to his delight, Graham Greene is a fan of his! Years later he reads Graham Greene's Panama book about Torrijos, GETTING TO KNOW THE GENERAL, and amazingly enough he finds the book dedicated to Torrijos' \\"friends,\\" amazingly enough. Greene advises Perkins that he doesn't do much nonfiction because with fiction, because \\"fiction is safer,\\" though in the end, he says, \\"The important thing is to write about things that matter. Like your Globe article about the canal.\\"What he says makes sense, it's just the way he says it that drives readers mad."},{"Title":"Confessions of an Economic Hitman","review":"This book is well written and straight forward.

From a very broad and rough perspective, it seems to me, the \\"ancient\\" world and the \\"modern\\", with their bureaucratically centralized states and relatively stable geographic configurations, have much more in common with each other than either of them have with the medieval European milieu, with its tangled tapestry of intersecting levels of power (the Church, the aristocracies, the royal dynasties, the towns, the monastic orders) and quixotically shifting political and ethnic borders. In this sense, it is a complicated fulcrum, pivoting civilization from the ancient empire to the modern nation state and world economy, and much of my reading has been an attempt to understand how this transition from ancient to modern worked. I should have started with this book. Reynold's provides an astonishingly complete picture of western Europe from the seventh to the eighteenth centuries, from the evolution of its basic geographic and ethnographic constraints and opportunities, to the transformations of power, technology and wealth that convulsed its patchwork of societies. In addition, he attempts a somewhat lower resolution, but just as ambitious inventory of conditions of the rest of the planet as it stood during Europe's breakout to transoceanic hegemony. Written forty years ago, it is striking to see just how nearly up-to-date he is on so many details of world history. Even more masterful is that he manages all this precocious breadth and accuracy in a work clearly directed to undergrads with little knowledge of history (there are no footnotes or references, centuries are referred to as, e.g., the \\"fifteen hundreds\\" rather than the \\"sixteenth century\\", etc.). Indeed, the writing style is breezy--almost conversational--and very often humorous. Eschewing theory for description, Reynolds nonetheless makes clear the various connections among phenomena such as trade fairs, the growth of towns, the spread of literacy, the power of the church--and a host of others. Unapologetically \\"eurocentric\\" (the subject, after all, is Europe), his treatment of non-European spheres is tantalizingly cursory and directed purely towards how they hindered or accommodated European expansion. In view of this, I was nevertheless struck by how closely his treatment of the rest of the world resembled other, much more recent, works explicitly designed as curatives to eurocentric approaches (such as Eric Wolf's brilliant \\"Europe and the People Without History\\"). If you are striving to grasp the \\"big picture\\" of medieval and early modern Europe, this book, despite its age, is an absolute--and immediate--requirement."},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"I stumbled upon the Starbridge series by reading the 4th book \\"Scandalous Risks\\", which I absolutely loved. I then decided to read the series starting with book 1, which introduces the character of Jon Darrow. In \\"Glittering Images\\", he is a wise and compelling priest who counsels a fellow priest. In \\"Glamorous Powers\\", we get to know Jon Darrow, at times ad nauseam, warts and all. I love the intelligent, energetic dialogue in Susan Howatch's books, but found this book almost too talky. The first 100 pages or so are particularly tedious. I found that I, as another reviewer admitted, grew a bit tired of Jon Darrow, whereas in \\"Glittering Images\\", I couldn't get enough of him. Nevertheless, this is a wonderful read with fascinating insight regarding spiritual pride, mystism, marriage, God's love and redemption."},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"Each novel in Susan Howatch's Church of England series revolves around one of a group of interconnected individuals in the fictional town of Starbridge. Episodes in these stories, spanning decades when the series is taken as a whole, overlap and differ in presentation, seen as they are from the perspective of each particular novel's protagonist. The genius of Howatch's writing is evident in her ability to tell a story beautifully through and though the limitations of the protagonist. The narrator is not, in other words, a reliably objective observer and so the reader is challenged to find the truth somewhere in between the lines.GLAMOROUS POWERS, the second entry in this series, focuses on the mystic and healer Jonathan Darrow, a widower and, as the story begins, an abbot of the fictional Anglican Fordite order. Darrow has a vision that convinces him that he should leave the monastery. After an excruciatingly difficult discernment process under the guidance of his abbot general, Francis Ingram, Darrow is released from his vows and enters the secular world of England at the onset of World War II.The story is told through Darrow's eyes and one soon realizes that all is not quite as Darrow makes it out to be. Indeed, Howatch marvelously conceives the book such that even Darrow's \\"glamorous powers\\" of prophecy and healing might be rationally explained away as wishful thinking and the power of positive thinking, respectively--this despite the fact that the power of faith remains a theme throughout the book. The uncertainly that the unreliable narrator creates in the reader's mind can make this a taxing read at times: we know what Darrow thinks, but what's really happening? Moreover, we get to know Darrow very well, perhaps too well, and he's not entirely a sympathetic figure. Familiarity, as they say, breeds contempt. When Francis, who was so annoying at the beginning of the story, returns towards the end of the book, you're glad he's back; Darrow was getting on the nerves.The story is engaging despite the fact that virtually nothing happens of real import except late in the book. Much of the book is interior, the perceptions and misperceptions of the aging ex-monk. When stuff does happen, it's understated--perhaps too much so. Yet if all of this had amounted to some real insight into the human condition, I might have felt more edified. As it is, plot resolutions--well presaged in the book--come about as a matter of coming to terms with one's family. So, in the end, Freud.However that may be, GLAMOROUS POWERS puts on display Howatch's gift of narrative. If this book may be seen as too confined to the topography of the mind and with too little to show for it, it nonetheless remains an enjoyable piece of literary fiction."},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"I chose the book because I loved others books written by Howatch, but this one unfortunately disapointed me a lot.-"},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"Susan Howatch is one of the best writers. I am amazed at the history and background details which she weaves into all her fantastic stories. I have nearly all her works and even got my husband hooked on her novels.

Additionally, the author addresses the social changes wrought by World War I and II in theBritish world."},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"When Susan Howatch's Church of England Series was recommended to me, the first book to fall into my hands was Glamorous Powers. I read it three times; once just for the captivating story she wove; a second time with the dictionary; and a third time to meditate on the psychology and theology. Few books have made such a profound impression, reaching beyond entertaining to mentally challenging and spiritually inspiring. This book and the rest in the Church of England series (I have read all seven) are unique in modern literature, grappling boldly and convincingly with the deepest concepts of faith through the most entertaining medium of master storytelling told by one of the best. I highly recommend every book in this series. Each is entertaining. Each is a study of hope in the face of despair. Each is a mystery skillfully unraveled.

But Darrow is not just gifted, he is also suseptable to all the human weaknesses and psychological convolutions we all must face. How can he understand God's will for his life, reenter the world after years of monastic life, make peace with his family, face his own past faults and ultimately find his new calling? And how objective will his spiritual director be when he and Darrow have long shared a history of interpersonal conflict?As a Christian pastor who knows a bit about &quot;glamorous&quot; spiritual powers, I particularly related to Howatch's insights regarding the need for spiritual leaders to work out their personal &quot;kinks&quot; in order to properly platform God's power. Darrow shows us how vital, yet difficult this task is, especially since it almost inevitably means we must share our deepest weaknesses with another.As usual, Howatch's text reads briksly and is packed with story twists, insights and characters that leave you crying for more. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.Bill Faris"},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"Susan Howatch may be a woman with training in the law, but she gets inside the mindset of male priests in the Anglican Church (Episcopal Church in the U.S.) better than anyone else. This is a mystery, a suspense novel, a love story and a deeply psychological look at spiritual direction all rolled into one. The book begins with a man having a vision of a small country chantry (chapel). Outside the chapel is a unique suitcase. Is this god telling him to pack his bags and leave the monastary he has known for so many years? After intense spiritual direction, that I found riveting, he decides to leave. He goes on holiday, and while walking down the hall of the inn he is at, he see the suitcase of his vision! He has to meet the owner of the valise. She turns out to be a beautiful woman (much younger than himself). Will love ensue? What is god's will? This book will encourage you to consider the power of prayer and god's direction for your life. It will call you to wrestle with the possibility of healing and evil. This book began my love affair with each of the books in the &quot;Starbridge&quot; series. It could be the start of something special for you, too."},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"The second in the series of Starbridge books - Glamorous Powers - is the one I liked the best. IN this book we get to know Jon Darrow, who figured in the first volume Glittering Images as Charles Ashworth's spiritual director, more intimately. Whereas in Glamorous powers, seen through Charles Ashworth's eyes, he was the perfect super priest who knew everything, here we actually get under Jon's skin and see him as he sees himself: as a flawed, confused man with many problems, in particular concerning his relationship with women. Jon had spent several years in a monastery as a monk, but now, in his sixties, he receives a calling from God to leave the monastery and fulfil a mission in the world - but he doesn't know what. Nor is he certain if that mission includes marriage.For anyone with an interest in Gnosticism and mysticism, this is a particularly interesting book - but such an interest is definitely not a pre-condition for reading and enjoying it! I'm not the only Howatch reader to have this as their favourite in the series. (...)"},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"One only gets small hints in 'Glittering Images' that there is a lot more to Jon Darrow than meets the eye, 'Glamourous Powers' is his story. After leaving his order after seeing a vision, Darrow tries to work out his vocation and in his attempt lets his ego and spiritual arrogance get the better of him which leads to tragedy, but also the offer of spiritual renewal afterwards. An excellent look at how spiritual leaders and mentors have their own failings and the fact that they also need to be helped and disiplined. It is an excellent argument against those who are completeley against charismatic renewal, but also against those who are totally for it without seeing the warning signs and the need to be answerable to someone who you trust but who who you also don't have a cosy relationship with."},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"Having read all six books in Ms. Howatch's Church of England Series, I find deciding which is best difficult.

But, at the same time she holds out Hope for those who choose to strive for their ideals. I highly recommend these books."},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"This review is for the first Ballantine Books paperback edition, November 1989, a volume of unknown origin found while cleaning out the bookcase. I decided to read it only because Amazon.com customers rated it five stars. Although I was raised as a Roman Catholic, and at age thirteen spent a year in the seminary, I soon became disenchanted with, and largely disinterested in, organized religion. Notwithstanding this bias, I'm glad that I read GLAMOROUS POWERS.The plot opens in Grand Chester England at a quarter to six on Friday morning, May 17, 1940 in the cell of Jon Darrow, who for the past seventeen years has been a monk in the (fictional) Anglican Fordite Order of Saint Benedict and Saint Bernard. Jon is having a vision. He interprets this vision as God's instruction to leave the order and embark on a new, unspecified calling. Before Jon can leave, however, he must convince the Abbot General, Francis Ingram that his vision was a communication from the Holy Spirit and not an aberration of a disturbed psyche. There follows a fascinating mental dual between Jon and Francis.This deep and literary exploration of psyches pervades the story. Before each chapter and section, the author liberally quotes from the works of W. R. Inge, particularly MYSTICISM IN RELIGION. Jon has mystical (glamorous) powers, healing powers, which Francis thinks are often nothing more than \\"parlour tricks.\\" I thought of \\"Anglo-shamanism.\\"Although the story evolves within the institutions of religion, it does not tamper with faith or belief, so the reader need not worry about being upset by heresy or theological debate. The author confines polemic disputes between Anglo-Catholics and Roman Catholics, Low Church and High Church, to ritual, and treats these as external conflict rather than internal struggle. This story is not about religion, but about the psyche, with pervasive emphasis on the guilt and anger emanating from parental failures.Jon Darrow has problems, \\"dis-ease\\" he would say. The larger than life character is Francis Ingram who unravels Jon's troubled psyche without revealing his own disturbances. At one point Jon shuns Francis and mires himself into a muck of troubles, and at page 296 I made a note that the story was getting a bit tedious. It revived, I thought, around page 339 with the return of my hero Francis. Indeed, the acerbic and witty letters written by Francis to Jon are splendid examples of writing at its very best."},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"Whether or not \\"Glamorous Powers,\\" the second of the six Church-of-England novels by Susan Howatch, appeals to you, will depend on your attraction to or disgust with the protagonist. In this book, as in no other of the series, the first-person narrator, ordained priest Jonathan Darrow, sets the mood and the tone, and dominates the proceedings from beginning to end. The reason my review has only three stars, is because the character of Jonathan Darrow is, for me, a three-star narrator and not a five-star narrator! Why not admit to my own bias? Especially when father Darrow is one of the most disruptive and polarizing of all the clergymen populating Howatch's fictitious Starbridge diocese, and that is indeed saying something. His character -- and, as I think of it, his novel, his story -- are guaranteed to divide and polarize readers of the Starbridge series into pro-Darrow and con-Darrow factions."},{"Title":"Glamorous Powers","review":"I love these books.I even occasionally re-read them.

However, in re-reading, since I already know what will happen, I relax and completely enjoy the entire book.She writes compelling characters, and their justifications, extremely well.

He is also 60 years old, a psychic and a vision from God sends him back into the world and out of the monastery. There is a great deal of counselling and angst in this novel as well. There isn't enough different about this novel to make it the same fascinating read as book #1 though. I've already bought book #3 and I hope we follow a different pattern with that one.

His NASA: The Complete Illustrated History is a lively and richly illustrated account of the organization that led and contines to lead America's ever-evolving space program. The book is a welcome addition to the historical literature on space exploration--and it will appeal to the general reader and specialist alike. Popular perceptions of NASA focus almost exclusively on the post-1958 era, when the organization oversaw America's successful effort to land a man on the Moon. As Gorn shows, the story is much larger than this particular epoch. In its first incarnation, NASA was known as NACA, when the organization played a pivotal role on the cutting edge of aviation design. Gorn's lively narrative tells this story along with the dramatic era of space exploration. This comprehensive approach gives the book unique character, allowing the reader to comprehend the entire sweep of aerospace history. No less important, Gorn is attentive to the role of key personalitise, some known and others lesser known to the general public. One of the most impressive dimensions of this beautifully designed book is the masterful way it matches images to the story line of the text. Most stunnning arguably are the color images showcasing the Apollo and Shuttle flights: the reader acquires a keen appreciation for the technical sophistication of rocketry and the sheer size/drama of space flight.

This is a good introductory book to key concepts. It is also a nice guide to key legal decisions that have influenced current information privacy policy in the United States. The legal cases are presented in an approachable, narrative form -- not a lot of legal mumbo-jumbo. The only shortcoming of this book is that it was published in 1994. A lot has changed since then. Even so, I recommend it as a starting point for those just stepping into the realm of information privacy."},{"Title":"Who Owns Information?: From Privacy To Public Access","review":"You need to understand that information and knowledge are the key to overcoming or finding the most efficient way to solve a problem. Humanity's infrastructure has created a tremendous amount of infrastructure. It is critical, for the person who would be effective, to take a perspective of where the information may lie and how to best access it.This book is not the most focused response to approaching this very fundamental problem - it is more a technical study for a subquestion in information science and policy. But it IS something that will begin to steer one in the right direction of developing a perspective of how to map knowledge in society - who owns it, where it is in society, and how to begin accessing it. The necessary skills are that this helps with is in developing a nascent understanding of the economics of information and knowledge sharing."},{"Title":"Secrets D'Amour: Erotic Memoirs of Paris in the 1920'S","review":"As an avid collector and fan of erotic literature I have found many examples of these books published under different titles and as multiple books....This one is a prime example as it is also included in a 2 book volume Confessions d'Amour .... the book is great and I reccomend you by them both in one volume .. below is my review on these 2 books In contract to Victorian English writings the plots and sub-plots are much more complex and character development of the French seems paramount ...There are two books in this novel ..

Robert Penn Warren was a horny old goat in his seventies, and Random House still published poetry. For that matter, the birthplaces of poets were still considered as possible sites for museums. What happened?You can't tell from this book. Well, you maybe could, but the difference is subtle (which is, of course, much of the problem in telling good poetry from bad). Warren gives us a collection of mixed formal and free verse, with the free verse having such strong rhythms it often feels as if, when you have gone from a rhymed poem to a free verse poem, there's something missing in the free verse. Would that all rhyming poetry had such a quality to it.Warren free verse, as well, is excellent, and there are thousands, maybe millions, of would-be free verse writers who could (if they knew what they were looking for) learn a great deal about how to write effective free verse from this collection of work. Warren, who's been writing poetry since before some of the modern-day bards' grandfathers were alive, was the last of a breed when he died in 1989. The last of the original New Critics, not old enough to remember the Civil War, but old enough to have gotten firsthand tales from relatives. (One resists the urge to tie Warren to Allen Gurganus' oldest living Confederate widow. It is difficult, but one does so.) Old enough, certainly, to not only remember when poetry was considered a good part of this nutritious breakfast, but to have been publishing at the time. Not only that, but to be good enough at it to have landed a major contract with a major publishing house.The problem is that it's sometimes, as I said above, very hard to tell what makes for good poetry and what makes for bad poetry. In 99.9% of cases, poetry that strays from the image makes for bad poetry. Poetry and value judgments do not mix, in the main, though millions have tried to make them do so. If the poem doesn't make you see tings in your head, it's not a poem. Most of the time. There are a handful of poets over the years who have been able to pull it off (and most of their stuff is very much in the imagist tradition, they just know how and when to stray). Robert Penn Warren is one of those poets. Explaining why is rather like trying to bottle and market smoke without using mirrors. Read it, and perhaps you will understand. ****"},{"Title":"Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation (Spiritual Masters)","review":"Among More's last works, &quot;A Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation&quot; is one of his most important. There are scholarly editions, from Yale and the University of Indiana Press, and there are popular editions from Everyman and Septer that are available. More wrote this book in the Tower of London as he awaited execution, but the style is not the raging virtupretive one he used when confuting Tyndale. There are &quot;merry tales&quot; such as the one about the German who was never satiate his own praise, in Book Three Chapter 10, but most of the book is given over to meditation on death. More has two characters, Anthony a young man, and Vincent, his aged Uncle. They are placed in Budapest and they are fearful of an impending invasion by the Turks. More's story has been read as thinly veiled alagory of his own situation. Anthony standing in for More's son-in-law William Roper, and Vincent for More himself. That may be putting it too simplistically, but it is a good starting point. Unlike More's best known work &quot;Utopia,&quot; &quot;A Dialogue of Comfort&quot; was not written in Latin, but in English. I doubt one in a thousand readers have read More's classic in the original Latin, but everyone who reads English can read More's &quot;Dialogue of Comfort&quot; without the aid of translation. This is a spiritual book. In this book More asks where shall comfort come from. More answers his own question: &quot;For God is and must be your comfort, and not I.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation (Spiritual Masters)","review":"The first thing that I would say is that it is quite frankly astonishing that this book is not much better known throughout the Christian world considering the masterpiece that it is. I have read some spiritual works by Catholic writers (mostly saints), and I would rate this book among the top of the list. St Thomas More shows an incredible knowledge of Sacred Scripture, the works of the ancient Greek and Roman philosophers, and of the Church Fathers and other great Catholic theologians. It is precisely the way he is able to combine the thoughts from all of the great thinkers that humanity had had up to that point (obviously relying most heavily on Catholic thought) that makes St Thomas More's work so great. His stroke of genius is being able to combine the spiritual aspect of man with his human (More displays an astonising knowledge of human nature), never separating the two, for man is true body and spirit, \\"The spirit is indeed is willing, but the flesh weak.\\" (Matthew 26:41) Some great spiritual books occasionally may seem somewhat abstract, in the sense that it may seem hard to translate the spiritual counsel to daily life, not so with this book. Another fascinating aspect of this book is the ability that More has in analysing ALL possible angles of a subject; he leaves no question untouched, and he uses the dialogue between Anthony and Vincent principally for this purpose, so that by answering to Vincent's objections or questions on a particular topic there can be no doubt on the reader's mind on the significance, practicality and true meaning of what More is trying to convey to the reader. St Thomas More displays an absolutely brutal logic in his writing - I would really like to see someone attempting to counter his arguments in a convincing manner! An lastly, the book occasionally will make the reader smile and even laugh, as good St Thomas More shows his wit and humour to wonderful effect, helping the reader to view all passing things in this world less seriously and lift up our hearts to the only thing that at the end of the day matters, and that is to be with God for all eternity after we have concluded our voyage in this vale of tears."},{"Title":"Dialogue of Comfort Against Tribulation (Spiritual Masters)","review":"My Catholic book group has found this book to be well worth the effort. The translation is very readable and the content edifying."},{"Title":"Olusegun Obasanjo: In The Eyes of Time","review":"Title: Olusegun Obasanjo: In the Eyes of TimeReviewer: Onukaba Adinoyi OjoPresident Olusegun Obasanjo is a representation of a new breed of African leader(s) who have succeeded in their political careers because of having the interest of the people at heart.When he left the Nigeria government as a military head of state to the civilian administration in the late 70s, he had set a trend of his own. Little did he, on in that case Nigerians know that Obasanjo would occupy the seat of power as a civilian president, and indeed a successful one.The book although focussing on the first 39 years of this energetic and committed \`son of Africa' succeeds in bringing out the virtues that have made Obasanjo the man he is today. The book traces his life as a son of peasant parents in a small village Onihale, near Ifo where his father rose to become the village head and acted as a link between the villagers and the British Native Authorities.Onukaba Adinoyi, the author of the book is best placed for that role given his wide experience as a journalist with The Guardian newspaper. Since the time he met Obasanjo in 1984 at the Murtala Muhamed Airport in Lagos, he succeeded against the exceptions of his colleagues, in building a rapport that culminated in his being the right hand publicity man for Obasanjo.Obasanjo's ambitions of being a \`somebody' in the society started at an early age while he was still in primary school. His visionary father also contributed to achieving his dreams after realising the importance of facilitating his son's quality education.\\"Olusegun manifested early in life the traits of an independent-minded, strong-willed, smart boy. Any time he felt unfairly treated by either of his parents, he would withdraw into himself, refusing to eat,\\" notes the author. His determination is partly potrayed by his quest to have a girl named Oluremi as his lover. Despite being from a poor family, Olusegun was able to succeed in persuading Oluremi whose parents were considered as being well off financially.Obasanjo's entry into the army was to say the least, by chance. It happened that he picked a copy of a newspaper from his friend and while browsing through, an advertisement inviting applications for the cadetship examination of the Nigerian Army caught his attention. According to the author, Obasanjo's interest in the cadetship was not because of his interest in the army but because he wanted to prepare for more serious advanced level examination he was about to do. But after passing the cadetship examinations however, he started to seriously consider a career in the army. The rest as they say, is history.The army proved to be a blessing in disguise for Obasanjo. Within less than a year in the army, Obasanjo's life has witnessed some transformation: from impecuniousity to relative efficiency. \\"The basic needs of life were now within his reach\\", says the author.Obasanjo's life in the army started at the time when Nigeria was gaining independence from the British. Soon after independence, the country was engulfed in seasonal turmoil with coups and counter coups.According to the author, one of the major weaknesses of Obasanjo is his quick temper. But on the other hand, his friends and foes accepted his commitment to the army and the country at large. After he was appointed to head the Third Marine Commando during the Biafran war, the reaction from his comrades was that of upbeat. \\"He knows and likes his job. He is clever and simple, everybody just respects him,\\" one respondent said. Obasanjo's transformation of the rugged Third Marine Commando was a clear manifestation of his readiness for a bigger role within the army and the country in general. Indeed, his transforming of the Marine Commando is credited with the defeat of the Biafran rebels.The book takes the reader through the life of Obasanjo after the Biafran war, his marriage break-up, his re-marriage and the factors that contributed to his being the Chief of Staff, a position that propelled him to being the military President of Africa's most populous nation, Nigeria.The book is a good read for anybody interested in the past of President Olusegun Obasanjo.

The author stresses in it the preference that lately the Catholic Church has given to sex and gender matters over other matters pertaining Faith and religion. The author claims that the Catholic Church has become conservative on some issues (sex and gender again) and liberal on social and economical issues.The book is interspersed with trivia-like passages which, for me, it is quite alright. This book appealed more to me because of the author's style (form) than because of its content. I will like to read other books by Mr. Portmann on other interesting subjects."},{"Title":"Sex and Heaven: Catholics in Bed and at Prayer","review":"=If we must classify Sex and Heaven by John Portmann one appropriate rubric might be \\"Queer Studies,\\" but this volume surely is a very exceptionally queer study. This book is knowledgeable, perceptive - and, surprise - well-written (the author's Yale and Cambridge education shows).This book delivers. The first third is indeed about sex and Heaven, more in fact, sex in Heaven. Yes, we will be all there in Heaven. Some of us, as in life, tall, some short. And our differing personalities (but no envy) - sort of laundered. The laundering I fear might make for a most dull place. An endless ocean cruiseship with all one's fellow passengers lobotomized. The old spiritual notwithstanding, we won't all be white in the heavenly light. Will there be slavery there? Is an affirmative action program in place? Yes, Portmann actually asks these questions. All you wanted to know about Heaven and never dared to ask. Questions you never thought of asking. But very few answers. Portmann subjects the inscrutable, the idea of Heaven, to strict and penetrating scrutiny. The result is like a trailer park after a tornado.As for the all important question, who gets aboard and who is left standing on the dock (worse, goes to Hell), Portmann suggests the varsity team as an analogue (later the country club). Now who but a Yalie would think of that? There is a chapter on \\"The Sex We Don't Have\\"; that's important with respect to the question of who does and doesn't get in. From all this the author extracts one central generalization. Historically the church, primarily the Roman Catholic Church (he also examines Islam - plenty of sex in their Paradise - and Judaism), has become totally preoccupied with sex to the exclusion of all else - including theology, not to mention the Scriptures. These days, according to Catholic teaching, it seems, correct sexual preference is far more important than correct religious views or even good acts for getting into Heaven. Heresy - blasphemy even - are overlooked but gay love, never, never, never.Another third of the book, more than is necessary I feel, deals with the relationship between Roman Catholics and Jews (Protestants get relatively little attention). Once, closely following The Gospels, the Vatican condemned Jews as Christ-killers. But there has been a drift away from Scripture. From censoring the Oberammergau Passion Play - out of deference to Judaism - to ceasing to convert Jews, the Church has moved to letting non-Christians, but not non-heterosexuals, into Heaven. And so, the author concludes, a straight Jew has a much better chance of getting into Heaven than a gay Roman Catholic.In my own opinion, the Gospels are the foundation of Christianity. The Faith cannot exist without them. If the Roman Catholic Church, or any other church, drifts away from The Gospels it will cease to be a Christian church. Ridiculous? Unbelievable? Portmann writes (p. 115). \\"I have not considered whether...leaving Christ behind might benefit the Catholic Church. True, demoting Jesus would simplify relationships with non-Christians enormously...\\" This is not the only way Rome has drifted away from original Christianity - think of the Mary cult in the Middle Ages.Is such a drift reflected in this book? Aquinas, Augustine, and St. Paul are cited frequently, but the Gospels sparsely. At first, with his devastating questions the author appears to be an iconoclast. And so offers few answers. The reader asks himself, \\"What, if anything, does this guy believe?\\" Deep in the book we begin to see. He is (as he told us on the first page) a Roman Catholic. But certainly not another lapsed Catholic. Portmann is a very knowledgeable and intelligent Catholic. He know the details; and he knows the big picture. His insight into the manifold problems facing his church could hardly be more clear for a layman. What at first appears to be some kind of an attack on Rome, the reader slowly discovers, is in fact a clever apologia for the Church.In the conclusion to this book, the author writes, \\"Heaven is what I'd focus on if doctors told me I had only one more year to live... I would attend Mass daily and pray the rosary.\\" But, characteristically Roman Catholic, he makes no mention of reading the Gospels. All his questions are answered there. Jesus loves us all, I believe, and He will save us if we let Him. Dante placed the fallen Satan at the very center of Hell at the exact point in all the universe most removed from Jesus' Throne.If I may add to one of the author's major points, not only has Rome (and many Protestant \\"Christian\\" sects as well) replaced theology with a sick preoccupation with sex, over the centuries the historical churches have equated sex with sin and sin with sex. Something which Jesus, whose sexual views were extraordinarily liberal for the prejudiced and violent times in which He lived, never did. Nothing is more removed from the teachings of Jesus, from the Eleventh Commandment that Jesus gave His disciples and us, than homophobia.Reviewed by R.A.

This is a fundamental when reading the story. It predicts all of the horrible things to come from an advanced society (such as ours today). While doing this it tells a stroy about a young boy who learns of the end for the old human race (who were at their peak around 500 years before).

I liked the the Mexican grotesque feel of the artwork, with it's bright colors and dreamlike figures, though some readers may find it a bit &quot;busy&quot;. The complete deck of 80 cards has an additional 2 cards: a title card and an inspiration card, describing the author's basis for developing this particular deck. While a far cry from Universal Waite imagery that we are all so familiar (and sometimes bored with) the deck has some similarities. The pips and Minor Arcana are completely illustrated. The Major Arcana cards are flawless! Check out the The Star and The Hermit, two of my personal favorites.

Errata are the behind-the-scenes changes in the rules - how is that good? It only complicates the game. Also, I've noticed that with every volume the amount of info steadily decreases:the first volume held images of well over 2000 cards from Third and Fourth Ed., Arabian Nights, Antiquities, Legends, Ice Age, The Dark, Fallen Empires, Alliances, and who knows what else. It was jam packed with an out-of-order chronology, the banned cards, lots of strats and card info. The second volume was thirty percent smaller - 1300 cards from Weatherlight, Visions, Fifth Ed., and Portal. It was bleaker, smaller, less enthralling. Now, THIS volume features 900 cards from four small expansions - they didn't even wait for the block to be over. Some of illustrations are botched or ill-colored, and the text on the best cards...

He is the best horror writer out there."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"The book takes too long to get started. The first book (The Saints of Neilsville) plods along with a laughable predictability. The second book (The Society of St. Peter Martyr) picks up the pace and things really start to get creepy and strange. This section unfortunately relies too heavily on descriptions of all sorts of sexual acts. I'm not sure if I should laugh or be insulted. The two books take the plot on an unexpected tangent. Just as things seem to be petering out (excuse the pun), it picks up speed with the same frantic pace of some Stephen King novels. The last twenty pages then take a huge and wonderfully surprising tangent, earning this book a higher review than I otherwise would have given it."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I am a big Saul fan and was not disappointed by this story. I have read all of his books."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This was definitely in the second group. A long, slow build up to basically nothing, no mystery, no resolution, nothing more horrific than a secret undercurrent of homosexuality in the Catholic Church (imagine that!). Writing is at best completely unremarkable, but often clumsy and repetitive. Why is this book still in print?"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I've read two books by John Saul (I'm reading them in order of publication).This story dealt with suicide. There was blood due to the suicide methods, but nothing in the sense of \\"blood and guts\\", except for the opening scene. The story did revolve around Catholicism. Catholicism has always been a focus in horror films and such. This story by no means was a jab at the Catholic faith, but just this specific fictitious church in the story. The author I felt did a good job with character development. He slowly peeled away layers of the story to reveal the plot. It wasn't as \\"intense\\" as I might have liked it to be, but still was enjoyable and kept my interest throughout. John Saul does a good job with keeping the plot mysterious to the reader. I'm looking forward to reading his other books."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"The thought that comes to mind when I think about Punish the Sinners is how shocking it is. The novel starts out like many John Saul novels with an outsider being menaced by something possibly supernatural and the level of menace and fear is as high as Saul's other books but the degree of violence from this book really did surprise me (especially the sexual violence). This is a very dark novel and explores issues that might cause discomfort to those who live sheltered lives and have similar outlooks on life. The suspense itself will have you jumping at shadows. Throughout the entire novel I kept feeling an overwhelming sense of dread and foreboding. I always felt like there was something out of the corner of my eye that I missed when I read it. The book will shock and scare and what more could one ask of a horror novelist such as John Saul?"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I have kind of been on a John Saul kick as of late, and decided to give one of his older novels a try. So picked up a used copy of Punish the Sinners. I found the book to be... slow. There are shocking moments, and some very grizzly violence towards the end of the novel, but none of that really picks up until 3/4 of the way through. The rest of the novel is one character's inconsistent struggle with his faith. I say inconsistent because his motivations and feelings really don't flow from chapter to chapter, but instead seem to jump randomly to fit the story. With the exception of one very shocking and wonderfully tasteless revelation and sex scene, the book is almost boring and repetitious. The characters never seem to fully develop, with most of the teen girls being interchangeable, and our lead character seeming like a different person from chapter to chapter, and sometimes from page to page. While it's not a total train wreck, it basically becomes a very mediocre small town soap opera.So based on the first third of the book I would only give this book 2 1/2 stars. Then the last third begins and the whole book changes. Characters begin to kill themselves, and the stakes are raised, and suddenly the book becomes very entertaining. The \\"supernatural\\" aspect of the novel takes over and at this point I couldn't put the book down. I won't give anything away, but I will say that ending shows that Saul is capable of creating some almost stunning, and yet violent imagery as the body count begins to rise. In the last hundred or so pages John Saul's talent begins to shine through. It's just a pity that it takes so long for the book to get going. So long in fact that I'm guessing most readers will have already given up.Then there is the ending. I will just say that I was surprised at the choice John Saul made, and looking back at it now, the final pages seem to give the book a much welcomed nasty edge.Do I recommend this book? No, not really. There are so many better books, including ones by John Saul, that I just can't tell anyone to spend money on this one. If you can get a cheap used copy, then maybe, but otherwise skip Punish the Sinners and find something better. If you are looking for a John Saul novel try Faces of Fear or The Manhattan Hunt Club. John Saul has done better, and you the readers can do better as well."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Punish The Sinners is escapism at its best. Sauls weaves a sad tale of suspense and intrigue. Readers will find the opening funny and almost instantly chilling. Sinners exposes Saul's ability to craft a story that exposes the delicate almost fragile nature of children. This is the catylist for the evil that prevails. If horror has a first name, this book may just be the middle name. This is a must read. FYI..there is one part of the book that is sure to have you cringing or puking. Either way, you will be moved by this horroring tale."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"To date, this is by far the best *and also the first) John Saul novel I have read. And based on other reviews, I think that sentiment is shared by a lot of other readers. Had I not had other commitments, I probably would have read this cover-to-cover. All in all, I think it took me two days. If you are looking for a quick escape - read it. Too bad, nothing else by John has even come close to this one....."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"After reading &quot;Creature&quot; a few months back I had some doubts about John Saul. Well, i don't know about his later work, but this one was good. Peter Balsam goes to Neilsville to teach a psychology class at a parochial school, but soon finds some of his female students are killing themselves for no apparent reasonother than the fact that he showed up in town. Finding out why the girls do it is mainly what this book is about, and it had an unexpected ending, which is rare in most stories I have read as of late. I also couldn't find too many loose ends thatweren't tied up, although there were a few, which led to 4 out of 5 stars. All in all, a fine read."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"If you are a John Saul reader, you do not need a review. You know how good he is.

I actually found my palms to be sweating while reading about Peter Balsam's (the main character)thoughts concerning his &quot;bad&quot; feeling about the town and his old friend Monseignor Vernon. I could not put the book down. I can honestly say that after reading The Blackstone Chronicles and then Punish the Sinners, I cannot wait to read all of John Saul's books. Saul is a master at placing you the readers into the main character's mind. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Excellent novel. Tightly written, suspenseful, and an ending that surprised me."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I'm not sure if the other reviews are meant to be jokes or what, but John Saul is perhaps the worst hack writer I've ever read (or listened to, in this case). He does start the stories pretty well, but the wheels don't just come off the wagon, they fly off at light speed! Relaxation therapy? The musty odor of semen? Monsignor's huge organ? The characters are as flat as a postcard and the plot is outlandish and not just improbable but ridiculous.Someone please explain to me why 1)Balsam would have ever chosen to stay on in the first place considering the treatment he recieved from the beginning and 2)why would the Society choose this guy when there had to be a zillion other weaker-minded types they could have recruited to drizzle their, uh... religious fervor... all over."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I READ THIS BOOK MORE THAN ONCE!JOHN SAUL IS THE BEST WRITER!THIS BOOK IS SO CAPTIVATIING! THE END GIVES YOU THE CHILL!!!"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This book took me no time to read because it had my complete attention. My only complaint was the ending..."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"I've read almost everything Mr. Saul has written. Oddly enough, I only recently came across this one, his second published novel. It certainly has a terrifc premise, and our hero, Peter Balsam, is likeable; also conflicted and vulnerable, which makes him perfect fodder for the wonderful mind of Mr. Saul. How exciting to come to a new town and start fresh after a rash of failures, whether the priesthood or his subsequent marriage, or the certainty of his future. Peter Balsam comes to teach phychology at a parochial school, almost unheard of by the set-in their ways populace. Angry nuns, weird old priests and closed-minded townspeople greet him with suspicion, but the kids love him, so glad to be given a chance to learn something new during their \\"formative years\\". Well, chaos ensues, as would be expected, and the next-to-lead character, Monsignor Peter Vernon, Balsam's old school chum, creates lots of confusion and plot twists that carry the reader to a satisfying conclusion, though not the one you'd think. Or...it would've been unexpected had I not read so much Saul before. It was very enjoyable, and if you're new to Mr. Saul, check this one out right away."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This book grips you from the very start and never lets go. While its a fast pace horror novel regarding suicide, and religious fervor it also tackles other topics such as abuse of power, sexual hypocrisy and the church overall. I got a bit upset when the sexual element was introduced; thinking Saul was making a judgement call but as the story progressed it redeemed it self. It also has one of the best and realistic endings I ever seen in a novel of this type. I am glad Saul had the good sense to end it in the way he did. A great audio book from the first CD to the last. The reader did a good job though his female voices needed some fine tuning at times. Still a great listening experience. I'm off to buy another! This book contains 5 CDs and is read by a single reader."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Punish the Sinners is a thriller concerning a rash of suicides and religious fervor sweeping through a desert community (the heat is symbolic on many levels). On another level I think it is a very personal book for Saul, usually a very impersonal and highly structured writer. This is due to the tensions regarding sexual orientation issues with the lead adult characters. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"John Saul is a master of horror story telling. His stories cause shivers up and down your spine, butterflies in the stomach, and the uncontrollable urge to keep reading. I am deliberately keeping these reviews vague so as to not spoil anything.Punish the Sinners is a bizarre story, set in the backdrop of a private Catholic high school called St. Francis Xavier High School. When Peter Balsam begins teaching a controversial psychology course, he notices that the children in this school have been very well indoctrinated in the attitude of the whole village (Neilsville, WA), which is very much a small town filled with very religious people.However, something isn't quite right at the high school and Peter is determined to find out what it is. There are strange rumors, whispers about a dark secret society. And then the children start dying ...This story is just creepy and I loved reading every word. Don't miss it if you are a fan of horror.Saul writes true horror, so don't expect any happy endings here. But DO expect to be thrilled and chilled. Don't miss this great story."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This is the first novel I have read from Saul and I admit I was impressed. From the first page it hooks you in and keeps you there. The ending was not typical and much of a surprise. Overall really good book, along the lines of Stephen King novels, which have that eerie and mysterious flavor to them that make them such good thrillers. I look forward to reading more of John Saul's work."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"A typical Saul thriller that his fans will enjoy. The plot centers around a Seminary dropout- turned teacher who is asked to teach at a stuffy parochial school and finds himself in the middle of a rash of teenage suicides and other evil goings-on. A typical fast-paced Saul thriller that lures you in quickly and keeps you there. The ending was different than I expected, which was a pleasant surprise, but I wish Saul had cleaned up some of the loose ends. All in all, a quick, easy read that Saul fans will enjoy."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"This is the best book Saul wrote, it's great. I read it a few times actually and each time I couldn't leave it and move on with my life, like doing something for school or something. It touched me, the subject is very well built, so are the characters. Peter Balsam, and old childhood friend of Peter Vernon (now the Monsenior) is asked to come and teach psychology. He is an outcast in a relligious society and relates only to another oucast, a divorced woman. Prejudice coming from religious ideas is a great background for the Monsenior who finally came with a plan how to punish the \\"sinners\\". He is a very disturbed character and if you are a smart reader you'll get the idea why he is as he is. He is by no means the common religious fanatic, he's more. You enter a world of dark, creepy secretes hidden under a mask of peace and God. It's so usual for saul to do this, paint a perfect picture and turn it into grothesque, showing the true evil. I like that he's not a writer that ends books the way most do, he doesn't make it sweeter than life is. I hated this book, I threw it on the floor in rage when I finished it. But I loved it too, believe me. I understand it, it has a certain logic. Oh, you have to read it to see what I mean. If you didn't read Saul before - this is the best and the most evil book I'd say. Ok, let's say, the most evil from the pleasant ones. \\"The right hand of Evil\\" is the most evil. I am 22 and still it gave me nightmares. It wasn't believable and it was kind of distgusting like also \\"Suffer the children\\". Morbid. I would relate it to \\"Comes the blind Fury\\". It's about fury, but at a more unconscious level, I don't suspect that the evil character realizes hos rage so well, he can't controle it, it's madness and yet a perfect plan, so cold, and so calculated. It's brilliant! Great, grrrrrrrreat book."},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Peter Balsam has come to Neilsville to teach a class in psychology at the local high school.

A good sophomore effort for Saul. Evil priests have a special place in my heart. A few scenes could have been spiced up and made more interesting. It could have had a better ending as well. It seemed as if Balsam just gave up.--author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow"},{"Title":"Punish the Sinners","review":"Punish the sinners delivers an interesting but ultimately unsatisfactory suspense story centering around a Catholic school in a small town. While the story initially raises some interesting questions about theology and Catholic doctrine, Saul eventually forsakes those topics completely in the pursuit of a ridiculously far-fetched tale of obsession and mind-control. There is literally no character development whatsoever, and Saul goes a step worse in drawing on multiple character stereotypes: the sinister priest, the disbeleiving psychologist, the popular jock, the picked-on \\"ugly girl,\\" and more. If Saul had done anything memorable with such characters, it might be worthwhile, but this is simply unacceptable. To top off the frustration, the ending is simply atrocious, and does nothing to conclude the story; it feels like a bad horror movie where the killer is still alive at the end (though that is somewhat of a recurring theme in Saul's work). Not recommended at all."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"I have always enjoyed short stories, and when the short stories are James Bond short stories authored by Ian Fleming, what's not to like? Here, there is very little not to like; these James Bond stories (well, one of them is really not a James Bond story, but it's OK) move along quickly and crisply, and feature Fleming's trademark spare, lean style of prose.In my opinion these stories give the reader some idea what the workings of the British Secret Service might be like, and some insight into the character of James Bond, one of the more ambiguous characters in literature. I happen to really like all of the James Bond stories, and I think that Fleming deserves more credit than he gets by critics of literature. James Bond is one of the great figures in action literature, and if the James Bond movies make him into a cartoonish character, that is not true of the novels and stories that Fleming authored. These are great stories.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"of the stories in this novel, the quantum of solice is the most thought provoking. Action-packed, not here. Solice is simply brilliant like a good phyc. movie. The characters in Solice are flawed and life-like. This story hits hard because I know these people I went to school with them, I worked with them. Your eyes is a good book, but I find myself picking it up only to read Solice, which is not about action or spies, but revenge and redemption. Not murderous revenge, but love revenge."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"Ian Fleming's James Bond short stories, the five in this book plus \\"Octopussy\\" and \\"The Living Daylights\\", are a good way to sample Fleming's writing and the world of 007 without the time investment of a novel.It's quite the \\"in thing\\" to turn up your nose at James Bond...Ludlum & LaCarre are more realistic, the movies are Saturday morning cartoons in live-action, etc. But Fleming said many times, in person and in print, that he wrote thrillers for a living, and what happens to James Bond does not happen in real life. If you accept the books on those terms, they're a lot of fun to read.\\"For Your eyes Only\\" and Fleming's other 007 books have been re-printed for the 50th anniversary of the first book, \\"Casino Royale\\". Other reviewers in this space have done an excellent job with these short stories. I'd like to give the reasons why Ian Fleming and James Bond are still legends after 50 years...THE PLOTS -- Although Fleming sometimes veers into outlandishness, the missions and situations that he puts 007 into usually have some grounding in Cold War reality. The reader gets a glimpse into the dangers and paranoia of that era.THE WRITING -- Fleming, a former newspaper reporter, has a vivid and economical writing style that grabs you from the beginning and pulls you right along to the end. He makes good writing look easy.LOCATIONS -- Fleming was known for going to the places where James Bond operated, and taking copious notes. Whether the action takes place on a coral reef, in Paris after World War II, or in Bermuda high society, Fleming has the ability to put you right there.THE BOND WOMEN -- Sure, they're all beautiful, and they all tumble to 007's charm. But Fleming had a good eye for people in general and women in particular. Far from being mere damsels in distress or decorations for 007, the women in Fleming's stories are tough, savvy, and capable.BOND HIMSELF -- Ian Fleming's James Bond gets scared, makes mistakes, gets hurt, doesn't always get the girl, has real moral misgivings about the darker side of his job, and drinks coffee, water, ginger ale, and double bourbons, not just vodka martinis \\"shaken, not stirred.\\" In other words, a more believable and human character than the movie superhero."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"I have always loved writing short stories better than a full length novel, but don't often enjoy reading them as much. Perhaps because I'm so familiar with Fleming's Bond, I really enjoyed some of these stories and didn't need all the filler.Anyone who has enjoyed a Bond novel should like at least a couple of the stories in this collection.

I like this book because once again it demonstrates Ian Fleming's skill and style as a writer.

The trademark Fleming attention to detail is present, as is usual, and Bond, of course, occasionally hits the Caribbean, as he seems to do in EVERY novel at least once. It pains me that the title story in this collection of shorts wasn't put up on the big screen intact...it would have made a heck of a SPY movie, rather than the lame, hard to follow adventure it became with old Rogie the Usurper in the lead role.The story, \\"The Hildebrand Rarity\\" is the basis for the Timothy Dalton film \\"License To Kill\\", where, though Franz Sanchez, Agent Bouvier and Felix Leiter from the movie aren't present, one of Sanchez's cronies, Krest, IS!As with just about every OTHER Bond book-to-film transfer, the plots and supporting characters are fiddled around with extensively, but a sharp eye would be able to discern the similarities.I would have liked it if this book had been in better condition when I got it, but it was one of the original Signet paperbacks, which makes it more than 35 years old.

See what she comes up with!"},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"The eighth book published in the 007 series is not a self-contained novel, but rather a collection of five short stories-two of which are kind of shoehorned in and aren't really typical Bond pieces. The first story, &quot;From A View To A Kill&quot;, is a pretty decent little Cold War espionage piece. In a well-crafted set piece introduction, a dispatch rider from Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers-Europe headquarters is ambushed and his documents stolen by Soviet spies. As a result of bureaucratic infighting (highly realistic, and doubtless drawn from Fleming's own intelligence experience), M sends Bond to try and figure out the security breakdown. It's a good tale, with an ingenious set of foes, probably the best story of the lot.In &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, Bond enters highly murky waters by taking a more or less personal assignment from M to track down the killers of an old friend. It's a highly topical late '50s piece, involving a former Nazi as mastermind, and henchmen drawn from the ranks of Cuban dictator Battista. Interestingly (in hindsight), Bond expresses real sympathy with the rebel Castro's struggle! To act as M's executioner, Bond must travel to Canada and then sneak across the US border to operate in Vermont, which is kind of interesting. Things take a turn for the ridiculous when he stumbles across another revenge seeker, wielding a bow and arrow. The middle story, &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; isn't a Bond story at all. Rather, it's a story of disaffected marriage told to Bond by his host after a rather boring dinner party. It's actually quite good, but has nothing to do with Bond.&quot;Risico&quot; takes Bond back to action, and places him in Rome, where he is assigned to disrupt the flow of heroin into England. Fleming creates a rather prescient version of &quot;The War on Drugs&quot; by directing Bond to act against the insidious enemy of drugs. It's a classic Bond story in that Bond is easily duped, meets a pretty woman, meets an unlikely ally, and engages in near fatal gunplay. (And of course, at the end, the drug pipeline to England is all a nasty Soviet plot.) The final story, &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot;, is again, barely a Bond story-reducing him to observer status. He's not really on the job, but instead inexplicably agrees to hire himself out as a fishing expert in the Seychelles. Basically, he's just there as an audience for another marriage-gone-sour story. There is a villain, there is a murder, but Bond's not really a central character in it. The only real purpose to the story seems to be to allow Fleming to work out his own issues vis-&agrave;-vis American millionaires.On the whole, these stories don't add much to the Bond canon. It would have been more interesting had Fleming chose to give us a taste of Bond's action in the Ardennes in WWII, or of the two assignments that led to his 00 designation (both of which are mentioned in Casino Royale). Still, the first story is worth a quick read, and &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; and &quot;Risico&quot; will be of interest to those who love the film versions."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"All five stories included are good, but somehow uneven, making the overall rating hard to decide between a 7 and a 10. The first one, &quot;From a View to a Kill&quot;, is fast-paced, good writing with a thrilling episode showing 007 in a motorbike being consciuosly chased by a foreign assassin. The hidden base of the unnamed enemies is another preview of the ellaborate headquarters Bond nemesis would use in the films. M is not present this time. This title was cut to &quot;A View to a Kill&quot; for the film, which resembles nothing of this compact short story. The title adventure is much more insightful, making one sweat with 007 as he approaches Gonzales place in the forest ready to shoot the man. The license to kill is more than justified by this tale only. Good heroine. &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; is one of the strangest Bond episodes, actually being a story told to 007 in which he hasn't anything to do with. Bond's mission is interesting but put by Fleming in a single paragraph. It's the story of a married couple that makes this episode, and it's excellent. Really! It shows Fleming no short than in Somerset Maugham's level, with a lesson not of moral but of life (and leaving 007 questioning about HIS life). A jewel distant of the Bond canon, even more than &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. &quot;Risico&quot; is excellent Bond in a more traditional way. It's an adventure set in Italy and involving drug smugglers, with a terrific and human villain named Kristatos and an equally terrific and human ally named Colombo. The beach fight, the minefield run and the table-recorder are pure inspiration. The final story, &quot;The Hildebrandt Rarity&quot;, is another off-the-track Bond, this time with a villain out of everyday life. Millionaire Milton Krest is nasty in the real sense. The story ends with a question mark about who killed the bastard (I guess Krest wife did it). Fleming is again king of the undersea realms, making us sad for the fishes and other species killed by Krest's venom in order to catch the red-and-black fish that gives its name to the title. An excellent, different collection."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"To commemorate what would have been Ian Fleming's 100th birthday, on 5/28/08, and in anticipation of the latest James Bond film, \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" I recently reread Fleming's 1960 offering \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" for the first time in 30+ years. Of the 14 Fleming books featuring the exploits of the world's best-known secret agent, only \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" and the author's posthumous \\"Octopussy\\" (1966) consist of short stories, and the five collected in this earlier volume are a particularly good batch indeed. Two of them had been published previously; the other three were originals for this volume. All feature what is popularly known as the \\"Fleming Sweep\\"; the ability of the author, through fast pacing and a remarkable amount of picturesque detail, to make the reader accept even the most improbable of scenarios. And although two of these stories are not exactly espionage tales per se, they all provide insights into the fascinating character that is the literary 007.The collection starts off strongly with \\"From a View to a Kill,\\" in which Bond is given the task of finding out who has been murdering governmental dispatch riders on their motorbikes and stealing top-secret documents. The tale takes place in the suburbs of Paris and features some exciting gunplay at the conclusion, as well as an intriguing female ally, Mary Ann Russell, who we unfortunately do not get to know overly well.In the title story, \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\" Bond goes on a personal mission for his boss, M, whose old friends, the Havelocks, have just been killed by an ex-Gestapo agent named von Hammerstein and his Cuban hitmen. In the northernmost wilderness of Vermont, Bond finds these men in a mountain lodge, and (as in the 1981 film, which otherwise is completely different from this story) encounters the Havelocks' daughter, hot on the vengeance trail herself. The suspense quotient in this tale is very high, as Bond uses all his commando skills to sneak up on the villains' lair, and, as in the collection's first story, an explosive finale caps things off. A most satisfying tale indeed.The book's third offering, \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" originally appeared, of all places, in the May 1958 issue of \\"Cosmopolitan\\" magazine. This is a most unusual story in the Bond canon; indeed, it is one that is narrated TO Bond by the governor of Nassau, where 007 had just completed an assignment involving Cuban revolutionaries. The governor's after-dinner tale concerns a couple that he once knew in Bermuda society; one whose marriage went sour after infidelity, jealousy and bitterness poisoned it. It is a fascinating story of domestic hell, and one that makes Bond realize that his (previously regarded) exciting life may be a little dull when compared to some others'.In \\"Risico,\\" M, much against his will, condescends to involve his Secret Service in drug busting, and sends Bond on a mission to Rome and Venice to smash the heroin ring that had recently started to corrupt British youths. Bond encounters two rival smugglers in Rome, Kristatos and Colombo (again, two characters that feature in the \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" film, in a wholly different context), as well as the mysteriously motivated Austrian Lisl Baum (ditto), and participates in a ship raid on a drug-storage warehouse. The story is fast paced and generally exciting, and features an incredible amount of travelogue detail to add to its realism.The collection concludes with \\"The Hildebrand Rarity,\\" which initially appeared in the March 1960 issue of \\"Playboy.\\" Like \\"Quantum of Solace,\\" this is not really a secret agent tale, but rather an adventure that Bond is involved in, after investigating certain security arrangements in the Seychelle Islands for the British Admiralty. He and his friend Fidele Barbey (similar to the Quarrel character in 1958's \\"Dr. No\\") are hired by a boorish American millionaire, Milton Krest (a completely different character than the one portrayed by Anthony Zerbe in 1989's \\"Licence to Kill\\"), to go on an expedition to capture a rare tropical fish for the Smithsonian. Aboard Krest's luxury yacht, Bond meets Krest's attractive and abused wife and gets involved in a sudden murder. Fleming's love of scuba diving yields effective results here; his detailed descriptions of undersea life are both gorgeous and evocative. This story, although lacking any real action per se, features wonderful characters, great suspense and a nicely ambiguous conclusion. Like \\"Quantum,\\" it is an unusual Bond story that succeeds marvelously, bringing to a conclusion this rather winning collection of (as the book's subtitle puts it) \\"Five Secret Exploits of James Bond.\\" The book should serve as proof positive that novelist Ian Fleming had a sure hand with the shorter form as well. It is required reading, needless to say, for all fans of 007."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"The book is not near the quality of the James Bond movies. Which shocked me since I usually think the books are better that the movies. This book has 5 stories in it all about 30 pages each. The stories are only ok, but if you have seen the James Bond movies and are expecting anything similar, prepare for disapointment. For some the only similarity is the title."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"For those who have made their way through the first seven James Bond books, the eighth book in the series, For Your Eyes Only, is a bit of a change-of-pace, a collection of five short stories. Not only are these stories shorter, they are also simpler, with no grand villains or complicated plots. For those familiar with the movies, two of the stories would, at least nominally inspire movies; the titles of the other three tales would be less familiar.Three of the stories are typical spy type tales. The first story, A View to a Kill, opens with the murder of a courier in France carrying valuable information for NATO. Bond is in the neighborhood and recruited to assist in the investigation and uses his skills to outshine the allied intelligence agencies. The second story, For Your Eyes Only has Bond planning an assassination of a Cuban/German thug who killed a couple who happened to be friends of M's. Things get more interesting when the couple's daughter has her own plans for vengeance. The fourth story, Risico, puts Bond in the middle of a feud between two smugglers, forcing him to join up with the lesser of two evils.The out-of-the-ordinary stories are the third and the fifth. In the first of this pair, Quantum of Solace, Bond doesn't really do anything beyond listen to a tale told by the Bahaman governor. This story-within-a-story involves the marriage of a civil servant and a flight attendant, one that goes sour quickly due to her blatant affairs and leads to her harsh comeuppance. The final story, The Hildebrand Rarity is another story of a marriage gone bad: Bond is cruising on the yacht of an abusive millionaire and his cowed wife; it's the sort of relationship that will wind up with a dead body by the end of the trip.All of the stories are passably entertaining, with the spy tales slightly outdoing the offbeat ones. What's missing are the elements that make the Bond stories stand out: the adventure, the psychotic villains and the threats to England and the rest of the West. What's left is decent, but unexceptional. This one won't win many new fans, but it should satisfy the ones who already exist."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"For Your Eyes Only features five exciting short stories of James Bond 007. While fans noted that they were not as good as his full-length novels, they still are wonderful thrillers to read.The first is From A View To A Kill. This short strory tells of the organization SHAPE, (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe)and their motorcycle dispatch riders that are being murdered on a certain highway. Unknown soviet agents are setting up ambushes for the men, killing them and stealing the important documents. Bond is sent with the help of Mary Ann Russell to investigate. He finds the area where the Soviets have established a base on the forest in the highway. Bond dresses like one of the riders to lure out the Soviets, he attacks them and kills the rest. An okay Bond story, but nothing special.For Your Eyes Only comes next and is much more promising. It begins in Jamaica with a retring Nazi criminal called Von Hammerstein. He spots a nice house and set of property that is owned by the Havelocks. He sends out his man Gonzales to arrange a buying to be made. The Havelocks refuse to sell so Gonzales kills them. The Havelocks were friends of M, so Bond is sent to investigate. He travels to Vermont, the temporary stay of Von Hammerstein and meets Judy Havelock, the vengeful daughter of the Havelocks. She kills Hammerstein with a bow an arrow against Bond's advice. Gonzales is killed by Bond and he leaves with Judy.Quantum Of Solace is the oddest Bond story to date. Bond is meeting with the governor of Bermuda. The governor tells Bond the story of a girl that was married to a young man, but wanted to marry someone else. The governor then tells Bond that the man the girl eventually marries is a guest at the dinner table at that very moment. It's a deceptive and tricky story.The next story is Risico. Bond is on assignment in Rome to stop a drugs smuggler. Bond meest with contact Kristatos who tells him that the smuggler is Enrico Columbo, and that Bond should kill him. Bond then later meets up with the mistress of Columbo, Lisl Baum in Venice. He is then captured by Columbo, who tells him that Kristatos is the real enemy and smuggler. Bond is shown Kristatos smuggling warehouse by Columbo, they raid the building and kill Kristatos. Risico is a fast-paced and adventerous action story filled with exciting scenes.The last story is The Hilderbrand Rarity. This story is placed in the Seychelles Islands, where Bond is on board the ship of millionaire Milton Krest. Krest is on an expedition to find the ultra rare fish species called the Hildbrand Rarity. Bond meets up with Liz Krest, who is beaten by her husband. Bond immediately learns to dislike Krest and his methods of killing marine life to catch the rare fish. Krest does eventually catch the fish and puts it aboard the ship. Later that night, Bond discovers Krest dead- he his choked by having the fish stuffed down his throat. Bond is unsure of who killed him. Liz Krest, who was tired of the drunken ways of her husband, or Fidele Barbey who was often insulted by Krest?Five short stories, which do I consider the best? Risico, the Hildebrand Rarity and For Your Eyes Only. But they are all very good. The short stories are a nice change of pace with Fleming and provide some change."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"\\"For Your Eyes Only\\" was the last Bond film to actually take its plot from the Fleming stories. It pasted together three tales, two from \\"For Your Eyes Only\\", which included the short story of the same name and the short story \\"Risico\\". The film also borrowed some of its plot from \\"From Russia With Love\\". \\"Risico\\" includes the small gang war between Kristatos and Colombo while \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" was used to create the character of Melina Havelock who hunts for her parents killers.The Bond books are always much smaller in scale than the movies and these five stories are smaller still. \\"Quantum of Silence\\" doesn't even feature Bond in an active role, he's only a passive listener to another man's tale of a wife's infidelity. The final story, \\"The Hildebrand Rarity\\" was my personal favorite with a classic tale of revenge and a satisfyingly ironic method of killing.I would have to place this book as an average Fleming effort. I think that Bond works better in full novel form. It's a bit of a letdown when the man who took down Goldfinger and Dr. No is now taking on a miniscule nest of three Russian spies working out of a bush in France. Yes, their headquarters is a bush."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"For Your Eyes OnlyFor Your Eyes Only, a compiliation of James Bond short stories, doesn't work. It is best read by Bond fans who either want to read all the books in chronological order (however, there is no continuity between this book and the others, so that hardly matters), or Bond fans who want to say they read every Bond story Fleming published. But it is not very good. The book includes the following short stories:\\"From a View to a Kill\\"\\"From a View to a Kill\\" is possibly the shortest of all James Bond stories. As such it is hardly developed and doesn't leave much impact. It is hardly worth considering as a story, but rather as Ian Fleming's scratch pad. Considered in this way the story is interesting for some of its elements.Fleming is at his best when describing Bond's meals and drinks. \\"From a View to a Kill\\" contains an obligatory meal scene that works especially well. Fleming not only describes food and drink in exacting detail, but manages to turn these descriptions into commentaries on the culture and society of the meals' location. This time Anglo-centric unleashes his opinions on has-been post-war Paris. In the process he manages to reveal some interesting background points about Bond's early life. But all this quickly evaporates into more of an action/detective in which Bond investigates a murder.Fleming's stories usually include a point during which a plot or a scheme is revealed to be bigger than it first appeared. Bond discovers what he suspected to be the case, that the murder was an assassination by unearthing a hidden underground base of sorts. The logic of this thing's existence and purpose are hardly believable, but the gadgetry of the place is interesting because it is a step beyond what had been typical for Fleming up to this point. Indeed, the rose-periscope and bush-door seem more like something out of the Roger Moore Bond movies, still years away. It is worth noting that \\"From a View to a Kill\\" has nothing at all in common with the Roger Moore movie, A VIEW TO A KILL, other than the name and the setting in France.\\"From a View to a Kill\\" is too short to skip, but it ultimately isn't very satisfying.\\"For Your Eyes Only\\"After re-reading the second short story in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY (also titled, \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\" I reached the conclusion that James Bond works much better in novels than in short stories. This is in part because this short story, much as the last one, left me wonder why I was reading it. While the story had action, it lacked the type of suspense, plot development, and surprise endings that move the Bond novels along. Also, that I had completely forgotten most of this story from my first reading of it many years ago was telling. \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" is more of a story than From A View to a Kill,\\" but it is still a scratch pad of sorts, interesting more for ancillary reasons than for the story itself.Still, these ancillary reasons are worth mentioning. Bond's job is never more illicit than in this story. He is sent to commit an assassination more or less as a personal favor for his boss, not as an official governmental act. He struggles with this a bit, and a different type of writer could have made more out of that struggle than Fleming does. But he trudges along to carry out his assignment. This story, perhaps more than any of the novels, establishes Bond as a \\"cold blooded killer.\\"One of the features of Bond stories that I enjoy is their 1950's setting. Fleming wrote from the 50's, obviously without any knowledge of how the future would unfold or how his time and thought process would be viewed years after he committed them to paper. The alieness of all of this is stark in \\"For Your Eyes Only.\\" The target of Bond's assassination attempt is a former Nazi, who had recently been inn the employ of Cuba's dictator, Battista. Battista was still in power when Fleming was writing, and Castro is mentioned not only sympathetically, but as an admirable quasi-ally. He certainly isn't one of the Communists under just about every bush Bond looks under in most of the novels.Neither the Nazi origins of the villain, Von Hammerstein, or even the villain's name, ever make it into any of the Bond films. But much of this short story does. For such a weak story, I was interested that most of it made it into the movie version of FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. The movie was bigger, and the short story really comprised about a quarter of the film, but I was reminded once again that some of the Bond films improved upon the stories rather than just borrowing the names.\\"Quantum of Solace\\"\\"Quantum of Solace\\" is only superficially a James Bond story. Oddly, then, it is the most interesting and compelling at least of the first three stories in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY. Bond is in Jamaica on assignment, but the story is not about the assignment. In this one, Bond mostly listens to a story within the story, told by the colonial governor of Jamaica, with whom he had just had dinner. This story within the story is the thrust of \\"Quantum of Solace.\\" It has nothing to do with espionage, action, or adventure. Rather, it is a brief tale about a failed relationship. That's it. Somehow Fleming manages to make it interesting. I was wondering where the story was going and was caught off guard by its mild, but unexpected surprise ending. In this regard, Fleming achieves on a small level some of what he otherwise better captures through novels than short stories. While \\"Quantum\\" has little to do with Bond (or, more accurately, Bond has little to do in Quantum), it is the most enjoyable story so far in this collection.\\"Risco\\"A good portion of the plot of the movie, For Your Eyes Only, is taken from this short story. After reading this and the short story version of FYEO, I came to a greater appreciation of the movie-maker's desire to blend the two stories together into a coherent one that remains as faithful as could be hoped to a couple of short stories.\\"Risco\\" plays out the Kristatos-Columbo rivalry around which the plot of the movie turns. Of all the short stories in this book it is the one that most resembles the previous Bond novels. It involves a mission to a foreign land, colorful characters, a devious villain with vague ties to Russia, and in Columbo, an ally somewhat reminiscent of Karim Bey in From Russia with Love. Nevertheless, \\"Risco\\" is not as good as any of the previous books, probably in part because it is not developed like a full novel. Also, not for the first time, while reading it I felt that the moviemakers did this story better. I was actually somewhat bored reading it.There are no great surprises in \\"Risco,\\" perhaps because we all know Kristatos, not Columbo, is the real villain. Nothing special is revealed about Bond's past or his predilections. As with most of the rest of the short stories in this compellation, \\"Risco\\" seems more like the outline of a story than a complete work.\\"The Hildebrand Rarity\\"After being worked over by the somewhat boring \\"Risco,\\" \\"The Hildebrand Rarity\\" delivers the knockout punch. For Your Eyes Only saves the worst for last. It is significant to note that very little of this short story made its way into any Bond movie to day. \\"Milton Krest,\\" the character that passes for a villain in this one, and his boat, The Wavekrest, appear in the movie, License to Kill, but only in name. The story of \\"The Hildebrand Rarity\\" is lost in the final pages of this book.\\"The Hildebrand Rarity\\" contains one of the worst elements of Bond stories: Bond is basically an observer of events here. How and why he ends up in the situation of the story, which has nothing to do with spying or even government work, is murky at best. The story is basically a reverse mystery, a Murder on the Orient Express set on a ship, with an all-too-easy search for a rare fish thrown in, and one twist. Fleming's twists are usually the capstones to his Bond novels, but here the twist is that the mystery is never solved. Indeed, the build up to the crime is too long, and the aftermath is wholly inadequate. It is almost as if Fleming got tired of this story and just put it down. I did too."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"This collection of five James Bond stories is a slight effort. For fans of Ian Fleming, this is an interlude in the major novels. For the uninitiated, this is an opportunity to sample Fleming's fiction in its pristine state, before tampering by over-the-top filmmakers. The typical traits of the Bond/Fleming cycle are present. The James Bond created by Ian Fleming is an iron fist in a velvet glove. A no-nonsense guy who is good to have on your side. Fleming blends the hard-boiled edginess of Dashiell Hammett with the sophistication of Dorothy Sayers. Snobbery is evident. Bond is a lone wolf, and prefers it that way. The writing assumes a working knowledge of French and Italian. This can confuse some readers, especially Americans, in descriptions of food, liquor, etc. Three of the five stories are straightforward Cold War era espionage stories of murder, revenge, and betrayal. This includes \\"A View to a Kill,\\" \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\" and \\"Risico.\\" The irascible M is present, most especially in the title tale. Bonds comes off best in these three stories. \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is an odd piece that could have been written by John O'Hara. It shows Ian Fleming flexing his literary muscles. \\"The Hildebrand Rarity\\" is a story of vengeance and murder, but it has nothing to do with Cold War spies.

Some of them were later used in the \\"James Bond\\" series of films. Note the similarities between \\"Quantum of Solace\\" to \\"The Hildebrand Rarity\\". This is a good sample of Fleming's works.\\"From A View To A Kill\\" tells of the killing of a dispatch rider outside of Paris to steal his official messages. James Bond is called to solve this mystery after the experts were stumped. The search dogs found nothing, but there was a problem by a deserted campground. Bond searches and finds some hidden marks on some trees. By waiting and watching in camouflage he discovers the secret. The pages tell how this threat was neutralized.\\"For Your Eyes Only\\" tells how a property in Jamaica went up for sale. Eventually this news reached London and M. sends James Bond to take care of this problem. But someone else has the same idea. They cooperate to get rough justice in the Adirondacks.\\"Quantum of Solace\\" tells how James Bond was sent to Jamaica to stop arms sales to the Cuban rebels (Bond's sympathies were with the rebels). Bond planted firebombs on the arms ships. Later Bond has a conversation with the Governor, who explains what keeps a marriage together. He then tells a very interesting story about a married couple and their fates.\\"Risico\\" is about a risky business that will involve James Bond. It is to stop the Italian connection that is bringing narcotics to England. Bond learns more form his target, and sails to visit a foreign port. Mission accomplished. But what happened afterwards?\\"The Hildebrand Rarity\\" has James Bond vacationing in the Seychelles (to scope out the islands for M.), Milton Krest explains how charitable foundations are used to dodge taxes on the rich.

At their worst, they betray both a sloppiness in Fleming's approach to his stories and an implausibility in their design. Fleming's more episodic approach here means less involvement than you get with \\"Casino Royale\\" or \\"From Russia With Love\\", but it also means less room to go off the rails.That was the problem with the previous two Bond novels, \\"Doctor No\\" and \\"Goldfinger\\", which meandered too much and betrayed Fleming's boredom with his creation. Published in 1960, \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" benefits from presenting Bond in smaller doses, enough to deliver jolts of excitement but not enough for what were becoming persistent and fatal bouts of narrative ennui. Fleming still seems restless with his role of Bond chronicler, and veers off in a couple of instances here from the spy-story route. Yet this is actually to the book's benefit.The opening story, \\"From A View To A Kill\\", involves Bond investigating the disappearance of a motorcycle courier working for NATO. An opening scene establishes the courier's fate amid the bucolic, uncaring splendor of the French countryside. Bond appears to make what he can of the case despite some realistic inter-departmental friction.I actually found this the weak sister of the five, though I did enjoy it quite a lot. The main debit here are the villains, hastily drawn up and weakly disposed of. Still, Fleming does make the 30-page story read even faster.Title tale \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" has Bond on the trail of a cold-blooded murderer looking for a new hideout. Working not as a spy but as a favor to M, Bond sees his assignment through in a way only slightly more satisfying than \\"View\\". Again, Fleming's descriptive powers make for the strongest impressions, as we watch birds frolic in a lushly-gardened Jamaican estate (again, with sudden death to follow).From here, we come to \\"Quantum Of Solace\\", the true oddball in this collection, but one that reveals Fleming's larger gifts as a storyteller. Bond really isn't needed in this story at all; he appears only as a sympathetic listener while a British foreign officer tells about a marriage gone wrong in a colonial outpost in the Caribbean. Fleming offers a gripping soap opera in miniature, about what happens when a couple's respect for one another is completely dissolved.My favorite story in the bunch, \\"Risico\\", is a title unfamiliar to Bond-movie lovers, though they will recognize both characters and plot elements from portions of the movie \\"For Your Eyes Only\\", which cleverly borrowed from the story of the same name as well. It's the only time in this whole book we see Bond as a secret agent, in Italy trying to shut down a drug-smuggling operation. There he runs into the mysterious \\"Dove\\", Enrico Colombo, one of the best characters of the whole series. Fleming delivers the best action sequence of the book with an attack on a warehouse, and some very clever narrative slight-of-hand keep you happily offguard regarding what happens next.Finally there's \\"The Hildebrand Rarity\\", another offbeat exploration into domestic strife, though this time with Bond as a more active player. Again, Fleming's scene-setting powers take center-stage, this time in an undersea environment Bond explores in pursuit of the title fish, a rarity wanted by American millionaire Milton Krest. Krest beats his wife and lectures Bond on British inferiority, which puts him at the center of a satisfying revenge story that Fleming dares to leave unresolved. Of all the stories, \\"Hildebrand\\" seems most worthy of a full-length novel, though it lacks the sense of mission informing \\"Risico\\".A solid placeholder in the Bond canon hinting at deeper territory, \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" may work best for those already familiar with the series, who don't need too much prose to be drawn back into Bond's world in this fit-and-start manner. For them, the book offers a very entertaining return to form for Fleming, and perhaps that's why his next few novels would present a Bond recharged."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"All of Fleming's Bond novels, and most of his short stories, are such a relief to read in today's relativist, anti-patriotic, multi-cultural, male-bashing or emasculating culture. These novels (and also Mickey Spillane's) are my measure of what a cultural norm should be. They are such an antidote to the weepy, pseudo-introspective rubbish that passes for popular literature today."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"This grouping of short stories doesn't hold up to the normal standard that i think most of the Ian Fleming's James Bond novels do.

The murdered Havelocks of \\"For Your Eyes Only\\" connected to the rousing drug battle in \\"Risico\\".The last story is classic Bond: the studly spy savors the opportunity to comfort a brand-new but incredibly hot widow on a sea cruise--even as he wonders whether she was responsible for her late husband's ghastly death. Now that's the 007 we've known and loved.Perhaps the most interesting story is \\"A Quantum of Solace\\"--because it's hardly an action-packed story of espionage at all! Bond listens to an old man tell the gossipy story of a civil servant's melodramatic marriage/divorce, and Fleming makes it work. I found the story even more interesting now that I've read Andrew Lycett's excellent biography of Fleming and learned that Fleming included details from the lives of his friends in the Caribbean.I also learned from Fleming's biography that he suffered a massive heart attack around this time, so it will be interesting to see if this affects his writing from here on. Next up: \\"Thunderball\\"."},{"Title":"For Your Eyes Only (The Complete James Bond)","review":"I have read all of Fleming's 007 novels and this is perhaps his weakest work, but it is still enjoyable and entertaining to read.FYEO is a collection of 5 short stories. The stories can be summed up as follows:FROM A VIEW TO A KILL - Bond sets out to find and destroy the secret hideout of a spy ring that has eluded the top security brains of fourteen countries.FOR YOUR EYES ONLY - Bond is on an \\"unofficial\\" mission to assassinate a professional killer (and former Nazi) who murdered the personal friends of M.QUANTUM OF SOLACE - Bond learns the strange secret of one of the guests at a dinner party held at the Governor's house.RISICO - Bond gets set up by a dope dealing agent of SMERSH.THE HILDEBRAND RARITY - Bond becomes party to sudden and ghastly murder aboard a luxury yacht that is returning from finding one of the rarest species of fish.I enjoyed all of the stories expect FROM A VIEW TO A KILL. That particular story has absolutely nothing to do with the same titled film except the Parisian setting and its title.While these stories do very little for the continuation of the Bond series they do give some insight into Bond's human side. For fans of Bond it is definitely a must read. But for anyone looking for their first Bond to read I definitely recommend choosing another Fleming novel. The novels blend the action and character of Bond much better than a short story can. They also create much greater suspense. My personal favorites are CASINO ROYALE, FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE, DR.

The story is good, but the main selling point is the riveting performance by Ellison, which is more then worth the price of admission. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"City of Darkness","review":"This is my first foray into Ben Bova's work. I've seen it around but never quite picked it up. If this is typical of the quality of his work, I will be back for more.The story is set in a future United States in which the cities have been closed. New York City is cut off from the rest of the country except for the summer months - where it becomes a tourist destination away from the unrelenting tedium of suburbia (called \\"the tracts\\"). Our protagonist runs away to the city and gets locked in after it is closed at the end of the summer - and he finds out that the city is not empty after all...Harlan Ellison makes this audiobook seem like a one man radio play.

As he narrates a scene in a smoky room, he coughs, when the hero gets winded, the narration does as well. Most of the &quot;voices&quot; of the various protagonists are downright embarrassing. Evidently Harlan never read the story before narrating it. This is painfully obvious at every turn of the story, where Harlan increases the tension in his voice as a plot is resolving, or heightens the drama to a fever pitch, just as the hero makes it to safety.Overall, I would have turned it off if the story hadn't been so gripping.

The Booklist review states that this is the first comprehensive encyclopedia on the subject. The reviewer clearly isn't familiar with the literature. Fleming and Honour's Dictionary of the Decorative Arts, first published in 1977, is still the gold standard. It is disappointing that the the Grove Encyclopedia hasn't chosen to broaden the scope geographically from the Honor and Fleming work beyond Eurocentric. It is also regrettable that, although craft objects can be found that meet the standard of \\"objects found in museums,\\" they have apparently been given short shrift across the board. Although the editor's credentials are very impressive, they don't reflect grounding in the decorative arts as opposed to fine arts or architecture. Also, since he doesn't credit the contributors to the articles, one can't know whether the articles are informed by someone who is a decorative arts specialist.As an individual researcher, I can't tell from the reviews whether this expensive work would be a valuable addition to my library or not."},{"Title":"Fundamentals of Probability, with Stochastic Processes (3rd Edition)","review":"This book makes a turgid and unintuitive subject even more opaque and convoluted. The lessons focus on the abstract and do not lead the reader into the practical.

A fundamental understanding of calculus will barely assist the reader make sense of the examples. Expecting the reader armed with the chapter to be able to solve the problems is like expecting a person with a lathe and a forge to construct a go-cart. While its theoretically possible that they might, the fact of the matter is that this book does not give one the tools needed to approach and digest the material.For example, section 1 is a very basic chapter on axioms of probability and simple set theory. At the end, in the review section, they ask you this:\\"Let A be the set of rational numbers in (0,1). Since A is countable, it can be written as a sequence [example given]. Prove that for any epsilon > 0, A can be covered by a sequence of open balls whose total length is less than epsilon. That is, for every epsilon > 0 there exists a sequence of open intervals (alpha, beta) such that every r a member of (alpha, beta) and the summation of 1 to infinity of ( beta - alpha) &lt; epsilon.

If Mr Ghahramani wants to illustrate concepts with an endless stream of babble and examples, at least give some sort of overview at the end of paragraphs. Don't burden the reader with the task of seperating what is important from what is meant more as an illustration in case you didn't understand the theoretical concepts.What's perhaps even more irritating, though, is the absense of a study aid with answers. This makes it virtually impossible to use it for self-study. There are (ironically) very concise answers to the odd-numbered questions at the end, but I prefer to check my answers immediately and learn from any mistakes I may have made.I may have fired away a bit too strongly at the beginning.

I really don't feel that it helped me at all; I know myself well enough to know that the suggestions it has simply will not work for me. I just don't work that way.It didn't help that five out of twelve chapters were dedicated to poetry, and I am simply not a poet. I can, if my feet are held to the fire, write poetry, but I get no pleasure from it, and whether anyone else appreciates my poems or not, I never do. Which is only fair, since I rarely appreciate anyone else's poetry, either; my general opinion of poetry is that in most cases, it's self-indulgent drivel. Free verse, especially, but a writer who can manage rhyme and meter without devolving into doggerel is as rare as a statesman in politics these days.Even the chapters that dealt with prose, though, suggested things that might work for most, and might increase my quantity of work if I followed them. I suppose, if I followed them religiously enough, I might even be able to refine a few diamonds out of all the lumps of coal. But the price would be that I would come to despise writing, and would never want to do it again. That's too high a price to pay. I'll continue to wait until I have an idea worth writing about, give it some serious thought, mentally form the idea into a story, and once I have a good idea of where it's going, THEN I'll sit down at my keyboard to write. I'll have fewer pieces to show for my efforts that way than I would if I forced myself to sit and write SOMETHING even when I have no ideas, \\"freewrite\\" random associations, and then go back and try to refine them into something workable later (which is what this book advises). But I won't have piles and piles of drivel with my name on it that I have to wade though on a regular basis. I consider that a fair trade. It's sort of like going to a cocktail party and waiting until you have something to say that's worth adding to the conversation as opposed to running your mouth whether you have something to say or not; if you do things the first way, you run the risk of getting overlooked and being perceived as a wallflower, but if you do things the second way, your odds of being perceived as a pushy jerk with more ego than brains goes up geometrically. Granted, as a writer, no one has to see your verbal diarrea but yourself, which is a definite advantage. But I don't want to see it, either, much less have to spend hours wading through it trying to find the kernel or two of wheat amid the chaff.It also didn't help that I really didn't think much of ANY of the writing samples that they used to illustrate various tricks of the trade.

A biography of Brigadier Arnold Potts.","review":"\\"Warrior of Kokoda\\" is the story of Brigadier Arnold Potts, a country farmer from Western Australia who led the Australian 21st Infantry Brigade on the Kokoda Track in 1942. He organised and inspired his outnumbered and out-gunned brigade, together with the remnants of \\"Maroubra Force\\", to conduct a three-week-long fighting withdrawal back along the Kokoda Track. The Japanese force was eventually fought to a standstill along the ridges overlooking Port Moresby. To this day, some regard him as 'the man who saved Australia'. However, instead of receiving the accolades of his commanders and the thanks of the nation, Potts was ignominiously removed from his command shortly afterwards and sent to sent to the 23rd Brigade at Adelaide River, south of Darwin. Many of the veterans of the Kokoda campaign regard this episode as a disgrace and an attempt to cover up the inadequacies of the Allied High Command.Others do not agree and believe that Potts was merely transferred, for quite legitimate military reasons. The controversy remains. Warrior of Kokoda describes the action on the Kokoda Track and Brigadier Potts's intimate involvement in it. It also reveals the behind-the-scenes manoeuvring between Prime Minister John Curtin, General Douglas MacArthur, and General Sir Thomas Blamey. Chicanery and heroism went hand in hand during Australia's darkest hour in 1942And here's an article on the book from the Australian Army History Unit. Quite interesting.\\"Alongside Gallipoli, the Kokoda Trail is arguably Australia's most significant military engagement. Where the landings on the beach in Gallipoli in 1915 have become part of the national consciousness, and gave rise to the Anzac tradition, Kokoda is altogether something different. Moreover, generations of school children have learnt of the sacrifices made at Gallipoli. To be aware of what occurred on that fateful April dawn is essential knowledge for understanding the tradition of mateship and nationhood. Appropriately, with each passing year the few remaining original Diggers are accorded national, iconic status. Australia was not directly threatened by the events at Gallipoli. Our participation was as much an expression of our deference to Empire as it was to national pride. The same cannot be said for Kokoda.David Horner is one of Australia\\"s leading military historians. He is a senior fellow in the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University. His estimation of the importance of Kokoda is unambiguous. \\"In relation to the direct security of the nation, no Australians have fought more important battles than those who struggled through the Papua's Owen Stanley Range during and August and September 1942\\". Yet, to imagine Kokoda as a moment in Australia\\"s military history where a unified sense of purpose was evident is - according to military historian Bill Edgar - to misread the situation. Central to this is the relationship of Brigadier Arnold Potts and General Thomas Blamey, the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Army.From a number of perspectives, Potts is a distinctive Australian. A part-time soldier, he was a farmer from the remote territory of south Western Australia. He had served in the 1914-18 war and he began World War II as a major in the 2/16th Battalion. In the space of three years, he was commanding the 21st Brigade on the Kokoda Trail. The feats of the 2/16th and the 21st Brigade are legendary in the annals of Australian war history. David Horner believes that the 21st Brigade under Potts contributed significantly to the repulse of the Japanese. \\"It is generally realised that because of the bad weather that hung over the peaks ... the Owen Stanley Range was a considerable barrier to aircraft as well as men on foot. If the Japanese had taken Port Moresby, their bombers could have attacked Northern Queensland at will.\\"The Japanese advance was slowed by the efforts of Potts and his men. The men were proud of their achievements and were inspired by the leadership of Potts. A month after the battle of Kokoda, Potts was relieved of command by Blamey. It was not a decision well received by Potts or his men. Until now, there has not been a sustained analysis of the circumstances surrounding Blamey\\"s actions concerning Potts. There may not be any absolute truth in history, only interpretations, yet research undertaken by Bill Edgar is sure to enliven the controversy around the relationship between Potts and Blamey.Edgar is unequivocal. He believes that Blamey treated Potts shabbily. Edgar sees that there may be flaws in Blamey\\"s character which contributed to his actions which even today are questionable. \\"The Blamey factor in the Arnold Potts story proved difficult to ignore. The general was a contradiction. He was deified by Establishment and yet vilified by the ordinary men he commanded. There was an irrationality about some of his actions in 1942, which for me has never been satisfactorily explained.\\" Edgar\\"s views on Potts and Blamey are part of a new biography: Warrior of Kokoda. A biography of Brigadier Arnold Potts. If anything, Edgar\\"s research has taken a very different tack from what has generally been the case with Blamey in particular and Potts as well.This is in the use of applying psychoanalytic techniques to figures in the past. Edgar says he anticipates this will be controversial. \\"I think Sir Basil Liddell Hart put it correctly when he said that military history should be a study of the psychological reactions of the commanders, with merely a background of events to throw their thoughts, impressions and decisions into clear relief. \\"I don\\"t think Australian military history has gone down that path. You need to leave the possibilities open. David Horner, as editor of the military biography series, of which my book is part of, is the centre of a conservative establishment. The issue of the relieving of Potts has been going on since 1942, and the men of the 21st Brigade have belt that they have not had a voice.\\"While Edgar's motivation is laudable, Horner sees there are some difficulties with Edgar's views. \\"I would say that he has put forth a hypothesis rather than saying that events happened in the way they are supposed to have done.\\" Notwithstanding Horner's reservations, Edgar's conclusions about Blamey are likely to be controversial. He mounts a plausible case, Horner admits as much and yet, what Edgar may have done by revisiting the past, is to be accused of significantly eroding Blarney's reputation. Edgar says he is ready for this. \\"I'll take some flak over my criticism of Blamey. To keep Blamey as a figure to admire, we need our myths.\\"\\"When Blamey died in May 1951, however, it was with the official accolades of his nation, and with his treasured field marshal's baton. Is this particular field marshal's baton more a tribute to ruthlessness and a capacity for astute political manoeuvre than to any greatness in the field of military endeavour? Many ordinary Diggers, even now, think so.\\" The core of Edgar's work is the responsibility of the historian to continue to re-examine the past with a view to striving to represent it more truthfully, if not differently. For Edgar the facts do speak for themselves that Potts and the men who fought alongside him have been marginalised by Australian army high command.The obvious question is why did Blamey feel it was necessary to remove Potts from his command after his successes on the Kokoda Trail in August and September in 1942? Edgar is unequivocal. General MacArthur had felt that the Australians were not performing well in New Guinea. \\"The blokes who fought under Potts feel betrayed as MacArthur was working through Prime Minister Curtin to get at Blamey.\\" It is a point Horner has some sympathy for. \\"Blamey was under pressure to have a success in New Guinea. MacArthur was saying that Australia had failed and by implication, Blamey had failed. MacArthur had Curtin's ear. It was MacArthur's view that Blamey should take command and so Blamey went to New Guinea. Curtin had to accept MacArthur's position as he was Commander-in-Chief.\\"Opinion is divided as to what kind of man Arnold Potts was. He was formidable as a leader of men yet given to questioning the sense of those above him. Edgar does not eulogise Potts, but he makes his position clear: \\"Potts was a man for all seasons. A great soldier, citizen and family man. He was quietly ebullient. He was physically tough, popular with his men and in his letters to his wife, he revealed a gentle and tender side of his complex personality.\\" The action Blamey took can be seen as the decision of a desperate man. By sacking Potts, he removed from his post one of the most well supported men by those he commanded without Edgar believes, wholly convincing arguments. Horner says that Potts may have been the price Blamey needed to pay. \\"For Blamey to sack Potts, he would be seen as doing something. Many judges, and Edgar is one, think that Potts was doing a good Job. Yet, he had certain character traits which may have worked against him.\\"\\"He was not a highly trained soldier in terms of managing staff. He was good on the Kokoda Trail, but not good elsewhere. In Bougainville, for example, he went like a bull at a gate.\\" Where Edgar's research into Potts has broader dimensions is how he regards the Australian military culture. He feels that Potts fell foul of a system, which could not easily embrace him. It would still be unable to do so. Blamey represented this culture when Potts was fighting on the Kokoda Trail and Edgar believes Potts spoke his mind frankly, something which was not always welcome. \\"Potts, aware of the machination that had been going on in high places, was nevertheless getting on with his own job, hopeful that the commanders and the politicians, were getting it right at last.\\"In some senses, Potts exhibited the characteristics of the Australian identity, which have come to be valued as national qualities. He was an unswerving supporter of his mates, he could make do in times of considerable adversity, and he backed his judgement. He was of a generation who effectively built rural Australia. He was hard working, resolute and prepared to go the extra mile if the thought there was to be a chance of benefit for those who depended on him. Characteristics Edgar says, which brought him into conflict with the army. \\"Potts was a maverick. He didn't like superiors. He'd ask awkward questions and he took delight in tearing down authority.\\"This is clearly evident in a letter in October 1942 from Potts to his wife. He reveals his disregard and agitation towards Blamey and at the same time, indicates that he believes he could do better than his so-called betters: \\"TAB called yesterday. He is looking old and harassed. The political side butts in and he screams and interferes terrifically and the axe is held over any head that doesn't bow to superior wisdom. I'd love to have an hour of authority and ask who is running the bloody war and who is entitled to criticise.\\"\\"Potts was an independent character who knew that ultimately he was going to go back to his farm. He was also a driven man. He liked to be in control.\\" In the rewriting of Australian history by the present generation there inevitably will be some controversy. What Edgar has achieved is to give an important and informed opinion of an inadequately understood and appreciated decision by Australia's foremost military commander during the fighting on the Kokoda Trail. David Horner, who has written extensively on Blamey, although not agreeing with all that Edgar says, nonetheless concedes that Edgar has made a timely contribution to Australia's military and social history. \\"There is an opinion that suggests Blamey could do no wrong. There is the Blamey memorial trust for example.\\"\\"I compare Blamey to Rupert Murdoch. He was running a big empire and he trampled on a few people in doing so.\\" Yet, it is not just Potts and Blamey who take centre stage in this sure to be controversial study. Prime Minister Curtin is questioned and General MacArthur is revealed as a man who Edgar believes had no qualms about blaming the Australians for any setbacks in order to preserve his reputation in Washington. Blamey does not come out well from Edgar's sifting of the past. With the evidence Edgar provides, it is difficult to see how he could. Potts is a man much maligned and maybe willingly misunderstood by the ranks above him. He was abrasive and like the men he commanded, first and foremost a soldier.In the mud and blood of the Kokoda Trail it was those men, well led, who effectively saved Australia. Something his superiors were loathe to recognise."},{"Title":"The Big Bow Mystery","review":"Author Israel Zangwill wrote one of the earliest locked-room mysteries in &quot;The Big Bow Mystery.&quot; A woman becomes discouraged when she cannot wake her new lodger. He is in his room, which has been locked from the inside. Despite her fervent knocks, she simply cannot wake him, and she hears no sounds from within. Convinced that her lodger has been murdered, she enlists the help of a celebrated ex-detective neighbor. He breaks down the door, and the lodger is found dead in his bed, his throat slit. The door was indeed locked from the inside, and the windows were similarly secured. Thus is the puzzle at the heart of one of the earliest (circa 1891) locked-room mysteries.Zangwill has indeed included a masterful puzzle, though the story itself is somewhat problematic. The middle of the story is unnecessarily complex and confusing, and there is a bit too much devotion to politics. Still, the book is very accessible, and anyone with a fondness for the sort of &quot;impossible&quot; crime that John Dickson Carr (a.k.a. Carter Dickson, a.k.a. Carr Dickson) later made famous should read this early entry to the genre.Note: I read the paperback book for this review and have not listened to the tapes."},{"Title":"The Big Bow Mystery","review":"Israel Zangwill did not write this novel to write a mystery, he wrote it to be a satire of Victorian England. The charecters are on dimesional at best, and completely unlikeable, even the detective. The solution for the mystery is belivable, but the reason for the impossible nature of the crime is completely unbelivable. Like the other reviewers have said, and I agree, the middle of the story is completely pointless, as are several of the charecters. But, it was the first locked room mystery novel, so I must give it some credit."},{"Title":"The Big Bow Mystery","review":"One of the main points of this novel is that people see what they expect to see, and do so at the expense of what's really there. So, caveat lector. Don't start this early locked-room mystery (the first?) expecting a purist's detective tale of the later (Golden Age) type. That's not to say that it isn't a decent locked-room mystery with a couple of last-page surprises, but Zangwill also uses the genre as a vehicle for his ideas and observations, and for poking fun at late Victorian London. The novel offers a good representation of the period--especially with regards to the labor movement--Dickensian characters (almost caricatures, not necessarily likeable but still entertaining), and quite a bit of sardonic humor.In that regard it struck me as more \\"modern\\" than many later and more pristine detective novels of the twenties and thirties."},{"Title":"The Big Bow Mystery","review":"The fact that the mystery disappears after the second chapter in no way detracts from the joy of this book. From widowed boarding house attendants to freeloading artists to a detective that might as well be the anti-Sherlock Holmes, this is one of the funniest and meanest books to come out of the Victorian era.Known primarily for Children of the Ghetto, Israel Zangwill was a Jewish Victorian writer with an eye for the foibles and idicoies of every day life. The mystery is not so much abandoned as seen from a societal basis. We have the glory hounds, the newspaper stories, the sensationalists, and the vendors who gather outside the scene of the murder to sell food to the tourists.When the murderer is revealed, it's a bit of a letdown, but the trip from the beginning to the end is so enjoyable that you don't mind."},{"Title":"The Big Bow Mystery","review":"My favorite mystery reading is by authors of the 1800's. They were the days of authors who could definitely write, not at all liketoday's so called writers(Micheal Connolly is probably the best).I had heard of Zangwill but had never read any of his writings.This one when it began I was intrigued; a real mystery..lockedroom then it begans to meander into labor relations, etc. of theperiod occasionally inserting something about the crime thenback again to other things. Angwill is sometimes amusing in thenames and description of his characters such as, Mrs. Drabdump.Another character was, Peter Crowl who evidently wanted to knoweverything about everything from the Bible on. This is a description of Peter Crowl: Crowl was a thinker or thought hewas which seems to involve original thinking' his hair thinningrapidly at the top as his brain was struggling to get as near aspossible o the realities of things.

Each writer brings his or her own brand of horror to the table and the result is something too deliciously fun to miss.First up is a twangy backwater yarn set in a place where \\"...you can't hardly drive across town without caking your Goodyears in the slimy carcasses of tiny, eight-legged speedbumps.\\" Cullen Bunn's Blood Feud tells the story of poker buddies who square off with the legions of Hell and, to borrow a phrase from the author, this tale is blacker-than-snuff-spit and every bit as fun as it sounds. Bunn has a real brilliance for delivering the loony macabre and his voice is dead-on. Blood Feud is guaranteed to tickle your funny bone and scare you witless.Next up; Blood Rose Editor Mark Worthen gives us The Minimart, the Ruger, and the Girl, a tale that puts the vampire right there in line with you while you're paying for gas. When first we meet retired-biker-turned-slushy-ringer-upper Nick, he's in the middle of trying to transport a corpse on his Harley. Pay attention. Nick pops up again in a later story and you'll be very glad he does. I liked Nick instantly, as well as Lysette; a vampire that looks like a beautiful teenage girl but has all the smarts of her ninety some odd years tucked away in her bag of tricks. I liked Metronome Kid too. M., the R. and the G has a little bit of everything; mystery, suspense, a few snorts, and some romance. I want to see a whole book of Nick and Lysette stories. The same can be said for The Carrion Bird, the Angel of Death, and Me. Nick's voice is a dry, endearing hybrid of crusty and sweet and it's easy to see why Lysette feels the way she does about him. He never takes himself too seriously and Worthen creates magic with this character. Speaking of magic; Maslow's Magic Eight Ball, another Worthen piece, provides a nice contrast with a slightly more poetic style.And now for something completely different; J.P. Edwards lends a soft beauty to Thicker Then Water with two offerings that give a richer, more emotional depth to the concept of horror. Voices in the Dark is a mysterious piece, rife with mood and color, and in White Roses and Matching Caskets, Edwards' soothing tone is served up with just the right creepy edge. These stories are apt to touch you in a deeper place, and if that isn't scary, I don't know what is.Three stories by Curt Hoffmeister round out Thicker Than Water with a spicy concoction of history, sex, and blood. Jade is a cop story with a comic-book flavor and a werewolf sprinkled in. It opens with a stripper sliding head-first down a pole. Hoffmeister has a knack for injecting comedic and supernatural elements into unexpected places. All three stories are woven together by the sinuous golden thread that is the French vampire Desiree Le Gallienne. This beautiful icy-eyed bloodsucker is not afraid to dole out a Cruel Destiny to those who deserve it. My favorite is Behind the Veil of an Odalisque whose title is a perfect metaphor for the sumptuous intrigue you'll find within. Desiree infiltrates a Moslem harem during the Ottoman Empire to save a slave girl kidnapped by Barbary pirates. Hoffmeister delivers big-hearted vampires and crisp, clever wit amid a dazzling spectacle of jeweled candelabras, flashing sabers, and ripped guts. It's the perfect finish for an anthology fueled by a vast and colorful array of terrors."},{"Title":"Thicker Than Water","review":"Thicker Than Water is a good collection of vampire short fiction by four authors. Nine unusual stories of vampire fiction will enthrall you long after the book is read. The stories range from cheesy B-movie type horror to frightening tales with spiders, werewolves, ghosts, and of course vampires. Voices in the Dark was the most touching story, but my favorite one was Jade, the story of a vampire stripper. These authors skillfully draw you into a voyeuristic view of their world and the tantalizing glimpses will fire your imagination. It was a pleasant surprise to find other short stories in the book involving the same characters. Although brief, they are deep with friendship, love, and desire proving that blood really is thicker than water."},{"Title":"The Anabaptist View of the Church (Dissent and Nonconformity)","review":"In this foundational study of Anabaptist history and thought, Franklin H. Littell calls for a complete re-assessment of the notoriously ambiguous label \\"Anabaptist.\\" Littell, Professor Emeritus of Religion at Temple University, challenges traditional interpretations of Anabaptism by utilizing primary sources. Ironically, as Littell notes, historians of the last 400 years have made little use of Anabaptist writings when dealing with Anabaptism. Also, the scarcity of primary sources (at least until the twentieth-century), abundance of hostile polemical writings, and tendentious citation of secondary sources illustrate poor historiographical discipline where Anabaptism is concerned. The Anabaptist View of the Church seeks to correct this centuries-long mistake.Littell begins with the problem of Anabaptism's essence. Littell clearly states that no complete uniformity can be found in the early years of the radical movement. However, this quintessential question of a single essence cannot be answered without looking at the major reform centers (Wittenberg, Zurich, and Strassburg). Littell quickly points out the ambivalent relationship between the reformers in each city and the flocks of radicals that arrived. The Munster debacle was a watershed event in the relationship between the radicals and reformers. Unfortunately, revolution came to be seen as a major element of all \\"Anabaptists\\" after the peasant's revolt and failure at Munster.It is a fact that some pockets of radicalism (i.e., Munster) were revolutionary, but certainly not all. The \\"Maccabean\\" type of radicalism, as Littell calls it, held firmly to an eschatological view of reform. In this light, the church-state tensions \\"can be reduced by a theocratic attempt of the elect to gain control of the centers of power and to govern the world as though it were the church.\\" The radical leaders in Munster instituted a \\"Davidic\\" dynasty with a foreshortened eschatology. The revolutionary spirit present in Munster is typical of many eschatalogically driven movements: push ahead, no matter the cost! But, the revolutionary spirit present in Munster was atypical of Anabaptists. In the end, after Munster, the reformers were, for the most part, unable to distinguish between the revolutionary radicals, and the quiet radicals. As a result, widespread prejudice and persecution sought all radicals. What began as control through confiscation and exile, culminated in forcible extinction.While Anabaptists (violent and non-violent) were intolerable in most of Europe, Phillip of Hesse offered a tolerable haven for religious dissenters. In Hesse there was no death-penalty or outright rejection of ecclesiastical reform. In fact, Phillip himself was a primitivist who also desired a return to apostolic Christianity. Littell aptly points out that Phillip of Hesse emerged as an early voice for religious tolerance out of the horrors of religious persecution in the sixteenth-century. The success of his tolerant policies should not be a footnote in the larger discussion.By the end of chapter one, Littell continues to work out a viable understanding of Anabaptism's essence. \\"All of this indicates that the movement is not susceptible to a facile interpretation.\\" With such an array of groups scattered across Europe, one cannot argue for a simple definition of Anabaptism. However, Littell uncovers two recurring themes common to all groups under the \\"Anabaptist\\" umbrella: 1) they saw themselves as communities of discipline, and 2) as a community, they constituted the true church.Chapter two introduces \\"fall\\" imagery as a foundational Anabaptist critique of Rome, the reformers, and all of Christendom. Littell connects the idea of a \\"fall\\" in Anabaptist thought with religious (and cultural) primitivism. The \\"True Church\\" experienced a fall after the apostolic age just as humanity spiraled downward following Eden. There was disagreement among reformers and radicals as to the exact date of the fall, but both groups believed in a tragic failure at some point.Littell contends that both the nature of the fall, and the method by which it might be corrected, are at the heart of the break between the reformers and radicals. The former were not willing to discard the parish church; the latter believed the whole system to be destroyed beyond repair. Where could the Anabaptists look for a model? Unfortunately, Anabaptists could not look to Rome for a model of ecclesiastical reform. Interestingly, according to the radicals, the reformers had only offered a false hope of mending the broken system and offered nothing in the way of constructive change.Instead of looking about, they looked to the early church. The common characteristics of the early church's relationship to the world were similar to the situation facing sixteenth-century radicals. Thus, the model of the primitive \\"pre-fall\\" community of faith includes the following: pacifism, communism, simplicity, and the importance of the common man. It is clear from these principles that Anabaptism presented more than a simple theological debate. Its prophetic presence and essence called for a re-assessment of the social and political order.Littell moves on in chapter three to treat the internal nature of the True Church within, the community itself. What are the marks of the True Church according to Anabaptist writings? Littell posits believer's baptism, spiritual government, community, the Lord's Supper, and the authority of civil government (passive obedience) as the Anabaptist marks of the true Christian church. Detailed analysis of each mark is not necessary in a paper such as this, but it should be noted that \\"the Anabaptist sense of destiny as the Church of the Martyrs is of highest importance.\\" A community of Christians, for the Anabaptists, involved living the life of the persecuted and crucified Christ. Not only did Christ command nachfolge in terms of martyrdom, but the evangelical message of Matthew 28 was equally important.Littell claims that no texts appear more frequently in Anabaptist confessions of faith and court testimony than those containing the command to evangelize all people. This understanding of the Great Commission stands in stark contrast to that of Rome, and even the reformers. The \\"radical reformers\\" believed the command should be taken literally and applies to all Christians, regardless of earthly vocation.The reformers, on the other hand, believed the apostolic age exhausted the command to evangelize. The \\"wandering\\" of the Anabaptists annoyed Luther who wanted to maintain the order of appointed ministers. This orderly view is in keeping with Luther's aging concern for order and stability. For him, the Anabaptist practice of leaving family and job to proclaim the gospel was a harmful and illegitimate understanding of scripture.Not only did the Anabaptists restore the missionary zeal of the early church, but they did so by holding to a core eschatological belief. Eschatalogical belief, as Littell points out, is a common ground for revolutionaries and nonresistants. In the Anabaptist mind, making disciples and gathering the dispersed faithful were inextricably linked to God's ultimate restitution of the True Church. Littell asserts that the distinguishing mark of the Anabaptist movement is its view of itself as the True Church.Littell concludes by tracing the history of Anabaptist scholarship. He is convinced that 400 years of scholarly work has misunderstood the Anabaptists. Absolute dependence upon the views of the Reformers, as read in their hostile polemical writings, is to blame for this faulty understanding of the radical reformation. Accordingly, the discovery and release of vital extant Anabaptist primary sources should lead to a belated reworking of Anabaptism's essence.In conclusion, two words of caution must be added. First, little treatment is given to the role of social-class in Anabaptist life. Which segments of society were attracted to the movement? What role did one's social setting play in the \\"radical\\" understanding of the early church? Littell clearly states that most of the educated leaders were killed in the early years; does this vacuum of educated leadership suggest that subsequent \\"converts\\" were not educated, or that the educated avoided Anabaptism? Perhaps future studies will shed light on these important sociological questions.Second, Catholic reaction to Anabaptism is strikingly absent. There are numerous references to the Anabaptist correspondence with the reformers, but where is Rome? Did the Anabaptist polemical agenda depend upon the audience? It is assumed that the radicals were persecuted from both ends, but only the reformers receive attention. How did the responses compare and contrast with those of the reformers? Since Anabaptism was neither Catholic nor Reformed, but was instead a group of distinct groups, it necessarily follows that Roman Catholocism must have played a vital role in Anabaptism's self-awareness.Critiques aside, The Anabaptist View of the Church is a well-written and immaculately researched scholarly work, to which the sixty-one pages (for only 161 pages of text) of notes and bibliography testify. Any serious student of Christian history should read and reflect on this re-assessment of Anabaptism. Littell has revolutionized Anabaptist scholarship, and his call, ironically, is ad fontes!"},{"Title":"Guerilla days in Ireland;: A first-hand account of the Black and Tan war (1919-1921)","review":"Matter of factly written, sometimes brutal, first hand account by one of the most successful field commanders during the troubles."},{"Title":"Graceland's Table: Recipes and Meal Memories Fit for the King of Rock and Roll","review":"Love it!!

The only problem we had was him pulling off two of the flaps, but I easily glued them back on and it looks good as new. Most babies are rough with books!!! He will crawl over to it and choose it over 10 others. It has a cute rhyming text that is question and answer type (not too long for a baby's attention span). Example- 'Who's in this flower warm and snug?' (pull down flower-shaped flap for answer) 'Peekaboo' 'It's lady bug!' All of the flaps are shaped to blend in with the background. The pages are pretty sturdy--not actual board book pages, but stiff glossy paper. The cover is hardcover and durable. Highly recommended! You will not be disappointed. Lamaze books are very high quality!"},{"Title":"Peekaboo Park: A Lift-The-Flap Book","review":"Recommended by my daughter. The children love lift-the flap books.

Unfortunately, the Author who has a PH.D in religious studies from NYU doesn't seem to have even the most basic grasp of what \\"higher critical\\" means.He starts off in the introduction by making emotional hijack statements like, \\"the deadly influence of liberal seminaries\\" and \\"since the rise of liberalism\\" and \\"liberal denominations\\" saying that most seminaries are filled with unbelieving professors who are \\"shaking the faith of christians.\\" He continues by stating that \\"the facts are on the conservative side\\" and \\"the immutable facts pointing to Christ's resurrection as seen in the Shroud of Turin\\"....umm hello, the shroud of turin is a fraud which dates to 1300 AD. Definitely not his best foot to put forward out of the starting gate. And of course, there are no sightings or references offered to support the information or the claim.The first chapter, titled \\"The Cornerstone of the Christian faith\\", The author again makes the claim that no event in history has as much supporting evidence as the resurrection of christ which he claims historians have called \\"the best-attested event in antiquity\\", but again he offers no references, no names, no supporting evidence for the claim which he has subtitled \\"the relevant evidence\\".The next section is subtitled, \\"seven pieces of evidence\\" which are 1) christianity is the largest organization on earth 2)the empty tomb 3)the broken seal 4)roman guards at the tomb 5) the tomb stone 6) Jesus' post-resurrection appearances and 7) the character of Christ himself.Seven claims for which he offers no sights, references, sources or footnotes other than 3 unrelated bible verses.The rest of the book is the same, poorly written, completely lacking in references, sources, etc. The writer is at times jokingly rude and has a mocking, smug attitude towards people asking questions or anyone having the balls to question such a significant event.From cover to cover, this book is simply a waste of time and money."},{"Title":"Wine label language","review":"This is a great little book to have in your collection whether you are an avid wine enthusiast or you only enjoy an occasional glass.

If you want to know about Belgian brewing on the wild side, there is no better place to be educated than this text.His perspective is definitely that of a brewer, but also of wild fermentation fanatic and scholar. Technical and advanced information is available, but is kept to a minimum.I was very interested in this style of brewing, and gobbled it all up."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"Absolute neccessity for the homebrewer looking to try their hand brewing tradtional Belgian-style beers. A wonderful book for anyone that simply appreciates Belgian-style beers."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"This book is so fascinating, I really found it to be quite a page turner. That said, Sparrow does get a bit technical and for someone who is not a brewer, it might not be very useful and even a bit confusing. Nonetheless, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in brewing, from amateurs to commercial brewers."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"I can't believe the amount of information in this book. It is so incredibly detailed, I can't believe that it didn't take a lifetime to accumulate this. this is a must have, not must read, for any brewer, home or pro, that is at all interested in beer with wild yeast. I got a little bored with the listing of breweries and what they do, etc. I can absolutely see how this would round out, what would otherwise be a reference or text book. I was simply looking for practical and well founded knowledge about brett, lacto, pedio, etc. THIS IS IT, take my word for it. I was simply blown away at several points during this read. As an example the author suggests that you could add brett, pedio and other cultured yeasts on a schedule that was based on their life cycles found in a spontaneously fermented lambic. Fantastic idea. I can't wait to try this. This book is packed full of useful, practical info on wild yeast.This book has made me crave more info on the subject (although I don't at all expect anything to surpass or even rival the info in this book), and guess what, there isn't anything, not currently in print anyway. this is your book on wild yeast, accept no subsitutes."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"This book was loaded with good historical pieces that I doubt could be found elsewhere. It is not a casual book however, only for those with a deep interest in Belgian brewing. The text tends to wind around a bit, but is well worth following."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"I've never been in a Belbium brewery, but from what I hear, the health department in any city/state in the US would immediately shut them down. The very title of this book 'WildBrews' explains why. The traditional lambic beers of Belgium are produced using wild yeast. While you can find wild yeast everywhere, the ones you get here in the US produce truly bad beers. Each batch you produce will be different, sometimes totally different, but in my experience always bad.The yeast that seem to abound in Belgium produce beers with a consistency that has lasted for generations. I don't know if it is true, but I have always suspected that clumps of yeast would gather together rather like cob webs or dust balls around the brewery and fall or be blown into the mix. I was rather surprised at the appearance of the breweries in this book as they seemed clean and sanitary.Lambics have not been among the most popular beers made in this country. Only a few micro breweries produce lambics, the most popular around here is New Belgium from Ft. Collins, CO.You can, of course make your own Lambics, the recipies start on page 255 of this book. But you don't do it with the natural yeast floating around the air in your garden. You buy Lambic yeast from a couple of companies.One scary thought. Beer was invented some 5,000 years ago. Probably some grain got wet, sprouted, dried out, got wet again and some yeast got into the mix. Boy that must have been bad stuff. At that time it was all wild yeast. Personally I'm glad that we've had 5,000 years of yeast development.This is an enjoyable book, almost a travelogue through Belgium beers."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"Wild Brews covers those beer styles of Belgium that depend upon fermentation by wild yeast and bacteria, specifically East Flanders brown, West Flanders red and lambic. Although you may be under the impression, as I was, that a lambic brew could occur only in the Brussels and Payottenland areas and inside cobweb infested barns with leaky roofs, Sparrow contends that wild yeast can occur anywhere. It is the cultivation and control of the right microorganisms that create a quality brew.The book looks at the history, brewers and brews of the area and includes many photographs, but of particular interest to advanced brewers are the sections on the nature of Brettanomyces, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Saccharomyces and other microorganisms that ferment and acidify wild beers. Temperatures and other environmental factors can enhance or inhibit their activity.An infusion mash is commonly used for Flanders red and Flanders brown and a turbid mash for lambic. The methods are detailed in the book, plus specifics on how to control the fermentation process to balance the yeasts and bacteria by allowing dominant stages and adjusting temperatures. The addition of fruit would amplify the complication. This is not a book for a beginning home brewer.Brewers will find it nearly impossible to copy a style because of the unpredictability of wild yeasts and bacteria. Two brewers using the same recipe are likely to come up with brews quite different. Wild brews are often blended to change the character of a beer or achieve consistency. Blending is an art that requires trial and error to learn.Sparrow provides ten recipes, including options to experiment with the brews at different stages. The recipes and information in this book provide a wonderful challenge to create a unique brew while aspiring to the standards set by the Belgium brewers."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"As the title suggests, this book deals with the history and manufacturing techniques related to sponteneously fermented beers (lambic, gueze). It shows a very different perspective on what is \\"beer\\" from that of modern America where Budweiser dominates. Similar to \\"Farmhouse Ales\\", this book explores how culture and geography combined in the creation of these beers. It also deals with how modern attitudes are challenging the continuation of some of the methods. It seems odd that after 500 years someone would decide that a production method is \\"unsanitary\\".This raises a great point. If the reader is like me, much of the methodology described in this book will seem like an unclean heresy compared to the dogma that new homebrewers are indoctrinated with. Which, to me, makes it fascinating. For the majority of American homebrewers this book will open a whole new world.The book does a good job of describing the history, culture, biology, and methods that create \\"wild brews\\". Equipment and techniques are thoroughly described. In fact, this book inspired me to give barrel aging a try. It worked! At times the text does seem to wander and bog down (the reason for four stars instead of five). The author also falls into the \\"malt-extract beers are not as good as all grain\\" mantra. I see this a an annoying elitist attitude with little basis in fact. As Tess and Mark Szamatulski point out: \\"Award winning beers have been, and continue to be brewed with malt extract.\\" Let each brewer choose the method that best suits them.To sum up: The good points of this book far out weigh its negatives. This book provides a fascinating and inspiring look into a world of beer that barely exists for most North Americans. If you are a homebrewer who enjoys experimenting it will provide you with many avenues of exploration and hours of enjoyment."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"Amazingly easily to read I assumed this was going to be a technical manual on how to brew sour beers.

Thanks,Andy in Western Australia"},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"I've noticed that most beer books on Amazon have almost all 5 star reviews. This makes sense in some ways, since everyone loves beer and there aren't many brewing books - so we really appreciate the people that take the time to write these books!But I do think that some beer books can be better than others, and don't always deserve an automatic 5 stars. This one was a disappointment for me.It's a very dry read - it's a struggle to get through cover to cover. You'd think beer would be an easy topic to make for exciting and animated literature, but the author in this case has a very dry, biographical writing style. When I compare this book to The Brewmaster's Table with Garrett Oliver's animated writing style and constant humor, it's like night and day. And it's not only that book - compared to Brew Like a Monk, this is a very difficult book to get through.I realize wild brews are a difficult topic, but that doesn't mean that useful information cannot be delivered in an expedient fashion - I learned more of value from the Brewing Network's three radio podcasts on lambics + Flanders ales than I did from this book.The first half of the book contains very detailed histories of various traditional Belgian breweries and their wild ale processes. These are useful if you want to study up on specific beers I suppose, but not very useful if you want to learn general techniques with wild ales - the author even says himself that it's somewhat pointless to try to clone classic Belgian wild ales because there's so much random variation.Also, it really could have used a good editor to give it better organizational structure. It just jumps around all over the place constantly.That being said, the book is still useful as a reference - it contains some useful charts and tables - and anyone who is really serious and dedicated to getting into wild ales should get it. However keep in mind even some of the data is somewhat dated at this point - he discourages use of plastic fermenters because Better Bottles didn't exist when he published - yet I know many people who successfully use Better Bottles for wild ales."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"I hadn't brewed at all when I purchased this book, but I was very curious, with all the hoopla about sanitation and temperature control, how humans managed to brew anything for the last thousands of years without bleach and refrigeration and you name it. This book doesn't necessarily answer all of that, but it is incredibly informative about Belgium lambics and Flanders beers. This is a 'how it's done' book not a story-telling travel through the region tasting beers with colorful characters, nonetheless I found it fascinating! A little repetitive in places which didn't bother me since I knew so little about these beers and the means of creating them. And since the author appears to hail from the U.S. of A. he is familiar with and writes about commercial lambics on this side of the pond. I loved the section on barrels. And for those of us who want to give a lambic or a Flanders beer a go, there are a few recipes included. A nice, chunky bibliography is in the back."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"Wild beers are the most unusual and elusive of all styles. They're difficult to brew and even difficult to buy. Their whole world is shrouded in mysteries of microorganisms and organic chemistry. Wild Brews spells it all out in an understandable way. It's easily the best source I've found on wild beers.For brewers, such as myself, who don't care for wild beer, it's still enlightening. Wild Brews catalogs all sorts of microbes which may find their way into our brews and how to increase or reduce their impacts. It's also interesting to see the same critters floating in beer that make vinegar, cheese, and several other products."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"This is one of a series of books about Belgian beer that takes a look at style that seems to have survived from the past. Wild brews is a discussion of beers that are fermented with wild yeasts and with (gasp!) bacteria.Most beer lovers have had an encounter with these beers: they are shocking, original and-to our tastes-most unbeerlike. They tend to be either distinctly sour or sweet and sour. Their effect in the mouth is thirst-quenching in the manner of a tart lemonade and they are often surprisingly aromatic.Jeff Sparrow has provided an introduction to the history and brewing techniques of these beers that seems to grow out of a deep knowledge of the biochemistry involved and a major involvement in the Belgian brewing community. As a beer-lover, I find this book to be a revelation and it has led me back to some beers that I haven't tasted in years.As a brewer, it scares the daylights out of me. Letting organisms like pediococcus and brettanomyces loose in your brewhouse or kitchen is risky. Outcomes with these organisms are always uncertain and aging can involve super-attenuation and unusual mouth-feel.However.The wild beer tradition is one of blending, and I can't help but think that a growler of my farmhouse ale could stand to be cut with a bottle of, let's say a lambic. Hmmm.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANGBang Bang"},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"great book, and picks up where lambic left off. lamic is dated, and now you can buy mixed cultures, and therefore alot of its info is perhaps not useful. wild brews really takes it from there though. great discussions about how all beers were once wild and about how its the aging in wood that innoculates them. perhaps more attention on how to produce lambic at home would be useful to the small brewer, and perhaps some alternatives, like wort and mash souring (so as to get wild character without contaminating your equiptment) would be nice. very good though and worth buying if you brew these."},{"Title":"Wild Brews: Culture and Craftsmanship in the Belgian Tradition","review":"This is a great book for those interested in brewing out of the ordinary beers.

As a companion piece to the Secrets of the Talking Jaguar, which is equally profound, this book leads us away from the Shamanistic and into the everyday life of these beautiful people. The book is full of the wisdom of the past regarding such things as marriage, teenage years, birth and death. My emotions and memories of the indiginous peoples of this land are brought vividly to mind in this book. I have lived and worked for many years with Pueblo people and am struck by the many similarities of belief and ritual.Prechtel is a fantastic writer who keeps one wanting more!"},{"Title":"Long Life, Honey in the Heart","review":"This being third in the sequence of Martin Prechtel's books that I'd read this year, completion of the triptych brought my understanding to critical mass/tears in view of how much has been lost in Guatemala's entry to the 21st century. However, these writings make it highly probable that the loss is not complete, or unmourned. His books embody the very processes he tells of; for example, his mention of customs which are made to be broken: people's learning the significance of who breaks them, how, and when they are broken or allowed to be broken strengthens the culture.* His own experience of out of sequence initiation illustrates this, but beyond that, the fluidity with which he passes between poetic and humorous storytelling and epilogues in a more philosophical tone invites inner dialogue in the reader. He is well aware of the modern consumer mentality as a ghost layer mimicing an underlying spiritual void, when he taunts the readers at the outset that many will voraciously consume his books and move on, without fulfilment. *This realization is the most important one passed from mentor to initiate in any culture. My mentor at the same period (the 1970's)was a halfway-house worker who realized and taught others that we were not there to enforce a culture on the mentally ill, but rather light-heartedly yet seriously to help them draw the line as to what they could expect to get away with and more importantly, not get away with, in this life, and to plan accordingly. Indigenous music and language being preserved and used in their celebratory (if no longer ritual) uses may be all we have left to work/play with. Prechtel does well to begin his story with his introduction to Mayan music. The depths have not yet been plumbed as far as the role music plays in initiation, since the printed word is not the right medium to convey this. It struck me as wonderful that a Peruvian flute band were playing their hearts out last weekend in Portland, Maine, at the last visit of the Tall Ships- a proper &quot;send-off&quot; to the ghosts of Conquistador navies by a very much alive pre-columbian musical band."},{"Title":"Long Life, Honey in the Heart","review":"Modern society has us born and abandonded. It does not take any interest in us unless we make lots of money or achieve some kind of fame. We have little purpose in it except to make money for others and that is pretty much the extent of it: nothing else is demanded of us.Martin Prechtel's book describes a society where giving is more important than receiving, working together for a common cause of spiritual value rather than material value, opposed on both sides by the materialist communists and capitalists, neither of whom can see any value in their old ways of initiation.Yet the initition creates a person of far greater value than those who sought to destroy it. Whether or not the reader can share the beliefs of the Tzutujil Maya, and for a modern reader it is of course difficult, the result of this system of society is the creation of real human beings, lives not devoid of meaning and afloat on a sea of worthlessness, but deeply intertwined with the living processes of the world, each one feeling that they contribute to the story of life, that they have value and love.The difficult and dangerous passage of initiation that the adolescents of the village undergo to bring the goddess back to life gives them an inner power and wisdom that stays with them for the rest of their lives, meaning that they don't become disruptive, lost and alienated from the world but an integral part.It is a shame to me that our modern societies, whatever their political system, cannot operate more in this way. Not to live exactly like they used to - before the modern societies imposed themselves - but to realise what they achieved and how it can benefit our cast-adrift generations.I have given this book five stars because it offers a way out of the ever-tightening spiral of anguish that drives even the pleasures of modern life and it does so without preaching or spite. There are humourous passages throughout as well as more serious tracts. It is about the joy and beauty of life."},{"Title":"Long Life, Honey in the Heart","review":"Martin's words are a blueprint for healing our spiritual wounds and our separation from the natural world around us.As a mentor, I found the information on initiation and the levels of hierarchy within his village to be invaluable. His dedication to the Mayan traditions and the people who have carried that wisdom down through the ages is exemplary. Thank you Martin for the strength and courage to bring that message forth during these very troubled times!"},{"Title":"Long Life, Honey in the Heart","review":"We saw Martin speak in Ashland, Oregon, and bought his books. they are nectar foods for the soul. nothing else like his writing, he will transport you with language to a place in your brain beyond language. Savory, delicious, honest, wildly reverent. but it and read it. then quit your job."},{"Title":"Long Life, Honey in the Heart","review":"Prechtel's retelling of his life as a part of a society based on ancient tribal traditions. It gives a rare glimpse of mankind caring for its own. A tale of a culture striving for health and balance between neighbors, generations, mankind and nature. It is a beautiful tale of human beauty dashed by the motion of time in the hands of modern man. As sad as it is to see the outcome I find these people living within me as a reminder of what society can accomplish when it is rooted in respect, dignity and love."},{"Title":"Long Life, Honey in the Heart","review":"Prechtel's prose is beautiful but this is difficult to get your teeth into. If you can persist with it, then it is rewarding as it travels the gamut of shamanic experience, and is wildly entertaining at times. However, there are drawbacks. It is very long, and the pace sometimes tedious. It's a pity this wasn't edited better. Overall, a good introduction to shamanism. I would recommend starting with Patrice Some instead."},{"Title":"Long Life, Honey in the Heart","review":"This is the third book I've read by Martin Prechtel. I wish there were 5 more to read.

I had never played guitar before, but she thought I should. It was such a nice gift that I couldn't just put it in the closet or send it off to the pawn shop. So, I skimmed the first couple chapters on the history of the guitar. And I really read the next couple chapters to learn about how you read the music. Then it was on! I've been playing ever since. I would not be a guitarist right now, if it weren't for this book.It is much more comprehensive than how I used it. The book continues with different scales (pentatonic, blues, jazz, etc) as well as how to set up different amp, head, pedal combinations. It finishes with studio stuff. When it says \\"Complete\\", it is. And it's very easy to read and understand with great pictures and diagrams. For anyone who has ever asked me how to learn guitar, I recommend this book to them."},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"I am an intermediate player with 15 years of experience. I agree with many others that this book looks great when you pick it up and thumb through it. However, it is very frustrating. It says practice this scale/mode/pattern over and over but doesn't give you the next step. It is written for someone who already knows these things and merely wants to brush up on technique. I have a pile of guitar books a foot high and this is still the best.....I guess :("},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"A great reference, better than the Guitar Player's Handbook, but contains similar information. A lot of useful information.One gripe would be that some of the theory later in the book shifts to standard musical notation, straying away from tablature. Since I use tab and much of the other content includes tab, this was a bit disappointing. However, this did not shift my overall enjoyment of the book.If you are looking for a great reference on scales, modes and modal relationships, this is worth a read. (There is more content than scales and modes, but those are what my prime interests in this particular book were)"},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"This is the worst guitar book I've ever seen. It looks great, because it's full of pictures. However, it's more of a consice encyclopedia than a tutorial. It presents concepts in the most confusing way ever! After studying guitar music theory for two years, I still can't stand to read this book, including the topics that I know well. If you want to learn a good way to think about music theory for guitar, especially if you are a beginner, I suggest you get something else. I suggest books by Wilbur Savidge and Fretboard logic series."},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"I never got to read the original Complete Guitarist, which was out of print when I got around to buying this book, but let me say this book is very good. The original, from what I have heard, was more richly illustrated than this book is, but The New Complete Guitarist still keeps the meat and bones of the original. It starts from a complete beginners standpoint (how to hold the guitar), through to advanced scale and chord structures, all the way to how to maintain your guitar. I have had other books on guitar playing, but this one cuts straight to the nitty-gritty. It's basic chords are indispensable for a beginner and the sprinkling of music theory really lets you understand the chords you are playing, instead of tedious memorization. I would recommend this book to anybody who owns a guitar and would like to push themselves further. This book will grow with you."},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"The presentation of this book is phenomenal which is why I bought it. I glanced through it and found its presentation, photos and text to be appealing. However, once you actually start to read the thing, it's extremely difficult to follow from chapter to chapter. They try to cram too much info into each page which makes it counter-productive to the learning process. I have benefited much more from the Fretboard Logic series and even those Hal-Leonard introductory books. I only recommend this book to those with an intermediate level of knowledge about the guitar and to those that won't get frustrated spending several days/weeks on just a few pages of this book."},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"I've been playing guitar for about fifteen years now, and just recently decided it might be a good thing to get a book that could help me fill in the spaces of technique and theory that had undoubtedly accumulated in my playing since I began.I chose this book among all of the beginner/intermediate how-to's at the bookstore because it looked like it would be comprehensive and also easy and fun to use. On a once-over at the music section, the text seemed clear and easy to follow and the book was filled with helpful illustrations and sidebars.I bought the book and took it home and at first was very happy with it, but the further I read, the more disenchanted I became.The main problem I had with this book is that it doesn't build on its own concepts at a sensible rate. The authors frequently make frustrating leaps, introducing a concept in one chapter and then over-immersing the reader in it in the next.This book was almost helpful in many ways, but ultimately more frustrating than it was worth. I think it could be improved, however, and made into a more useful guide, if the authors were to streamline the presentation of information and not using advanced concepts when the reader has not been adequately prepared for them."},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"The New Complete Guitarist is a classic. There is tons of information here, much of which leans on music theory. The book covers lots of guitar styles (not much on classical, however) and techniques and goes from simple open chords to sophisticated chord voicings, progressions and soloing. The book is written in the style of most other DK books which is a very aesthetically pleasing \\"visual\\" approach consisting of many colorful photographs and charts with small descriptive blurbs nearby.Some readers have complained that the book uses terminology that is not explained until later in the book. This is sometimes true, although it is fairly easy to locate the explanation elsewhere. The book should be considered more of a reference book (or something between a reference book and an instruction book). I would probably not use the book as my sole source of instruction, however, because some topics need to be elaborated on more thoroughly and this book avoids verbosity. None-the-less, if you only purchased one guitar book or needed a supplemental guitar book, this would do you extremely well.Readers should also checkout the classic \\"The Guitar Handbook\\", by Ralph Denyer as an alternative or an addition to The New Complete Guitarist\\". Although similar, The Guitar Handbook provides a different, but welcome perspective to similar topics."},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"This is a very good book for an experienced guitar player. It is too concise for a beginner in my opinion.

I've taken guitar lessons for 3-1/2 years and have bought several books about guitar playing and guitars in general. This is by far the best book that I have found.

It also gives some good riffs for various styles which gives the player an opportunity to experiment with styles they might otherwise never try."},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"This book covers everything a beginner needs to know. I'm new to guitar, and this book goes into detail about how to play. The illustrations make it fun and are helpful. Late in the book, it teaches you different modes.

This should be a must have for beginners and an exellent reference for everyone else."},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"I just started playing guitar, had never even picked one up before so I wanted to find the best intro. I bought several other books, magazines, etc., and out of all of them this is the best. It explains what every symbol in the sheet music means, it explains briefly the theory of what makes a guitar sound the way it does, history of guitar music, techniques for plucking, strumming, etc., and it is VERY visual. It goes through timing, scales, and of course chords. It shows you where you should be every step of the way, which is important when trying to teach yourself. I don't think there is any substitute for hands on teaching with a professional, but this comes close. Highly reccomended and you can't go wrong for the price"},{"Title":"The New Complete Guitarist","review":"I was at the library to pick up a guitar book I had requested and I just took a look around the library randomly and spotted this book so I got it too. I had low expectations of it because it looked like some superficial \\"how to play by reading a book instead of playing\\" kind of thing. But I was wrong. This is an excellent and sophisticated book. It is not just nice to look at, it is immaculately crafted visually for the purpose of helping you visualize difficult music theory concepts as they relate to the guitar.The beginning and end sections of the book are basically a nice but thorough pictorial history of guitars and electronics respectively. I appreciated this thorough introduction to these topics since I now feel I know most of what is commonly known about guitar gear. I was really personally blown away to see a Telecaster in parts prior to assembly; I have a Telecaster kit in pieces! Kind of a weird coincidence but all good stuff.Then on to the hard topics that fill the middle of this book. I've read a lot of music theory books and guitar books and this is far and away the best combination of the two. The author has clearly mastered all of the technicalities of music theory and, typically, he can't contain his enthusiasm for jazz. This worried me since I don't care for jazz, but he was able to treat all genres fairly and in a way designed to help someone who wanted to understand their technical points.The real valuable part of this book for me is in the comprehensive music theory discussions. He dissects scales, modes, chord construction, progressions, tunings in a way that leaves out only the most esoteric exotica. His treatment of these topics are as clear and confident as those found in pure music theory books but he understands that his readers are motivated not by an abstract love of music theory but rather a desire to play a guitar better.I got it at the library on a whim, but after studying it for a month now, I'm going to buy my own copy. As a text book for someone learning to play guitar, this is an excellent choice. As a reference it is rivals the depth of knowledge available on the internet and far surpasses it in organization and presentation."},{"Title":"American Dream Car in Cuba: Vintage Cars on the Road","review":"I visited Cuba last year and was amazed at all the wonderful American cars, so I really wanted to enjoy this book when I bought it. It has a few great photos, such as the cover photo, but mostly the photos are pretty dull and repetitive and don't really say anything about Cuba. The text, mostly by a Cuban writer, is boring waffle with very few facts and historical data. Where are the interesting anecdotes about Ernest Hemingway, or even Fidel Castro and other famous characters and their cars? The wonderful little pocket-size book on Cuban cars by Cristina Garcia is much more interesting.

The brain also begins to diverisfy the way it groups them.Eventually however, the brain finds it much more effecient to shuffle them all together into one cohesive, functional &#34;deck&#34; - the ego.Every heard the expression, &#34;He's not playing with a full deck.&#34;Turns out that ain't so far off. If the diversification and shuffling process gets interrupted, delayed, or derailed, personality pathologies result.That's it....Kernberg just keeps repeating that for 300+ pages or long, convoluted, jargon laden sentences that require either a scalpel or a butcher knife to disect. I don't know if it's just a pretentious thing, or if people in his field are taught to write that way, but it was very off-putting.Now take the $37.04 I just saved you and go for pizza and a movie."},{"Title":"Tuolumne Meadows (Wilderness Press 15-Minute Topographic Maps)","review":"The small format High Sierra Hiking Guide Series is clearly an on-the-trail refresher series. For day hikers and 'packers alike one of these and the appropriate 7.5 topos will get you there and back. Most of the lyricism we expect from a Wilderness Press guide is present, though in an abreviated form due to size constraints: for the full treatment and as a home reference volume for picking potential trips (or reliving past ones) Sierra North, Sierra South and Yosemite National Park - A Natural History Guide to Yosemite and Its Trails are the way to go.These are full decription tomes where you can smell the duff and here the crunch of the granite under your boots. Imagine my horror when I got back east and found their idea of a trail guide was more a mileage marker list, I guess the complexity of the trails is an issue but I've worn my second edition Sierra South to tatters from all the rereading and my East Coast guides (White Mountains, Vermont High Trail etc.) get read to keep me from getting lost and quickly reshelved as they have no feeling.

My impression is that the author is speaking to someone who already knows the trails and the area well. It may be better than nothing, but it could have been much more.In fact, I have been unable to find a Yosemite backpacking guide that wasn't a disappointment. There must be one somewhere. I am spoiled on excellent guides such as Hiking New Mexico (I don't recall the author), and particularly the Arkansas guides by Tim Ernst. All backpacking guides should be as thorough and thoughtful."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"I am a big Spenser fan but not all Spenser books are good. In several of Parker's books I have the feeling he is writing to satisfy a contract requirement for so many books in a limited time, some I think fall into that category by are so well written that I ignore it. But \\"Stardust\\" was so poorly written I had to force myself to read it and I often put it down to do something else. Also, in reading it, I felt that Parker did not like Hollywood and he took this dislike out on Jill Joyce, a TV star with hard ties to the movie industry. As I read the book I never developed any empathy for Jill, I disliked her when we were introduced and this dislike grew with the book. Forget the ending, this feeling flip-flopped but not due to Spenser or Parker, it is the climate of the times. I felt all along as I read the book there was something behind Jill and her character but I never tumbled to it, I was just reading and accepting people as Spenser gave them to me. I did not know who the killer was until it was revealed in the book and then I never felt too convinced, I thought it was contrived and non-realistic. Still, since I did not foresee the conclusion, the book did have some value and I gave it the three stars."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"I like Robert Parker's Spenser novels, and have read almost all of them. The early ones are quite good, but the ones after 1990 or so are pretty much a mixed bag.STARDUST is pretty much a by-the-numbers effort, about Spenser's attempts to bodyguard an incredibly famous TV actress, who just happens to be the most neurotic, promiscuous woman on the planet. This book is mildly funny and entertaining, but not particularly original or exciting. It doesn't help that the TV actress character isn't the least bit sympathetic. The dialogues between Spenser-Susan and Spenser-Hawk are pretty much the same old stuff Parker has written many times before.There's little in this novel you won't find in other, better Spenser books. My advice is to try those books and forget about STARDUST."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"I usually enjoy the Spenser books, but \\"Stardust\\" was really disappointing. I didn't like the Jill character at all, so it was impossible for me to care about her and/or what happened to her. Too bad Spenser didn't walk away from this case at the get-go.Also, is anybody else sick of Susan's perfection? And the way she eats - or doesn't eat, I guess would be more correct - makes me cringe.I'll go on to the next Spenser and hope it's better than this one, and also hope that Spenser and Susan don't go to any restaurants."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"Robert Parker's Stardust is a good book, but Burt Reynolds never becomes Spencer, he simply stays Burt Reynolds reading a book.

I tripped over this in the library needing an easy read. What amazes me is that this was apparently a popular series in the 80's. So much for the 80's. Spenser and Susan are so superior to the rest of the human race we should all be ashamed. They are witty, they are sensitive, they are honest, they are loving, they are perfect. As a natural offshoot of this they are tiresome, they are snide, they are racist, they are class-driven in their outlook and tastes. They are, frankly, very creepy.

I don't get it. This was one of the most shallow and boring books I have every read. If it wasn't for the fact I was bored and had nothing else to read because my husband was watching football I would never have finished it. In fact it didn't - I skipped to the last 20 pages just to get it over with. The characters are boring, the plot was straight from so-so has been TV show, descriptions of Boston and surrounding areas not needed and actually took up half the writing.Why do readers like these books, I will never pick up or waste my time again - but I guess I am happy to have finally stopped wondering what it would be like to read one.

Once I finished I immeadiatly ordered the next Parker novel."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"For starters, in spite of the one-star rating and negative review, I am a big Spenser fan. I've read the first 17 Spenser novels -- in order.The late Robert B. Parker created an awesome, unique character with Spenser, a self-educated and intelligent P.I. who just happens to be a former boxer and ex-Boston cop -- with a rebellious yet noble side.Parker's biggest strength in all the Spenser novels (through this book) is the dynamic Parker established between Spenser and his girlfriend, Susan Silverman, and his best friend Hawk, who's a street tough. The interplay rings true in their dialogue and characterization.But the dialogue and characterization of Hollywood starlet Jill Jones, et. al, is exactly what makes this a singularly weak story. Jones doesn't come off as a three-dimensional character. To call her character paper-thin would be a compliment. It's a flimsy plot-line at best, as Parker's portrayal of those in the movie business borders on satire.The book is full of Spenser's one-liners, several of which, as usual, are quite funny. But, 17 novels into the series, I finally have to admit that I won't be able to stand reading them all. And what few more I'll read will be spaced quite far apart. And that I'll even read that many more -- in addition to the 17 I've read -- should say a lot about what kind of fan I am and how good the series has been. But I guess nothing lasts forever and cliches become cliches for a reason.If you are considering making this your first Spenser novel -- don't. Go back and buy \\"The Godwulf Manuscript.\\" Then read them in order. Spenser should grow on you and you should enjoy many of his novels. They really are meant to be read in order (as there are many allusions made to past characters and events) and are quite enjoyable.I just wish I could say the same for this one."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"One of the amazing things about Parker is his ability to create a great story then ruin it was a petty, mean-spirited characterization. I understand Spenser has a problem with women because he is soooo very in love with self-centered Susan; this has caused him to think she is perfect and all other women suffer in comparison (why does this seem unreal). But, and this is a big but, Parker needs to stop portraying the damsels in distress as being so trashy and unworthy of being saved. Really. Between his strange attraction to perfect Susan and his attraction and admiration of the perfect Hawk, I'm getting the impression that Spenser is in the closet. Would explain alot."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"What might burn to what purification and perfection, within the ashes of impoverished beginnings ...Again, a Spenser novel kept my focus away from the snow-packed, icy curves of a Rocky Mountain corridor over the Continental Divide on Colorado State highway 50, edging the high, steep cliffs over Monarch Pass. If any feat would recommend the ability of a novel to hold a reader captive, that should.The fascination in this # 17 in the series seemed to pivot around a flickering disgust Vs appeal of the Star of the plot, Jill Joyce, as those dark/bright flashes played through Jill's evolving relationships with Spenser, Susan, and residual characters, who mostly viewed \\"Jillie\\" as a \\"high-octane pain in the ...\\" (quoting one the book's descriptive terms of her). Parker worked an amazing double-sided realism into the plot, contrasting Jill's spoiled, impatient, sour personality; to her youthful vulnerabilities, her having not one true friend, and her carrying the weight of the job title's specific and actual demands. With drunk, druggie, an nympho added to the liabilities in this Star's aura, the scales slipped south, and provided Spenser with a challenge he couldn't refuse. I may have left out a couple descriptive terms of the down side of Jill Joyce's personality, but guessing what they might be would be a snap.STARDUST is a classic character study, and an excellent example of fine writing, especially given Parker's vivid, delightfully sardonic descriptions of various settings, descriptions based on weather conditions and wealth divergence, contrasting Boston and surrounding areas with the San Diego and LA extended environments.During the writing of my previous review on PLAYMATES, # 16 in this series, I began noticing an edge of embarrassment about my ongoing compulsion to write reviews on each novel in the Spenser series. Therefore, I seem to be pushed at the moment by a nag from my Left Brain to explain personal and professional motivations in feeding the continued pursuit of this \\"study.\\" Actually, that's precisely what my dedication to reviewing this series has become, a study. I feel blessed to be able to observe three decades (and counting) of cultural evolution through Parker's liberal notations of styles of dress, tastes in food, ways of thinking, repartee dance-steps, etc. Yet, I'm making note of much more than that.I'm observing the steady, methodical, dedicated evolution of an author's voice, talent, perspective, and ethical philosophy ... over thirty years of annual production in a sequential offering repeating characters, locale, and genre.I'm observing \\"current\\" events unfolding within Parker's plots. I'm noticing subtle publisher presence and reader preference as that backdrop appears to play into Parker's choices of subject, theme, and style variances in each novel in this chain adding links upon links of evolving ethical considerations.My interest was maintained well in STARDUST as my curiosity grew about how Spenser could save this child, who was screeching in repulsively offensive ways, for someone to take care of her, someone, anyone to care about anything in her, qualities beyond beauty, which might lie more deeply and lastingly in Jill's soul... someone to care about more than her capacity to draw in dollars. As a prostitute to overwhelming demands on her presence and physical perfection, given nothing truly refueling of self in return; Jill reminded me of Spenser's April Kyle, clearly showing that money, fame, success, and adulation are able to starve the life out of a young heart needing TLC, compassion, and a savior.As has become Parker's relished signature, several scenes of dialogue exchanges in STARDUST were highly satisfying. One of the cheer inducements I regularly enjoy in a Spenser novel is his ever-growing-repertoire of ways to burst odorous balloons of pompous buffoons who overrate their importance by metaphoric measures of mountains of compost heaps. (See Marty Riggs in this one, especially the scene in chapter 29 with Quirk, regarding Jill having been misplaced. And, for a story about mountains of coal dust and a young Mom starring in a bull-dog win, see Coal & Coca-cola)And then, we had here the entrance of Victor del Rio and gang-of-two, Chollo and Bobby Horse. Yep, another fascinating bad, bad, bad dude ... with a couple honorable qualities, who related well with Spenser in scene after engrossing scene.My favorite scene in STARDUST, though, was the one noted above, with Riggs, Quirk, a collection of big wigs at Zenith, and Spenser. Quirk gives Riggs a prime-spot-comeuppance to either kill or die for. Parts of that chapter I had to read aloud to my husband. After I had read a couple paragraphs, then asked a few minutes later if he wanted to hear more, his positive pose slid immediately into an ear-toward-my-direction.The last line in this one could serve as the beginnings of purification of poverty, if not an outright activation of alchemy.What is Hope,Linda Shelnutt"},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"The man who reads this book is not Burt Reynolds. He makes Hawk sound like Tonto of Lone Ranger fame. Read the book because the tape will make you sick."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"... I thought this was one of the best Spenser novels at the time of its publication, but I do recommend reading it in sequence. Especially, read \\"A Savage Place\\" first, because the two books have a certain relation to each other.This is a bit more of a mystery than others in the series in that you don't discover the murderer's identity until the end, and this is good in adding a bit more suspense than usual.Spenser's hired to protect a very obnoxius TV star, who's addicted to drugs, alcoholic, arrogant...listed alphabetically, I'd be naming several other character defects before we get to nympho, and that's just past the middle of the alphabet!!! On top of all this, she might be making up all these threats she's supposedly receiving. However, when her double is murdered, Spenser has to take the task of protecting her more seriously. He has a hang-up about protecting women since an unpleasant happening earlier in the series.I had a suspicion around half way through as to who the murderer was...I won't tell you whether I was right or wrong. However, I believe the suspicion was deliberately & subtly planted by Parker, and if so, I admire him for the way he did it. Like I say, I'll let you find out whether this was deliberate foreshadowing for dramatic effect, or a red herring to distract you.I do recommend this highly, but if you're not already a Spenser fan, read several earlier books including \\"The Savage Place\\" first in order to better appreciate this."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"Once again it's Spenser to the rescue. This time he's called onto the set of a television show to act as bodyguard to the star, and America's sweetheart, Jill Joyce. Unfortunately, she's also a drunk, incredibly difficult to work with, and determined to bed every man within a 5-mile radius.But when Spenser's on the job it's professionalism all the way which makes for a very fiery employer / employee relationship. It also makes for some most amusing situations and gives ample opportunity for Spenser to display his flair for detective work. The relationship between Spenser and Susan is comfortable, as ever, and between Spenser and Hawk as solid as a rock.The sanctuary of a Spenser book is always a welcome haven for weary readers with the pace of the book high and the pages turning quickly. Light entertainment at it's best; if you're after mystery with a liberal dash of humour then you're in for a real treat here."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"I think this is Parker's take on the tv series Spenser For Hire. He doesn't seem to have a high opinion of Hollywood actors/actresses. The other book in this series that this one is most like is : Looking For Rachel Wallace.While I am a huge Spenser fan I wouldn't say this novel is a must-have. It is more for those who are die-hard Spenser/Parker fans. It is still a good read, but many other novels in this series is better than this one."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"Parker has written another good book. Spencer is hired to baby sit a TV star. He is to protect her and also find out who is trying to kill her. He is his usual witty self, he is helped by Hawk and Susan as always. The TV star, Jill Joyce, is not a good person, a nice way to say it. Spencer keeps digging and finally comes up with the person who has been making the threats. You will be surprised who it is. A good read, if you have liked other Spencer books you will like this one. I always enjoy Hawk, wish he had a larger role the books."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"I received this book on tape it was not in my option in good shape!

I Love Spencer books and this one does not disapoint."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"Spenser is hired by Zenith Meridian Television to protect their star television personality, Jill Joyce - who says she has been receiving harassing telephone calls and letters. When Spenser tries to find out more about these calls, Jill refuses to elaborate - insisting, however, that he protect her from \\"Him,\\" as she calls her stalker, while all the while refusing to answer any questions relating to details about the problem, her past or pretty much anything at all and at the same time alternating between trying to get Spenser into bed and drinking herself into a torpor. Finally Spenser leaves her in Hawk's care and sets out to find out what he can on his own.Jill is probably one of the least appealing people Spenser has ever set out to \\"save.\\" He, however, sets out with great patience nonetheless, to do just that. He follows every lead, steps on toes from the East to the West coast in the process, has his life threatened several times and finally gets to the bottom of the situation. It ain't pretty.Of course, you'll have to read the book to find out what happens.I enjoyed this story, mostly because the character dynamics were so interesting. Jill Joyce was so terribly unpleasant, yet at the same time she engendered great sympathy and loyalty among so many people that it was really unbelievable. As one character remarked, she had a \\"quality\\" about her, something deep inside her that got buried under the booze and drugs. Parker did a good job with his writing skills of showing that vulnerability as well as the prickly and unpleasant exterior. Very good job. Strong recommend from me."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"This Spenser novel is for me one of the hardest to decide in terms of how I felt about it once I had finished it. I have read all of the earlier Spenser novels, up to about 1999 or so, and when it came to this one, I could definitely see a turning point. Other reviewers here have talked briefly about the plot involving a spoiled, drink-happy TV star with attitude, but I am going to add more opinion to how the reader might or might not like this book once he/she has finished it. Robert B. Parker has stated that in his earlier writing days, he used to craft out a story from beginning to end before writing it, and then years later he began to just sort of take a brief idea and begin writing, not knowing where the story was going to lead until he got to writing it. I could clearly see with this book that perhaps beginning with Stardust, he began using the latter methodology. It shows to me how using this strategy can sometimes lead to a great read (Crimson Joy), or it can lead to a convoluted mess that somehow has to be tied up at the end.Stardust starts out very tight and fun. Witness Spenser's comments about television, something I am sure were comments the author had regarding TV while the Spenser:for Hire series was airing. There are some fantastic scenes in this book, as well. For example, Spenser's handling of a showing-up a martial artist's (Randall)display of his abilities, or what I consider to be Hawk's best line to Jill Joyce after she drunkenly lets him know she is looking for something in particular.-- BIG SPOILER --But, after all of that, the reader is left with an ending that requires one to believe that a poor white-trash person, managing to be able to go out of their way to travel a great distance, and afford to do it, is the killer we've been looking for. It just did not make sense to me. There are other candidates thrown at the reader along the way as possibilies, and clearly Parker had not decided who the killer was going to be until he got to the end. He could have chosen better, in my opinion.It is for these reasons I give the book 3 stars. Great read up until about the last fourth of the novel, where it seems to try to reach for a ending it did not really have to."},{"Title":"Stardust","review":"The beginning of this book is really very average Spenser, which certainly makes it enjoyable enough but not at all noteworthy. Let's see ... Susan drags Spenser into a case he doesn't really want, Spenser wisecracks and offends everyone in authority, Hawk provides trustworthy and able-bodied support ... same old, same old. The story itself isn't very compelling or interesting until the end. That's when Spenser shows us what makes him special. It's his attitude toward Jill Joyce, the care he devotes to her, and the offhanded way he delivers it (as though it's just his duty as a human being) that I found out of the ordinary and very moving."},{"Title":"The Economics of Contracts: A Primer","review":"Salanie's book covers the standard areas of contract theory; adverse selection, moral hazard, signalling etc, along with chapters on the dynamics of complete contracts, incomplete contracts and a final chapter on the empirical work on contracts. The material on dynamics and incomplete contracts is most welcome as many other books in this area do not cover it. Perhaps more space could have been given over to incomplete contracts given the increasing importance of them.The book manages to cover a large amount of material in a relatively small number of pages, it is just over 200 pages. Most of this material is presented in an accessible and readable manner and most graduate students in economics should be able to read the book.The most obvious problem with the book is the number of small errors it contains. Some of the figures have points that are in the wrong place; there are a number of what look like typos in the text, being told that an indifference curve goes through a point (q2,t2) when in fact it goes through (q1,t1) for example. While these are only minor problems they do distract from the otherwise good impression that the book makes."},{"Title":"The Economics of Contracts: A Primer","review":"...so if that's what you want, then this book is for you. However, if you're using this for your first look at contract theory, you may well be disappointed (as I am). I don't credit Salanie for leaving out the technical details of the models, because he doesn't effectively convey the depth of the models in his largely intuitive treatment. I'm all for intuition and simplicity, but his book leaves me with more questions than answers after reading it.I'm browsing around on Amazon for a better book, so I thought I'd write a quick rating so that other lowly beginners like me don't make the same mistake I made in purchasing this as my only textbook.On the other hand, I suppose if you want a concise overview with the sketch of most of the important contract theory models, then this might be what you're looking for."},{"Title":"The Economics of Contracts: A Primer","review":"This book is a great introduction, as well as a very handy reference for contracting research. It achieves what it initially focuses on achieving plus has some tools to build intuition, along with references where needed. Although might not be complete, but it certainly doesnt promise a thorough discussion of contracts. This is a must have along with Bolton and Dewatripont."},{"Title":"The Economics of Contracts: A Primer","review":"I loved that book because it explains the theory of contracts in an easy way buy with no lack of formality"},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 1: Best Of The Forties Book 1","review":"Just how did Archie meet Betty?

DEFINITELY worth buying."},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 1: Best Of The Forties Book 1","review":"There were very few comic book characters that got their start in the early part of the golden age that were able to sustain their titles all the way through to today. Superman was one, Batman, of course. But Captain America didn't, neither did The Flash or Green Lantern. But another who did was America's favorite teenager, Archie Andrews. In the years following the end of WWII, superheroes fell out of favor with comic book fans but Archie and his friends kept chugging right along, now over sixty years old!This great new collection from Archie Comics re-prints fifteen classic stories from the 1940's. With an introduction written by Stephen King, himself a long-time Archie fan, we get classic Archie tales from the earliest years. It is so interesting to see how the comic has changed, and adapted over the decades from hair and clothing styles, to music and popular culture. I couldn't help but chuckle when Tyrone Power is mentioned in one of these early stories as being one of the girl's idols, talk about your changing times! For those like me who grew up in the 60's and 70's, it is quite a treat to see how different the characters appeared in those early days. That famous Archie \\"house style\\" had not been developed yet and they had a more unique look than they do today. Among the treats that are included in this volume are:The very first Archie story from Pep Comics #22 in December 1941. Archie, Betty and Jughead are all introduced. In particular, Archie and Betty look more like 12-year olds than the teens we all know and love. Archie's jalopy, which would be the source of running jokes for years, makes its first broken-down appearance just a few issues later in Pep Comics #25, followed by Riverdale's favorite debutante Veronica in Pep #26, both in 1942.Archie's nemesis Reggie mantle makes his first full appearance in Jackpot Comics # 6 in the Summer of 1942, and already the rivalry over Veronica would begin. Veronica's dad, Mr. Lodge comes along in Pep #31.\\"Prom Pranks\\" from Archie Comics #1, 1942, relates the tale of how Veronica first met Archie and decided to go to Riverdale high. Ahhh...bet you though Ronny always went to Riverdale just like I did!\\"Double Date\\" from Archie #7 gives us the first of what would be the decisive storyline in Archie comics...the love triangle between Archie, Betty, and Veronica as Arch is caught having a date with both at the same time.In \\"Battle of the Jitterbugs\\" from Archie #30, Archie and Reggie challenge Betty and Veronica to a Jitterbug dance contest to prove that boys are better dancers. Each of the boys takes turns dressing up in drag for the big contest.\\"Dangerous Sex\\" from 1949 introduces us to \\"Moose\\" as Jughead has to reluctantly tutor Moose's girl Lottie Little for a big test.Wow! What a collection! When you read these stories it's not hard to see why this character has survived over 60 years. This is just good, old fashioned comic fun that is sorely lacking in comics of today...except for Archie Comics, of course! Highest recommendation!"},{"Title":"Archie Americana Series Volume 1: Best Of The Forties Book 1","review":"Archie, Veronica, Jughead, Betty, Reggie, & the long-suffering Mr Weatherbee.

Best of the 'Forties Volume Two is sometimes regarded as more slapstick, but I find it the other way 'round. This volume, with an introduction by Stephen King is a lot better than volume two, although understandably Archie fans may want all of this reasonably priced series. I also found Best of the 'Fifties Volume one to be outstanding.The archival nature of this series makes it perfect for Archie one-offs. My favorite comic was Archie's Mad House, which would seem ideal for this series, as would the Pureheart the Powerful comics or the Man from Riverdale episodes with Archie as a secret agent. Archie has been a hit wherever he's gone, including radio, TV, comics, books and toys. These archival volumes fill in some of the missing history, and aptly illustrate why for fans over the last six decades, everything's Archie."},{"Title":"Life on the Road (Large Print Edition)","review":"The genius of Charles Kuralt--and what makes this book great--is his ability to find insights from the smallest of things, which the rest of us would pass over on the way to more \\"important\\" matters. In some ways his life was extraordinary. But in other ways he led a rather conventional life, going from one greased pig competition to the next hoe-down on his rickety bus. He never walked on the moon, or cured a disease, or broke a batting record, or played at Carnegie Hall. But his insights into the simple experiences in life, from a field of wildflowers to the beauty of an autumn day, make A Life On The Road a book to cherish, and return to again and again. I can't recommend this book enough. America lost a true artist when Mr. Kuralt died.

Suffice to say it spans from the story of a simple brick layer he met in rural america to a proud, grumpy soviet ex-pow who had been waiting 40 years to send a message to an old friend in America.I put this book down with a great faith in humanity and a deep admiration for Charles Kuralt. He leaves you feeling that this world is filled with thousands and thousands of remarkable stories that are waiting to be discovered and that life is full of opportunities around every corner."},{"Title":"Life on the Road (Large Print Edition)","review":"I once heard Dan Rather on TV talking about his late friend Charles. He admired his uncanny ability to describe everyday experiences of common Americans and make them stand out in a positive way. Rather talked about how Charles went against the grain of network television, when networks were consciously \\"dumbing down,\\" Charles was trying to appeal to Americans who had read at least one book per month. He had faith in the intellectual capacity of citizens and their ability to help democracy.This book contains wonderful stories, crafted only in a way Charles could. He saw the everyday heroes in the USA, the heroes who didn't make the headlines, but who mattered a lot in the hearts and minds of many. Charles was trying to be a bright light in a sometimes dark world, and he succeeded.Give this book as a Christmas present to any friend who truly cares about his country and who is tired of the partisanship that is tearing the nation apart.

You'll learn about a woman who spends every day of her life cooking and feeding her neighbors because she wants to be a friend to man. These are the true nobility of our country, the real success stories of lives worthy of note and respect. In comparison to these, Bill Gates, Lee Iacocca, Ted Turner pale in significance.These are lives fully lived, the promise of the individuals completely realized.

He weaves an entertaining and touching tapestry of his journeys across America with delicate fervor. As a journalist, I have found his stories inspiring in my work and a wonderful tool for crafting my own descriptive dialog. My old truck still has a cassette player, so we frequently bounce down the backroads and through the mountain passes of Colorado together, the teacher teaching, I listening.

I had an acquaintance who was a scholar with a focus on Japanese literature. She explained to me a little bit about the complexity of translating waka. I have nothing but admiration for those who can do it well. Hirshfield actually has an essay at the back of this book called \\"On Japanese Poetry and the Process of Translation\\". I recommend it highly, even if you do not normally read this kind of essay.I am a little bit afraid that the focus on the love poems and the emphasis on Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu as female writers may give the wrong idea about the strength and importance of the poetry. Shikibu is widely considered the greatest poet of her period and Ono no Komachi was one of the Rokkasen-- the six best waka poets of the early Heian period. The reason that I am not giving this volume five stars is because of this packaging and not because of the poetry itself.These poems are a joy to read aside from any issues of scholarship. They are strong and sad and very affecting. There is actually no stronger recommendation to read this than the poems themselves, so I will close this review with one of the poems by Shikibu:What is the useof cherishing life in spring?Its flowersonly shackle usto this world."},{"Title":"The Ink Dark Moon: Love Poems by Onono Komachi and Izumi Shikibu, Women of the Ancient Court of Japan (Vintage Classics)","review":"Ono no Komachi and Izumi Shikibu would have been able to do credit to the effort to review this book of their poems.

Anyone seeking information on the Arab Empire (c 1000-1800 C.E.) as well as the Arab Renaissance will come away very satisfied.He also includes a wonderful chapter on the place of the Arabs in history which will be very enlightening to the serious scholar.

I also gave this as gifts to all my girls...DH"},{"Title":"The story of Aunt Becky's army-life","review":"With the sesquicentennial (2011-2015) of the Civil War (1861-1865) soon to be here, I purchased this book because of Sarah Palmer (aka Aunt Becky) was from my county. It is also a good one to read for anyone interested in what Civil War female nurses went through during this time."},{"Title":"The story of Aunt Becky's army-life","review":"At first I couldn't imagine Aunt Becky leaving her two young daughters to travel with the army for years. I gradually came to understand a few things.1. She was recently widowed. She had family that I assume cared for her daughters.2. She had two brothers that went to war and she basically went with them and stayed with their company, though she rarely was able to meet up with them.3. She felt called to do her part and also to help her brothers if they needed her.She sacrificed tremendously, wearing the same dress for years, (maybe there were two and she alternated, but she spoke of only her \\"bed ticking dress,\\" often going hungry, sleeping in a soaking wet tent, on a soaking wet cot. She spoke occasionally of Mrs. Dix, (Dorothea Dix?) and she was paid at the end of the war, but not without fighting for it and immediately gave some of it away to her \\"boys\\" that she had traveled with and cared for.It is actual recorded history, not what we think happened or probably happened, but what did happen, from this woman's perspective.I love journals and diaries for this reason.It also helped me understand the feelings of why the war was fought and what it meant and did to the country.Also in those days nursing was not considered fit work for women and was done by men. At first she wiped brows and held hands, but it wasn't long before she was dressing wounds and helping in surgery.I highly recommend this valuable piece of history."},{"Title":"Mathematics and Sex","review":"I bought this book because of an earlier review that complained about no explanation of the formulae. I was hoping that what that really meant is that it was filled with good math and was in depth. Unfortunately, it isn't.There are some of the chapters that I found very interesting, such as the chapter on attraction cycles. There are other chapters that were really just fluff. Some quick references to some research, and some silly insinuations about the author's bar hopping experiences or lack thereof.I liked that the book took a number of concepts and translated them to references to mathematics papers.I disliked that there was not enough math. Formulas are presented without defining any of the terms. So you might be told that an attraction cycle is represented by f(x)= R(x) + a*B(x). But there is no definition of the R function, how the a constant is derived, or the B function. Nor is there a discussion, usually, of the research that went on to define the function and alternatives examined. The book would benefit very much from going into a full definition of the functions, even if it were in an appendix. Instead, you get a little bit of a tease but not enough information to understand.Likewise, there are cases where the mathematical focus would benefit from a discussion of computer science or engineering techniques. For example, the author describes the complexity of how a dating service might perform similarity matches. She readily admits that she doesn't know what they actually do, so conjectures, makes some references to multidimensional analysis, and more or less leaves it at that. Such a chapter would benefit from a discussion of Bayesian networks, cluster analysis, or other techniques that are common in the computer world as ways to deal with the particular issue.Although I have not yet finished reading the book, I find that I am starting to skim, which is never a great sign. I'm getting the feeling that the author dug into a few of the topics, but then added a number of chapters to flesh out the table of contents. I will finish the book, but I'm finding that I'm much more interested in the next book on my list. (The Machine That Changed The World)"},{"Title":"Mathematics and Sex","review":"Yes, I agree with the previous reviewers that this book is an informative light hearted romp through the world of mathematicalmodelling of one of biology's most important topics: sex. But, I am giving this book only 3 stars since I find it very irritating to be fed with mathematical equations where no attempt has ever been made to explain the various variables or even a rudimentary explanation. This is just plain show and very very detracting!"},{"Title":"Mathematics and Sex","review":"Here is some math for customers considering this book. There are 7 reviews preceeding mine. 5 are right. 2 are wrong.The reviews that are right have noticed that the book contains no math. The reviews that are wrong have noticed that the book is vaguely about sex. Actually it's not. It's about the difficulty difficulty some academics have in starting a sentence and completing it on the same topic.The trouble with invoking applied mathematics is that you have to support what you're saying. Therefore when offering an equation or formula you traditionally state what the variables stand for.I assume that the author has this information but finds it difficult to restate in common English. Almost every topic is concluded in this drift: \\"Well it would be much too time consuming to explain what this formula means but isn't it nice to know that it exists?\\"No. I mean it would be, but we don't know that the formula does exist (hapless readers that we are). To convince us, you have to explain it. Explain: which means state clearly and describe how it works.Here's an example, misanthropically quoted by MSN this morning.If you are looking for a mate for life the correct formula is togo out with 12 people and then choose the next best one after that, which seems to mean better than number 11 but not necessarily as good as number 12. Yes, just ducky, but why is that true?: Sorry, explanation time is over. Exam will be at the sports bar on Saturday night. Don't blow it.Now look: does this \\"formula\\" stand up on its own two feet or is it also drunk and falling off its barstool? Does it still count if all 12 of them dumped YOU? Suppose they were all alcoholics, or verbally abusive? Suppose your relationship with each lasted only three days? Suppose, less dramatically, that following the normal psychological model, you simply picked the same \\"type\\" every time? Do you actually have enough information to proceed or should you still see a lawyer about pre-nups. And why 12? Why not 30 or the square root of 17?Perhaps the author was afraid that if she actually explained herself clearly her readers would spend so much time working out the fractals between margaritas that they'd never go home with anyone. She should ease her mind and write the book correctly. No one is going to take her conclusions to the field. The subject is interesting as theory. And it is interesting. I just wish the author had taken advantage of the fact."},{"Title":"Mathematics and Sex","review":"How do you make maths sexy? Write a book about maths and sex! Trouble is, this book doesn't quite work. If you are already heavily immersed in maths and mathematical modelling, then here are some thought-provoking models that can amusingly be applied to sex. However, anyone unmathematical will see this as simply turning life experiences into a set of gobbledygook equations that add nothing to understanding, and reinforce lots of negative stereotypes about geeky maths.The author writes rather too often about her sexual past, her personal views on orgasm, etc. It would have been better if she'd avoided personalising it altogether. Maybe she thought personal sex/relationship anecdotes would be funny, but if so, it didn't work with this reader."},{"Title":"Mathematics and Sex","review":"Very much for the non-mathematician (there is nothing requiring any mathematical skill, just interest) this well written and entertaining book demonstrates the ability of incredibly simple models to capture extremely interesting behaviour, and comments wryly on such imprtant issues ;-) as how many people one should date before settling on \\"the right one\\"."},{"Title":"Mathematics and Sex","review":"Clio Cresswell, Mathematics and Sex (Allen and Unwin, 2004)One doesn't usually think about the terms \\"mathematics\\" and \\"sex\\" going together. Clio Cresswell is out to change that perception, and her attempt here is a witty, albeit slightly shallow, little book that's definitely worth a look if you enjoy either mathematics or sex (and are there really people out there who enjoy neither?).Cresswell's approach to the topic is to treat readers like laypersons, which is much appreciated by those of us who are somewhat innumerate. Cresswell dedicates each of the book's chapters to one particular aspect of the dating and mating ritual and expounds upon current mathematical hypotheses that attempt to explain why we do the things we do. Perversely, if there is a failing to this approach, it's that Cresswell sometimes treats us a bit too much like laypersons; some more detail on how the equations scientists have come up with work would have been nice.Still, it's a game try, and a fun one, worth reading. ***"},{"Title":"Mathematics and Sex","review":"I don't know why people are complaining about no math in this book. All the topics are well referenced at the back.This inexpensive book is light reading, entertaining, highly thought provoking and shows the way forword for those who want more details. And it is pretty cheap too."},{"Title":"Mathematics and Sex","review":"I [heart] Ms. Cresswell's premise: relationships and sex are approachable through mathematics. However, her approach leaves me either wanting more mathematics or a more formal voice. She doesn't skimp on the formulaic jargon, but does skimp on its explanation. You're teasing us Clio! Don't be so coy. If you're going to show us the nuts and bolts of how math can uncover the secrets of relationships and sex, then show us the full monty, and give me the details. Need the info. Yeah. Anyway, the \\"number of 'bonks' to successful pair bonding\\" tip is worth the price of admission alone but there are other insightful and perhaps instructional tips hidden in this work as well."},{"Title":"Mathematics and Sex","review":"How can a book with a title like this not attract your attention? Why thig might even be interesting enough to attract the attention of the most jaded high schooler.In Clio Cresswell's view, mathematics is the study of patterns. And boy are patterns a part of sex. How many of us have married the same woman several times - different skins, same insides? What are the probablilities? How do you express this in an equasion.The writing style is wonderful. Here's the start of Chapter 7 -- Have you ever found yourself wishing there was another sex? \\"Maybe you have secretly wished for a sex with a penis that would cry with you at the movies, or a sex with breasts that would find copious beer drining the greatest turn-on since Elvis.\\" It goes on to talk about the mathematics of having three sexes. \\"Just think how hard it is to pick up already in our set up. Imagine if you had to pick up two people each time. You would hardly ever get laid.\\"A wonderful view of applied mathematics."},{"Title":"Mathematics and Sex","review":"Good book. Never thought of the subject in that way before, however it was very interesting reading."},{"Title":"The Great Dinosaur Atlas","review":"\\"The Great Dinosaur Atlas\\" is wonderful book in its mission and accomplishment. An atlas by definition is a book of maps. A specialized atlas, like this one, adds a special subject to those maps.Crafting their words and illustrations for children, the author/illustrator, Lindsay and Fornari, show dinosaur faces on the first two pages (the book is set up in double-page subjects), with maps indicating their discoveries. \\"Age of the Dinosaurs,\\" a section of chapter one, explains: \\"Fossils are a record of the Earth, and every new fossil found may help to fill in our picture of the world of dinosaurs\\" (7). The date of this atlas is 1991. It is a DK publication, with Dorling Kindersley one of the very best publishers in children's nonfiction, informational books.The rest of the atlas, then, is a gradual revealing of known information concerning dinosaurs, their archaelogical discoveries, and what those discoveries tell us. As the author says, new finds sometimes change the interpretation of old information.The atlas shows the earliest earth mass, Pangaea, its shifting divisions into the continents we have today. Knowing that there was one mass easily explains how an identical skeletal remains in South America was also found in Australia, an island continent. What dinosaurs lived during the Jurassic period and the Cretaceous? What did they eat? How did they reproduce? What happened to these unique creatures that became extinct?That information and those answers fill the rest of the book, with the illustrations just as informative as the information. However, what makes this book stand out is the huge, in-your-face illustrations of the dinosaurs. Most children already know about dinosaurs, but to hold this over-sized book (14\\" x 11\\"), and see those large pictures will make the child push the book away a bit from the startle reflex.I cannot say this is the best book about dinosaurs, but it is a highly recommended book for a children's library because it is an atlas--thus a great lesson book--and a quality one.Note: Please click on the book title to go to the product page, click on the images and examine the selected illustrations taken from the book.Second note: At the time of this writing, I had not considered information that might be outdated. Since publication of this review, commentators have suggested I might re-consider. I would have to remove the entire review, losing all comments, to change the star rating. Instead, I am stating here that this fabulous DK Atlas is most likely outdated and that I probably will remove it from circulation in my school library."},{"Title":"The Great Dinosaur Atlas","review":"This atlas serves as a lovely introduction to the world of dinosaurs. At just 64 pages, it is very readable with text that is easily understood &amp; yet not patronizing to the beginner. The book tries to be comprehensive in its coverage by first telling us about the formation of the continents &amp; how this explains where dinosaur fossils are found. The dinosaurs found on each of the continents are then covered, and this is interspersed with specific information on the various types of dinosaurs eg the carnosaurs, sauropods, horned dinosaurs etc. All the way, the book is beautifully illustrated with detailed &amp; colorful renditions of the dinosaurs &amp; their skeletons by Giuliano Fornari, who has a list of other dinosaur books to his credit. One gripe is that the book doesn't appear to be up to date. It was originally published in 1991 and although this is listed as the 'First American Revised Edition 1999', recent dicoveries are not mentioned - eg the book lists Ultrasauros as the longest dinosaur, but in 1993, the 130 foot long Argentinosaurus huinculensis was named. Another dinosaur recently described, Sauroposeidon, found in Oklahoma might be even bigger. In addition, Tyrannosaurus rex is mentioned as the largest carnosaur, but I believe that the Giganotosaurus carolinii named in 1995 might be bigger. Still, these are small gripes that do not detract from the fact that this is a great book for budding dinosaur lovers of all ages ( even my 16 month old son pulls the book down to leaf thro its pages daily)."},{"Title":"Diversity of Creatures, A","review":"A Diversity of Creatures was published in 1917, but most of the stories predate World War I, and it shows. The book resembles the just preceding adult collection, Actions and Reactions, more than it does the postwar collections such as Limits and Renewals. Indeed, I would classify A Diversity of Creatures as something of a disappointment, if only relative to Kipling's high standard. It does include one of his all-time great stories, \\"Mary Postgate\\", and one other very fine story, the odd SF piece \\"As Easy as A. B. C.\\" Perhaps not surprisingly these close and open the collection. There is also the famous comic story \\"The Village That Voted the Earth Was Flat\\".The most obvious recurring theme in the collection is revenge, and not always in a good way. Quite often the revenge is by characters Kipling appears to approve of against hapless or awkward antagonists, and seems out of proportion to the original offense. For example, in \\"The Village That Voted the Earth Was Flat\\", a group of people in an early motorcar are caught in a sort of speed trap, clearly a revenue grab by a local Baronet. They are newspaper people, as well as an M. P. and (in another car) a theatre man. They get together to subject the village in which they were mistreated to humiliation by such means as arranging for them to be hoodwinked into voting that the Earth is flat after a presentation by a fake member of the Flat Earth Society.\\"As Easy as A.B.C.\\" is a sequel to \\"With the Night Mail\\". It is set in 2065. The world by this time has become a mostly libertarian paradise, with a declining population and a horror of invasion of privacy. One form of invasion of privacy, in this formulation, is democracy, with its imposure of majority will. Paradoxically (or not), the generally libertarian nature of this society is maintained by the Draconian rule of \\"The A.B.C., that semi-elected, semi-nominated, body of a few score persons\\", as the introductory paragraph has it. In this story some members of the A.B.C. are travelling to Chicago, where it seems a few idlers and no-accounts have been assembling and trying to force votes on various issues. The other locals, horrified, call in the A.B.C. demanding that they take over -- if they don't, they say, people might get killed. And so the A.B.C., rather drastically it seemed to me, takes things in hand -- though with magic tech that supposedly won't actually really hurt anyone. Politics aside (the views put forth are, I think, purposely exaggerated for effect), I really liked the story. It seems very fresh, very science-fictional and well thought out, for all that it dates to 1912.The title character of \\"Mary Postgate\\" is a spinster hired to be companion to a well-off woman, Miss Fowler. Miss Fowler's nephew Wynn is orphaned, and she and Mary Postgate more or less raise him, until he joins the nascent Flying Corps at the outbreak of war. Soon he dies in a training accident. Through all this we gather something of Mary Postgate's relationship to him: clearly she dotes on the boy while he treats her with casual disrespect that one supposes includes a reluctant admixture of affection. Mary Postgate suffers in silence through the funeral, and the cleaning up of his effects. The two women decide to burn some of Wynn's belongings, and as Mary is working on his there is another accident -- a building collapses, and a local child is killed. At about the same time an airplane crashes near the incinerator where Mary Postgate is burying Wynn's effects. Mary immediately (and almost certainly erroneously) decides that the airplane had dropped a bomb, causing the building collapse. When she finds the downed pilot, she refuses him any help (though he speaks in French, albeit possibly German accented French), instead guarding him until he dies -- an event she reacts to in a stunning scene in which she seems perhaps to come to orgasm as the main dies.It's an odd odd story, and Mary Postgate is one of Kipling's stranger characters. You might think that the story, written in about 1917, in the midst of the War, should be read straight -- that Mary is simply doing her bit for the War effort, killing her German, as it were, while mourning her lost surrogate son, who died as a result of the War. But everywhere this is undermined. Mary's actions are hardly heroic, and her orgasmic reaction to his death is distasteful. The German pilot isn't even necessarily German -- he could be French, an ally. Mary assumes he dropped a bomb on the village and killed a child -- but that does not seem likely. Mary's beloved Wynn does not die in action but in a training accident. To me the story seems rather to be concerned with the tragic waste of war, with the danger of excessive vengefulness, and with one particular character: the spinster Mary Postgate.These stories are the cream of the crop in this book. There are other fine stories (for example \\"In the Same Boat\\"), and even the lesser stories are Kipling -- thus hardly to be ignored! The 4 star rating is only relative to the greatest Kipling collections, such as Limits and Renewals and Traffics and Discoveries."},{"Title":"Biography - Andriote, John-Manuel (1959-): An article from: Contemporary Authors","review":"I haven't read the Contemporary Authors biography of me, and may not do so.
