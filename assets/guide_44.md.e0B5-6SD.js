Not only is CATHCER more enjoyable, you will get the point even if you are only an average reader."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I don't have the patience. I found it boring and was unable to relate to Dedalus at all. Essentially, this book is a summation of Dedalus' stream of consciousness.

I have to admit, the book does have some good points, but mostly, it is very hard to understand. I liked the fact that Stephen (the character), who was very religious, repented of his first sin, but you have to admit, who would spend all his time in church trying to be absolved of their sins?

For me, this was not quite a Literature class force-feed novels, albeit close to one. I *thought* that it was to be required reading for AP British Lit, and being the atypical student that I am, likes to get a head start on things. . .James Joyce in general and this quasi-autobiographical novel in particular are horribly overrated. If you prefer novels that have at least a verisimilitude of plot, do not read Portrait. It is nothing more than stream-of-consciousness ramblings that go on and on to nowhere--or at least to nowhere that makes the reader the least bit desirous to read further. I suppose that the intent of this literary atrocity--er...technique--is to elucidate the psyche of Stephen Dedalus, but it even fails to do this well. (Returning to the topic of British Lit force-feed material, the last novel I read for that class, Tess of the d&#8217;Urbervilles, maintains a story-line AND limns three characters more fully than Portrait characterizes its one protagonist. I present this example only to suggest Joyce&#8217;s relative ineptitude and to substantiate my capability to indeed connect to literature, even outside of my preferred genre--just not in the case of Portrait.) If any analects able to evoke a response from the reader can be extracted from the utter blandness, they are found in the fire-and-brimstone preaching which comprises page after page after--hey, Dedalus and Joyce&#8217;s childhoods may have contained much more than mine, but they&#8217;re still not enough to fill a novel!I think that I found a solecism in one of the Latin quotations, but I do not remember what it was.If you&#8217;re one of those psychopaths who find all interior-monologue insightful, read Portrait. If you like your novels pointless and plotless, read Portrait. If you need a soporific, read Portrait. Otherwise, no.I am fortunate that this did not turn out to be required reading, for writing an analytical essay on such an insipid novel would be even more torturous than reading it; in fact, it would be a lot worse than the one the aforementioned sermon luridly explains."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"After having greatly enjoyed the Dubliners - a series of perceptive and beautifully written short stories about ordinary people - I looked forward to delving far deeper in Joyce. When at last I cracked the cover of this book, I was sorely disappointed at the unbearable pretention and lack of plot in this novel.Stephen Daedalus is a callow snob, whose concerns are so otherworldly and obscure that they feed directly into the most ridiculously romantic and shallow stereotypes about artists as unusual gods. It is simply a monument to a young's man's egotism and unerring sense of his own destiny. There is little to learn from all the strange things he obsesses about, his experiences rarely ring true, and there is nothing notable about the writing.This novel is probably coveted in undergraduate lit classes because most of the readers are untested adolescents, who feel they can conquer the world so easily. Alas, as an adult it is just boring."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is my first exposure to James Joyce. I will admit that while I was reading it, the book was not enjoyable. I started out confused by the jumping around at the beginning and the lack of movement made it hard to stay awake at some parts. The book is about Stephen Dedalus who takes us through his adolescent years. It takes place in Ireland in the midst of the Catholic and Protestant battle. In the first chapter Stephen is trying to fit in with family, friends, and even his country. In the second chapter Stephen starts to separate from his father. At the end of this chapter, Stephen gives in and has his first sexual experience with a prostitute. In chapter three, he listens to Father Arnell's moving sermons. After he hears these sermons, he immediately goes to confess his sin to a priest. In chapter four he discovers art, and in chapter five he alienates himself further from his family and country.As I mentioned before, my first run through with this book was not a happy one. It may because it was rushed, but as I looked back through it the second time I was amazed at Joyce's style. Although there was not very much movement, Joyce's description and imagery was outstanding. I had never before enjoyed a book with tons of imagery, but Joyce's imagery is what made the book real to me. I also thought the different themes throughout the book were remarkable. While I was reading the book through the first time, I did not pick up on many of the themes and symbols. It was the when I was looking over it later that I saw all the symbol of the birds, the imagery of the water, and I saw how Stephen was moving farther and farther away from his father and gaining freedom. At the beginning of the book, Stephen sees the birds as vicious. When we get closer to the end of the book, he sees them as beautiful. This shows how Stephen is breaking away and his freedom. As the book progresses, you can also see how Stephen comes to know that his feelings of love are normal. At the beginning when Stephen said he wanted to marry Eileen, Dante is appalled, but as Stephen watched the girl in the ocean he realizes that it is all right to love. I also liked the connection to the Greek mythology. I think it ties into the book very well.In the end, I have to say that I liked the book. If I did read it again, it would be much more pleasurable to be able to pick out all the symbols, themes, connections, and imagery as I went through it instead of waiting until after to see how it all comes together."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"&quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; is easily one of the greatest books of the twentieth century. Rarely is such a mastery of the English language encountered. James Joyce has an almost uncanny ability to create images and feelings out of words. He manages to describe a place and also the feelings of the main character when he's in that place with teh same set of words.The story itself is almost inconsequential. As I read it I was so caught up in Stephen's self-destructive spiral that I could never pass any sort of moral judgement. I had to like Stephen because he was so human. His dilemmas and his emotions were so real, and Joyce was able to bring them to life with his words.As a previous reviewer has said, it is true that to understand certain parts of the book, it helps to have a little background on Irish politics at the turn of the century (or at least know who Parnell is) but a few minutes of internet research will do that for you. As for strange words and slang, the language becomes more elevated as Stephen grows up (a touch of genius, if you ask me) so that's not really much of a problem. Stephen's final break with tradition as he answers the call of Daedalus, his namesake, is magnificent to read. All in all, this book is definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"\\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" is an eloquent novel that reveals James Joyce's literary genius. The story, which seems to be based on some of Joyce's life, is told using a third person limited omniscient narrator, but often appears to be told through the eyes of the main character Stephen Dedalus. The story is set in late nineteenth century Ireland shadows the growth and development of Stephen during his early years. He begins his journey as a young lad, oppressed by his parents, society, and religion. The diction and tone employed in the early stages of the novel are that of a young child. As we see Stephen's passage through life we also observe a progression of the writing. As Stephen becomes more educated both scholastically and in the ways of the world, Joyce's writing style progresses with him. This fluctuation in style effectively portrays the changes in Stephen, and the ever-widening rift that he creates between himself and his oppressors. Throughout the book, Stephen struggles to separate his own life with the life that he is expected to live. Through a series of vividly descriptive epiphanies, Stephen discovers that his own ideas, though contrary to his upbringing, are acceptable. The book concludes with a series of personal journal entries of Stephen's in which he rejoices in his new found life exclaiming \\"Welcome, O life!\\"(185). The lessons learned by Stephen Dedalus have great application to our own lives, proving that sometimes we must cast off our upbringing and venture out on our own to discover who we are. This lesson coupled with Joyce's imaginative, symbolic style makes for a killer combination. \\"Portrait\\" is an excellent read!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce&iexcl;s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is the coming of age story of Stephen Dedalus. Stephen grows from a sensitive child to a defiant young man. The reader learns about Stephen as he matures and discovers that Stephen is a complex person full of paradox.The very first contradiction is evident in Stephen&iexcl;s name. His first name comes from the Roman Catholic Saint Stephen who was the first Christian martyr. Stephen can be seen as a martyr for his art. At the end of the novel, Stephen leaves his native Ireland in pursuit of his dream of being an artist. He gave up everything he had for his dream. His last name comes from a Greek mythological figure, Daedalus, a great inventor who was commanded to make a maze by a powerful king. The king&iexcl;s goal was to imprison the brilliant Daedalus in the maze so that the king would always have access to his genius. Daedalus made waxen wings so that his son, Icarus, could escape the maze. Icarus soared to close to the sun, melting the wings his father had made. Icarus died because of his foolish pride. Stephen can be seen as Icarus because he lost his home, family, and faith in pursuit of his own glory. His name is obviously contradictory and characterizes him as both virtuous and prideful.Stephen&iexcl;s personality is as contradictory as his name. As a young boy, Stephen is fearful and insecure. In the beginning of the novel, Stephen seems cowardly when he is bullied by his classmates. But he later finds strength to question authority. He is bold enough to question his upbringing, the beliefs of his family, and the tenets of the Catholic Church. His questioning of the Church, leads him to reject Catholicism and embrace his talents.Similarly, Stephen is too shy to kiss the girl he likes, but he willfully visits prostitutes. On one occasion, Stephen knew that the girl he liked wanted him to kiss her, but he could not bring himself to do it, even though he desired too. Later on in chapter II, Stephen &quot;wanted to sin with another of his kind, to force another being to sin with him and to exult her in sin,&iexcl; so he visited a prostitute. But when the women asked him to kiss her, he could not. His inner struggles are apparent in his desire to sin with a prostitute, and the inability to kiss the girl he desires.He recognizes this contradiction between his outward appearance of piety and his inner immorality, when he says,&quot;Could it be that he, Stephen Dedalus, had done those things? His conscience sighed in answer. Yes, he had done them, secretly, filthily, time after time and hardened in sinful impenitence, he had dared to wear the mask of holiness before the tabernacle itself while his soul within was a living mass of corruption.&quot;Stephen finds himself caught between his desire to be good and his desire to be discreet about his transgressions. His conflicting views are illustrated by his thoughts. &iexcl;He had to confess every sin. How could he utter in words to the priest what he had done? Must, must. Or how could he explain without shame? A madman! Confess! O he would indeed to be free and sinless again!&iexcl;After repenting of his sins and turning back to the faith of his upbringing, he considers becoming a priest. A priest asks Stephen, &iexcl;Have you ever felt that you have a vocation?&iexcl; Stephen considers the possibility of becoming a powerful, well respected priest with much anticipation but then comes to the conclusion that, &iexcl;He was destined to learn his own wisdom apart from others or to learn the wisdom of others himself wandering among the snares of the world.&quot; He realizes his destiny lies away from the Church.Throughout the novel, Stephen&iexcl;s thoughts are disjointed and contradictory, much like his name. He has a difficult time finding his identity, and in the end, Stephen leaves behind his home and embarks on a journey to find himself."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Upon finishing Portrait one understands much better Joyce's seguay into Ulysses. Ulysses turns ordinary people in an ordinary day into an experimental novel. Portrait, much the same, uses the very ordinary life of its author as a model for the main character. Unlike Ulysses, Portrait simply fails to generate a whole lot of interest, unless one is specifically enthralled with the relation of young men to their priests, or interested in the mundane conversations of university students. The book begins strongly enough with a clever rendition of the earliest years of Stephen Daedelus. But, as the book curves more to Joyce's struggles with his Catholic upbringing, my interest begain to wain, and by the end, suspecting Joyce had lost enthusiasm in his own book, I was quite happy to have only a few more pargraphs before me. Now, I have an equal disinterest in sailing, but have read books on sailing which captured my interest against my will. Portrait never reaches this point, and while understanding it on an intellectual level, for me there is a distinct lack of passion, drama, story line, or the basic subtle artistry that makes for a good book. There were some high points highlighted by a sermon so explicit an exposition of the Christian Religion as to expose that religion. Certainly Joyce with this rendition of the sermon proves his ability to outwrite and outpersuade anybody who had written of Christiantity to date, and so flashes a bit of his great talent. In the end, I felt that Portrait contained a few very well written parts, and while the writing certainly is on a high plain, in the panopy of literature this was barely average."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Perhaps considered by many as one Joyce's most personal work.

What makes this book wonderful isn't the plot, but the revolutionary style of writing used by Joyce. &quot;A Portrait of the Artist...&quot; is a challenging book, but very satisfying to read."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN does not so much solicit deep thoughts and great emotions so much as it wrings them out of the reader. To finish this book is not to feel uplifted and encouraged for Stephen Dedalus, but to feel that at least he has made progress and knows enough of his strengths and weaknesses that he may make something of himself. Is this not possibly where we are left at the end of all great coming-of-age novels?Joyce takes us through five stages of Stephen's youth. As a boy in 1890's Dublin he hears his father arguing that Irish nationalism has been sold out by the Catholic clergy. Soon Stephen's hands are \\"crumpling\\" beneath the paddle of an unjust priest. He becomes a leader in his class, an intellectual in a world where many believe: \\"If we are a priestridden race we ought to be proud of it. They are the apple of God's eye.\\" Later Joyce spends eleven inimitable pages on these apples explaining in colorfully exhaustive detail what it would be like to be baked in a hellpie (for God is loving but God's justice is harsh). Five pages on the physical tortures of the eternal fire, and six more after a break about the mental tortures--Dante himself would be impressed. Fear of hell scares Stephen sufficiently enough to repent from his teenage brothel-frequenting phase. He goes to rather interesting extremes of devotion, even considering the priesthood as a vocation. But his questioning nature is even too intellectual for the jesuits and he discovers another path for himself at and after college.Joyce writes poetic, often urgent prose: \\"To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to create life out of life!\\" becomes one of Stephen's clarion calls. A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN should be read by anyone looking for one of the best tales of intellectual, physical and spiritual awakening we have. Its beauty is best savored slowly. The rhythms might be difficult to pick up at first, but it really won't take very long until you will have a hard time putting the book down."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I'll be the first to admit it, I hated this book when I first read it.

Knowing that if I was willing to think about a book in response to my own life I needed to give it a second chance, I went out and bought a copy. Sure enough, upon a second reading, the novel seemed all the more enjoyable to me.

Even with slow, careful reading, I found it tough -- because I'm not a 1900's Irish Catholic teenage boy.I have, however, been a teenage boy, and many of Stephen's experiences and psychological developments ring through time: his adolescent, ambivalent virgin/whore conceptions of women; his self-denial and earnest attempts to better himself; his rejection of the meretricious parts of the world; his disappointment in family. And his grand rebellion against the culture of his birth.Over and over, Joyce refines away the actual events of Stephen's life, showing instead the echoes and re-echoes of these events in Stephen's psyche. An hour with a neighborhood girl becomes a touchstone for years. A bit of student graffiti upends his respect for a college. Subtle moments of epiphany cause him to reject some things, reach out towards others. This is a timeless story of adolescence.The story ends just where it should."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"It sometimes takes a while to warm up to writing such as this first major work by James Joyce, ands yet his understanding of the Irish heart and his ability to articulate it eloquently makes this book worth delving into Joyce's mind. His title tells the story cleanly enough, but this is Joyce, and there's more to this bildungsroman than simply a young man coming of age in 1900s Ireland.The story is of a young man, Stephen Daedalus, who just as we have all been in our youth, subjugated to family, school, and church. And in this era of Ireland's history, that constitutes a formidable albatross. I'm synopsizing to a great degree, but Daedalus' first onus is a rather formal Catholic education, in which discipline is paramount. The school's rules are an end unto themselves, and hardly a means toward such.Of course, this is a catholic school, so the sensibilities of education and religious training are intermixed. Daedalus and his mates are cowed by this one-two societal punch, much time being spent listening to a priest telling the boys of the horrors of Hell. Daedalus' reaction? \\"It put me in quite a blue funk.\\"Young Stephen quickly comes to experience the carnal, courtesy of a girl he pursues, Eileen, and later, a fantasy girl. But these are just set-ups for the priests in his life to bestow guilt on him. Stephen hurries to confess his earlier life a way and considers a commitment to the priesthood.At this point the book - and Stephen - experience a sea change of sorts. He has two choices here: he can knuckle under to the approved Irish/Catholic lifestyle, or he can go his own way. And of course he chooses the latter.Some of Joyce's writerly techniques wouldn't pass muster today, but that's hardly a knock, since he did more than anyone of that generation other than Hemingway to change novel writing technique. But in others, Joyce plays the philosopher, the roue, the priest novitiate, and the iconoclast, perhaps in ways never played on the page before. It must have been hard to do what Daedalus accomplished in terms of self-determination, but then that's what Joyce is giving his readers - the opportunity to throw off the burdens of an overly strict society and to go their own way.4+ stars"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This story is about the emergence of identity. Stephen Dedalus's consciousness is front and centre in the book as Joyce weaves together important vignettes from his life that all contribute to his hero's artistic realization. Language, as always, is vital to Joyce's understanding of how humans develop.For instance, the first segment of the book begins with a fantastic childhood story that showcases Stephen's diction and syntactical choices--without his awareness of this fact. I enjoyed the subtle things about this part. For instance: Stephen sees his father's glasses only as \\"glass that his father looked at him from behind.\\" Also, Joyce starts out the book's tacit use of Dante by rendering the regional pronunciation of \\"Auntie\\" as \\"Dante.\\" That's how Stephen hears it, and that's how we do too. Another great moment is when Stephen is at boarding school and hears the gas vents \\"singing.\\" He's unaware of his artistic potential, but Joyce is pointing us in that direction already.But Joyce is not here to help us read. Rather, he wants to show us the ins-and-outs of a young boy's mind. That's a difficulty I can't blame anyone for having with his writing in general. It's something you either have to accept, deny, or shred, and then you can decide whether to read him or not. However, even if you go through those steps, you're already doing something that Joyce wanted in the first place. He's tricky that way.In my honest opinion, a lot of people will love or hate this book. It's got dark colours throughout, gets murky when Stephen feels bad, but shines when he's on the verge of realizing himself. Joyce is destabilizing form to parallel the ups and downs of a young man's social, intellectual, and religious maturation. It's poetic that he chooses to write in this way, and particularly so for a young man. My advice is to read \\"Portrait\\" for a window into an early revelation in 20th Century English literature. If you 're happy with that, see what Virginia Woolf does with this style, and you won't be disappointed in the slightest."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I am a handful of hours into this work.

This is a semi-autobiographical novel detailing the rather uninteresting youth of a turn of the century Irish boy. Perhaps if I had lived at that time this book would be more meaningful, but in 2010 there is nothing controversial about doubting the infallibility of the Catholic church or the existence of God. This question is one of the main themes of the book, as well as a sort of semi-existentialist quest for the boy to define himself as an artist or whatever. Well, the existentialist debate has been better offered by superior authors from Dostoevsky to Camus, and Joyce falls flat here. The other main subject which Joyce attempts to invoke is some of the political divisions in Ireland. He uses a few characters to try and personify the rivaling political factions of the nation at that time. However, this attempt is short-lived, and it also falls flat.The one gimmick Joyce used which I found mildly interesting was the use of different language as the boy grows older. So the book starts off with some laughable dribble about a \\"moocow\\" and a \\"nicens little boy named baby tuckoo,\\" and ends with Joyce trying to parody the \\"Hail Mary\\" (again, the played-out religious themes).Did I mention how boring this book is? Nothing of interest happens. Terrible book. Avoid at all costs.

They find it dense, obtuse, and a chore.After having to plow through this work for an AP English class, I find it hard to blame them. The &quot;story&quot; is written in the stream of consiousness style, which seems to mean that author feels free to jump from one subject to another, with no concern as to whether it makes any sense what-so-ever to the reader. After finishing the book, I'm not even sure it was ever intended to be read, so much as to have been written.If you looking for a good book, give this &quot;great&quot; work a pass.And a note to any students reading this, if your teacher has you look for the &quot;shocking&quot; word in part 3 (or 4, I forget) its &quot;feotus.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Cut straight to the chase here: I tried really hard, I really did.

The plot focuses on the growth and development of Stephen Dedalus, an intelligent Irish boy born into a poor family. One of the most interesting features of the book is that it is considered to be a \\"self-portrait of the artist\\" by most experts. The events of author James Joyce's life mirror those of young Dedalus well. This makes for a fascinating read considering Joyce's prominent position in the writing world.The writing styles and techniques Joyce uses are expert. The writing level begins at a level that a small child would use, and increases in sophistication through the book as Dedalus grows older and becomes more educated. The pinnacle of the writing is Dedalus' narration about his theories of art and beauty near the end of the book, about the time he is to leave the university and Ireland altogether. The beautiful language of the narration is a work art by its own merit, and I highly recommend reading it whether or not you read The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in its entirety.Among the various things to look for while reading \\"Portrait\\" are the reoccurring images of water, birds, and the colors white and red. Specifically, pay attention to Dedalus' perceptions of these things, and how his perceptions change as the book moves forward. Two other common topics surfacing throughout the novel are politics and religion. Ever since a bitter argument about politics and religion broke out among his family at Christmas dinner, Dedalus has been wary of the subjects. This makes for conflict because the church and politics are at the forefront of the educated minds he is associating with.Lastly, when reading this book, consider how it relates Irish nationalism and Ireland's struggle to find its place in the world of art and culture. Although this is not such an obvious theme, it is interesting to note how many of the characters are concerned with what Ireland is, where it is going, and how best to improve it.Because the reading can be so heavy in The Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man, I recommend referring to some sort of an explanatory or summary essay to supplement your reading..."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is one of the great masterpieces of modern literature. Joyce is a true master of diction. While his imagery is complex and metaphorical, it is never banal. Though many of the experiences of Stephen Daedalus are commonplace, Joyce's descriptions give them meaning that is universally applicable.The basic structure of the book is rather simple. Five chapters each present an important point in the life of Stephen. Each of these segments contains an epiphany that slowly guides Stephen to his vocation as an artist. The language of the chapter's change as Stephen gains maturity and independence. In the first chapter, Stephen is a pre-adolescent boy struggling to be accepted at school. His thoughts center around his family, especially his \\"Nice Mother\\" (Joyce, 3). In the second chapter teenage first Stephen addresses issues of sexuality and love. He begins to be drawn to literature as a way of expressing his emotions. Chapters three and four provide a thought provoking analysis of religion. In perhaps the book's most important epiphany Stephen gains an affirmation of his artistic calling. In chapter five we see the development of Stephen's aesthetic philosophy, and his resolve to leave his native country of Ireland.It is interesting, indeed, to chart the progress of a weak six-year boy until he becomes a liberal minded university student. While the journey Stephen takes is not radically unique, by the end of the novel almost every one of his attitudes is significantly altered- including his love for his mother.Readers be warned. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, can be laborious as its title. Joyce uses altered syntax (hyphens instead of quotation marks) a makes use of unique word order to show the stages of Stephen's development. In the title itself, many always switch \\"a\\" and \\"the.\\" Joyce's book is not one meant to entertain. It is a philosophical novel that is probably written for completely didactic purposes.In my College English class, many disliked the novel. I disliked it as well, until I began to click with Joyce's use of stream of consciousness technique. At that point I began to feel as if I was in the mind of Stephen. I realized why some of the various time shifts in the book were occurring. I began to concentrate on the descriptions Joyce was presenting, and began to see some of the reasons for Stephen's development.All the techniques Joyce uses are aimed at bringing us inside the mind of Stephen Daedalus. Vivid imagery only comes when Stephen concentrates on a particular item, whether it is the stick used by a teacher to slap him, his vision of Hell, or the beautiful girl on the beach who stirs his soul with \\"profane joy\\" (123). Most of the attributes of turn of the century Ireland are completely ignored. Cursory descriptions of the land and political situation of time are never expanded, and really of little importance. \\"The Artist\\" is the focus of the book. All the remaining characters are flat, and are only used as yard sticks to show Stephen's budding independence. Again, the names and rolls of secondary characters are often of little importance.Again this book is not for the faint of heart. Speed-reading was an exercise in futility. Any lack of concentration could bring utter confusion if one missed a shift in Stephen's thoughts. I highly recommend using Cliff Notes or other study device to make sure you understand all the main events of the chapter. Understanding the book becomes easier as one becomes familiar with the unique majesty of Joyce's words. Even when describing boredom, they are remarkable.The drowning voice of the professor continued to wind itself slowly round and round the coils it spoke of, doubling, trebling, quadrupling it somnolent energy as the coil multiplied its ohms of resistance (140).Boring science lectures are only one of the things the Joyce brings to life. Reading Portrait was definitely a mind-expanded experience, make easier by the short length of the book. I highly recommend it for anyone who is ready to move from great stories, to great works of literature.Work Cited- Joyce, James. A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Dover Publications Inc. New York NY, 1994"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a fascinating tale, woven with a fresh stream-of-consciousness style that follows the thoughts of the artist, Stephen Dedalus, from childhood to adolescence to eventual maturity. Although written in the third-person, the prose evolves in a first-person fashion with Stephen, from his youthful contemplation of \\"wild rose blossoms on the little green place\\" to his fully adult conception of \\"the virgin womb of the imagination\\" wherein \\"the word was made flesh\\" (1, 158). In addition to the progressive complexity of the ideas, repetition of symbols-the colors of governess Dante's brushes, black dirty mazes, soaring birds, earthy peasant smells-also tie the flowing text together, providing reference, cohesiveness and depth. Rich imagery and symbolism give this deceptively simple tale added meaning, expanding the story from that of a single struggling artist to a sweeping metaphor for the human desire to create.Stephen Dedalus is a contradictory character, full of ambiguities and internal oppositions. He dreams of classic-book heroes and innocent virginal heroines within his room, yet seeks prostitutes on the solid dark mazes of the city streets. He yearns to find and embrace God and religion, almost reaching the priesthood itself-then denies his faith entirely. He loves his country, his mother, his friends, but forsakes them all in pursuit of his artistic vision. These many dissimilar aspects of Stephen seem bound together only by his passion for writing, his inner yearning to see, to create. Like the Daedalus of the Greek myth, who created beautiful wings to escape a twisted labyrinth of his own design, Stephen finds a freedom, exhilaration in his capacity to write beauty. As he matures, his visions of lovely birds replace the austere confines of the religious bench and his ability to imagine soars above his need for family, friends, and church until he is torn free from his old life entirely, flying unfettered into boundless skies of his art.Yet in the Greek myth, there are two who manage to fly from the maze-Daedalus, the creator of wings and labyrinth both, and his youthful son, Icarus. Icarus, excited by his freedom from the dark confines of the maze, soars higher, higher, in spite of his father's warnings, until the dazzle of the sun melts the wax of his wings and sends him plunging, helpless, to his doom. Daedalus himself survives, a witness to the death of his son, alone and a fugitive, a man who has lost all in pursuit of his art. Stephen himself could be either of the two mythical figures-by the end of the book he is still young, unproven, his creative ideas barely starting to take form. His youthful foibles could be tempered with time, maturity guiding him to unseen distant shores, or his pride could expand, lifting him into the deadly rays of the sun. Joyce never makes clear the fate of the youthful protagonist within the novel-by the end, Stephen has barely started his flight from the dark maze of his old life on the wings of his art, the feathers still fresh and firmly attached to the newly-made frame, his course uncertain. Yet in his glorious discovered wings lies a hint of all humanity, the portion of mankind with a driving urge to create, to lift voice, pen, brush in the pursuit of liberty and beauty. Through the lens of that wide backdrop, that significance, Joyce's novel captures a harsh reality and contrasts it with imagination wonder in a powerful portrait well worth examining."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man is a gripping novel about a boy's coming of age and struggle of growing up in Ireland. It's most often seen as James Joyce's life in retrospect. This book is about Stephen Dedalus' struggle with growing up, fitting in with society, and questions about religion.It begins as Stephen recounts his early years beginning at the age of six and attending the prestigious Congowes Boarding School. His parents are always in debt and barely scraped enough money to send him there. He goes to Belvedere College the next year because his parents can no longer afford to send him to that school. There he excels in writing and acting, yet does not have the religious fervency that his mother has, nor the political passion his father possesses. He longs for someone to understand him. He doesn't have many friends, yet longs to fit in. He happens to fall into the arms of a prostitute, and therefore goes through with his first sexual encounter. Afterward he feels the hot shame of his sins and momentarily embraces Catholicism. He desperately wants forgiveness of his sins when he goes to a church retreat for his school. There the priest preaches about the damnation of hell and repentance. Stephen feels that the sermons are directed to him and goes to confess his sins to a priest who could care less. He continues to go to Mass everyday, and later his sins come back to him and he feels as though his confession was not legitimate. A priest from his school notices his newfound piety, and asks him if he would think seriously about becoming a priest. Stephen later goes to a beach to think and suddenly an epiphany happens before his eyes. He's seriously contemplating the action of becoming a priest when he sees a beautiful girl standing in the water. As he walks away from her, he realizes that it is not a bad thing to want the beautiful things in life. Everything in Ireland is now frustrating him, and he concludes that the only way that he could be happy is to leave Ireland and become an artist. There is a lot of symbolism with birds. Dedalus is a person in Greek mythology whose father made him wings to fly. This was Stephen's opportunity to fly away from all his problems there and to fly away from the person he once was.Personally, I liked this book. It showed me how some people do suffer over certain things. Stephen tried to be part of the crowd in every aspect of his life, yet he didn't fit in anywhere. He was tormented over his sin with the harlot, only to discover that it wasn't a bad thing to want beauty. I love how he is happy in the end, even though it is leaving his beloved country. He felt freed from a lifetime of restraint and confusion, and for the first time felt good about life. This is a book of renewal and self- discovery, and I would recommend this classic book to any one I know."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait of a Young Artist is a beautiful piece of literature that explores the development of Stephen Dedalus from a young man into an artist. The novel is somewhat autobiographical in that Joyce explores and analyzes his life though the main character Stephen, and through this is trying to make sense of his past and what that makes him. Stephen becomes more independent in his thinking throughout the novel. He is trying to find out who he is in relationship to his family, his peers, Catholicism, and his country. Joyce uses symbolism as well as language and syntax to show Stephen's development.The language and syntax of the novel parallel the development of Stephen. Chapter one is written in stream of consciousness. Joyce uses this effective tool to really show how a five or six year old would be thinking. The novel begins with a story Stephen's father told him. Then it moves to him wetting the bed, then to his nextdoor neighbor, and then to the boys playing on the play ground. The writing is just as a little child would think. It seems illogical to an adult, but to a child it is logical. The word choice Joyce uses is also very effective. \\"Rody Kickham was a decent fellow but Nasty Roche was a stink.\\" The word stink also parallels Stephen's age. In chapter three the language is more fully developed. \\" He feared intensely in spirit and in flesh but, raising his head bravely, he strode into the room firmly.\\" Intensely, bravely and firmly show that Stephen is growing and maturing. By the end of the novel the writing is no longer in stream of consciousness and the language is complex. \\" A soft liquid joy flowed through the words where the soft long vowels hurtled noiselessly and fell away, lapping and flowing back and ever shaking the white bells of their waves in mute chime and mute peal and soft low swooning cry.\\" Words are no longer just letters; they have meaning and purpose. In this Stephen fully realizes who he is he is an artist. He has completed his change from a boy to a man.Stephen's development is also shown by birds, which symbolize freedom. The more freedom Stephen has the more he is able to explore who he really is. In the beginning of the novel the birds talked about are unpleasant. Stephen's governess Dante teases him with a poem about an eagle pulling out his eyes. Therefore, this eagle connotes fear as well as something with power, power over him. Then, the bird transforms into his rival and friend Vincent Heron. Instead of being controlled by the bird he is pushed by it, furthering his development. Then, the bird becomes something Stephen wishes to aspire to. \\" His throat ached with a desire to cry aloud, the cry of a hawk or eagle on high, to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds.\\" Now, the eagle that had once tormented him was a symbol of freedom and life.A Portrait of a Young Artist is not a book for everyone. It is not easy reading. There is also no plot line to pull the reader along so, the reader must be actively engaged in reading the novel. Also, Joyce uses complex jargon and phrasing. Some parts may have to be read through two or three times before their meaning unfolds. The reader also has to let themselves get lost in the writing, dive into the words, make them your own. The language and symbols Joyce uses are beautiful. He is a master and an artist of words which is what makes this book worth reading."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Confusion. This novel is for those of educated minds. Stream-of-conscious runs through this book and only stops as you stop to re-read each page to find out what happened. The book runs free from subject to subject, all seen through the mind of Stephen Dedalus. His imagination runs freely throughout the book and it is sometimes hard to pick up whether what your reading is reality or just a thought process. Symbolism. Every word, sentence, and page is key to understanding this novel. If your focus wanders away for one paragraph, you lose, game over and go back to the beginning to start reading again. The thick symbolism makes it hard to read, but Joyce is able to capture many feelings through the symbolism of birds.I couldn't get into this book. Every time the book was about to pull me in, a sudden change of pace would leave me scratching my head. This novel seemed to drag me nowhere, granted it is a classic, my classic eyes, nose, and ears say \\"no\\" to this book.This is a well-written novel told about a young boy's life as he grows up. You learn side by side as this young boy, Stephen Dedalus, learns of life. You see things as he sees them, experience things as he experiences them, and feel as he feels. Whether it's fear, loneliness, pride or remorse, the feelings are lived as Stephen's imagination and life intertwine themselves together through each page.This is a great novel if you have a Joyce-code-reader that helps you understand the Irish slang, Latin and symbolism. Irish slang dots this book, Latin develops it, and symbolism flies through it. This plot-less book is very hard to understand, which conveys Stephen's attitude toward life. He, a young man, is very confused in life. There are five stages in which Stephen goes through in this novel. He goes through school homesick, and looking for an identity other than his father's. Joyce depicts the family through debate at the dinner table, showing the strong political views of Stephen's father. Stephen also finds himself in a growing situation at school. After being wrongly beaten by the prefect of studies, Stephen decides to go and tell the rector on him. Fear mounts as he enters the hall across from the rector's room, but joy comes as he excitedly runs to tell his friends what happened. As he continues to experiment with life as he finds himself wading through sin. He struggles with the lusts of the natural man, as he gets involved with the opposite sex. And then it hits him. A power sermon about death, judgment, heaven and hell chain his soul down as he wishes to escape the eternal torment that surrounds him. He wants his soul to be at peace. And so through a battle with his conscience he repents and frees himself from sin. He then devotes his life to religion and purity. Seeing his devotion to the priesthood, a Father offers him a vocation. However, he discovers another path to paint the picture of his life. He journeys away to find his freedom lies in being an artist.If you're going to read this book, put your code-decrypter nearby and get ready for a ride through the mind of Joyce."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Ulysses might be considered the masterpiece of this prose stylist to beat all stylists but Portrait though shorter has more story in it as its subject matter is the coming to consciousness of the young Stephen Dedalus from pre-verbal youth to highly verbal young thinking man. The early pages are fascinating as young Stephen learns his first words amid discussions of Irish politics. As Stephen matures he becomes more and more independent of his immediate and humble background as only the very highest thinkers are capable of engaging him(Aquinas being one in a line of important influences that he absorbs). The book is really Stephens search for the proper course for his life to take and by the last pages he has devised his intellectual strategy. The influences shape him but one can see they have served only to awaken what will no doubt be a very original mind. Joyce writes wonderful sentences and the experimentation and newness of the style still feels that way, it remains a great modern book,and it remains the greatest of the coming of age books. Ulysses has less story but each of the events of that one day are loaded to the hilt with stylistic homages to all the great literature that came before it, brilliant but it does leave one gasping for air. Great book but this ones smaller scope places it in a more accessible range for readers who might want to get used to Joyce in stages . There are a good many passages in this one that rival the ones in that bigger more lauded book. Portrait was the laboratory out of which came Ulysses, but it is a work that stands very well on its own and a very exciting work it is to anyone who cares about books and the investigation of life through words."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"&quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; is an autobiographical novel covering the first twenty or so years of James Joyce's life, and as the title implies, it is about his awakening to the desire to become an artist. Joyce writes in the third person as Stephen Dedalus, the oldest child in a large family with a father who is prosperous but unfocused at making a living.The novel begins with Stephen's earliest memories of his parents telling him silly stories as a baby. Then the narration cuts quickly to his years at a Jesuit boarding school where he finds that he is extraordinarily conscientious and sensitive to his tangible surroundings: colors, objects, and words. The priests who teach at the school are rigid taskmasters and disciplinarians, and Joyce vividly depicts the (undeserved) punishment Stephen must endure when he is caught idle at his lessons.The rigorous religious atmosphere of the Jesuit schools is stifling to Stephen's developing aesthetic sensibilities. At the day school where he spends his early teenage years, the priests fill the students' heads with terrifying (and ridiculous) visions of hell, and Stephen endeavors to become more devout, dispel impure thoughts, and save himself from an eternity of torment in a lake of fire.Stephen's religious devotion impresses the priests at his school so much that they recommend he consider joining the order. He consents to this idea at first, but one day he has an epiphany: watching birds in the sky, he realizes an incredible freedom that is available to him -- a freedom of creation, invention, symbolized by his namesake in Greek mythology. He skips the priesthood and attends a university where he becomes an intellectual, pontificating on the meaning of art and beauty and writing sorrowful poetry about a girl who is the object of his desire.Contrary to the reputation that &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Finnegan's Wake&quot; have, &quot;A Portrait...&quot; is really not difficult to read, nor is it without humor. The narration is straightforward, and it presents the process of becoming a self-aware artist with surprising clarity, poignancy, and realism."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"\\"A Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" is James Joyce's magnificent and now classic evocation of a Catholic boyhood in Ireland. The book is written in a peculiar style, which can make it difficult for self-confessed 'skim-readers' like myself! However, this style also makes it intruguing. The style is, in fact, brilliant when it is examined carefully, detailed, structured and readable. The struggle through sin and sanctity towards self-expression is the book's major themes, making a timeless classic to be enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A portrait of the artist.. is predominantly an auto-biographical tale of Joyce's own artistic development and sensibilities. The very poor reviews this book has received recently, are quite awful, and unsubstantiated. To say Joyce is unreadable, untenable, and desultory, is to miss the entire 20th century and modernistic importance of Joyce. The previous reviewer criticised Ulysses' change of narrative: isn't that one of the great things about the book, the revolutionary technique, and multiple viewpoint?"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce is one of the very few writers (John Steinbeck is another) who realizes what can be accomplished with the act of writing and achieves it. Certainly, some people may be lacking interest in this book, but the reason it is such a classic is because it pulls off things most books never even try to do. The simplest of events are described exactly as Joyce sees them, and he does not try to make them &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;exciting&quot;. He sees things for what they are and presents them without total honesty. Reading &quot;Portrait&quot; is like reading a picture, with every detail brought to light. Those who find it boring should not blame their blindess on what they cannot see."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This is a very entertaining book and not difficult to read. Most book lovers will love the book. In my review below I do not give away the plot. That is left for the reader to discover.I read \\"Dubliners\\" and then read the present 250 page book as a warm up to ease into \\"Ulysses.\\" This is a better book than \\"Dubliners\\" and we see the genius of Joyce without being intimidated - as the reader can be with \\"Ulysses.\\" As a side note, the protagonist Stephen Dedalus has the same name and is similar to one of the three main characters in \\"Ulysses.\\"If you are looking for a lot of analysis this is probably not the only book to buy. This Signet version contains the story plus Langdon Hammer's 18 page introduction. I avoided reading that first, because it seems to give away most of the key parts, or at least enough that one does not want to read it until later. Overall, I loved the book and thought the analysis was good but short.The book starts with Joyce recalling a few childhood memories, and it will probably stir some memories in the reader as well. He has very colourful descriptions of his parents, relatives, and his teachers, especially various Irish Catholic priests.Is Joyce a genius or just crazy? He seems to have a bit of the crazy streak in him, and perhaps that why the novel is so creative. The prose and writing is among the most impressive that most will ever see. The book contains beautiful descriptions of his childhood, then Catholic schools, and then his college days. The prose and vocabulary is Joyce's own. It is laced with Irish expressions and phrases - not the lengthy descriptive phrases of a Hemingway, but dense, and expressive, sometimes quickly changing as we read. Sometimes it is long and rambling as he describes a scene beside the ocean or brings us into one of his dreams. It is a wonderful experience, and I found myself being thankful that I had decided to read this Joyce novel. It is probably in the top 10 for writing and creativity, weak on structure.People looking for a story and structure will be annoyed as was the person who rejected the first publishing. It is a superb mixture of memories, dreams, and fiction, all blended together.Joyce provides no narration; he writes as if we are watching a movie, mostly going forward in time but not always. The reader is left to sort out the time and place or if it is real or just a dream as we travel from scene to scene through the book. As noted in the analysis, Joyce is in direct contact with the reader. There is nobody in between to guide the reader and explain what it means. You determine that from the dialogue. In any case, we follow him from a young school lad to his college days. We learn of his struggle to whether embrace the Catholic Church and be a priest, or whether to take another path.This is superb writing, and one appreciates why Joyce is famous. As a novel it is a bit lacking but few will notice any flaws."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The narrative point of view of this book was very innovative for its day. Its not a traditional driving narrative where the author weaves together elements of a plot that leads the characters to a telling conclusion. The point of view is interior to the main character, but in the third person not the first, and the language changes as the character changes.The narrative follows the growing up and coming to age of Stephen Dedalus from his earliest memories. It shifts from exterior events to interior reflections and fades in a disconnected way into dream events. Some of the exterior events are quite striking and memorable, such as Stephen getting whipped for something he did not do, the bird-girl on the shore, and a long priestly harangue about going to hell. Many signs along the way acquire a mythic or symbolic significance. There are frequent references to birds and flying, which signify Stephen's growing intention to leave Ireland.The heart of the book is the story about a struggle against authority. The ability to rebel against dire warnings of everlasting punishment from disobeying a religious order requires considerable strength of mind from a lone individual. It requires inner resources, a constant source of solace that gives one an unwavering resolve. Stephen experiences the travails of youth, the giving into lust and subsequent shame, and then turning to the Church. He realizes that by becoming a priest all his material cares would be taken care of and the Church would allay his security anxieties. But his artistic temperament is awakened, most notably in the epiphany of seeing the girl on the shore; and he knows that he cannot endure the kind of sick drudgery that he would feel in the labors of renunciation of his self. Instead of having others chart his course, he awakens to the freedom of charting his own course."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Those of us, Irish or otherwise, today lack the ability to hear English as spoken a hundred years and a bit more in Dublin by--here at least mostly--the educated classes of the time. Joyce's musical and allusive prose, difficult for many newcomers to his books, is perfect to be listened to when read aloud with intelligence and sensitivity--and a bit of needed humor especially to counter its protagonist's Thomistic cogitations and mental or spiritual convolutions. Now, this panoply of inner and outer voices can be imitated in part, thanks to one man's many tones.I've been uploading this collection from the CDs to make audio files, and it sounds great. Snips of period music or a bit of ambiance often begin the episodes, headed on the CD by general phrases related to the contents of the sub-sections of the five book chapters. The box comes with a bit of introductory material, although on the discs themselves no supplemental explanations are included. I have heard Jim Norton read Counterparts for the Caedmon tapes of Dubliners, and Norton's own Naxos tapes of the same. (His later effort, a full Ulysses, is a bit beyond my budget, but in an abridged form of 4 CDs it, and another 4 of Finnegans Wake, also are read by Norton for Naxos.)He does not sound always that 'Irish' as the theatrical stereotypes would render voices; rather, a register of British and various upper and middle classes of Irish voices must be conveyed, no easy task for one man before not an audience or camera but only a microphone. Banter, philosophizing, boasting, sermons, and jokes: much needs dramatization. The cast of characters, more male than female given the nature of the story Joyce tells, allow for as much animation as can be granted by the limits of the rather earnest, dour, and/or intellectual ruminations that for large portions of this novel replace more conventional notions or action, plot, or suspense. But, such was the task Joyce took on, and Norton remains faithful to it as well as any actor interpreting such difficult prose can do, a century apart from its author. It's no fault of Norton if once in a while the burdens of expressing the moods of such a challenging character as Dedalus seem to overwhelm the listener-- this may be Joyce's intent on the page, to mimic how the mind of Dedalus and his soul are entangled.A good refresher, or a fine appetizer, that enriches your tackling the text with renewed vigor. It's not an easy read. On the page, lassitude can set in for many contemporary readers, but when heard, Norton's variety of pacings and emotions makes dramatic and sympathetic many of the more priggish postures taken on by the young Stephen Dedalus."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"&quot;A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man&quot; is many things. Perhaps most importantly it is a bridge work - it spans the divide between more accessible (but brilliant) work found in his collection of short stories, &quot;Dubliners&quot; and the less accessible (and that's a clear understatement for Finnegan's Wake!) but superlative work of his later years. To some extent, then, we expect some patchiness as Joyce is finding his feet here.Another aspect to the novel is that it is largely autobiographical covering Joyce's time at two Jesuit colleges and Dublin University. Much of the factual substance has been removed - it's an autobiography focussing on state of mind, brief glimpses into his world as his father's fortunes diminish. His heavily Catholic upbringing - high on guilt and corporal punishment - laying the seeds for an eventual rejection of faith altogether. His extreme emotions concerning a girl that he just meets briefly a few times.The book is also a sounding board for Joyce's philosophical views on beauty and aesthetics. Long &quot;conversations&quot; fill the pages with discussions on Aristotle, etc. and witty literary jokes. Most of this is, to put it politely, utter tedium I'm afraid. Pretension at it's worst. There are writers who can introduce such philosophical rants in their works and bring it off (Dostoyevsky for instance) but here Joyce fails to keep any semblence of pacing, or even beauty, in the words.Another example of this excess can be found in the description of a retreat that he goes to towards the end of his years in Jesuit school. Now this retreat is a pivotal moment in the book and gives rise to the most beautiful writing - a stunning description of the cathartic nature of Catholic confession - so it is worthy that it is treated in some detail. Unfortunately, what we get is pages and pages of two entire sermons on the physical and emotional nature of hell. Accurately distilled this could be moving, riveting and thought-provoking. As it is it's mind-numbing.Yet the book is still very beautiful. It deserves to be read and it deserves to be read slowly. Joyce, at his best, is one of the most lyrical, poetic authors ever to have molded the written language. So, read it - but be prepared to have to force yourself through a couple of sections."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The book is a blueprint for constructing a spiritual life. Read the &quot;baby talk&quot; of the first 2 pages several times and keep it in your mind throughout because everything to come links back to it in some way. It starts off free and simple and gets muddled: he hears a story about a moocow, sings his little song in his own way, becomes preoccupied with the sensual, falls in love with a little Protestant girl and is hauntingly scolded for it. His job is to get beyond the muddle (sexual desire versus the moral dictates of the Catholic church; personal revolt verses communal revolt in the form of the Irish cause) and back to the simple joy of the song.The book is divided in 2 halves: the physical life - THE HELLFIRE SERMON - the spiritual life. But it is also a circle: the song, the road away from and back to the song, and in the end, the singer, determined again to sing in his own way.The sermon, along with Samuel Beckett's Watt, is the funniest thing I've ever read and the scene with the dark-haired girl on the beach is the most beautiful."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The first thing I'll say is that I am so happy this book is written in coherent English for the most part (there's an abundance of Latin as well). With 'Ulysses' and 'Finnegan's Wake,' man, have you ever got to work to make sense out of what you're reading! I don't mind the work, but it's hard going and takes much time- time that I don't have right now. So, until that day when I do have time, I'll have to content myself with 'Portrait...' I don't know about most readers, but Joyce's semi-autobiographical novel reminded me of 'Of Human Bondage' in many ways. You know, guy comes from religious background; he's shy, broody, and inclined to a love of words; there are 'moments' when he begins to appreciate the aesthetic; there's talk of hell and the protagonist worrying about being a sinner if he falls away from the church...and so on. So if anyone out there found 'Portrait' difficult, try 'Of Human Bondage'....ya might find that it's your cup of tea. To abuse a word, for me, 'Portrait...' is a book of 'moments'. There are scenes that are brilliant, almost magical; and then there are scenes that border on the pretentious. Overall, it is worth reading, because these moments are worth the fodder you have to read through to get to them."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This is the semi-autobiographical coming of age story of Stephen Dedalus. I read it about 10 years ago when I was an undergraduate and found it fairly hard to get through, so I thought I'd give it another go. On my second reading I found I was able to relate far more closely with the protagonist and appreciate the quality of Joyce's prose. The story, which is told mainly in the third person, recounts several stages of Stephen's youth. The beginning of the book is written in almost childlike prose as it depicts Stephen's experiences as a schoolchild at a Catholic boarding school. I was able to relate to Joyce's depiction of a very precocious yet sensitive young boy, full of childlike curiosity and terrified of the harsh discipline meted out by the priests. The latter part of this chapter also contains an interesting discussion between Stephen's father and his colleagues about Parnell and Irish politics. Not being an expert on Irish history, I couldn't follow this debate as intelligently as many readers will be able to, yet through it Joyce depicted the sharp political cleavages dividing Ireland at the time.The next two chapters follow Stephen at a Catholic high school. He has become increasingly alienated from society and emotionally withdrawn. He also begins visiting prostitutes, which leaves him feeling disgusted with his sinful nature. Perhaps the most amazing part of the book is in chapter three, which details Stephen's religious conversion and subsequent renunciation of his faith. This chapter contains a sermon on the torments of hell which terrorizes Stephen and leads to his initial spiritual immersion. This sermon carries on for about 15 pages and is given in the most lurid, evocative prose that one can imagine. The sermon is explicitly designed to terrorize young minds and lead them to renounce their sinful ways. It really resonated with me, as I myself grew up in a conservative church where I was reminded every Sunday of the unimaginable horrors that awaited me if I did not turn my back on the sinful world. While Stephen, shaken with guilt and terror after this sermon, initially tries to immerse himself in the rites of the church, he continues to be assailed by doubts and skepticism, which ultimately lead him to renounce his faith. Joyce vividly describes the joy and freedom that Stephen feels upon freeing himself from the reins of religious doctrine and proclaiming his independence from all such confining systems of thought.The last part of the book shows Stephen as a university student. There were parts of this chapter that were hard for me to relate to. First, there is about a ten page section in which Stephen elaborates to a friend his theory of aesthetics. Art scholars and philosophers might find this fascinating, but it was somewhat hard for me to follow. There is also a very peripheral romantic interest that is never fully fleshed out. Joyce's ultimate aim here, though, was to depict Stephen as a highly independent young man. Stephen refuses to lend his support to the various faddish social and political movements of the day, whether it be Marxism or Irish nationalism. In the end, Stephen makes the decision to leave Ireland, finding that his artistic aspirations will never be fulfilled if he stays.Overall, this book clearly deserves its reputation as one of the best works of literature in the English language. Although several aspects of the story are hard to relate to for those who are either not Irish or experts on Irish history, there are also a number of universal themes that resonate more widely. First, this story can be read as a sort of free-thinker's manifesto. While it is admittedly hard at times to fully relate to Stephen (he is depicted as elitist and anti-social), many will be able to relate to his feelings of alienation and his independence of thought. Finally, one cannot properly review this work without noting Joyce's prose. Joyce reminds me of Nabokov in the sense that, although he is often longwinded, one can forgive him his longwindedness because it is simply a pleasure to read his beautiful prose. This is one of those books that contains passages that I will go back and read over and over again."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"It begins with \\"there was a moocow comin down the road\\" and ends with the famous declaration of the artist's intention,\\" to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race\\". Its language changes and develops in the course of the telling with the age of the hero and with the situations in which he finds himself. The development in language , the stylistic development externally marks out the internal development of the artist. Through exile, silence and cunning Joyce forged this work a bildungsroman story of his own artistic and spiritual development. It is the story of his rejection of family, of religion, of homeland to find himself in his one true home the vocation of writing of creation in literature in art. There is much memorable brilliance in the work many moving movements the child with the broken glasses before the cruel schoolmaster or the too proud young man denying his mother's religious last wish. All of this tells the story of the artificer Daedalaus and how he will move toward the making of a world of his own in literature.This book is often difficult to read ( Consider the lower world scene) is complicated in its style but it announces a new and private revelation the great artist's discovery and invention of his own vocation.Along with Dubliners and in a sense Ulysses, one of Joyce's readable masterpieces."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This is without a question the edition of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man to pick up. It goes without saying that it's not easy and it will require effort beyond just seeing the words on the page to understand, but it is a monumental work and anyone interested in reading Ulysses must start here.The most compelling reason to purchase this book over another edition is the thorough and expansive introduction. Joyce's prose takes a lot of things for granted; Irish history and Latin knowledge most notably. The introduction provides a summary of the former that is indispensible for reading any of Joyce's works, even back to Dubliners. Additionally, the introduction talks about Joyce's technique and does a good job of helping readers be aware of the writing behind the book.The endnotes are also extremely helpful, providing translations of Latin fragments, historical reference points, Catholic practices, and Irish locations. While it might be thought obtrusive to have to turn to the end of the book often (sometimes there can be nearly 10 notes on one page) the greater picture the notes assist in building helps the reader immensely in locating the book historically and culturally."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book is an interesting book about Stephen's life in college and how he had to overcome obstacles of family problems and his religious belief of God. It tells how he struggles with life in the real world. The style writing of the book was easy to read, but some of the vocabulary words were hard to understand. I liked the book because it tells about Stephen's life in college and so on. I liked the part where he stood up to the rector and told him that it was wrong for Father Dolan to punish him. I liked the part when Stephen went to the university because it was the part where he really started to mature and felt comfortable with his new friends. He felt free to write in his journal about events that happened in his life. The book was interesting talking about God (Jesus) and what happens to sinful people. The bad part of the book is when Stephen sinful for sleeping with the prostitute. He shouldn't have slept with her because there are consequences to his actions.I would recommend this book to teenagers and adults because this book is hard to understand for younger children. I would recommend this book to college students because the book starts in college and goes on."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Joyce enriches your literary space like nothing else... This edition is pretty handy and inexpensive, and has some nifty notes at the end to put you in context of a million little things that you might miss otherwise. Analysing the stature of this literary classic is probably an exercise in redundancy, so no attepts at that. So go ahead, pick it up and explore Joyce for yourself! Happy Reading.."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"John Lynch does a beautiful job bringing a new outlook to Joyce's work. One thing about reading Joyce is that you are drawn into his inner world of consciousness that you tend to become desensitized to the raging outside world. This happens with the Christmas dinner fiasco. One becomes so centered on how Stephen is interpreting this incident, the calamity at the dinner becomes distant. This is also true of the fire and brimstone sermon and the beautiful confession afterwards. Lynch wakes us up!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Most everyone who takes their literature seriously (most, mind you) will agree that this is a cornerstone to all that is metaphoric, lyrical and insanely intelligent.? Without giving away the plot, etc., I can simply encourage you to wade through the beginning 25 pages or so and then observe Joyce's development as a promising poet and literary architect. There is much skepticism about whether or not the entire account is accurate, but who the heck cares?- or for that matter, who could recollect their entire youth with such vivid detail? This book is well-worth your time to read regardless of your religious affiliation (Joyce was raised an Irish-Roman Catholic) and I would dissuade anyone who might question the book's integrity due to the time and place in which the story occurs- because, as you'll realize, the heart of the content lies in the protagonist's conscious mind."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce had a life worthy of study and it is parlayed in this novel with passion and art combined, in equal measure. It drives down the path of a young man's struggle to find truth in religeon, which does not excist beyond metaphorical reasoning. When the protagonist realises this, he defrocks his faith in christianity and searches for answers else where. It is difficult for the reader in our era to understand the pressures that must have been placed on a young man growing up in a catholic shcool and to dissolve his interest in religeon, but it shows the strength that Joyce had for his convictions and desires. A brilliant read telling a story with an amalgam of fiction and non-it truely is delivered in a wonderful and original fashion. For any reader who is not affraid to question life and whom enjoys the greatest writer of prose of all time."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"That Joyce quote from Portrait sums up not only my philosophy, but that of Steven Dedalus, Joyce's enigmatic protagonist as well. We see Steven through the eyes of the 3rd person narrator in this provocative, semi-autobiographical coming of age tale set in Ireland.Joyce delves deep into many of life's questions that we all wonder about, mostly subconsciously. It is an allegorical tale of art and morality and a choice to be made between the two. Steven's strict Catholic school is the focus early on as Steven is faced with temptations and faces the aftermath of his transgressions. Steven then moves on to the university and evolves into an adult. At this point I became enthralled with the depth of the prose and finally bought into why this book came so highly acclaimed. The drunken conversations among Steven and Cranly & his college buds stimulates the mind as they delve deep into God's existence and how to achieve the greatest possible happiness for the greatest possible number of people. Don't be discouraged by a slow start - Joyce packs his most potent punch in Chapter 3 and on. Cheers."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, by James Joyce is the story of a young man struggling to grow up and rise above the political, religious, and patriotic cords that bind him down. The book begins with Stephen reflecting on his childhood until he grows up to be a man with his own views. The story takes place in Ireland when there was much confusion in religion and politics. Stephen Dedalus was raised in a very patriotic home, which was also devoutly Catholic. Stephen, however, struggles with the strong views of his family and church. He doesn't quite know if he agrees with everyone around him. Throughout his life Stephen and his family have to move to different houses because of financial problems. This also causes Stephen to have to change schools, and become involved with different types of people. While he is changing schools externally, internally he is also changing; he is becoming a young man with ideas uniquely his own. Growing up is a great challenge for Stephen, he is thrown into many different situations and has people all around him trying to tell him what to think, and what to do with his life. He goes from having his first unexpected sexual relationship to feeling the awful guilt of his sins. Then he goes from wanting to become a priest to realizing that all he wants to do is get out of Ireland, and become his own expressive, unique self through art. He is not close minded to what people tell him, but he doesn't agree with what they tell him and he doesn't feel that it is for him. There is great symbolism and imagery in this book. There is a current theme of water and of birds. It is as if Stephan admires the birds, but they are also those in which \\"pull out his eyes \\". They pull out his eyes because he wants so badly to be a bird and fly away, but can't because too many things are preventing him from flying away. Stephen wants to rise above the water and the filth of his life, this water and filth can be considered the church and political issues that occupy his and his family's lives. He wants to become like Dedalus and build himself wings to fly away; in the end of the book he does fly away, and a new life awaits him."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce is a hero. Writing with a exceptionally unique style that fits the corresponding drama perfectly, he is able to involve several underlying themes that help advance the meaning of the book. The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is rich in detail and offers vital insights into Joyce?s art of portraying the internal struggles that all of us face within the drama of a single character, Stephen Dedalus. Perhaps the most salient brilliance of Joyce?s ability is painting the picture of simbolism and theme to allow the reader to internalize everything he reads.The book opens in a rather ambiguous way. Jumbled phrases across the opening pages provoke images of confusion and disorder in the reader?s mind. Joyce masters the Stream of Consciousness style of writing, which reflects the spontaeous thought process that all of us experience. It is especially notable at the beginning when he describes the unfocused thoughts of the baby Stephen. With a light touch of humor Joyce reminds us how simple life was for all of us back then when all we had to worry about was the discomfort of ?wetting the bed?(Portrait 1).The reader then re-lives his life as he joins in with Stephen?s. We are first exposed to the unjust treatment from others when the bully Wells shoves Stephen into the nearby cesspool. The imagery is more than intense here when he comes out of the pool grimy, disgusting, and smelling like a sewer. Joyce even pencils in the detail about rats wallowing around in the pool. The theme of unjustice continues as Stephen is punished publicly for losing his glasses, something that he had no control over. The Catholic Father Dolan flogs him across the hands for ?intentionally? losing them so he wouldn?t have to study.Another interesting piece of information that James Joyce includes for the benefit of the reader putting himself in the place of Stephen is the theme of physical beauty. Stephen experiences love all throughout the piece, starting first with the innocent love notes that he writes to a small girl his age, building to the prostitute with whom he has his first sexual experience, and culminating finally with the woman on the beach who he is infatuated with. This sexual passion arouses sympathetic feelings within the reader from all backgrounds. Everyone has experienced that true feeling of wanting to be with someone else.My favorite part in the story is how Joyce deals with the issue of remaining true to religion, particularly the Catholic Church. Stephen is troubled by the fact that there is so much corruption within the church. He sees the imperfections within the church, but yet he somehow continues. Other characters present Joyce with the opportunity to let us look deep into the heart of Stephen and examine how he struggles. Much of Joyce?s audience has struggled with the decision of remaining true to the Catholic Church in spite of its many corruptions, or pioneering a new generation of religious loyalty elsewhere.Towards the end of the novel Joyce touches on a reoccuring theme: freedom. Being free from religion as well as being free from Ireland (or the restraints that bound some individual). Again Joyce delicately works his way into the lives of his readers; all are faced with decisions of leaving their past lives, whether they be entrapped in the pits of smoking or the despair of being overweight, all of the readers of Jame Joyce are faced with that decision sooner or later. Stephen sees his escape from the island with drawing back to strength from the Greek artisan Dedalus, who crafted his own wings to escape. It seems that all of us somehow need to draw on strength from the past to give us motivation for the future. Many rely on examples from their parents. Others trust in counsel and advice given through the scriptures. All are in search of help from the past to live a better future.All in all, Joyce masters his work and is able to assist the reader in making his own decisions in his own life while doing it through the life of his central character. If I were anything but American, I might consider moving to Ireland."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book is definately not for everyone. The entire book is like a stream of thoughts invoked when one looks at a self portrait of one's youth. Maybe that's what Joyce was trying to accomplish. The book gets interesting as the chapters progress, intially it is a little hard to grasp. For me it required slow reading and in some cases rereading and excessive stretching of hands towards the dictionary to fully comprehend and enjoy the novel. The novel does not fall under the gambit of light reading, a consistent effort is required on behalf of the reader to continue reading the novel, in order to grasp the artistic spell that the author is trying to invoke on the reader.Do not expect a story, as such there is no story in the novel. The gist of it is the coming of age of the author but it was written in a way to revolutionize the way novels were written and read. It is much more profound, acute and slower than what most reviews purport it to be, which unfortunately means that for the average reader the book could be very boring."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is a semi-autobiographical story of Stephen Daedelus as he grows from a young child to a young adult. Virtually every word Joyce uses is deliberate. The novel is not one that a person can read and understand without completely focusing on what Joyce is saying.Joyce uniquely uses language to portray the young Daedelus as he grows and matures. The language is very simple in the beginning, following a stream of consciousness format that portrays Stephen's young age and undeveloped thought process. As he grows in all aspects of his being - physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and mental - the language reflects his growing complexity. Joyce also uses language to show the changes in Stephen's relationships with others - especially his family - that result from his growth. Throughout the novel, Stephen goes through various periods and levels of alienation. During his early years in boarding school, Stephen feels distant from the other boys and counts the days until he can return home. However, after a heated discussion over Christmas dinner with his family, he feels as though they are somewhat remote. He cannot figure out which adult to side with over the political issues concerning the Catholic Church and the Irish State. Thus, his young mind experiences its first feelings of alienation from his family. These feelings mark the first instance of a desire to break from traditional viewpoints, and the point at which the language begins to change.Gradually, this emotional separation becomes more pronounced as he starts to notice his father's imperfections, such as his excessive spending habits and the tasteless company he chooses to keep. By looking down on his father's actions, Stephen widens the distance between himself and his father. Thus, he loses his childhood naivet&eacute; and sees his father as an imperfect human being. Joyce reflects this change in the language by replacing childish phrases with more experienced reflections.As the novel progresses, the language Joyce uses becomes even more complex in structure and content. This illustrates Stephen's progression as his ideas and views of life become more his own. As Stephen's family sinks into the slums materially and socially because of his father's excessive spending, Stephen develops the courage to break away from them and stand independent with his own ideals and views.His emotional separation from his family finally leads to his physical separation from the familial and social environment he was raised in. He embarks from Ireland, leaving everything he opposes: his family, the Catholic Church, Irish Patriotism, and his old self. The language of the novel follows Stephen's internal progression as he moves from simplistic and undefined views, to his eloquent and personal theories about art and life. It is at this point of resolution that Joyce shifts his language from a distant point of view to the first person narration of journal entries - only after Stephen finds his own independent voice."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"stephen dedalus must be the most boring artist in the whole world"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"In my view this story suffers from being an entirely introspective view of the adolescence of Stephen Dedalus, a rather unattractive young man who seldom does anything. He is the only person we really learn about; the other characters only exist in their relation to him.Even so, I found the first part, recounting his life as a boarder in a Catholic school in late nineteenth century Ireland was quite interesting. There was movement in the story. It is this part that won the third star. But about the middle there was a long account of Hell as preached to the boys. I grant that it was important in Stephen's religious development, but its very length completely halted the flow of the story, and it never really recovered. The only good part in the remainder of the story was the discussion towards the end with his friend Cranly about his abandonment of his faith."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"It's not an easy read, I will concede that point very easily. However, none of the great novels seem to be EASY reads. My edition is very small and has huge black out pages full of print, and the lack of straightforwardness in the language, story, and prose, was headache inducing (I'd often reread sentences, even whole paragraphs to understand what was being said). Yet I think Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is probably the BEST book I've EVER read. No one, not even Dostoevsky or Conrad, are on the level of James Joyce, he's just in a league all his own. There's so much DEPTH in Joyce's prose, there's so much weight in even a single sentence, I mean this book is HEAVY. This novel will make others seem paper-thin, and other authors seem slack. I'm reading Toni Morrison now, and while she's not bad for a contemporary author, she's not even close to Joyce.Portrait is a masterpiece, and probably one of the best books ever written. I wouldn't be surprised to see Portrait place in the top five of books ever in any list now. Not easy but worth every ounce of effort you put into it.Sayonara"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I liked it; I really liked it! Who knew? I've neglected reading this book for years and years because Joyce's Ulysses took me all one summer to read and I didn't care to devote that much of my life to another book. Then I read Dubliners just lately, and I enjoyed it. So I decided to take it a step further and read this one, and I am so glad I did.Portrait of an Artist seems to bridge the gap between the relatively realistic narration of Dubliners and the language experimentation and symbolism of Ulysses. It tells the story of Stephen Dedalus from his youth through his adolescence and young adulthood. His is a typical progression: thoughtless adherence to his parents' beliefs, to rebellion against those beliefs with the accompanying guilt, to attempts to find his own beliefs and philosophy of life through intellectual examinations of the beliefs of others, to self-realization and the formation of his own life philosophy. It is a journey we all must make, and it is one often seen in literature. But Joyce conveys the evolution better than anyone.For one thing, the complexity of language increases as Dedalus progresses through life. The first section perfectly reflects the primacy of physical sensations and the disjointed and selective thoughts of a child. The language of the section portraying Dedalus as a teenager communicates his sexual awakening and his deep sense of guilt and defilement.The very words used arouse feelings of disgust. The language in the section of his university days is pretentious, and the characters often speak in Latin and cite quotes from various distinguished models as they search for their own identities. The language in the last section is the first instance of direct discourse from Dedalus, as he arrives at an adult determination. And it returns to the much less complex language of his childhood. All that is to say that the language of this book conveys the story more even than the narration of events. What an accomplishment!A section in the middle of the book, after Dedalus has \\"sinned\\" and before his university days, features the sermons of a priest on hell and its various torments. This section is so descriptively written that one does not wonder that Dedalus, as he hears it, turns from his \\"sinful\\" ways. Preachers everywhere should memorize and declaim this section--it would bring people to repentance in droves. (I'm being facetious here, but the sermon is most impressive.)It's the masterful use of language, and not the story, which makes this novel great. I might even try Finnegans Wake some day."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This is a challenging read, but great to read these classic authors.

But I couldn't fight the fact that I just didn't enjoy it all that much. As Joyce's semi-autobiographical protagonist (Stephen Dedalus) matures throughout the novel, and the narrator's voice matures with him, the story became more interesting for me, and so its final events and dialogue were what I liked best. But as a young Dedalus observes family members argue about religion and then ponders religion for himself ad nauseum, I was bored. His arguments and exploration of poets and literary devices were entertaining, as was his consideration of and desire for women, but that's about all I got out of this book."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The last time I taught the Portrait I used Oxford's excellent 2000 edition. In 2008 this was reissued with a new Standard Book Number, but so far I've found no changes in the text. The bibliography hasn't been updated, for instance, and the typo on p. 134 of the 2000 printing (where the sentence \\"Once a priest always a priest\\" comes out \\"Once a priest ways a priest\\") is still there in 2008.But there is a change in the cover design. In 2000 this included part of Gino Severini's \\"Self-Portrait,\\" but in 2008 the picture has been cut further back and it's now misidentified as \\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\"This edition is still excellent, but if you have a chance to buy the 2000 printing there's no point in spending more on the 2008 printing."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"First read in college I admired Joyce very much. poetic prose brings to life the surroundings of the characters.

It's pretty difficult to review a book in which nothing takes place. This book lacks... well, just about everything. It lacks half a sentence of substance. Nothing in the story is connected; I read the book and wondered, \\"What is this about? What was the story?\\" Actually, I have a confession to make: I didn't actually read the book in its entirety; I read the first half and was so disgusted by it that I had to read the summaries for the rest of the chapters online. It is that bad.Normally I listen to other people's opinions but I am making it a fact in my mind that this book is the worst book I have ever read. If you disagree, you are wrong. That is how terrible this book was. It was a complete waste of my money. It was required reading for school. I always read the books regardless of whether I like them or not, only reading summaries after finishing to make sure I understood the whole story. This is the first book I have ever relied on reviews to finish. My teacher worhips this book but there is nothing good about it. If anybody can explain to me what this book is about in a way that makes sense, I will give them ten dollars.So far, everyone in my school has failed to explain it to me.

It was chosen for me but as a had to read it was interesting read. Not my thing."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"\\"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man\\" tells the story of Stephen Dedalus, and is heavily based on Joyce's own life. It was first published in 1916, and is a rewritten version of \\"Stephen Hero\\" - which Joyce gave up on in 1905.His schooldays were dominated by the Jesuits, having been taught by then in two schools - a single year at Clongowes Wood College, before moving on to Belvedere. Stephen boarded at Clongowes, and it proved a difficult time for him - having previously been educated at home, he dreams of the holidays and has some difficulty in relating to his classmates. The school appears to cater for the well-heeled, and Stephen's departure was (more than likely) caused by a downturn in fortune at home.However, Stephen enjoys a lengthy summer holiday on leaving Clongowes - come the new school year his new school still hasn't been found. (His parents feel Belvedere was worth the wait - a Jesuit education is seen as something 'refined', much more 'respectable' than the sort provided by the Christian Brothers). He spends much of his free time during that summer with his Great Uncle Charles, training with his athletics coach, Mike Flynn, and having adventures with kids his own age. However, in time, his summer friendships fall victim to their homework-filled evenings, Mike Flynn goes into hospital and the family move away from Blackrock. Worse, Charles - who is late in years - becomes a little disorientated and confused. These changes in Stephen's life throw up a range of emotions - anger, dissatisfaction, and a sense of isolation. He then chooses to cultivate a sense of detachment and takes to sitting on edge of things, taking some strange pleasure in \\"the joy of his loneliness.\\"Stephen's faith is something he has difficulty with throughout his teenage years, as he lurches from one extreme to the other. An unquestioning believer in his younger days, he was genuinely shocked when it's suggested that some of his schoolmates at Clongowes had swiped some altar wine. He later loses his way, and spends a great deal of time visiting ladies of negotiable affection - before being ambushed by his conscience and positively terrified by a school retreat at Belvedere. He throws himself whole-heartedly into his repentance...but there is only so much you can cope with when you take things to the extreme.The choice of Dedalus as a surname is something that appears to be widely commented on. Dedalus is probably best known from Greek mythology as being the father of Icarus, the boy who flew too close to the sun. However, Dedalus was also an architect and inventor who became trapped in a labyrinth he had created himself. Stephen may see a life abroad as a pair of wings, but I would see Stephen's teenage years as the labyrinth he created himself. His refusal to relate to others and form friendships throughout his school years was a conscious choice - one that he made himself, and which made a huge contribution to the difficulties he faced later. His self-imposed isolation had little to do with either his academic abilities, the struggles with his faith, politics or bigotry - to me, it seemed more to do with the belief that he was better than those around him. Cranly, a classmate at university, was the first - and quite possibly only - friend he made. While Dedalus may well have been something of a genius, Cranly had a great deal more in terms of heart and wisdom. At one point, a colleague at university comments \\"You're a born sneerer, Stevie\\". Pretentious and self-centred could well have been added."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Several years ago a movie came out called \\"Being John Malkovich.\\" I didn't see the movie, but the title was always intriguing to me. Essentially, this book is as close as one could come to \\"being\\" James Joyce as a young man.As other reviewers have noted, the book starts slowly. I did not find the storyline to be particularly compelling, but the revolutionary \\"stream of consciousness\\" style introduced by Joyce to the literary world in this book was quite compelling. While I could not call this book a \\"page turner,\\" make no mistake: it is well worth the effort to persevere to the end. There is a reason why some books are considered \\"literature.\\" This is one of them.My Viking Press edition contained no notes or explanations...just the simple, unadorned manuscript without someone's notes telling me what I should extract from the book, what I should think, why it was great literature, etc. Nothing to \\"coach\\" me in a particular direction. Now that I have finished reading it, I would enjoy exposing myself to notes and essays on this work, to compare my own impressions with those of others.The plot of the book is simple enough: a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age story featuring Stephen Daedelus, Joyce's alter ego - hence, the title of the book. We follow Daedelus through his formative years, first as the young son of a wealthy family sent off to boarding school, then as the adolescent whose family has fallen from political grace and is now struggling to make ends meet as young Stephen changes to another school that while different, is still as much about religious instruction (Catholicism) as about secular topics. Then, we find him in his mid-teens undergoing a stage in which he abandons himself to lust and then swings the pendulum to the other extreme by attempting something approaching mortal perfection in his religious devotion and briefly even considers entering the priesthood. At the close of the book we find Daedelus in college demonstrating his clearly formidable intellect as he ponders and debates subjects with his professors and peers such as the meaning of beauty and the responsibility of the artist. Ultimately, Daedelus gives us his conclusion on how he intends to live his life that is at once both profound and clich&eacute;: to express himself through his art (his writing) as freely and wholly as he can, even if it means being spurned by society and making mistakes. In today's vernacular, it would probably come out as something like, \\"I gotta be me.\\" But of course Joyce leads us to this conclusion not as some airhead MTV-generation pronouncement, but as the result of his coming-of-age experiences and his deep philosophical ponderings about the meaning of life, the role of religion, and his purpose on this earth.The stream-of-consciousness style pioneered by Joyce in this book is remarkable, both in its originality to the literary world, and in its ability to give us the events of the story not just through the eyes of Daedelus, but almost through his subconscious. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to read someone's thoughts, right down to the sometimes erratic ways in which one thought leads to another or the impressions that occur somewhat randomly, this is what Joyce delivers. In these pages, he delivers not what it would be like to observe James Joyce, but what it would be like to actually be James Joyce.The language throughout is beautiful, many times a form of prose poetry. Often described as a novella rather than a novel, the rather sparse page count is rather deceptive: this is a dense book and will take as long for most people to read as a book three times its length. One thing in my edition of the book that was unconventional was Joyce's refusal to use quotation marks to distinguish dialog. He set off dialog with elongated dashes at the beginning of dialog sentences instead. Occasionally, I had to read passages several times to understand who was speaking because Joyce depars entirely from the convention we are all used to.All in all, this is an excellent starting place for those new to Joyce such as myself, both because it gives insight into the author, and because it introduces the character Daedelus who apparently figures prominently in other books by Joyce such as \\"Ulysses.\\""},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I heard teachers say this book is a tougher read than Dubliners but I don't think so. Yes, some parts are a little slow but I like it a lot better than Dubliners. And with this edition, some of the footnotes are a bit distracting. But somehow, Joyce has a way of keeping you interested in how Stephen grows up. I read this as a HS senior so I related to Stephen's coming of age pretty well. Sure there were times when I wanted to slap him in the face for his attitude towards women and his occasional hypocrisy (spoiler alert: an example would include him getting mad at his dad for flirting with a barmaid even though he banged a prostitute). But like Stephen, I also struggled with religious issues and (to a lesser extent) broke away from my parents when I went to college. Joyce paints a portrait of Stephen, with warts and all, that gives the character a great deal of humanity. Stephen's humanity is what I like the most about this book."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"To understand Joyce, a reader must appreciate one overriding truth: James Joyce was a literary snob who wrote for fellow snobs. When one understands this, there is no disgrace in professing perplexity or even contempt for his works. Joyce wouldn't have cared: he would have returned smugness for perplexity and contempt for contempt. He was not a humble man, and his writing was as much an edifice to his own ego as it was an attempt to communicate anything important to his reader.This is not to say that reading him is a worthless exercise. \\"Portrait\\" is a brilliant book. But it is also an insufferably elitist and arrogant one. This book takes bold risks, and stretches the landscape of literature the way Shakespeare did in his day, pushing into the undiscovered country with heedless abandon. But unlike Shakespeare, Joyce makes no effort to keep the groundlings happy. If you can keep up with him, fine; if you can't, too bad. Your loss, not his.\\"Portrait\\" is a thinly veiled autobiography that uses a fictional alter ego to promote Joyce's literary philosophy and his larger artistic philosophy in general. This philosophy is derived from Nietzsche and the Romantics, and it posits the artistic impetus as a uniquely personal act. The artist has no obligation to make himself understood to the masses. He is not constrained by anything so crass as convention, literary or otherwise. He is the artistic Superman, defining his own rules, following his own path, creating his own literary world. His writing need only sustain himself, and if others derive any enjoyment or inspiration out of it, this a secondary benefit and not the primary purpose of the artistic impulse.The trouble is that Joyce holds on to enough convention and self-discipline that he makes \\"Portrait\\" understandable, and by very virtue of doing so, contradicts his own thesis. \\"Portrait\\", though hard, is by no means unreadable--that would come later with \\"Ulysses\\" and especially \\"Finnegan's Wake\\"--but in this work, he obviously doesn't mean what he says. Had he done so, this work would have contradicted itself; spun off into irrelevant side channels; vary in form and style from chapter to chapter and even sentence to sentence (exactly what he does in \\"Ulysses\\"). In short, \\"Portrait\\" is great and engaging precisely because Joyce sets aside the worst of his artistic excesses. This work is still firmly grounded in reality and fences experimentation within the bounds of conventional understanding. Joyce is obviously still interested in communicating with us.This is not a work for everybody. I found it fascinating, but this may be due to a masochistic disposition in me rather than anything inherently valuable in the book. I am torn in recommending it. Since I personally value clarity over obscurity no matter how ingenious the experiment may be, I found \\"Portrait\\" elitist, artificial and, yes, even mean-spirited. However, I did not find the obscurity so thick or so difficult that it prevented me from seeing the genius at work. And to see such genius at work is a rare and pungent experience.Try it for yourself. If after the first two-dozen pages you don't like it, you should feel no obligation to finish it. Joyce wrote for snobs, and those who don't account themselves elitists have a justifiable claim against it. But if you persevere, you may just find that it makes up for its drawbacks with some truly remarkable revelations. Personally, I found it both ingenious and inspiring."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Great art will never be popular and popular art will never be great. This is not an easy book to read. That is what makes it so great. I read it in high school and missed almost everything that was there. I recently reread it as a 48 year old and saw much more. I picked up a copy of an English professor's insights and was stunned by how much I had missed. Like most great writers Joyce was extremely subtle and will last by being read for hundreds of years by a small percentage of the population, but he will last--unlike popular novels that exist for 1 to 50 years and then die due to lack of depth. And like most great writers a one time reading won't get your there. Plus reading it with a \\"guidebook\\" written by an English professor or even with Spark Notes will get you onehundred times more out of it than reading it without help. If you like pop fiction that you read once and throw away and everything is obvious and hits you on the head like a two by four this is NOT the book for you. If you like great works that require analysis and multiple readings and have tremendous but subtle depth than this is one of the true classics that introduced the modern twentieth century style of novels. Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man introduced revolutionary ideas in writing which have been copied by almost every twentieth century author popular or not. Many of the popular novels that people read would not exist without this highly original work by Joyce. But definately read it with a professor's guidebook--otherwise you will only get one percent of what is there and conclude that it is totally boring."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Though on a superficial level James Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man may seem non-sensical, philosophical, and without purpose, upon careful examination, because of Joyce's stylistic skill, it deserves to top any book list.The novel relates the growing of a small Irish boy, Stephen Dedalus, to a man amidst political, familial, religious, and moral controversy both internal and external. He develops from a subservient Catholic schoolboy into a university artist who rejects all imposed societal order, and equates truth with beauty.The plot is great buoyed through Joyce's masterful use of symbolism and imagery. As implied in Stephen's name, many of the symbols find basis in the myth of Icarus and Daedalus. Stephen too is trapped within a labyrinth and so the theme of roads and walking runs the course of the novel. He wanders the streets to his first sexual encounter, wanders in indecision over confessing his actions or not, and wanders as he decides whether to continue with a pious life or lay it aside for the worship of beauty.Stephen longs to be free of expectations and beliefs imposed upon him by family members, teachers, and friends. As he grows, his desire and hope for this freedom enlarge, and Joyce symbolizes this emotion with birds and flight, again drawing a parallel to the Greek myth. At the commencement of the novel, dark, horrible birds threaten to pluck Stephen's eyes, yet, as he recognizes beauty as his personal source of truth, perfection, and worship, the birds evolve into doves (2, 123). In his ultimate declaration of flight form the suffocating and confining world, Stephen declares, &quot;His throat ached with desire to cry aloud, the cry of a hawk or eagle on high to cry piercingly of his deliverance to the winds. This was the call of life to his soul not the dull gross voice of the world of duties and despair. . .He would create proudly out of the freedom and power of his soul, as the great artificer whose name he bore, a living thing, new and soaring and beautiful. . .&quot; (122). Even as he completely breaks the ties to his past at the end of the novel, Stephen notices and carefully describes the manner in which the birds fly and dart through the air (123).Water imagery brings unity to the work, as the book begins with Stephen wetting the bed and being pushed into a slimy ditch (1,7). Later on, the reader finds the beautiful girl Stephen views stands in the midst of the water (123). Maybe such water could represent the conflict Stephen feels, for the water imagery is frequently coupled with description of opposing forces. Upon wetting the bed, Stephen focuses on the comparison of the feelings of hot and cold. With the cess pool, Stephen teeters between being himself and trying to fit in, as well as following his father's advice not to tell on classmates and a desire to tattle. In the case of the girl, his conflict lies between a path filled with worship of God or worship of beauty. Stephen even wades into the water at this time (122). His sexual encounter and sin are also given imagery of slime and floods as he wobbles over what is morally right and his course of action.The conflict between the confining chains of religion and the freedom of impulse and beauty is central to the novel. Some of Joyce's greatest work comes from the mixing of these symbols, heightening the reader's understanding of Stephen's internal emotions. Many times, as Stephen views things of beauty of sensuality, he describes them in religious terms. Stephen approaches the house of the prostitute he tells &quot;The yellow gasflames arose before his troubled vision against the vapoury sky, burning as if before an altar. Before the doors and in the lighted halls groups were gathered arrayed as for some rite&quot; (70). He repeatedly describes Eileen as &quot;Tower of Ivory. House of Gold&quot; (28). On his way to the chapel to confess, Stephen encounters &quot;frowsy girls&quot; on the street and of them states &quot;. . .if their souls were in a state of grace they were radiant to see: and God loved seeing them&quot; (100). Even as Stephen wallows in indecision, longing to be free of his chains, the presence of his Catholic school friends accentuates the conflict in Stephen's mind (121).If nothing else, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is valuable as a model of the power of word choice and the need for careful craftsmanship in writing. Many in this world of disaster and decay find themselves trapped in obligations and expectations, but as Joyce teaches, it is in being oneself that one is truly free."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Perhaps considered by many as one Joyce's most personal work. Through a series of brillant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness Joyce evokes Stephen Dedalus's youth,from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the &quot;Clongowes Wood&quot; school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin(which in my opinion was the most profound part of the book, and the most enjoyable to read.)and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. It's this part of the book which makes me think of &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;. The mere idea of &quot;breaking loose&quot; to find one's self and setting yourself apart from others by doing what YOU want. A fantasic book filled with rich and wonderful details as only a master like Joyce could have done. Anyone in the mood for a enjoyable, thought-provoking read has to read this! Joyce has left an indelible mark on literature, and aren't we all lucky for that."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This man's writing is GENIUS. I read this book about seven years ago; and, it still impresses itself upon my mind as a favorite.Some people have trouble with his writing: they find it hard to understand.(With the obvious exception of Finnegan's Wake) I find Joyce's writing to be more understandable than most. I relate to his style very easily. He SAYS more than most writers using the same amount of words. In &quot;A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man&quot;, there is a lot of depth here in terms of metaphors and all sorts of sensations the writing invokes from your being.I think Joyce was able to transcend the typical semantic limitations of the English language and add motion as well as layers of understanding to his composition. The connections between the words ... phrases... all of their subtle meanings ... their INTERACTIONS ... their colors and sounds... this is like music in writing!! I don't know of any other author capable of this. When I read James Joyce, the pages come to life. His rhyming style in &quot;A Portrait...&quot; particularly fancies my attention. ;) I am sensitive to that rhythm. It is very child-like and fun - but not to be read superficially or you'll miss something...This book discusses themes including struggling with the sensual world versus perfectionistic ideals ... within the context of Old Irish Catholic upbringing and the struggles inherent therein. Tied in with that are also issues of rebellion/going your own way versus trying to &quot;fit in&quot;. Perhaps the latter of that is not so clearly stated in the book; but, I see it in there. These issues are explored - most appropriately - through the story of a maturing, intelligent, adolescent boy in Dublin who no doubt parallels Joyce himself. This is a story about personal growth: some of the metaphors illustrate the sensation of being born again and again and again ... cold, wet and naked into the world ... with each new experience and insight. These insights - epiphanies - are explored in a way that resonated greatly with me, impressing that deep, joyful sense of appreciation of this beautiful element in Life.I particularly enjoyed the point in the book in which the main character, Stephen Dedalus, begins indulging in Aristotle's theory of aesthetics. This is where the book peaked for me because the very style of writing ... as well as its descriptions of how life interacts with itself ... all of these layers were explained from an aesthetic context in Stephen's conversational discourses on the nature of beauty. I guess I could most simply describe the sensation as the old idea of a mirror reflecting (something) within a mirror reflecting within another mirror, and on ... or perhaps &quot;waking&quot; from a dream successively ... this is part of the effect it has on you. The reason for this is because you are forced back from the text and see a crystallization of the writing style itself that the main character of the book expounds in the theory. The beauty of the book is consummated at this point because of the understanding - the definition of it. I don't think I have explained it sufficiently here; but, I'll say that there was great irony at this point in the book for me. Oh, I loved this book...Not for everyone, I still think everyone should be exposed to this style of writing at some point. I think that perhaps the people who are deep-thinking artists (of all varieties) might get the most from this book, on average. This is still definitely a classic."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I will not argue the fact that Joyce is a master of the English language. Nor will I argue that at times he has very good insight into the psychological motivations of art, religion, and sociology. He possesses both of these talents. However, the manner in which they are presented in this book is simply disappointing. I am an avid reader and can appreciate thick philosophy woven artistically into an intriguing story. This book has sparse bits of philosophy and an occasional artistic stitch, but by and large fails to create a fabric that sparks my interest. Throughout this book, I found myself hopelessly holding onto the idea that, &quot;this is one of the greatest books ever written in the English language,&quot; and was left there holding onto that hope afterwards because it failed to deliver anything more.The story drags at the beginning, and while the minutia of Stephen's life is important to understand where he ends up, its focussed on way too much; the first 80 pages are useless and will leave you rolling your eyes for relief. Next, while a certain degree of specificity is important in terms of describing a scene, the precision to which he describes things, largely irrelevant things, can only be construed as &quot;filling&quot; to make this very short book acceptably long. Say something. Repeat it for emphasis. But don't fixate on it for pages and pages and pages. Lastly, the &quot;meat&quot; of the book, that being what actually made the man into an artist, is so sparse and loosely hung on the frail skeleton of plot, that any person reading this book hungry for some sort of insight or depth is ravishing and unsatisfied at the end, anxious to be filled up by some other book.Kundera is much better at doing what this &quot;master&quot; was intending to do. He cuts off the fat and leaves raw, creative, chiseled, philosophical muscle on the bone for a reader to savor. I wish I would have spent my time rereading something of his instead of deciding to pick up a book about the very slow and boring progression of this artist's perception."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I have been afraid of James Joyce for many years. Finally, I found the courage to read \\"The Dubliners.\\" It was excellent, and very readable. I read advice from people about how to approach reading, \\"Ulysses.\\" I followed the advice that said, \\"Just read it. Don't attempt to look up every obscure reference. Keep up your momentum.\\" Thanks to iPad I can look up many references very rapidly. There were only two sections of \\"stream of consciousness\\" and the advice to let it flow was right for me. I got through the book and was thrilled that I not only read it, but enjoyed it. Then came, \\"The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.\\" Having warmed up on \\"The Dubliners,\\" and reached full throttle on \\"Ulysses,\\" I decided to keep going with Joyce's works. \\"Portrait of the Artist ...,\\" is now stylistically familiar, as is Dublin and even the author. I don't know how autobiographical the book is, but it doesn't matter. The young man is interesting, introspective, and deeply committed to his perspective. I still struggle with many references, but now I understand quite a few, and that enriches the experience. Fear of Joyce probably causes many people to miss a wonderful literary experience. These books are very high on my list of great experiences."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Joyce's portrayal of turn of the century Ireland with all of its complex social and political problems is an excellent backdrop for this story, and he vividly describes Stephen Dedalus' role in a complex story. First, I enjoy Joyce's writing style and his ability to develop Stephen's character. It is easy to relate to Stephen's development of thoughts.I enjoyed how Joyce starts the story with Stephen as a boy, because this shows his vulnerability and dependence upon his parents for his political, religious, and social views. His interaction among the boys at Clongowes brought back my own memories from elementary school and my own interactions with students. He wants to be accepted by his peers, and Joyce shows this by his embarrassments and fears in taking a stand. Stephen is small in stature and in his confidence, but his triumph when he talks to the rector is an excellent scene because it shows Stephen developing his own independent thoughts and being able to stand up for them.I enjoy Joyce's vivid descriptions because they include the physical realm as well as Stephen's thoughts. This is shown throughout the book - one scene in particular is when Stephen goes to Belvedere College and he has an encounter with Heron, Boland, and Nash. The four are walking on a country road, discussing their favorite authors, when Stephen states that his is Lord Byron. The boys laugh, claiming that Tennyson is the obvious choice. They pin him down and try to get him to revoke the statement, and he refuse to do so. I admire Stephen's strength in his own opinions, this example shows that he has developed his own ideas and will stand for them. Joyce's imagery makes the scenes, including Stephen's emotions, come alive. He writes, &quot;At last after a fury of plunges he wrenched himself free. His tormentors set off towards Jones's Road, laughing and jeering at him, while he, half blinded with tears, stumbled on, clenching his fists madly and sobbing&quot; (57). Stephen's emotions come alive; I can relate to the hot, angry tears he feels.I also appreciate Joyce's writings concerning the political and religious situation in Ireland. Somewhat unaware of the problems surging in Ireland at this time, Joyce describes indirectly these problems, which fills in the reader as to the political, religious, and social context behind Stephen's life and development. One scene which made these problems clear to me was the Christmas dinner squabble between Dante and Mr. Dedalus. Stephen quietly sits back and soaks in his relatives' opinions in amazement at the scene. This scene is one of those that is when a child realizes that life has problems and the world is not in order, as he hopes. I recognize this mark of change in Stephen's confidence in his family and country.Stephen's development is one of the greatest aspects of this book. Joyce causes Stephen's thoughts to evolve - he starts with childlike, unconnected thoughts to more complex, opinionated ones. His own desires and opinions are made known as he matures, and his own unrest becomes increasingly apparent. Furthermore, the style of this book is complex - one must read between the lines and have some kind of concept of Irish conflicts and culture in order to truly understand the full meaning behind this book. It is sometimes hard to follow Joyce's jumpy style - there is no full plot structure. This is not the best book if you are looking for a fast, easy romance novel, but it is rewarding in that it causes one to think about its themes and Stephen's development of the independence of his own soul."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This is the first novel in which we meet the persona of Stephen Dedalus. It is noteworthy that Joyce titled his book A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN instead of A PORTRAIT OF AN ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN. The chosen title is presumptuous, at the very least,if not downright arrogant. However, at least for Joyce, young Stephen serves as paradigmatic exemplar of the artist. Not just any artist, but the 20th century artist.So what is so special about the 20th century artist? Why not artists from other ages, or all ages? The answer lies in the anti-religious and contra-religious themes and overtones which have developed at an exponential rate in the literature of the past 200 years. One finds this motif in nearly all of the major writers of late; Doestoevsky, Nabokov, Camus, Hemingway and Mann, just to name a few. In all of these writers (as well as countless others) one finds a great sense of loss. The universe is no longer see as a divine clock that keeps perfect time, nor is it seen as something crafted by a divine clockmaker.From this milieu emerges the artist. His task is to transform this painful revelation into something beautiful: art. We are introduced to young Stephen at that crossroads in life where he must decide whether to blindly follow the traditional beliefs of his forefathers, or to use his rational mind to cut himself loose from those bonds. Stephen's name is symbolic, for he chooses to take flight from the labyrinth of religion, as well as all of the dogmatic rites, rituals and institutions of Catholicism.The narrative of the book has a surreal flavor to it. One does not read PORTRAIT so much as one drifts thru the pages, like a raft gently floating downstream. There are many phrases in the novel that are pure poetry; Joyce's mastery of unique metaphors comes to the fore early on in the book. The prose is rarely lacking in elegance.The story will be most accessible to persons who are familiar with the socio-political and religious history of Ireland. For those like myself who are not so informed on these matters, the editor, Seamus Deane does an exemplery job of clarifying Joyce's allusions and references. I found both Deane's introduction as well as his footnotes to be very helpful.This book is highly recommend for all persons who ponder the changing role of the artist in the 20th (and 21st!) century. For an introduction to the themes of this book I would admonish the reader to refer to Friedrich Nietzsche's writings on aesthetics."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Readers who are familiar with the grown-up Stephen Dedalus from Joyce's acclaimed Ulysses will not fail to recognize the same aestheticized young man (of course much younger, duh)who struggles to find himself in balance with the complexity of life. Written in Faulknerian style which is feared and revered by readers, Joyce traces the childhood and youth of Stephen from the day he was born. Told in the baby babble at the beginning, to boyish fancy, youthful paradox, until the last chapter streaming fluidity of a nascent artist, Joyce captures every stage of his own development and conquest through the main bends of the road of life. From sexual awakening in his early teen years to later religious relization, Stephen Dedalus is portrayed by Joyce's wondrous motion of words that never seems to cease galloping forwards. Yes, like the Sound and the Fury, this book is provocative to certain degree as to challenge the readers seeking for more--&gt;help build a concrete foundation for the brilliant depiction of one of the most controversial characters of modern literature. The smooth painting of mental as well as spiritual growth certainly characterizes this work, and the seemingly impossible &quot;rambling&quot; between the pages is definitely worth a try."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man (Norton Critical Edition)This edition includes poignant commentary, essays, and contextualization. Great for anyone who is reading the book for the first time (like I was)."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"One of the ways I justified getting a Kindle was all the free books (of the \\"classics\\") variety I could read. I remembered starting this as a teenager and giving up on it, but I decided to give it another try.I'm glad I did, as I was finally ready for it.As far as \\"plot\\" goes, it can be summarized fairly quickly. You probably won't be turning the pages to see \\"what happens.\\" But you could be drawn in to find out how Stephen's mind progresses -- to me, the most appealing part of the book. As Stephen progresses from childhood to adulthood, you can see each chapter become more complex -- it's one of the best portrayals of intellectual maturing that I've ever read. Some great portions include the dinner table argument about Parnell, the hell sermon, and the conversation about the nature of art.It feels really presumptous to write a review of what is widely considered to be one of the greatest novels of all time, but I guess that is what reviews on Amazon are for. If you have a Kindle, you can get it for free -- why not?While all Kindle free books seem to have some typos, the ones in this book are very minimal."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Buy another version--Soho's is shameful. Not only is it a non-critical edition with no annotations whatsoever (which is fine--that's what I ordered, after all), but the sloppy editing throughout the entire book is so bad it's actually distracting. A high school editing staff could have done a better job."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"This book is absolutely incredible from a literary standpoint. How can you not give it four or five stars? Yes, its slow and you may not like it, but it is simply too good to not respect. Its like giving Bach or Mozart 2 stars. The writing style is revolutionary, the imagery is layered so thick you could read this book 20 times and not pick everything up, and the flow of the story reveals the deepest changes of Dedalus' soul. I have read many books that I have enjoyed more, but I have only read a few (Lolita, Brave New World, Hamlet) that are more influential and important than A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Unless you are a genius, you will not really enjoy this book with only one reading. Everything about this book is right, especially its literary structure. Joyce took about ten years writing it. At one point, it was a much longer book, but he chiseled it down to this jewel.After my first reading, I felt a sense of accomplishment. But I knew there was more in the book than I got out of it. It was like Joyce dared me to reread it. My second reading was pure joy because I was able to grasp so much more of the book's structure than the first time around. He writes in stream-of-conscious, and understanding that is the real challenge. Events and creative language may appear random at first, but after looking at the novel's 'big picture,' you can see order.The plot revolves around Stephen Daedalus' (James Joyce) coming of age, both as a young man and as an artist. Daedalus' personality and values contrast that of his Ireland, family, religion, etc. This is an auto-biography with plenty of artistic license. \`Stephen' was Christianity's first martyr. Daedalus was the creative genius in Greek mythology who made the Minotaur, the labyrinth, and Icarus' waxen wings. These types of detail pervade the novel. Take nothing for granted as you read.This Penguin copy ISBN# 0451525442 has an excellent introduction. Do not start without reading an intro first. You will miss out."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"James Joyce's Portrait of the Artist has long been hailed as one of the great literary masterpieces. While it is a different style than I am accustomed to reading, I learned to appreciate its unique approach. The way Joyce links Stephen's seemingly random thoughts in the first chapter kept me on my toes and made me more aware of my own thought processes as I read.Two parts of this book stand out in my mind; both deal directly with Stephen's personality changes. First, we watch Stephen change from a quiet, picked-on schoolboy to a student with increasing influence and authority. Suddenly (and seemingly without effort on his part), Stephen is no longer the isolated intellectual being pushed into ditches, but is leading younger boys in prayers. Just as Stephen won grudging respect from those who were his tormentors, he won my respect by refusing to tattle and giving into self-pity as so many others would. Second, we watch Stephen's spiritual journey. He is brought up surrounded by religion and is introduced early to the conflict between politics and religion. We see him turn from his religious background to \\"riotous living,\\" then turn back when the preacher's \\"hell fire and damnation\\" sermons prick his conscience. Stephen adopts such a rigid, pious lifestyle that the priest invites the young man to join the priesthood. Stephen rejects this opportunity, saying he will inevitably fall again. Almost immediately afterwards, he sees a beautiful girl and feels \\"an outburst of profane joy.\\" Through these two events, we track Stephen's growth and progress as he discovers his own personality. In large measure, it is this that that makes the novel so timeless. The struggle of offspring versus parents, of childhood teachings versus outside influences is an ever-present tension in adolescence. Stephen's struggle with his parents' religion seemed especially pertinent. All too often, people never stop to see analyze their religious beliefs, to see if there is a deeper reason for their convictions than just childhood habit. Stephen does not want to celebrate Easter, but is loath to cause an argument between his mother and himself-a struggle felt by anyone who has ever differed from their parents on any matter. Though not always this dramatic, there comes a point when children must think for themselves. Not being too far removed from that age myself, it will be interesting to re-read this book in years to come when the roles are reversed and I find myself the parent. I wonder if I will empathize more with Stephen's mother who hopes he can find a heart or if I will staunchly defend the young man's position.Initially, I wasn't sure whether or not I like Portrait of the Artist, but it is a book that stays with you. The writing style is unique and interesting. Joyce's use of words such as \\"dismember\\" (rather than \\"cannot remember\\") and \\"whitegray not young\\" (to describe Father Dolan's face) captivated me. No one can deny that Joyce is a master of the language."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"No worries. It's not Ulysses. No footnotes needed.

De gustibus non est disputandum, however, as the Romans said.Speaking of which, because I was raised Lutheran, I didn't get all the Catholic stuff. I figured you people just went to confession and moved on. My people just sing loud, eat sausage, and grow fat, as unnameable torment and self-loathing eat away at our heartvalves: how would you like them apples huh?All in all, I was glad this book was short and will now go on to Ulysses, as I enjoy things Greek, with reasonable exceptions, being of German extraction.

I am just an average reader and I didn't catch any of the philosophical meanings Joyce had behind his writing, and even if I did, this book would still be terrible.

Similar to Dubliners, I had to put this book down before reading seven or more pages at one time."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Although A Portrait of The Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce has been called a masterpiece by many, I did not enjoy reading it. It was a very well sculpted book, but I found it very hard to follow and rather dull. I could not relate to it very well. The language used typical of the time period and I am not very familiar with what was happening in Ireland at this time.The book is about the life of Stephen Dedalus, but it might as well be about Joyce himself. Joyce follows all aspects of Stephen's growth throughout the political and religious turmoil in Ireland during the early 20th century.We are introduced to Stephen as a very young boy through his interactions with his peers at a Catholic boarding school and his experiences with his family who is torn apart over the religious and political issues of the time. This book describes young Stephen's search for himself in this confusing society which he finally throws of himself to become an artist.It is obvious that Joyce wrote every word of this book very deliberately. He repeatedly uses different symbols and images throughout the book. I must admit that he skillfully uses style throughout this book to portray the feelings of the time according to Stephen at each different time in his life. For example, the book begins with his sporadic flow of thought that is common among boys his age. It eventually comes to a very organized journal-like style associated with young adults.Joyce did a good job writing this book and was very careful with every aspect of it; however, I did not enjoy it and would not recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I'm sorry but I don't get it. I realize that there is more going on in the book than I understood as I read it, but I don't want to take the time to find out what it was. This book had relatively few pages, but it took me an awfully long time to finish it, and I mean awful. The story is not very interesting. I've noticed that many reviewers are impressed with the form in which the story is expressed - and surely this is part of the reason why this book has endured - but I've always enjoyed substance over form, and the substance for me is the story. One can sometimes identify with the Dedalus, but in the end it's not enough; his story isn't very interesting. I'm sure that a more critical reading of the book would reveal more and make the book more enjoyable, but given the amount of time that one must invest just to read the book, and the small pleasure derived from that enterprise, one is discouraged from dedicating even more to more fully understand. Pass on this book unless you're really willing to delve into it or try some lighter fare . . . like Moby Dick."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"In my case Portrait managed to take frustration and disappointment to previously unimaginable heights and it undisputedly stands as the most unsatisfying piece of literature I've ever attempted to digest. Initially Portrait simply bored me beyond belief, but then it also seriously enraged me on account of its meandering pointlessness. In order to protect my sanity I found myself compelled to take drastic measures and set aside my objections to the ritual burning of books. However, I could only get the bonfire I erected to eat away a disappointingly small part of my copy of the book. Thus Portrait even refused me the pleasure of seeing it go up in flames...

Academia has praised this book for a number of reasons, most notably its innovative stream of conciousness style. Critics and high school lit teachers alike seem to agree that James Joyce is pretty great, and this is one of his crowning achievements. Honestly, I'm not sure I see it the same way. The book doesn't exist on its own plane of unqualified excellence as I had been led to believe. Many of the characters, although based on real life counterparts, lack depth and development. A lot of this has to do with the entire book being presented from the main character's point of view, so we are not allowed to see any other perspectives of the events that unfold in the novel. A lot of the action doesn't really seem to add to the overall story, either. It does not appear that the main character grows from any of the situations or that they have much of an effect on later developments.Despite all of this, I still enjoyed the book, as should be evident by the 4 star rating above. I liked the book because of the first point I made about specious depth in the writing. The book is written in its own highly esoteric language that I really got a kick out of. That line I quoted earlier may not really mean anything on its own, but it just sounds so damn pretty, how can I resist it? This book is certainly not for everybody, and it takes soem getting used to for the first hundred pages or so.

This book is something different.Joyce is in his early stages of hi litterarie work, just starting to experiment with the chain of tought technique, and the result is absoultely brilliant... what we have received is the most beautiful and compelling autobiography, one has written in the entire history of litterature. In a voice of Stephen Dedalus (character around whom, together with Leonard Bloom, Ulysses is built) Joyce presents his early childhood thoughts, Joyce preensets development of character that refusses as the time progresses any kind of bonding with govermenet, education, church or any other kind of institution while at the same time building his own, inside universe where things happen at his command, and by his direction.Language is sometimes hard, and you'll catch yourself re-reading some passages with tendencie of better grasping his message, his tought, but 3/4 of the work is written in the most beutiful english you can imagine...I strongly reccomend this book..."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"There were no extras in the Kindle edition, at all.

This is not that version!"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"After having just finished reading Ulysses (and loving it) I decided it would be rewarding if I read 'A Portrait' next in order to delve further into Stephen Dedalus' character. (Moreover, I had also just finished reading Ellmann's famous biography of Joyce and felt inspired to read Joyce's own semi-autobiography). Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with the dry, tedious narrative tone that Joyce adopted in writing his novel, especially within the overdrawn third chapter in which we learn the terrors of hell and damnation. Yes, I know the sermon sequence had great significance in Stephen's development from the primordial muck of biological existence to the more rarefied air of the soul, of human conscience and (above all) of the powers of artistic creativity. Nevertheless I found my thoughts wandering elsewhere when I was reading this book and many times I had to re-read whole pages because I had realized I was just reading the words without absorbing their content. While Ulysses drew me immediately into the consciousness of Bloom and Dedalus, 'A Portrait' was bland, cold and uninviting. I felt by the end of \\"A Portrait\\" that I was solely reading the book because it was Joyce and because it was deemed a classic. Perhaps I ruined A Portrait by reading Joyce's masterpiece first. Even if Ulysses can seem (at times) even more glacially abstract and opaque to the reader than A Portrait, Ulysses at least challenges you in such a way that you want to understand more about the text (its various allusions, its satire, its narrative experimentation, ect). I do not feel compelled to read A Portrait again, in fact (in the process of writing this review) I now feel compelled to re-read Ulysses and perhaps even Finnegan's Wake."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"As a literary piece this book is geniuos. The ideas conveyed through out this work are as thoughtful and mind boggling as it gets. I admit my mental capacity was not strong enough to be able to interpret every word and I feel there was a lack of overall story line. I found the structure of ones character to be intriguing but did not catch on the national pride and representation of Ireland in this book.I enjoyed Dubliners much more but what is my opinion worth? Its still a classic masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I was required to read this book as part of my intensive writing class. That may put a slightly negative spin on my views of this book, since I was forced to read it. However, I think that was not a major factor on my opinion of this book.&#65533;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&#65533; is a good book. In this book, Joyce uses beautiful imagery, interesting style, and thought provoking ideas. Joyce has a very artistic voice that creates wonderful images for the reader. He uses point of view to make the reader think and make connections between the book and the reader&#65533;s own life. Joyce uses many intriguing and antiestablishment ideas. Overall, this is a good, but not great book.One cannot read this book without noticing at least some of the imagery that is contained in it. The first page and a half is pure imagery. There is no plot or real coherence to it. As the story progresses, there becomes a plot; however, a large emphasis on imagery remains. On page twelve it reads, &#65533;He crouched down between the sheets, glad of their tepid glow.&#65533; The reader is able to see this event, because Joyce uses great words like &#65533;crouched&#65533; and &#65533;tepid glow.&#65533; Joyce is also great at making the reader feel things. On page 82 it reads, &#65533;The frail, gay sound smote his heart more strongly than a trumpetblast, and, not daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, into the shadow of the tangled shrubs.&#65533; One feels what the main character, Stephen Dedalus is feeling. The imagery creates a connection between reader and character, which adds to the overall quality of this piece. On page 158 it reads, &#65533;O what sweet music! His soul was all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, conscious of faint sweet music.&#65533; That passage is just simply beautiful. The reader can see these images, which fully illustrates the euphoric feelings of Stephen. Imagery is gorgeously applied throughout the book to create a tie between reader and character, and reader and story.The thing that intrigued me the most about &#65533;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&#65533; was the interesting point of view. The book starts out as Stephen&#65533;s point of view. By the end, it is Stephen&#65533;s journal. In between, it is everything from strictly third person limited to a first person view in third person. This may not seem to make sense, all this talk about point of view being in more than one person at one time, but if you read this book, it will make sense. The importance of this view to me is in how it made me think. I had trouble concentrating while I read this book. I was constantly thinking of different experiences, ideas, or hopes of my own. Joyce uses a point of view that is so much like one&#65533;s own thoughts that it is almost impossible to not let one&#65533;s thoughts stray. I would think about things in my life related to what the book was discussing. This creates a powerful tool in the author&#65533;s hands. He is able to make the reader think about the book at a personal level. That way, the reader internalizes the points Joyce wants to make. This book affects the reader, often unbeknownst to him. The reader&#65533;s ideas are affected. Joyce does not brain wash his readers; he simply opens their minds to new ideas. The interesting use of point of view is able to change the readers&#65533; opinions.This book is often thought of as an anarchist book. It is on the cover of one of Rage Against the Machine&#65533;s CD&#65533;s. Also on the cover are books like The Anarchist Cookbook, The Media Monopoly, and 50 Ways to Fight Censorship. When I first discovered this, I was baffled. This book was about a shy little boy growing up. I did not understand this books connotations until the end. In the fifth and last chapter, Stephen is a poet with many antiestablishment ideas. By hearing Stephen&#65533;s discussions with other characters, the reader is exposed to these ideas. Stephen&#65533;s anti-society ideas are shown on page 181. It reads, &#65533;I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland or my church.&#65533; Stephen obviously has no faith in God, his country, or his family. Furthermore, Stephen will not do things just because he is supposed to. He will only do things he believes are right to do. This book has many ideas that display a rebellious spirit.Overall, I would say &#65533;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&#65533; was a good book, and worth a read, if you have the time. It can give you a better understanding of writing and of others&#65533; point of views. If you are interested in any of the things I mentioned in this review, I would advise reading this book. It demonstrates many interesting ideas and techniques of writing."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"With its rich symbolism and sensual, impressionisticstream-of-conscious language, the novel \`A Portrait of the Artistas a young Man' is seen as one of the greatest and most influentialmasterpieces of world literature. Before this autobiographical storywas finally published in 1916, it had been rewritten many times,because James Joyce, the author, wasn't satisfied with it.JamesJoyce was born in Dublin, capitol of Ireland and the place where mostof the story takes places, in 1882. He was one of a large family, justas Stephen Dedalus, the maincharacter of the story is. James andStephan both visited Clongowes Wood College, Belvedere College andDublin college of the Royal University. After he did some writing fortheatre, Joyce moved to Paris -at the end of story Stephen alsogoes to Paris -, but returns when his mother becomes sick. He becomesone of the most famous authors ever, especially be writing\`Ulysses', the story which follows up \`A Portrait of the Artistas a young Man', in which Stephen Dedalus reappears.This novelchronicles Stephen's life from his early years at Clongowes School tothe university, when he decides to leave Dublin. Joyce describes theDedalus family fantastically. Young Stephen's education by theJesuits, his sexual awakening, his intellectual development and hiseventual \`being against' the religion, in which he has beenraised.Stephen has been far from a good Catholic boy. Among otherthings, he's been visiting the brothels. All this has made himfrightened ... . He thinks he will end up there and can't stopthinking about the punishment he'll get. \`....at the command ofGod, the fire of hell, while retaining the intensity of its heat,burns eternally in darkness. It's an never ending storm of darkness,dark flames and dark smoke of burning brimstone, amid which the bodiesare heaped one upon another without even a glimpse of air.' is whatStephen imagines hell's like.Fortunately the sermon hits him with aspecial intensity, so much so that it changes his life forever. Beforethis, he's completely absorbed in the \`physical'. After it, hebecomes just as absorbed in the \`spiritual world' - it's likegoing from the first end to the other. He's being offered a positionas priest. When Stephen decides he doesn't want to be a priest, theidea of becoming an artist really starts to take hold. And when hesees a girl on the beach, his life is set for good. He revolts againstthe religion and moves to Paris.The story, which comes from thetime of the modernism, the stream of consciousness, has been writtenin a third person view. You only read the things Stephen sees, hearsand especially the things he thinks. All the time the story switchesfrom reality to imagination without letting you know it does, whichsometimes takes care of some confusion and misunderstanding.Joyce'smastery of literary style and the richness of the language -as wellEnglish as Latin- make the story very hard to read, without keeping onlooking at a dictionary, but it's worth the effort. Like everyonesays, it's a masterpiece."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"A brilliant tour de force of Joyce's mastery, as few or perhapsnone have ever equaled, of language. &quot;Portrait&quot; is a stunningstory of Joyce's (the story is highly autobiographical) developmentas a moral and conscious [sp?] being and a preamble to &quot;Ulysses.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I breathed a sigh of relief when I finished this book. I was glad to have it done with. Because it is supposed to be a great book, I wanted to see it through. The book is hard to read and while there are some gems of wisdom in it, I think those insights could have been had with a lot less confusion. I think I see some new lines on my forehead from wrinkling it up trying to figure out what this guy was talking about. If you want to read this, be equipped with a Latin dictionary, a handbook of Irish slang and some knowledge of early 20th century Irish history. Sometimes I wonder if books make it onto the list of \\"great\\" literature mostly because the author is willing to mock the church, especially Christianity and take another whip to Jesus's back. I guess doing this is supposed to make the work cutting edge. Well, not any more. Atheism is mainstream now, so the shock value has been shaken out of it. I only have one life and just so many hours to devote to reading. I hope the next book I read makes better use of my time."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Actor Jim Norton did a wonderful job creating a special voice for each of the book's characters. I could see how the chapter three sermon on hell would be terrifying to young Stephen and yet come across as ironic and manipulative to someone more mature. I've read this book numerous times, but Norton helped me discover a whole new way of enjoying Joyce."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"For those people who like to understand the books that they read, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man is not for you. The book is written in a unique style, where you follow along with what the main character is thinking. The book jumps around a lot, and you can be at dinner on one page, and in school on the next. The only things the reader sees is what the main character sees. The reader also is forced to go along with the tangents that Stephen makes, sometimes disorienting the reader with what is actually happening.A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man offers a lot of good insight though, on the development of the mind through life. The reader can easily see how Stephen's outlook on the world changes as he grows. Though this provides an interesting point of view, it make it extremely difficult to keep track of what is happening, as mentioned above.I myself, as it is hopefully obvious, did not like this book. Though the book offers up a few interesting points, it doesn't really make me feel attached to the main character. Also, the last chapter to me was really pointless. As I saw it, he mainly rambled on a bout a lot of random junk, and it didn't seem to fit with the rest of the book. It was just a chapter on how he talked about pointless analysis of random things with his friends.So, the main recommendation I would make is, read it, and just stop after chapter four. The rest is pointless."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"\\"A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man\\" is a fictionalized account of James Joyce's early life. But more importantly, it was a bold, radical departure from previous novels, since it possessed such a richly lyrical prose describing the artist's self reflection and maturation during his adolescence; perhaps it was the first important novel on self consciousness and realization published in the 20th Century. Its protagonist, Stephen Dedalus - whom we will encounter again in \\"Ulysses\\" - is none other than Joyce himself, striving to reconcile himself with the demands of his family, his faith and desire for artistic freedom. Ultimately it will be artistic freedom which wins out, as evidenced by the radical transformation of Joyce's initial, simplistic prose, to one which is truly poetic by the novel's conclusion. Set approximately around the time of the great Irish politician Parnell's death, Joyce offers fascinating insights into his early education, his relationship with the Catholic Church and his emerging sense of Irish nationalism, fueled by his admiration for Parnell. While this is not Joyce's best work of novel-length fiction, it certainly foreshadows his subsequent literary triumphs such as \\"Ulysses\\"."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Sure its pretentious, frustrating, difficult, etc., but it is also such a rewarding read. Boring sections like chapter 3 with the church sermon set up excellent ones, such as the end of Chapter 4, with Stephen's epiphany, which I must say is the most beautiful, glorious thing I have ever read. the emotion and symbolism (such as Stephen Dedalus taking flight from society much like his Greek namesake Daedalus did from an island) is simply overwhelming. I had to read this for a college english class (as well as write an essay on it) but i still enjoyed it. the stream of conciousness style may be too difficult and odd for some but i found a nice break from other literature, which is more than i can say for the similar novel To the Lighthouse by Woolf (also extremely good stylistically, but much less interesting). brilliant, but not a good introduction to joyce for those still in high school or not used to reading challenging literature. I would recommend &quot;The Dead&quot; to try him out first."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The best first line every written in any novel. Read it and see. =)"},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"The strikingly beautiful language of James Joyce provides readers with page after page of scrumptious poetic prose describing more of thoughts and reactions to implied situations within the novel. Portrait of an Artist is not so much the story of young Stephen Daedalus as it is an expression of the feelings of a young man facing an internal struggle between religion and aesthetics. As the prose of the novel grow along with its young protagonist readers are able to see the progression of a small child into a strong young man. Joyce instead of telling readers the story provides them with the sensations and feelings of Stephen as he grows allowing the story to be merely implied and absorbed by the reader. Although many parts of the novel may be difficult to understand, as readers are not always sure exactly what is happening because of Joyce's style, the beauty of the prose itself is a major part of what makes Portrait of an Artist such a fantastic piece of literature.The struggle of young Stephen between his creative side and the rough political and religious expectations of his family and nation can also be seen by Joyce's choice in the name of his character. The relation of Stephen Daedalus to the mythical Daedalus who created wings to escape the Leviathan is weaved throughout the novel through Joyce's use of bird imagery. The reader can see the progression of the young hero as he strives to create his own wings to escape the oppression he comes to feel from religion and even patriotic devotion. One of the most beautiful passages of the entire book is the epiphanatic moment when Stephen sits on the beach and notices a beautiful young woman standing in the surf. Joyce describes this exquisite young girl by using language one might use when describing a beautiful bird. She represents the beauty and creativity Stephen has felt guilty for desiring all his life because of the strong influence his religion has had on him. Stephen's realization at seeing this girl is one of the major steps in his attempt to create his own wings and fly away.This masterpiece of James Joyce's, although fictional, draws heavily on experiences from the author's life. It touches on many meaningful themes all mainly related to coming of age as Joyce takes readers through many of his own youth experiences. The real genius of the novel is a technique called stream-of-consciousness that Joyce was one of the pioneering developers of during his time. From the baby talk and infantile perception Joyce presents at the beginning of his novel to the elevated and intellectual ideals Stephen presents during his time at the university, this style of writing enhances the experience for the reader as they are literally inside the main character's thoughts although the narration is not in the first person. This adds to the experience, as the reader is able to struggle along with Stephen as he attempts to rise above the imposition of family, peers, religion and politics. The journey throughout the novel is a story of a young man who comes of age and eventually finds his directions in life as he strive to become an artist in a world dominated by rigid things."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I began this book not knowing much of what to expect from it. I generally like classic novels, but I also like to have a clearly-framed plot and several well-developed characters. &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot; has none of this, and as that started to become apparent as I read, I was worried that I would not even want to finish the book. Instead, I finished it in a couple nights, and I now consider it one of the best books I've ever read. What's most amazing is that the idea to this book is so simple. It's about a boy (this one, Steven Dedalus, happens to be Irish), growing up and struggling to discover his niche in his surroundings. A theme so totally simple and done so many times before and since.But the author is what makes all the difference here. The eloquence of Joyce's language and his beautiful descriptions are hard to believe came from one mind. I feel some authors get so caught up in their vocabularies and metaphors that they lose the ability to connect the object of their descriptions to the reader. This is never a problem with Joyce. His development of Steven Dedalus, from boy into young adult, progresses perfectly from the start to its inspiring peak at the book's close.The Modern Library ranked this as their #3 book of the 20th Century (Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; was #1). While putting a rank to the best books of a 100 year period is somewhat ridiculous to me, I don't know if I could name 2 books that I've read from that time frame that are better. And that is what surprised me most about this book."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I think &quot;A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man&quot; was one of the best books I've read. You start reading it and get addicted. If you haven't heard of James Joyce and are interested in his work, then I strongly reccomend this, but you must have an open mind. I read this when I was 13 and James Joyce now has become one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"Gentle reader, please know that this book deserves its reputation as one of the greatest novels in the history of the English language. It can be approached at many levels and satisfies at all of them. I read this in my early years at University and my advice is to take some of the reviews here with a grain of salt. Mr. Thomas Gidding's ponderous, ill-tempered harangue (wherein he calls Joyce's work pretentious while stuffing into his review as many multisyllabic words as possible), and Mary's &quot;Not up to par&quot; review (wherein she reveals she is getting collage credit for her English course having yet to find the spell check) only prove that they have missed the boat not because it left early, but because they showed up late. Be brave. Dive deep. This is a wonderful novel. And it is like no other."},{"Title":"A Portrait of the Artist As a Young Man","review":"I first read this book in high school and found it ponderous and prosaic. Now, ten years later, I've just read it again for an M.A. class on Joyce. What a difference ten years can make! Joyce's prose is stunning. It reads like a dream. The &quot;epiphany&quot; sequence at the end of Chapter Four is a tour-de-force of stunning visual imagery and emotion. One of the best books ever!"},{"Title":"A Rose for Every Month (Sound)","review":"This book begins with the character of Jane Rushton, a 30-something English woman in the 1920s who flees to Italy to escape her fiance's infidelity. There she meets Ottavio Castagnolo, &quot;padrone&quot; of a vast wine and olive estate which has been slowly falling into ruin. Jane agrees to become governess for Ottavio's two young children, and thus the lives of the Rushtons and the Castagnolos become forever intertwined. Specifically, Jane's brother, Charlie, her cousin, Alexandra, and her nephew David, all become bewitched by Italy through mingling with Ottavio's sister, Anna, his brother, Fausto, and his son and daughter, Marco and Francesca. The story spans approximately 40 years and is set against the backdrop of WWII. My only complaint about this novel is that the ending felt rather rushed; suddenly, we have the characters informing us of the action rather than being allowed to see it unfold for ourselves. Overall, however, this was an enjoyable read, especially given the unique perspective into a terrible time of world history."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure Before Trial (Chapters 1-7)","review":"I recieved this book in an outstanding period of time it got to me like in three days and in perfect condition great buy!!!"},{"Title":"La Mission De Maitreya - Tome 1 (French Edition)","review":"Voici la Mission de l'Instructeur Mondial...

But this one is very different. It reads like you are watching a movie, which I think is very cool. This is like reading Clancy with a cool writing style."},{"Title":"The Succession","review":"What would happen if the elite &quot;American royalty,&quot; including movie stars and sports celebrities, were sacrificed in the name of morality? What if highly trained assassins united to rid the nation of greed, disloyalty and corrupt values, executing people who represent moral indecency? Jean-Jacques de Mesterton tells this tale of conspiracy in The Succession. The novel centers around Jack MacMaster. MacMaster is a skilled professional soldier who previously worked for one of the most influential men in international affairs. He is now recruited for an execution mission that targets persons who sensationalize corrupt virtues. As the group of assassins murder celebrities and politicians one-by-one, the media goes wild and the government is baffled. The killers' precision and expertise provoke fear and apprehension in America and throughout nations abroad. No one can identify the motive. Once de Mesterton unveils that the killers are on a moral crusade, the new question is who are these killers and how much power do they have? To answer this question, he brings readers into Jack MacMaster's complex past as this web of conspiracy untangles. De Mesterton writes The Succession as a perfect blend of a mystery novel and an action film. The book's structure resembles a film, with a distinct timeline and a visual, fast-paced story. The chapters unfold like scenes, as developments in the plot evolve with each change in setting. Without the visual stimulation of a film, however, readers get to experience this movie-like plot without sacrificing imagination. Readers can be captivated like a live audience while each person's vision of the characters and settings remains unique. The Succession is perfect for anyone who, like me, enjoys stories that are fast-paced, exciting, and visual."},{"Title":"The Succession","review":"I travel a lot for my job; I bought this book along with two others before a trip to L.A., which is as far as I go. I read it first because it was the oldest of the three, and I knew nothing about the author. I like mysteries and political thrillers. The book surprised me. The plot is still relevant to what's happening today. It's beautifully written. This story moves fast. I read it in 7 hours. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Succession","review":"Simply put, amazing! I am now reading &quot;The Succession&quot; for the third time and am drawn in to the plot just as much as the first time I read it! With his perfectionist style and detail to his characters, Mr. Mesterton has created truly one of the greatest political-action thrillers I have ever read! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a page-turning, action-packed (yet quite romantic and funny) book that you WILL NOT be able to put down!"},{"Title":"The Succession","review":"As a young man, all of my greatest fantasies focused around a romanticized picture of life as the great James Bond. I wanted to go around the world, use amazing tools to do various tasks, and subvert the great espionage plots of the world. For a great long time, James Bond was my hero. As I matured, I still saw James Bond as a hero, but more for the sophistication he embodied, not for the embellishments cinematography had created. I began to see the truth behind all of the figures we refer to as heroes, and discovered that real heroes are just as human as the rest of us are.Jean-Jacques de Mesterton has presented the reading public with a truly powerful testament of the human condition, fusing a powerful, visual plot with a character that is truly human: a person the reader not only emulates, but in a sense pities as well. Jack MacMaster is the focus of the story, a soldier who questions the existence he now leads. His life is quickly altered when he is called on to be involved in plot involving political extremism, assassination, and a conspiracy that is unbelievably depraved and evil, mostly because it seems very plausible. The beauty of the story also lies in its continual sense of movement. In reading the story and creating a mental picture, one gets the impression of a movie, with new scenes being brought forth with each new chapter. While making the story fun to read, it also creates a sense of freedom, allowing the reader to conjure images and emotions to supplement the amazing textual creations of de Mesterton. With the intrigue of the foreground and the struggles of MacMaster to regain his sense of being, plus his toil to regain the woman he loves, and we have a beautifully crafted and well-rounded story.Jean-Jacques de Mesterton's &quot;The Succession&quot; is a highly entertaining and visual story that is a joy to read. We are a given a character who each of us can readily identify with, an alienated soldier of life, trying to cling to a sense of humanity and decency, and a story that is powerful and moving. Bravo, de Mesterton, on creating an excellent piece of literature.As for de Mesterton's work being worse than an airplane magazine, I believe that if all airlines would &quot;The Succession&quot; into their planes, even the coach class would discontinue many of their complaints."},{"Title":"The Succession","review":"This is a thrilling book! I always enjoy the start of any good adventure, the set up of characters, the way the author involves us in the plot line, how the literary voice can change with different characters. The &quot;Succession&quot; is an excellent example of how a great start can become a thrill ride by the end. I basically ate this book in three bites, the third being a great gulp of the last half. The author seems to have a realistic grasp of many of the details of dirty underworld dealings. You can't tell if he is just making up pure fiction or if there is some personal experience involved. If I had one critizism of the book it would be that it was much too short. I enjoyed the characters and would like to see them in another adventure that would give us a closer glimpse into their background. As it is we get to see just enough to make us wonder. A very worthy first novel, I am eager for the next."},{"Title":"The Succession","review":"In a vein similar to Tom Clancy, De Mesterton has skillfully delivered a hero-driven adventure story, with the aroma of a film in the making. The Succession was mesmerizing from beginning to end.Unlike the flawless hero we have become accustomed, De Mesterton delivers his hero, Jack MacMaster, with honesty, human frailties, and bad baggage to boot. De Mesterton skillfully turns these nagging skeletons into strengths for MacMaster, whom we cheer as the character arcs and grows, and masters (no pun intended) each situation, drawing from his unique skills.I am baffled by the claims of the European from France, if he truly read this trade-published book. The plot was flawless, and I was riveted by this page-turner, finding the literary prowess of De Mesterton (whose work could only have been influenced by real-life experiences), remarkableThis being said, two points are quickly obvious - De Mesterton has overcome great obstacles in his own life, and become an extraordinary communicator - but also a man of principle, integrity and honor - and one whom it is probably prudent to befriend and not offend."},{"Title":"The Succession","review":"This is not a good book. Its poorly written and the plot is comedically stupid."},{"Title":"The Succession","review":"Reading the Succession was like watching a high paced action movie. Not the cookie cutter kind that Hollywood has been cranking out, but the quality kind. de Mesterton has a great grasp of the English language which he uses to its full extent in poetic descriptions and storytelling. The plot is well woven as he softens and strengthens the tension throughout the story. His detailed descriptions of characters, events and items such as guns and cars can't help but make you believe that he had first hand experience with much of what is written."},{"Title":"The Succession","review":"My profession is in the filmed &amp; video entertainment industry, so I'm always on the lookout for a book that could be translated onto the screen. Those that I do find which interest me in that fashion usually require a bit of adjusting to make the fit. As I have already adapted one such publication for the screen, I know of what I speak. In the case of THE SUCCESSION, I was pleased to find that not only was it a zingy, roller coaster of a ride in novel form, but also exactly what I look for as potential screenplay material. Aside from not being able to put the book down until I had read it in its entirety, De Mesterton's vivid images literally leapt from the pages onto the walls of my mind and played there like the hit film I know it will be. Anyone who enjoys a good yarn in book form, only to compare it later to its screen adaptation, will do well to pick up THE SUCCESSION today and begin reading, because it is certainly headed into the theaters in the not too distant future, destined also to be a hit in that venue.Congratulations to you, Mr. De MestertonP.

The protagonists are very roughly hewn and thrown into the already bad enough story as if picked out of an assemble-your-own-book-so-that-you-can-call-yourself-author instruction sheet (take 1 or 2 villains, 1 really really good guy, 1 supersecret private agency which comes to the rescue after the amount of pages is about right...).

The magnificent irony of killings for the sake of moral decency was my favorite stylistic element, though de Mesterton's diction alone is enough to stimulate the reader.

Much of the story is set in Colorado where the plot twists and turns on itself like Rocky Mountain switchbacks.

The skills of a shadowy past come back to life as MacMaster discovers his worth in a battle to destroy the freedom-killers. This is a movie in the shape of a book. Imagination provides the details as the scenes flash across the pages. The hardbound medium is not dead in this dangerous digital age. My one complaint about the book is that it ends.

I'd forgotten the time I had read Little Women as a child, this took me right back to it."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"This book is nowhere near as good as \\"Little Women,\\" but it's nice to see the future of Jo, Meg, Amy, Laurie, and all of the family, though the adults are featured very little. The boys that Jo and her husband are raising and teaching get into fun, silly adventures. This book is both heartwarming and, at times, heart-wrenching. If you like stories about children and their joys and triumphs, you'll enjoy this sweet little book.All that being said, the Kindle version has MANY editorial mistakes; words missing, misspelled, a word which was clearly mistakenly entered in place of another, etc."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"Looking back on this book, I've noticed that it seems less (I don't want to say elaborate) but that's about the word...then say Nathaniel Hawthorne or Charles Dickens. But, in a way that is refreshing.I still think that the sacrifice of the toys was slightly funny and I'm still very much impressed by the unique parenting/leadership skills of the now adult Jo and her husband.Without giving away the entire plot, I'll say that it's about a school they run out of their house and it doesn't have a nice neat plotline.Now may I add: This version is amazing, the discussion questions in the back enhanced my reading immensely and I got so much more from the story then I would have. Also the illustartions are lovely. This book (compared to other's from it's era) is very revolutionary, and full of love for all humanity, even if their are: ethnical differences, age differences, wealth differences, and gender differences"},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"I first read this book when I was a child, and I love it just as much now as I did then. It's a great book to read to and discuss with your children.I would have given this review 5 stars instead of 4, except for one flaw. The Kindle version of this book is full of spelling and punctuation errors. Not a big deal for some, but it's just one of those things that bugs me.Then again, at a cost of $.86, I guess I don't really have room to complain. :)"},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"Little Men was a quick read and a lovely way to continue Jo's story. I didn't think it was nearly as good as Little Women, perhaps because there are more characters and it takes place within a shorter period of time... so there is less development in each character and even more moralizing as each short story within the book has a lesson to be learned!"},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"I love this book almost as much as Little Women. They just don't write good wholesome books like these classics anymore. Read it and you'll love it!"},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"Well, this book always will remain among my favorites, one that touches me and makes me feel. I think that when I was little, I saw a cartoon series about it. At that time, I didnt know that it was based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott. The success of this stories is the wide ranges of characters shown in this book, the spirit, moral conduct, inner strength, and most of all, the splash of fun and careless boyish pranks. THe setting is great, and I like to see how the old characters are developed, as well as the new. Strangely, my favorite character out of all the interesting ones was Dan, Jo's favorite firebrand. I liked how behind his rough nature and blazing dark eyes, and careless attitude, there is gentlenes, courage, and inner strength which Jo gradually brings out of him. And needless to say, Dan is a black sheep that Jo continues to cling on to. Yet, I liked the others as well, including rascal TOmmy, music loving Nat (especially how loyal Dan is to him), tomboy Nan, thoughtful Demi, little and big Teddy, (and Amy, who I am one of those rare people that wanted her to get with Laurie,) and adorable little Bess. All these heartwarming characters create a fire in the story which really warms me up. I've read Jo's Boys, and I like Little Men better because I can feel the spirit of things. Jo's Boys made me feel depressed. SO, this is a great book and surprizingly, the tone was very different from LIttle Women (which I liked greatly) and I just think that the firebrand is the most dashing character in it. He kind of reminds me of Laurie, except in a different, stronger way. Jo's Boys made me sad that all was to an end."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"This book is very heartwarming, and, at times, funny. The characters seem real, and Louisa May Alcott portrayed the girls, Nan and Daisy, very realistically-one a tomboy, one a \\"girl\\". They boys have funny jokes, and we feel Jo's pain after one boy, Dan, runs away. This is an excellent book...get it!"},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"I read this book 14 years ago and I can still remember how I felt while I was reading it. It was a book that touched my life and changed it in a certain way. I hope my kids will read it someday (when I have some) and that yours do it too because, when you are young, it teaches you kindness, compasion, respect, courage and many other things that we should all have in our lives."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"This is for the Kindle Edition.While I deeply love this story, and recommend it to every child, I suggest you find a different copy. This one is riddled with misspellings, confusingly incorrect pronouns and other typos. Every time there is an italicized passage of song or verse, the preceding paragraph is also italicized. It pains me to give such a wonderful piece of American literature such a bad rating, but I really wanted to warn people away from this copy."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"This sequel toLittle Women (Unabridged Classics)is a favorite classic, and second in the series that ends withJo's Boys. I read all of these books as a child, and the additional Alcott books as well.To satisfy a reading challenge, I have decided to reread some of these old favorites.Little Menwas delightful, highlighting the wonderfully compassionate nature of Jo and her husband, Professor Bhaer, whom she met in Little Women. At the end of that book, Jo's Great-aunt March, the cranky old woman who seemed too demanding at times has left her house (Plumfield) to Jo. Now Jo and Fritz (Professor Bhaer) have opened a school for boys. Most of the boys appear to be troubled or challenged in some way. The story tells us various antics and behaviors exhibited by the boys, and displays how Jo and Fritz deal with these issues.After reading the biographyLouisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women (John MacRae Books), I could see the parallels between LMA's father's ideals and their methods in dealing with the recalcitrant boys.The book was colorfully illustrated in the edition I reread, and was reminiscent of the book I read as a child.While I would always recommend any Alcott book, I must admit thatLittle Mendid not resonate with me the wayLittle Women (Unabridged Classics)did. Therefore, I must award four stars, while restating that the story was wonderful and brought back those childhood moments."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"If you are worried about the assault on sentimental values and self-reliance by badly churned out crap-4-a-buck, give your sons (and daughters) this book.

Thank you Alcott, I know this family speaks for many."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"I read this book to do a critical analysis of it.

The ancient beloved illustrated classics enjoyed as a child seem to have &quot;stuck with me,&quot; to the to the extent that even now I think of &quot;firebrand Nan&quot; from Little Men, and &quot;grasp the nettle,&quot; as she did. One reviewer mentioned Jo's &quot;maturation;&quot; part of such growth may be the ability to somehow nurture such &quot;firebrands,&quot; without changing their personal character. Jo herself seemed to prefer the un-dependent, untrammelled free spirits among the 'children.'"},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"The IndyPublish hardcover edition of this book is very badly typeset--I found several errors within the first chapter alone.

As a Louisa May book, only four (out of five that is!) I cannot write to you, reader, too much about the sumery because every chapter was a new scrape or story.

She would recommend it to anyone, and if I don't read it before hand that after I have children of my own she will give me the book and tell me to read it.She wished she had read it many years ago when I was younger because the examples of how to help little boys to become young men where amazing."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"Mention the name Louisa May Alcott, and most people will instantly think of \\"Little Women.\\" But in my mind, the less often discussed \\"Little Men\\" is just as great, if not better.The story picks up shortly after the conclusion of \\"Little Women,\\" with Jo and Frederick Bhaer running a school at Plumfield. Along with their own little Rob and Teddy, they are busy raising the neglected children of rich folks alongside the orphans they have taken in.While the boys exist in a virtual haven for good ol' fashioned fun upon the farmlike Plumfield, Mother and Father Bhaer still manage to teach them moral life lessons along with their classroom exercises.If you enjoy this book, be sure to pick up \\"Jo's Boys,\\" which takes place ten years after \\"Little Men\\" and concludes the boys' stories."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"I really enjoyed this book. i don't like to re-read books because i know what will happen, but i did re-read Little Men.

Little Men is a wonderful and enticing book about the main character in the previous book, Jo. Jo and her husband are running a school for boys although there are few exceptions. Most of the book is a about their adventures, and Jo picks up many more people to live and learn at her school, for she is running a boarding school. The book will warm your heart right from the begining and you will read on not stopping even a moment. : )"},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"This has been one of the best books I ever read!

I would strongly suggest reading this book."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"I thought this book was enchanting. It was wonderfully written.

Each child has his or her obsticals to overcome and each has their own good points. The author makes you feel as if you are in the school with them the entire time.

Let me say, that it was well worth the wait! Thank you for such a great deal on a really good book."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"If Little Men weren't an entertaining novel, it could serve as a timeless reminder of how adults can help children direct their energies in helpful ways and develop better habits. The philosophy is to provide lots of love, understanding, forgiveness, slack and carefully chosen incentives and guidance while encouraging friendships among youngsters who will balance one another out if they spend time together. You'll recognize lots of Marmee's loving approach in Jo's more rough and tumble perspective. It's a nice combination.For those who loved the child-centered world of Little Women, you'll be entranced by what Jo does to educate and raise her own boys, her nephew and niece, a troublesome neighbor girl, male boarders and some unfortunate orphans.Much of the novel focuses on the character development of two poor orphans, Nat and Dan, who find Jo's Plumfield (which she inherited near the end of Little Women) to be an unfamiliar paradise of a home and school that requires some adjusting to.Although the title is Little Men, there's plenty of focus on Daisy, twin sister to Demi, Nan, an independent girl with lots of energy, and Bess, Amy and Laurie's daughter. There are pretend balls, teas, and dramatic performances that echo those in Little Women.But the male slant that is subdued in Little Women bursts forth in Little Men as the book recounts pranks, brawls, collections of disgusting items, pillow fights, taming a colt and doing heavy chores.Like Little Women, the chapters are really short stories involving the same characters as they progress from month to month.If you haven't read Little Women, by all means start there. An important part of the fun of Little Men is finding out what happened next to Meg, Jo, Amy and Laurie."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"I have read Little Men a dozen times over and each time I either find something new...or just love the parts I already read!

I just think it is the greatest and can't wait to read Jo's Boys! P.S. I am not 1, but I don't want to share my age"},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"I read Little Men; the sequel to the classic tale of Little Women. Louisa May Alcott, the author of Little Men, Little Women, Country Cousins, Eight Cousins or the Aunt Hill, and Jo's Boys was born and raised in Concord, Massachusetts, where she did all her writing. As she got older she suffered the loss of her two sisters, both at a young age. In her books she basis her characters on herself and on people she knew, including her three sisters, her mother, and her father. Overall, she had a happy life of writing, though she never got married. Little Men was first published in 1871 by the Nelson Doubleday, Inc. This book is about life at Plumfield; the school Jo Bhaer and her husband Fritz founded. Their school allows boys (and some select girls) from all locks of life into it. Because of this reason it has become well known by many people for its kindness to all. The Bhaers show great love to every child who comes through, including boys from the street, Jo's own nieces and nephews, and her own children. They treat each boy the same and give them their own jobs to do around the farm. In turn, each child learns responsibility, respect, patients, and love at Plumfield, unlike any other school.Plumfield has many residents, but only some are characters in this book Jo Bhaer was the hero in Little Women, who ends up marries the German professor, Fritz Bhaer. She is lively as ever caring for the boys and girls of Plumfield including her own sons Teddy and Rob. Mrs. Bhaer is a gentle, caring woman who loves each child as her own. In turn the boys and girls teach her that not all lessons are learned in the classroom, in fact some are learned and she doesn't even realize it. Fritz Bhaer is a kind German professor who has a very heavy accent. He teaches the children all the regular subjects like math, science, arithmetic, and history. Father Bhaer also teaches lessons on growing crops and cultivating them, taking care of animals, and helps each child on their mishaps. For all these reasons, the boys and girls love Father Bhaer, and help him in any way they can.Nathaniel (Nat) Blake, one of the boys taken off the street and given a second chance at Plumfield. In the beginning he is a weak and sickly boy who is sent to Plumfield by Mr. Laurie, a dear friend of Jo's. When he gets their he does not now how to read or write. Gradually, kindness and determination help Nat to get stronger, less sickly, become a great reader, and an unusually good writer.Tommy Bangs, one of the boys who goes to Plumfield. He is the biggest troublemaker there, but has a kind heart so everyone can't help but love him. Overtime, he becomes less troublesome, and helps out more than anyone expected. Daisy and Demi, Jo's sister's kids also go to Plumfiled. They are very kind to each other and to everyone else. Daisy loves to play with dolls and cook for the residents of the school. Demi is a very smart boy, who listened to every one of his grandfather's stories, as a small boy. He learned a lot of his knowledge from those stories. He does have a downfall though. He loves to read, but he reads action books when he should be reading and studying for school. Father Bhaer breaks this habit quite easily when he finds out.On the street Nat met many people, including a sluggish boy Dan who was nice to him. Dan ends up coming to the school also. He is not the best boy to make friends with, because he makes a lot of trouble. As the book goes on Dan gets cured from these bad ways by Father Bhaer and becomes a very nice, gentle boy. The second female resident of Plumfield is named Nan. She is nothing like Daisy or like most girls. Nan will take dares from anyone and do them, no matter how dangerous they may be! Daisy would love another girl who would play dolls and cook with her. By the end of the book, Daisy persuades Nan to play dolls with her. Nan agrees. After they play dolls Nan starts to be more girlish, but in the end she still does dangerous things.Little Men takes place in the late 1800s in Concord, Massachusetts. At this time slavery was still in the south. The children of Plumfield had all been sent there to board, for one reason or another. Nat and Dan were sent there because they were on the streets. Nan's mother had just died and her father couldn't afford to take proper care of her anymore. Tommy's parents did not want to deal with his pranks. Daisy and Demi wanted to go to the school where their aunt and uncle taught. A boy named Jack Ford was sent there because it was cheap, and there were other reasons for the boys that come later in the book.Little Men starts out when Mr. Laurie (one of Jo's old friends) sees Nat on the streets and sends him to Plumfield, the school run by Jo and Fritz Baher. When the door to Plumfield is answered by Asia the house maid, Nat can't help but stare at all the boys playing on the staircase, floor, and sliding down the banisters. One boy slides down the banister and lands hard on his rear. Nat rushes over to make sure he is all right. The boy says he's fine and introduces himself as Tommy Bangs. Then Mrs. Jo appears. She asks to see Nat by himself. They go into a side room and Mrs. Jo then tells Nat she will be happy to have him at their school.Nat rests the first day and night he is there. The next day is Monday, the first day of school. Fritz Bhaer teaches the boys at school and he treats Nat with special care since Nat can't read or write. Nat does fine his first day. He then knows that he must work hard to please his new family, and he will do it willingly in between chores and play. All the boys were taught but Daisy would not be permitted. As a result, she was not allowed to play football, or other games the boys played. Mrs. Jo felt sorry for the little girl, so, her and Mr. Laurie go and buy a whole kitchen set for her. She adores it, and will cook anything for anyone. The boys get jealous and eventually allow her to play with them, if she cooks special treats for them. Daisy agrees, and once again Plumfield was at peace.In the middle of the book, Nat's \\"dear friend\\" Dan comes for a visit. Nat pleads with Mrs. Bhaer that Dan can stay. She isn't quite sure she trusts Dan, but she agrees that he can stay. Dan ends up bringing trouble to the school by fighting the other boys, smoking tobacco, (which was strictly prohibited by the school), and setting the Plumfield on fire by not putting out his cigarette. Dan is sent to live with another boarding school for bad children like him. Meanwhile, since Dan was sent away, they have an extra bed to spare. Mrs. Jo meets a man in town whose wife has just died and doesn't want to take care of his daughter named Nan anymore. She comes to Plumfield and she fits right in with the boys better than Daisy. Daisy is heartbroken that there is finally another girl at the school, but doesn't want to play dolls and cook. She pleads and pleads with Nan and finally Nan plays with her. Nan finds out that dolls and cooking aren't that bad and she decides to do it with Daisy more often.Nan and Daisy were cooking one day and they had an idea to have a ball. They invited Nat, Tommy, and Demi. The boys agreed to come if there would be food, and of course there would be. The boys get to the ball and everyone starts dancing. Then they sit down to have tea and pastries. When they all sat down Daisy realized that the pastries were missing! Tommy had hidden them and would not tell where he had hidden them. Nan and Daisy became furious, and ran to get Mrs. Jo. When they told her what happened she did not punish the boys. Instead, she, and the girls would not talk to the boys until they said they were sorry. They finally apologized and the girls forgave them. The night after Mrs. Jo had just came back from town and saw a straw hat and a hand sticking out from a hay bale. She gently pushed the hay aside and saw that it was Dan! He had come back! She awoke him softly and he said, \\"Mother Bhaer, I have come home.\\" Those words touched her heart and carried him into Plumfield where he made a full recovery of his broken foot and tiredness.Towards the end of the book, the children of Plumfield go huckleberry picking. Mrs. Jo doesn't want five-year-old Rob to go but Nan pleads that she'll take care of him. Mrs. Jo gives in. All the children are picking berries peacefully, until Nan and Rob say they are going to a secret spot. They go into the woods and loose their way back. Nan starts to panic, for night is coming soon, and Rob starts to cry because he is scared. Thankfully, they are found before a bear found them. Little Bess, Jo's niece comes for a visit and is treated like a little princess by all the boys. There was some peace between them all. While she is there, they put on an end of school year play. This year it is Cinderella. All the children dress up like the characters in the book and put on a magnificent play. Everyone claps and awards flowers to Mrs. Jo. They finish off the book by having a gigantic feast.In the beginning of the book Father Bhaer tells each boy he is a crop that is growing in his garden. At the end of the year, if they are all good and whole Father did a good job furnishing them. As in all plants, the boys had weeds growing that tried to stop the way, and some of them did for a time. Nat told a lie, Jack stole Tommy's money, Tommy hid Daisy's pastries, and Demi read the wrong books at the wrong time. In the end, though there were some weeds, Father Bhaer had a very successful cultivation, and looked forward to new plants next year."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"Having read it as a child, I would have told you then that it was a good book, but having re-read it now, I'd say it's just &#34;okay&#34;. Reading it, I feel like I'm talking to a mother whose children can do no wrong, though they often do. Sometimes the style of it is annoying and at times the characters unrealistic, and I find myself longing for the more natural tone of Little Women. I honestly think the author had a much greater understanding of women then men, for how she wrote the boys.

(The other off course is Little Women).Little men is a book that can make you both laugh and cry. The morals inside are more useful than any of the ten commandments. Louisa May Alcott has definetly done it again.Without giving away everything, these are some of the reasons why you will enjoy the book:1) You see Jo grow up. She is no longer the wild child who's impetuous and androgynous character often lead her to trouble. She inherits maternal qualities that you never expected Jo to have.2) You will get more insight on the professor. Although I truly wanted Teddy and Jo to get together, this book made me think otherwise. Professor Bhaer, with Jo's help, makes a delightful father to the boys. He is the one you will get most of the life morals from.3) The boys in Plumfield are definetly the key figures in the book. They create both the mischievious and melancholy stories. As I said, 'you'll laugh and cry'. Reading about these boys will make everyone reflect on their own lives.4) Teddy grows up too. If you enjoyed the young scandulous Teddy, you'll enjoy the new one even more. In little men, Teddy (like Jo) has grown into a real mature father.There are plenty more exciting things in the book. It is truly a classic masterpiece recommended to anyone who needs a lift in their spirit."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"While Little Men is not up to the literary achievement of Little Women, it is a wonderful tale for kids. It is JUST perfect for reading chapter by chapter to kids as part of an evening family night. It is as jolly as a house full of rambunctious boys could be.Jo Bhaer, nee March, has boys of her own now and boys to spare. She and the Professor take in students based on charity and kindness. Some boys are neglected, some are badly brought up, all need love, laughter and a caring environment. Plumfield is all that and more.The jolly goings-on make you wish you could have gone to school and lived at Plumfield. The book is prevented from being saccharine by the all-too-familiar themes of neglected kids, growing pains and the sad and much too early death of a favorite character from Little Women.There is lots of fun, and lots to discuss in this sequel to Alcott's marvelous Little Women. Lest you think boys won't like Alcott, I know more than one man who loves Little Women even as an adult."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"Little Men is (for those who do not know) a sequel to Little Women. Little Men is a wonderful and enticing book about the main character in the previous book, Jo. Jo and her husband are running a school for boys although there are few exceptions. Most of the book is a about their adventures, and Jo picks up many more people to live and learn at her school, for she is running a boarding school. The book will warm your heart right from the begining and you will read on not stopping even a moment. : )"},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"Please note, this is and has always been, one of my favorite stories. I am not reviewing the story Little Men, but the way it was published by IndiePublish. I would give the story 5 stars, but this presentation only two.On the bright side, the cloth binding appears very well done and should last quite a while.Unfortunately, the publisher chose to reformat all the paragraphs in the text so that like this review all margins are left justified and a blank line separates the paragraphs. If it were done well, it might have worked ok, but it was done very clumsily with the completion of a sentence often being separated from the rest of the paragraph. (I have a suspicion that the reformatting of an original text was done by using a Find-Replace function of a word processor and not checked by an editor.) This makes for some awkward readings, and probably not something I would want to put into the hands of a child.Also the text was not proofed for typos or other simple errors in punctuation, and there are some places where I could not tell what the original sentence was intended to say. Again, I expect that the only proofing done on this version was by a spellchecker and a lot of simple mistakes entered into the publication.I wish to repeat, that I love this story and have since I was a boy, and would recommend the story to any child, but would not recomment this particular volume."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"I really loved this book!

Loosely plotted, it's a good bedtime book, because each chapter or couple of chapters presents a complete vignette. After all, you don't always want to be reading a book that keeps you up till all hours! Life at Plumfield is almost idyllic, with just enough conflict to keep things moving along. When I was a child, I longed for a museum like theirs, and a miniature cast-iron stove, and all kinds of things--the book was wonderful for my imagination.

It follows events in their lives as married women, and the lives of their children. This book seems to be more popular with boy readers than \\"Little Women\\", which often appeals to girls between the ages of 11-15 (depending on their individual reading level). Perhaps this is linked to the fact that there are more main characters who are boys in \\"Little Men\\". The innocent quality of romance and adventure in this plot, as well as the emphasis on morality and family relationships, make this a good gift for those concerned about the types of literature their children are reading. Adults buying this for children should note that the moral aspects of the story generally reinforce 19th century Protestant Christian values (its your choice whether that impacts your purchase or not!).This is another book that has continued to be my favorite 20 years after reading it for the first time."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"I really liked this book because it was really exciting and fun all at the same time!

Hehe, well, in my opinion anyway. If you liked Little Women, you should read Little Men. If you thought that Little Women was too girly or feminine, read Little Men.

It's a story about a bunch of orphans that have there own little special talents. The story is really a cute little story, but lacks a sense of plot. There's no action. I really think this book is so boring I fell a sleep every 5 minutes. Don't buy this book! If you don't like action and you like all that cute [stuff] read the counterpart, Little Women.

There are many really wonderful sequences in this story, though it doesn't really have much of a plotline. In fact, there are even some very creative and uncannily modern methods of parenting to drill the boys (yes, there are a few girls present, too) into well-meaning gentlemen one day. A do-gooder's fantasy that really gushes with sappy maternal cooing and fussing at times, but overall it's a very remarkable book ever written by a proper lady of the Victorian era."},{"Title":"Little men: Life at Plumfield with Jo's boys","review":"Little Men is the funniest of all the three books.

The novel is much more sophisticated and very touching. The movie basically concentrates on Nat and Dan, but the novel is about every single boy and girl. If you've seen the movie and didnt like it, guess what, try the novel! My fav't characters are everybody. Old Chirper(Nat), Dan, Demi, Daisy, Tommy, Franz, Commodore(Emil), Nan, Princess(Bess), little Ted, Rob, Jack..too many people.

You have no choice but to feel compassion for the boys and girls of Jo's house, and the innocent that they maintain throughout the book.

The book is a revenge to a dead woman, who had a love affair with the author's first husband for over ten years, but with the author's full consent. Based on the author's own account and contrary to the explanation given in this book, one can see clearly that Ayn Rand was not far from truth in her indictment on Brandens."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Ayn Rand was not lonely, she was full of joy. This is a ridiculous assault to anyone with the ability to read and reason. Any person can learn about Rand's life through documents, her works of fiction and non-fiction, countless interviews and personal accounts of friends and aquaintences. Anyone that would read up on her life and her philosophy would discount this book as lies. You do not even need to subscribe to her philosophy or agree with her ideas to see this book is written by someone that has no understanding of Rand's ideas and Philosophy."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"The defenders of this book criticize its critics by attributing defense of Ayn Rand to blind loyalty. I grant that one should always be open to the possibility of flaws in a human being. But why should we blindly accept that Ayn Rand's perception was flawed, but not question Branden's perception? Branden every once in a while says that Ayn Rand \\"must\\" have had such-and-such psychological trait. Let's grant her such claims. But then Branden herself must have been affected by Ayn Rand's affair with her husband, yes? So, if we are to take Branden's own psychological analyses seriously, we must apply the same to her and dismiss this work as hopelessly and inevitably biased. Branden, if guided by her own psychological experiences, cannot reliably analyze Ayn Rand's psychology, and can only report facts. But much (perhaps even most) of this biography is psychological speculation based purely on Branden's perception! The flaw in this approach is obvious. Rather than the author of a biography, Branden should have been a source used by an objective biographer who did not know Ayn Rand on a deeply personal level.It's hard to tell if Branden is deliberately involved in a smear campaign. She does compliment Ayn Rand as a person in some cases and fairly consistently praises Rand's novels. But then again, if I'm not mistaken, Griswold complimented Poe's fiction while simultaneously destroying Poe's reputation in a posthumous biography.Which raises another question: why wasn't this published when Rand was still alive, and had opportunity to make an attempt to contradict some of its claims?Overall, a highly suspect biography, even barring the work by Rand supporters to systematically refute it. Fundamentally flawed."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Barbara Branden is a former protege of Ayn Rand. She is also (as the book amply demonstrates) a pretentious mediocrity who appears to be able to offer the world nothing substantive, save a vitriolic, snotty \\"tell-all\\" style blast against her former mentor and supposed \\"friend\\".Barbara should have known that a book like this would be exactly the sort of thing Anti-Rand/Anti-Objectivism/Anti-Libertarian types would love -- a \\"juicy tell-all\\" purporting to demonstrate that one of the greatest public champions of socio-economic freedom was really just a shrewish, slutty nutcase.Branden takes exquisite, almost tragically obvious care to paint herself as the wholly-innocent victim of the machinations of Nathaniel Branden (her husband at the time), and the supposedly megalomaniacal villian, Rand. Her \\"sympathetic\\" portrayal of Rand's husband Frank O'Connor manages to show, instead, a pathetic, drunken schmuck, completely browbeaten and psychologically over-powered by his domineering shrew of a wife.As with NB's retelling of events in \\"Judgment day\\", the Brandens portay themselves as the archtypal \\"innocent, impressionable teenagers destroyed by the vile, capitalistic evil-ness of Ayn Rand\\". The truth is doubtless somewhat less flattering in their regard.It's very ironic this book is taken at all seriously -- given that at least half of it is almost word-for-word reprint of a biographical sketch of Rand that Ms. Branden had published in the hard-to-find book \\"Who is Ayn Rand?\\" in 1968, shortly before the break.No details of Rand's philosophy are given -- not even in summary form -- with the exception of several long-winded and preachy passages misquoting Rand's ideas, and then denouncing them as \\"dangerous\\".To top it all off, after spending 200-plus pages painting Rand as a deceitful, power-mad poseur, Branden devotes the end of the book to detailing the tremendous impact Rand's advocacy of socio-political freedom and \\"rational self-interest\\" have had on the culture at large.All in all, this book is an obnoxious attempt by a former \\"friend\\" to urinate on a dead woman's grave.I gave it 1 star, but it deserves far less."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Either the contents of this book are basically true, in which case Rand was not the model of 'objectivity' she pretended to be, or they are false, in which case the Brandens - two of Rand's closest associates ever, who knew, publicly represented, and practised her 'philosophy' for many years - are incapable of objectivity themselves. Either way, 'Objectivism' is misnamed."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"This is not a true biography of the great philosopher. It is a vitriolic exercise in hatred, riddled from beginning to end with self-contradictions. For instance, Branden insists that Miss Rand as a child conceived a life-long neurotic fear of physical reality. Yet only a few pages later she describes the young Ayn Rand joyously climbing a mountain on a vacation in Switzerland ... and later in life, happily taking the throttle of a New York Central diesel locomotive!Branden did know Ayn Rand in person, and did conduct a series of biographical interviews with her, resulting in the publication of a biographical essay in the 1962 book \\"Who Is Ayn Rand?\\" In the later 1960's they parted ways. Miss Rand went on with her vastly productive life, writing ground-breaking books that apply rational principles to the problems of living. Branden, on the other hand, turned Ayn Rand bashing into a pathetic career.And here's a key to what makes \\"Passion\\" so self-contradictory. Branden was too lazy to write a whole new book. When she came to write \\"Passion,\\" she bodily incorporated huge portions of her earlier work from \\"Who Is Ayn Rand?\\", connecting them with newly-written dashes of vitriol-to result in a bizarre pastiche of contradictory counter-claims. On one page we read how great Ayn Rand's achievement was, and how benevolent her character. On the next page we read how viciously neurotic she allegedly was, and how destructive to those around her. Does Branden really expect her readers not to be smart enough to relate one passage to another?With the publication of Miss Rand's letters in 1995, and the discovery of a thousand letters from her family in Russia (puncturing Branden's thesis of a neurotic hatred between them), one would think Branden would realize her hatchet job is just too unbelievable, and retire from the public scene. But like a phony psychic who's been exposed a dozen times yet still goes on bilking the gullible, she is still peddling her wares. She even managed to have her pseudo-biography made into a movie, by the same producers who brought us \\"Beverly Hills Bordello.\\"But the only \\"passion\\" in this book is the passion of Barbara Branden's hatred for virtue. There is precious little truth. She doesn't even manage to get the name of Ayn Rand's father right-he was named Zinovy, not Fronz! (...).I had the pleasure of meeting Ayn Rand in 1971, and of seeing first-hand how gracious she was with her many fans. I found her a genuinely polite, warm, and considerate person, who seemed serenely at peace with herself.Can the same be said of her detractors?"},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Ayn Rand was indeed a highly antisocial woman and the followers who ape her thereby risk making themselves equally unfit for life in human society. However, Barbara Branden is to be commended for writing such an excellent biography of this strange and narcissistic figure."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"An excellent expose of the cultic figure of Ayn Rand.

It contradicts itself--it contradicts known facts--it contradicts Mr. Branden's memoir (which is no better)--and it contradicts the evidence from Journals and Letters of Ayn Rand. It is also very poorly written. The movie based on it was still more fictionalization on top of fictionalization. Just ghastly!!"},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"During the 60's and 70's, Ayn Rand lead the Objectivist philosophical movement that she founded through her writings, most notably Atlas Shrugged and the Virtue of Selfishness. Her lectures at the Ford Hall Forum in Boston were yearly sold-out events. Her philosophy of objective reason over emotion and feelings, of self-reliance and the natural rights of the able were in stark contrast to the competing liberal movements during the wild ferment of the 60's and 70's.Among her closest disciples were Nathaniel and Barbara Branden. Nathaniel, a much younger, brilliant psychologist was her choice as intellectual heir. And something more... Barbara Branden, Nathaniel's wife at the time, wrote what she later repudiated as a puff-piece biography of Rand. After many years Barbara Branden went back and wrote a fuller, more human biography with details she was able to glean from the normally reticent Rand, who edited away her past as so much irrelevant junk. Even Rand's name is a nom de guerre taken in part from her Remington-Rand typewriter. And Barbara also included the controversial and frankly sad aspects of Rand's life as well.One incident in the book points to Rand's complexity and inflexibility. She was a lifelong smoker. She would often say that statistics prove nothing; that even if statistics say that smoking could cause cancer it says nothing about if YOU will get cancer, which of course is true. Ironically, Rand contracted lung cancer, however she refused to amend her outspoken opinion on smoking even on her deathbed.This book is a rare glimpse of a complicated genius from an insider's point of view. Barbara wasn't just a bystander, she was a participant in the almost larger-than-life drama that surrounded Ayn Rand. Rand attempted to live as the characters in her novels, with sometimes disastrous results. Barbara does an admirable job of writing about Rand, without rancor but without glossing over some of the more unsavory aspects of Rand's life. At the same time, she acknowledges Rand's greatness. Not everyone is happy with Barbara Branden's version of Rand's life, but if you are at all interested in the writings and the woman, you must read this unique and valuable work."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"I am currently a law student who has an undergraduate degree in philosophy. I have spent much of my adult life studying Objectivism and integrating many of its principles into my life. I am not an \\"Objectivist,\\" but I do consider myself a student of the philosophy.This book is not a fanatical denouncement of Rand, as some of the reviewers giving it a 1 star have claimed. Those that have read this book and have calmly reflected upon it, have absolutely no valid justification in giving it a 1. The author points out her own experiences with Ms. Rand, and gives her own interpretation as to Ms. Rand's psychology. The overall feeling of the book towards Ms. Rand is one of honest admiration, sincere fondness, and regretful sorrow. The theme throughout the book is that Ms. Rand struggled, achieved profound success, and experienced deep tragedy.Persons giving this book a 5 star rating, then going on to attack Ms. Rand's philosophy are despicably dishonest. The author's treatment of Objectivism is very positive. The only objections she has towards the philosophy are some of its applications to psychology (regarding free will and the origin of emotions). The author only really denounces the minority of individuals in the Objectivist movement that lack independence. If you want to understand Objectivism, read and think for yourself. But do not understand it through this biography, or the weak context-dropping reviews on this site. I suggest starting with some of the fiction if you aren't familiar with philosophy or the non-fiction if you are (either way, read the fiction eventually!) Then judge for yourself whether this philosophy is a great, complex, and powerful achievement, with positive practical application to all realms of man's life, or whether it is the 'over simplification' which the pseudo-intellectuals ramble on about in their reviews.I give this book a 4 because it doesn't adequately discuss Objectivism, which is central to understanding Ayn Rand. The author does make clear that any claimed problems in Ms. Rand's psychology were not a result of Objectivism, or vice versa. Ms. Rand was a great woman that gave to this world amazing works of fiction, and a philosophy which has already significantly impacted our culture. I do not know if everything said is correctly interpreted, or if every relevant context was given, but I do not believe that the author was being dishonest. If you want to get an inside look at Ms. Rand, read this book, and make sure to read some other sources too. Do not judge her philosophy based on your conclusion on this book, and do not judge her completely based just on what you have read in this book."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Barbara Branden was associated with Ayn Rand from 1950 until 1968, when she and her husband had their tragic split with Rand. In 1986, she published this biography of Rand. In light of the split between the Brandens and Rand, I don't think anyone would claim that this is the \\"last word\\" on Rand. Yet it is a well researched biography based on approximately 200 interviews of people who knew Rand at various times in her life. Branden also interviewed Rand extensively before their split.Unfortunately, Branden didn't have access to Rand's papers, nor was she able to interview some of those who knew Rand best from the time of the split until Rand's death in 1982.For reasons I've discussed on the web, I don't think James Valliant and others have undercut the description of Rand presented here."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"If you wish to continue hero worship or hatred of Ayn Rand, don't read this book. If you want a balanced view of this great Philosopher and Writer, it is a must read. I made an important decision after reading this book. I took my copies of \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" and \\"The Fountainhead\\" and donated them to a local library. It gave me closure. It is a happy ending to the story that psychologist Nathaniel Branden was to go on professionally and evolve beyond Objectivism. He puts out an excellent tape called \\"The Benefits and Hazards of the Philosophy of Ayn Rand.\\" All praise to Barbara Branden for this book. Highly recommend reading Nathaniel Branden's \\"The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem,\\" his opus. Enjoy hearing the good parts of Objectivism combined with an understanding of human emotion in that book."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"This is an excellent, literary, balanced biography.Barbara Branden gives the reader a detailed look at the real life behind the romantic fiction of Ayn Rand, beginning with Rand's youth in Russia and her struggles as an immigrant to the US in the 1920's.Branden lauds the virtue, insight, and intellect of this powerful novelist while also providing an &quot;insider's perspective&quot; into Rand's personal life and illuminating its triumphs and tragedies.Anyone interested in Rand's works,whether a proponent or opponent of her philosophy, will find this biography a fascinating must-read."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"The memoirs/biographies of Barbara and Nathaniel Branden are musts for anyone seriously interested in Ayn Rand and her work. This is my \\"two-fer\\" review of both books, which should be read together.The young Brandens' encounter with Rand was the most important experience of their lives. Her force of personality and formidable intellectual powers pulled them into a strange menage-a-quatre with Rand and her husband, Frank O'Connor, even as the Brandens launched the Objectivist movement. Both of them came away simultaneously transformed by Objectivism and personally disillusioned with Rand. The Branden-Rand break caused Rand great pain (disguised as moral indignation) and led to the almost-total isolation of her final years. The picture that emerges from both books is that of a woman caught in a self-created storybook world, eager for the companionship of equals, obsessed with control, unwilling to meet the world except on nearly impossible terms, trying to break out of her emotional-sexual prison -- then rejected by the smart and ambitious man twenty-five years her junior who had made her the center of an explosive and influential movement but who also discovered his need to lead his own life and make his own mark.Barbara Branden's book is mostly biography and marked the first step towards an objective judgment of Rand. The Passion of Ayn Rand is detached and wistful, while Judgment Day is an aggressive, sometimes painfully honest, memoir. Nathaniel Branden was still wrestling with himself when he wrote it. He recounts with pride how he emerged, wounded but intact, from his break with Rand and how his experience as both guru and victim of a cult-like movement affected his later work in psychology. On the other hand, The Passion of Ayn Rand projects no sense of struggle. Barbara Branden deftly and quietly identifies aspects of Rand's psychology that started at a young age and became more pronounced after she finished Atlas Shrugged: her extreme positive and negative idealizations of other people, her habits of \\"editing\\" reality and rewriting history, her emotional repression and consequent angry outbursts. Nathaniel Branden traces how these tendencies spun themselves out in Rand's novels, her philosophy, and the movement he created. Rand's lack of self-knowledge extracted a steep price. Of such stuff are cults made, he concludes.Fortunately, most people come to Rand by reading her books, not through the official Objectivist movement that she authorized, her attempt at complete control of her reputation, even beyond the grave. But it won't do, as many followers think, to accept her novels and philosophy while eschewing the official Ayn Rand cult. The complete Rand, both person and work, needs independent examination. The sledgehammer moralizing and Platonizing tendencies of her fiction are inescapable flaws of not just her personality, but her novels and philosophy. The extremes of emotional repression to which she subjected herself would have done in a person of lesser willpower, but she expected those who came to her to similarly contort themselves and to subordinate their own judgment to hers. A powerful, independent mind like Nathaniel Branden's could do this only for so long. The isolation and decline of her last decade were a result of the same determined willpower that made her novels possible. It also kept Rand and her followers from seeing her philosophical views as a flawed starting outline of a philosophy, hardly a complete system, and sprinkled with unproven assertions (\\"benevolent universe,\\" \\"all problems solvable by reason,\\" \\"existence = identity,\\" etc., permeated by conceptual sleights of hand and her confusion of consistency with completeness and necessity).These tendencies have had bad consequences for the Rand-inspired libertarian and Objectivist movements. They drove an unnecessary wedge between herself and conservatives. Her obsession with control and self-isolation prevented her from seeing the right arguments for a free society (no one can plan or control society or history or should pretend to) and led to her isolation from potential secular allies like Hayek, Popper, and Friedman. Emotional repression leads to disowning the self that in turn creates alienation from others. Are these not the very tendencies that libertarians suffer from and which seriously impair their ability to influence politics? Conservatives have gotten much further, not because of religion, but because they do not practice emotional repression or repudiate human nature. Rand's followers continue to hobble themselves with her faulty \\"psychoepistemology\\" that reduces thinking to conceptual abstraction and people to ideas. It's what made her think that John Galt and Dagny Taggart could be real people and not the allegories they so obviously are. Rand's impossible ideal was humans as self-creating gods, with their minds and lives fully subject to volitional control. For this reason, she rejected religion. But she nearly rejected evolution as well, because it implies that we are all subject to super-individual and unconscious forces, albeit wholly natural ones. Nothing was to interfere with Rand's fantasy of control -- that was her passion and her tragedy.POSTSCRIPT: The 1990s saw new, important critical work on Rand and her writings. They constitute an excellent start for interested readers, once they've digested the Brandens' memoirs. Start with the official exposition in Leonard Peikoff's Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand. Then move on to the best of the sympathetic criticism:- The Ideas of Ayn Rand, Ronald Merrill- The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand, eds. Douglas Den Uyl & Douglas Rasmussen- The Ayn Rand Companion (2nd ed., The New Ayn Rand Companion), Mimi Gladstein- Ayn Rand: The Russian Radical, Chris Matthew Sciabarra (a wealth of historical and biographical information giving Rand's ideas their full context - flawed thesis, but the most thorough scholarly treatment so far)Even a major book like Sciabarra's only scratches the surface. Rand's allegorizing tendencies are linked to her rejection of her Russian childhood, but also to a thread in Russian literature (traceable, through Christianity, back to Plato) that views persons as embodiments of ideas (e.g., Dostoevsky). The style of her fiction can be viewed as \\"individualist realism,\\" in opposition to the much cruder \\"socialist realism\\" popular in the 1930s and enforced in Soviet Russia. Rand's knee-jerk hostility to religion needs a fresh perspective in light of the mysticism of Orthodox Russia. Comparing Rand to other Russian refugees (like her contemporary and fellow Petersbergians Nabokov and Berberova) would be fascinating. (Russia's exit from the never-never land of Marxism has allowed rediscovery of its real history.) Someone should fully identify the influence of Nietzsche she supposedly outgrew with The Fountainhead. The Nietzschean \\"lone wolf\\" mentality clung to her and her work to the very end. Neither Rand nor her followers have ever produced a coherent theory of society. Neither did Nietzsche, but he knew himself well enough to reject movements, politics, and systematizing. Rand did not, and an intellectually sterile cult was the result.Rand constructed her philosophical beliefs to force the conclusions she wanted - this is obvious in her esthetic views, but it also holds in the rest. Attempts to repair and complete her philosophy lead back to the standard Enlightenment mix of natural rights, utilitarianism, and historical analogy, with Aristotle as one intellectual ancestor among others. These theories remain the backbone of existing conservative and classical liberal thought, at least in the English-speaking world. Could such an exercise lead to anything else?The hostile reviews on Amazon of the Brandens' books only provide more evidence of the mind-warping effects of cultism on nominally intelligent people. A pathetic recent attack on the Brandens falls into the same category. I could tell you not to read them -- but you should, so you can see what cults are like."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"I first read Ayn Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; when I was 16. It had a profound influence on me and I went on to read all of her published works. In one essay, Rand wrote a brief &quot;P.S.&quot; at the end, stating that Nathaniel Branden was no longer assoctiated with her or her philosophy. Given that she had proclaimed Nathaniel her closest associate in the Objectivism movement, it was all the more puzzling that she never explained why the break. This books explains why. It details some of the dark side of Rand's philosophy - the rationalizations of Rand, the unquestioning (read, unthinking) loyalty of some of her followers, but much of it praises Rand's philosophy and sense of life."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"I had read several of Rand's works and interestingly enough began with the non-fiction ones. I saw the movie on TV and thought it failed completely in presenting her revolutionary ideas. The movie centered (of course) on the odd affair between Rand and her first disciple, Nathaniel Brandon with both his wife's and Rand's husband knowledge and acceptance.The book, though, goes into detail that the movie could not. It explains ideas and thoughts and though processess that no film could ever portray. We read about a young refugee from Soviet Russia escaping to the one country that offered unlimited freedom. There has always been disagreement over whether our attitudes are born with us or developed by life experiences. In Rand's case, it appears she was born this way, displaying an odd, rampant individualism from an early age.We see her struggles, her marriage to Frank, her first failures as an author before the one great break - THE FOUNTAINHEAD which is still, in my opinion, the best. (The portrayal of Gail is simply unsurpassable.) We meet Nathaniel and the growing group of worshipers. Unlike others, I do not entirely blame Rand for this reaction - she accepted what others offered, a very human emotion.At some point she decided that she wanted the young follower so they had an affair which degraded everyone involved. During this time she wrote THE book, ATLAS SHRUGGED, and reveled in its success. Surprisingly, despite her accent, appearance, domineering personality and rejection by the intellecutal left she became a much coveted speaker, particularly for theoretical subjects. Above all, she was a woman of ideas whose first concern was promulgating those ideas.She has been attacked because she was demanding, for an affair, for a discrepancy between her public ideas and her private life. All are true but her popularity rests on her so-called philosophy which is, in its essence, the slogan of REASON magazine...&quot;Free markets, free minds.&quot; She espoused freedom and attacked collectivism in all its many variants - Naziism, Communism, Socialism, tribalism and religion. It was her espousal of capitalism and individualism that set her at odds with the &quot;progressive&quot; artistic world and, simultaneously, made her such a hit with &quot;ordinary&quot; people. A remarkable book for an even more remarkable life."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"A lot has been written about this book, and I'm not inclined to add much to the discussion. For whatever its flaws, it remains the only full-length biographical study of Ayn Rand. Barbara Branden's perspective as an insider who knew Rand better than almost anyone else has its advantages, but also its drawbacks.Two biographical studies of Rand are due this year, one by Anne Heller and another by Jennifer Burns."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Barbara Branden (and Nathaniel Branden) were two of Ayn Rand's closest associates from the time after publishing The Fountainhead through Atlas Shrugged and \\"the Collective\\" years. In the late 1960s there was a split between the Branden's and Ayn Rand following what Branden alleges was a 14 year affair between Rand and Nathaniel.In this book, Barbara Branden formulates a biography of Ayn Rand, from her childhood in Soviet Russia to her early years in Hollywood to her death in the early 1980s. She portrays Rand as a powerful mind who had the ability to captivate people that met her and as a woman of great genius. She also portrays Rand as having an array of psychological problems, particularly during the writing of Atlas Shrugged and the years that followed. She argues that Rand often repressed many of her psychological desires and wants in favor of her rational faculties, often at the expense of others. She details Rand's alleged affair with Nathaniel Branden and the events that lead to their ultimate split in 1968.I haven't read James Valliant's response to this book yet, however I am familiar with the standard Objectivist response to *anything* by a Branden. I don't think that Branden was as unfair to Rand. While she does point out Rand's failures, she also demonstrates Rand's powerful philosophy, intense motivation, hard work, and her genius. Frankly, I could care less for the drama between the Brandens and Objectivism. However, I do care about the work of Rand and the story of her life. I highly recommend this book to both Objectivists and non-Objectivists interested in Rand and her philosophy."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"A better biography I can not imagine. It is clear Barbara Branden loved Ayn Rand, and still to date accepted (at least when the book was written) the many things Ayn Rand, in her writing, got right. You can recognise the Ayn Rand style in Branden's work, and how well done it is. I can say from experience that to write with the understated apparent simplicity Ayn Rand used in, say THE FOUNTAINHEAD, is not easy at all. Barbara Branden though is not merely mimicking Ayn Rand; but she made that style her own, and as a tribute.This biography also rings true: both in being logically self-consistent, true to other accounts I've read, and consistent in many ways with Miss Rand's own works. [Whereas those Objectivists who have elevated Miss Rand to the status of a guru, and in so doing have betrayed the \\"moral commandment\\" from ATLAS SHRUGGED: Thou shalt think, for thyself.]It is possible to separate principles from personality; if Ayn Rand did not always live up to her ideals, that is both shame on her and proof that no one is above mistakes. I am in 95% agreement with her ideas because they are true. And this book should be read, because it is clearly the truth.Objectivists who reject this truth of their heroine, just because they would prefer to believe that she was super-human, are betraying the example of John Galt who exalted the truth. Here is a syllogism for these Objectivists: God, according to Miss Rand, does not exist; self-evidently, Miss Rand did exist; therefore, Miss Rand could not have been God...."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Despite some reviewers' claims of this book's unreliability, I found it to be extremely believable. I have read most of Rand's books, including her posthumously-published journals, and the kinds of contradictions I detected appear to arise from point of view rather than dishonesty. Barbara Branden does not attempt to hide the fact that she is writing from her own point of view, and of course the reader should take this into account.This book is not about destroying Rand, as some reviewers seem to think. Quite to the contrary, it celebrates her genius and her achievements. But it also shows the pitfalls of a philosophy that forces a man (or woman) to put himself on a pedestal and does not permit fallibility.As Branden points out, Rand failed to look inward. Perhaps she was afraid of what she would find, or perhaps in her fervor to avoid subjective thinking she went too far into stubbornness. Whatever the reason, Branden's telling of this story reveals how she apparently shunned the introspection that is essential in order to live one's life objectively.I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys Rand's work. Those who truly understand not only Rand's philosophy, but also her personality (as revealed in the characters of Howard Roark and Dagny Taggart), will empathize with her in her struggle to be understood, and will feel sorrow at her failure to live up to her own high standards. Perceptive readers will come away with a clearer understanding of who she was and how to apply her ideas to their lives in a productive way."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"By focusing on Rand's triumphs and failures in her personal life, Branden presents a story as dramatic as Rand's fiction. I've often noticed a disparity between her explicit philosophy and her style of dealing with people. Even in some of her non-fiction she has a bitter, impatient, and excessively critical tone while presenting some of the most positive pro-life philosophy ever written. This biography helps to explain the many aspects of this complex woman. My only regret is that Branden does not explain Rand's philosophical achievement."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"If you're interested in the life of Ayn Rand read this book, and then Nathaniel Branden's \\"My Years With Ayn Rand.\\"Yes, both these books show Ayn Rand failing to live up to her own ideals, but don't we all fail that test? Rand's genius was in formulating ideas and putting them down in a powerfully lucid form, not in setting a personal example. I can't say having read Barbara's and Nathaniel's books has affected my view of Rand's Objectivist philosophy--and why should it? A good idea is a good idea, no matter what the faults of it's author.As for the authors, both Barbara's and Nathaniel's books are first rate. While I can't vouch for the accuracy of the details, they seem to ring true. While Barbara's was a true biography, Nathaniel's was his tell-all of his long-running affair with Rand. This difference in perspective allows the books to compliment one another. Even after many years I still can't decide which one was better."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Barbara Branden admits to never seeing Frank Occoner drunk.!!!The source of the rumor that Ayn's husband was an alcoholic and who spent thousands of hours with Ayn had never seen the alleged alcoholic drunk."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"I have read both this Rand biography and the one by Barbara Branden's ex-husband, Nathaniel. I've also read the more recent book written by prosecuting attorney, James Valliant.After reading Valliant's book, \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics\\" -which includes Ayn Rand's own journal entries written during the last two years of her relationship with the Brandens plus Valliant's analyses of both Brandens' books about Rand- I found it impossible to conclude anything but that Barbara Branden's Rand biography is a shameless, rear-end-saving, web of deceit.Valliant's book gives the reader something neither \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand\\" nor Nathaniel Branden's \\"Judgement Day\\" could (or would) have given you: Ayn Rand's own words regarding the affair and the Brandens, while she still considered them friends. These were journals written during the time when the Branden's were doing their worst manipulating of and lying to Rand. Valliant's book offers crucial evidence on Rand's character and those of her close personal \\"biographers\\",the Brandens, which both of the Brandens' books leave out.So if you're going to read Barbara Branden's book, I'd recommend an immediate follow-up with Valliant's \\"Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics\\" for a well-rounded view of the truth. If you can stomach reading both books in close proximity to each other."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"The author questioned Rand's mental faculty stealthily through the negative.For example Miss Rand took diet pills but did not suffer from mental disorders.Branden drew a correlation between mental disorder and diet pills, which she did notprove. Then she denied the existence of the mental disorder that she wanted thereader to retain. The author has a monstrous approach!"},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"I read this book when it was first published, and I pointed out its existence to a young Objectivist manning a table of Objectivist/ Rand literature in an open space at York University. He called the book &quot;a pack of half-backed lies&quot;. Well, it does read like a novel, a novel by Iris Murdoch, say, in which intelligent and very serious people do very silly, very stupid, and sometimes evil things. All the while these oh-so-serious people are rationalizing madly--while keeping up a facade of the sort of respectability that they affect to despise. It's a very funny book, and it's a real feat for an author to make even the death of the main character an occasion for stinging satire (you see, Rand had &quot;reasoned&quot; that the allegations of a link between lung cancer and smoking were a collectivist plot. . .). N. Branden's Judgment Day adds more information, and his version of the slapping scene is as funny as B. Branden's version, but generally he's not as good a writer as his ex-wife."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Branden's book remains the only full-length biography of Rand, although new primary material arranged in chronological order has been published as &quot;The Journals of Ayn Rand.&quot; Referring to the journals, Rand's own notebooks which she never herself published, the arbitrary nature of Branden's work is clear. As an example, Branden draws dubious psychological conclusions from a photo of Rand as a child in Russia, a photo in which Branden is not even sure who is Rand!Branden's book is more novel than biography, a novel in which the writer's conclusions are clearly motivated by something other than a desire for the truth. Readers should not be duped into thinking that Branden was close to Rand; for the last 14 years of Rand's life she had no contact with Branden, and Branden had no access to important primary materials. Avoid this book, and read the Journals instead."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"This book fills in many of the gaps of Ayn Rand's colourful life and shows how her rollercoaster life with its highs and lows is a brilliant story in the same vein as her novels.It details her struggles against poverty, against editors who refused to publish her books and against the critics who savaged her plays and her philosophy. It describes her relationships with her family, her husband and the unusual nature of their marriage, her friends and how many of her friendships were destroyed and broken and why; who she believed had betrayed her; and her struggle against herself in refusing to acknowledge that she might ever be wrong.This book contains pain, bitterness, sadness and regret but also happiness, joy, pleasure and fulfilment. It is generally sympathetic and full of admiration for Rand and confirms not only that she was one of the world's greatest intellectuals but how her philosophy has had profound and far-reaching effects to this day."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"After reading this interesting biography of Ayn Rand, I am confirmed in my opinion that she simply didn't measure up to the standards of human decency. Why Branden continues to have any respect for her is beyond me."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"This book is a smear job against Ayn Rand so that Barbara Branden can clean up her own tarnished reputation while cashing in on Ayn Rand's fame.James S. Valliant, in his book The Passion of Ayn Rand's Critics: The Case Against the Brandens, thoroughly dissects the claims made by the Brandens against Ayn Rand. He then references Ayn Rand's own personal journals to systematically demonstrate how Barbara and Nathaniel Branden deceived and exploited Ayn Rand for years for their own illegitimate aims. Even after Ayn Rand's death, the Brandens continue to cash in on Ayn Rand's self-made fame and her original philosophy of Objectivism."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"How sad the day this bloodsucker washed upon American shores. A heavily accented (not Romanian but close enough) smug know-it-all with a protruding set of choppers and a penchant for wearing capes, Ayn Rand found her first victim in the hapless Frank O'Connor, who served as her ticket to ride and wound up her shell of a husband. Add to the pile of corpses the Brandens (the author and her husband) and countless other victims of her vicious philosophy, and what you have in Barbara Branden's biography is the tale of a nutcase, who when not railing against altruism didn't believe one lung later that excessive cigarette smoking led to her lung cancer.While B. Branden claims to have loved Rand, her biography and the movie based on it can do nothing but damage the reputation of this Russian export. Furthermore, with the mass communication of the Internet it is only a matter of time before those who have a better grasp on reality are able to drive a stake through the heart of this ghoul."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"The author of this book is the sister of Ayn Rand's heir and mouthpiece, Leonard Peikoff. He hasn't spoken to her since she wrote this book. It's all about the sordid love affair between Ayn Rand and Barbara Branden's husband, Nathaniel Branden. He's no prize himself, but Ayn Rand was one of the most bizarre characters ever to surround herself with a quasi-religious cult.This book might help steer some youngsters away from \\"Objectivism.\\" (Ayn Rand is still, perhaps surprisingly, popular among college undergraduates.) Of course, the trashy love affair might just make them curious for more."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"For years I had heard of ATLAS SHRUGGED and Ayn Rand without knowing anything about the book or its controversial author. In college I had the opportunity to take a course in biography and this was one of the books we were required to read. It started a fascination with Rand that continues today.It is amazing that Barbara Branden could provide such an objective look at Ayn Rand, considering the circumstances and history of their friendship and professional association. Regardless of Branden's endorsement of the Objectivist movement, her personal history with Rand was certainly not one filled with enjoyable moments, especially toward the latter stages of Rand's association with Branden's husband Nathaniel.Be that as it may, Branden provides a look at Ayn Rand from the inside circle, as it were. Branden provides an investigation of the author struggling to publish and then struggling even more to parlay literary success into a philosophical revolution the likes of which have not been seen since Nietzche. The story is well written, and Branden's personal involvement with Rand is neither edited nor 'touched up,' at least from this observer's perspective.Those who have heard of Rand's work but are unsure regarding its meaning and scope might want to try this biography as an introduction. Knowing the person behind the story will shed lightsome of the 20th century's most controversial literature."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Unlike the fawning bios by Ayn Rand \\"disciples\\", this bio gives you a fair and balanced story of the life of Ayn Rand. Instead of presenting her as some super-guru and putting her on a high pedestal, this shows her in all her humanity, and shows that Rand, like the rest of us, was just as fallible, just as irrational. She was cruel as well as kind, rational as well as wildly irrational. Good as well as bad.Branden did a fabulous job at writing Rand's story.Highly recommended - especially for those Rand fans who refuse to see that Ayn Rand was first and foremost a human being."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"This is the extremely interesting story of the life of an intellectual, self-centered, highly driven and accomplished writer who appeared (based on this and Nathaniel Branden's account) to psychologically smother the people close to her. Despite what other reviewers have said, I think it is valuable to explore, in addition to factual details about Rand's life, the opinions harbored by those who knew her best.It's also indicative, in one way or another, to see Barbara Branden's repetitive use of words and phrases Ayn Rand developed and employed -- expressions such as &quot;benevolent&quot; and &quot;sense of life&quot; and others. On one hand that appears fawning and imitative, but another point of view might arise from understanding one of Rand's goals, which was to supply the language for describing and justifying the principles she illuminated. If those words and expressions function as intended, hey, by all means go with them. (But I did hear or read someplace that Leonard Piekoff conferred to such extent with Rand while writing his first book, &quot;The Ominous Parallels,&quot; that she hammered on his wording so much that it became indistinguishable from her own.)It's also noteworthy to see those who attack Rand's so-named philosophy of objectivism by attacking her personally, much of their verbal weaponry supplied by this and Nathaniel's books. Rand did not develop the principles of objectivism any more than Isaac Newton developed gravity; rather, they both simply recognized what existed and worked to define it. That, I think, is why so many people feel inspired by Rand's writing -- they recognize principles by which they have lived, but have never actively contemplated... thus we return to the notion that Rand supplied the wording for their thoughts.An acquaintance of mine read this book without knowing anything about Ayn Rand, and proclaimed it a riveting biography (though she still hasn't bothered to read any of Rand's books). I read the bio after reading several of Rand's works, thus I was attentively watching for various milestones and background along the way. It's therefore evident that whether or not you already know Ayn Rand, this is a book well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"I was floored by this book, and I never have (and still do not) like Ayn Rand or her philosophy. With that said, I loved this book! I read it because I just saw the movie based on it, and was curious as to how Ayn Rand developed her philosophy, and also why she seemed to have such a strong &quot;hold&quot; over so many people. This book answered that and more: it is intelligent, extremely well-written, and I couldn't put it down! The only problem I had was that Branden (the author) was using it to work out her anger, etc. at Rand for her affair with Branden's then-husband. (Even though Branden denies doing this). She really could have shortened this part of the book. Even so, it explains a remarkable, unique person and philosophy. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Few individuals are as intriguing and polarizing as Ayn Rand which makes the likelihood of finding an impartial study of her life extremely difficult. Barbara Branden may be one of the few people in history to even be able to approach any objectivity in a biography of Rand given that she was both friend and enemy to Ayn at various periods of her life. Branden has a very close understanding of Rand's philosophy having been in her inner circle, but also became distanced from Rand when Rand dissacoaited herself with both Branden and her husband.Ayn grew up in the midst of the Russian Revolution and witnessed the hardships forced upon the Russians as Communism took hold. Branden conducted extensive interviews with those familiar or part of Rand's upbringing to get a handle on how the revolution shaped her mindset. The revolution gave rise to Rand's very strong feelings about the detirment to society caused when man loses his freedom. As a result, Ayn learned to question the status quo, to set her own standards, and refuse to let her desires be dictated by the standards of society. The events thus shaped her sharp intellect and the strength of conviction that would make her such a popular yet polarizing writer.By the time she arrived in America, Ayn's views were already rooted by very deep logic having created an entire philsophy built upon firm premises. According to Branden, those who found dispute with Rand's philosophic views tended to argue her conclusions without regard for her premises; which according to Ayn is an unforgivable act explained only by one who must either be intellecually lazy or lack the intellectual capacity to comprehend the foundations of logic. Rand was unopolitigec about her lack of tact and maintained little interest in conversing with those who she deemed unintellectual. Her stories typically depicted extreme characters intended to represent either the ideal individual according to her philosophy or the complete opposite. The end result was that Ayn Rand became extremely polarizing; despised for her antagonistic and stubborn nature but also held in high regard by others as one of the supreme thinkers on the nature of morality of a free society.Rand undoubtedly possessed a rare deep intellect, and whether her views represent a philosophical enlightening or unrealistically extreme may never be fully clear. Her life was unusual both for its success and its odd application of what Rand deemed a fully rational mind. But as Branden illustrates throughout the book, her life was without doubt full of intrigue. For those interested in merely finding out out about the life of a successful writer or those looking to better understand one of the most polarizing thinkers of the 20th century, Branden's biography of Ayn Rand is well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Barbara Branden (born 1929) is best-known for her relationship with the novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand, which ended in 1968; she (and former husband Nathaniel) is co-author ofWho id Ayn Rand?. This book was published in 1986 (after Rand's death in 1982, it should be noted). She wrote in the Introduction, \\"After 1968, when our relationship ended, I saw Ayn only one time before her death... Over the years, many people have suggested that it was time for me to write Ayn Rand's biography... I doubted that I had the necessary objectivity to write about a woman and a life that had so powerfully affected and altered my own life... I hope to show in her story that she was something infinitely more fascinating and infinitely more valuable than either goddess or sinner.\\" A movie (The Passion of Ayn Rand) was also made based on this book.While still living in Russia, Alice Rosenbaum (her given name) \\"did not... submit her (draft literary) work to any recognized literary authority; she trusted her own objectivity; SHE was the only authority on her own work, then or in the future. It was a policy which, whatever its drawbacks, would keep her moving through years of literary rejection.\\" (Pg. 41) Concerning Ayn's marriage to Frank O'Connor, \\"'everyone knew' the reason for the marriage was the imminent expiration of Ayn's visa... He was fond of her, he respected her, but one didn't have the feeling of love. Nick told me he married her because of the visa issue.\\" (Pg. 93) Once, when after a quarrel with Rand he told Barbara that he wanted to leave her, he asked plaintively, \\"But where would I go?\\" Branden noted that \\"He had few skills, no trade, no profession, no money of his own.\\" (Pg. 263) Later, \\"he was drinking, drowning his grief and his failed life in liquor.\\" (Pg. 339)Concerning the eventual affair between Rand and Nathaniel Branden, she writes, \\"I had no hint of what was to come... Neither did Nathaniel. Neither did Ayn.\\" (Pg. 247) \\"Ayn spent one afternoon and one evening each week alone with Nathaniel---Frank and I tried to prepare for what we knew was coming. And it came. And we were not prepared. The four of us ... discussed all the reasons... why Frank and I should understand their desire for a sexual relationship... Nothing was to happen without our knowledge and consent... Nathaniel had no power to resist the force that was Ayn Rand... And so we all careened toward disaster...\\" (Pg. 259-263) Chapter 29 details the blow-up between Nathaniel and Rand, as his affair with another woman came to light.Branden wrote, \\"Each reader of Atlas Shrugged finds for himself... its virtues and flaws... John Galt... is the wholly cerebral man, the man whose passions we deduce but never experience... Necessarily, the novel's shortcomings---and its virtues---reflect its author's personality and psychology.\\" (Pg. 299) She said in a footnote, \\"For a number of years after 1968, I was to speak of myself, Nathaniel, and our friends and students, as having been members of a cult. More recently... I have come to believe that that was not a valid designation of the Objectivist movement.\\" (Pg. 352)After Rand had been diagnosed with cancer, \\"Joan and Allan (Blumenthal) asked her to make public her decision to stop smoking. For many years, questions about the dangers of smoking had been raised by NBI students and at Ayn's own lecture appearances... Ayn refused. 'It's no one's business...'\\" (Pg. 383) In their final meeting in 1981 (Branden called Rand after seeing her on the Phil Donahue Show, and was invited to visit her), \\"We talked politics and philosophy and aesthetics---and it was not 1981, it was 1950, we were young and the world was young, and the glow of ideas outshone the sun.\\" (Pg. 399)While not a particularly \\"objective\\" account, this book is \\"must reading\\" for all who want to know more about the woman behind the books."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are often cited by people as seminal works in the development of their personal world view. What is this philosophy expounded by Rand called objectivism? Also known as \\"enlightened self-interest,\\" it has become the basis for much of libertarian politics. Rand has rarely been viewed neutrally: she is either seen as a prophet of reason or the destroyer of traditional values; the promoter of personal happiness and self-worth or advocate of mindless greed.Her childhood, she would have argued, was, irrelevant to the person she became. Later writings revealed a contempt for the \\"intellectual hostess\\" indifferent to the world of ideas. This stemmed, perhaps, from her early environment, her father completely indifferent to her, and her mother's active social life. She was a precocious child and valued intelligence above everything else; intelligence was to become inextricably linked in her world to virtue. She was bored by school; it was entirely too easy, and she began writing stories as a form of self-entertainment. A recurring theme even in the early stories was the battle between good and evil. Reason became the overarching element in her life. One day she simply decided to become an atheist. \\"I had decided that the concept of God is degrading to men. Since they say God is perfect, and man can never be that perfect, then man is low and imperfect and there is something above him-- which is wrong, [and since there was:] no proof of the existence of God; the concept is an untenable invention.\\"She wanted to define a moral ideal and to \\"project through fiction, the living reality of that ideal.\\" She had a brief interest in Nietzsche, but after discovering his anti-reason stance, discarded him. Clearly the trauma of growing up during the turmoil and privations of the Bolshevik revolution made a deep impression.By age eighteen she had already fully defined her philosophy and never deviated from it: \\"My philosophy, in essence, is the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute.\\"In her first novel, We the Living appeared a Nietzschean statement that implied she supported the use of force. She had it removed from later editions and stressed repeatedly that, \\"Whatever may be open to disagreement, there is one act of evil that may not, the act that no man may commit against others and no man may sanction to forgive. So long as men desire to live together, no man may initiate. . . .no man may start. . . the use of force against others.\\" Many of Rand's detractors have misinterpreted her use of the word selfish. Rand despised the typical interpretation because it meant defining one's values and thoughts based on making an impression on others. What she meant by the use of the words selfish and ego was an individual objectively (hence Objectivism) defining for oneself self-sufficiently what those convictions, values, and judgments would be independent of what others thought. Altruism was destructive because it meant that people operated and made decisions for the group. This led to a group-think mentality that disvalued the individual.This conflict is exemplified in The Fountainhead between Howard Roark and Peter Keating who represent the two extremes: the individualist versus the collectivist, and that evolved into a political philosophy. This raises another point as to why conservatives view her as such an icon. Corporations, it seems to me, are basically very hierarchical, tyrannical, and autocratic in their structure (despite protestations to the contrary) and they function for the benefit of their stockholders. That, I suggest, is a collectivist and not an individualist function. They function in the interest of a group. Individualists within such an organization, those with the selfish ego proclaimed as an ideal by Rand, would not be tolerated because they would behave in a non-collectivist manner. Her first interest in politics was sparked by the Roosevelt campaign, and she voted for him in the first election because he seemed the most tied to free enterprise, but by the end of his first term had decided he was too collectivist-oriented and went to work for Wilkie, but became disillusioned with him quite quickly. When later it was suggested that by working for the Wilkie campaign she was making a sacrifice in violation of her \\"selfish\\" principles, she replied somewhat ingenuously, I think, that it was really an act of supreme selfishness, fighting for a world in which she would be able to freely write her ideas.All her life she opposed religion and faith-based beliefs, arguing that \\"Religion. . . is the first enemy of the ability to think. . . .Faith is the worst curse of mankind [her italics:], as the exact antithesis of thought.\\" Religion was the embodiment of evil, an \\"explicit and implicit rejection of reason.\\" Her attitude with regard to emotion was interesting as well. She argued that all emotion was the result of cognition. \\"If a small baby sees someone pointing a gun at him, he will not react with fear; he may smile, thinking he is being giving a new toy. If an adult sees someone pointing a gun at him--he will feel fear: he knows the gun is dangerous and may kill him.\\" This means that emotions and the subconscious should be available to the conscious mind and that behavior and emotion should and can result from conscious thought and that \\"free will consists of the choice to think or not to think. Even psychologists who have admired her work regard this as a dangerous simplification.The filming of The Fountainhead became a struggle for her to maintain the integrity of the script she had written. Frank Lloyd Wright was asked to design the set buildings representing Howard Roark's designs, but he demanded a huge fee and complete set and script control, something that would have effectively made him the director. It was refused. Ultimately the studio's set designer did the buildings and simply patterned them after ugly modern buildings. Ayn was not happy. The movie also came under attack from the Johnson Office, Hollywood's self-censorship body, which was effectively controlled by the Catholic Church. It was not the \\"rape\\" scene they objected to, but rather Roark's speech to the jury, the priest who challenged it claiming it was too \\"materialistic.\\" The Johnson Office was not supposed to pass judgment on a film's philosophy, so Ayn called him on it and he was forced to back down. Atlas Shrugged continued the expression of her philosophy in fictional form. I'll say little about the content because a review will follow in a later issue, but one important concept, according to Brandon, is her view of the \\"impotence of evil.\\" Evil is irrational and to be fought but not to be taken seriously. \\"Evil is to be despised, not hated or feared.\\" The moral issues are fought between the good and the good (shades of Rushworth Kidder?). Ayn said, \\"the alleged victories of evil are made possible only by the flaws or the errors of those who are essentially good. Evil, left to its own devices, is impotent and self-defeating. . . [taking:] the burden of sin upon yourself --as God does-- it amounts to the sanction of evil. The power of religion consists of the power of morality--that's what holds people to religion--and I wanted to show that religion's monopoly on values does not belong to religion but to philosophy.\\"By this time she had become disillusioned with political conservatives: they did not know how to fight an intellectual battle. \\"What was needed was a moral justification for freedom that would be the antithesis of faith, altruism and collectivism. Rand gave America a moral sanction: \\"the philosophical demonstration that to live for one's own rational self-interest, to pursue one's own selfish, personal goals, to use one's mind in the service of one's own life and happiness, is the noblest, the highest, the most moral of human activities.\\" Conservatives would write about economic and political issues, but they did so from a religious and altruistic morality that was an anti-capitalist morality. Brandon and her future husband became acolytes of Rand, enamored of her ideas. But Brandon also was not a little dismayed by Rand's attitudes to \\"irrational\\" art: Beethoven was too filled with a tragic sense of doom; Rembrandt had a \\"grim, unfocused malevolence\\" and Shakespeare tragically failed to portray human beings with free will. Brandon remarks that those artists who became Rand's followers and adopted a completely rational approach to art lost their sense of originality and their art became \\"thin and tight.\\"Barbara Brandon is an unlikely biographer as she writes at length about the affair that her husband Nathaniel had with Ayn Rand, an affair that was to be very destructive to them all. Ultimately, in her affair with Nathaniel Brandon, Ayn surrendered to an emotion that she tried to categorize as a rational response to a situation, but it was to have enormous negative effects on her and those around her. \\"Ayn was a strikingly unsophisticated woman. . .she had lived an oddly sheltered life, locked within the confines of her special view of reality.\\" When Nathaniel fell in love with another woman and refused to rekindle the affair that Ayn had suspended, she became enraged, cut him off from all the Objectivist activities and began a campaign against him to get revenge. Brandon herself suggests this might not have been a bad thing because Ayn had become such a \\"cult\\" figure that the movement needed to be eliminated.This is a fascinating biography of an intriguing and influential personality."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Barbara Brandon should be commended for her ability to be so &quot;objective&quot; and forthright about her relationship with Ayn Rand. This is a fascinating biography which reads like a novel. What is most remarkable is Brandon's ability to write about her own pain over her husband's affair with Rand and yet she never loses what is obviously a profound love for the woman herself. She has revealed a side of Ayn Rand that was perhaps not the best, but she has also depicted a woman who was all too human, flawed and yet great in the truest sense of the word. Brandon herself is no less great for being able to write so hauntingly about the whole situation. Her ability to understand Rand helps the reader to understand also."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Ayn Rand is a brilliant and articulate spokeswoman for the rights of the individual. I find her philosophical writings inspiring, rational, and logical. Barbara Branden's book does an excellent job of telling Rand's life story, summarizing her philosophy, and at the same time illustrating that even Rand and her closest disciples had difficulty living the ideals of her philosophy.I believe that Ms. Branden did her best to be \\"objective\\" in writing this book but I'm not sure that it's possible for the betrayed wife of Ayn Rand's young lover, Nathaniel Branden, to be totally objective. Clearly, Branden loved Rand very much and was greatly influenced by her philosophy; she also was hurt and betrayed by Rand to a greater degree than others in Rand's inner circle.Rand's Objectivist philosophy claims that we live in a \\"benevolent universe\\" and that men are idealized heroes. Reading this story clearly indicates that there's a big difference between ideals and the real world. While preaching a gospel of individualism, Rand grew progressively more controlling in the lives of those closest to her. She lost all sense of boundaries between her ideals and the right of others to create their own rational values. She became the ultimate judge of what was rational and moral.This book is a great read, sometimes inspiring and sometimes sad and frightening. It's essential for anybody who wants to understand that geniuses are still human beings. The \\"objective reality\\" here is that flawed, lonely people can change the world in positive ways, just as Ayn Rand did."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"There are only a few people in the literature who have expressed the optimism and passion for living as Ayn Rand. There are many of course who are unknown and possess the same optimism, as the latter is a natural state of humankind. When these individuals are exposed to the literature of Rand, they identify enthusiastically with her characters and philosophy. It is for this reason that the literature of Rand should be classified more as realism than romanticism: it is an accurate statistical sampling of the predominant attitude in human history. Rand's characters are not larger than life but rather completely lifelike. One can meet them on a daily basis.The author of this book is one of these individuals, and she gives a detailed biography of Rand that gives touching insight into her character and humanity. From Alice Rosenbaum in Soviet Russia through the Fountainhead, to Atlas Shrugged and the formulation of the Objectivist movement, and finally to her death in 1982, the reader gets an inside view of what it was like to interact with Rand on a regular basis. It should be of no surprise to the reader to hear of Rand's mistakes and her faults. Her brilliance, along with her flaws, are part of being human. Indeed, the making of mistakes is an essential part of the cognitive process.It is the author's emphasis on the humanity of Rand that makes this book such a pleasure to read. There are many interesting anecdotes and commentary that give the reader special knowledge on the psychology of ethics and the contention that accompanies political or philosophical movements. It is not surprising to hear of the difficult emotional experiences that the author and her former husband had when interacting with Rand and her inner circle. Whenever the human intellect is as focused as it was in these individuals, the resulting roller coaster ride of confidence and insecurity is an immediate corollary.The author still expresses affection and admiration for Rand at the end of the book. Spending a great part of her life close to Rand gave the author a unique view of Rand's idiosyncracies and intellectual and emotional conflicts. When talking about Rand's captivating eyes, the author remarks that she never observed her looking inward, with the goal of sorting out her inner feelings. This is totally believable, for Rand did not have to engage in too much introspection: the characters in her novels expressed these inner feelings, and with a vengeance."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Before buying this book, I knew little about Ayn Rand. I respected her atheism and rationality, and had just finished reading Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology.Part way into reading the Passion of Ayn Rand, I had to stop and read the Fountainhead. It was a good thing, too, because it is very helpful to know the character Howard Roark and story line of the Fountainhead. Also, the story of the Fountainhead (and later, Atlas Shrugged) is revealed in The Passion of Ayn Rand.I read through the Fountainhead years of Ayn Rand's life and again I had to stop, this time to read Atlas Shrugged. Fortunately, I had no idea &quot;Who is John Galt?&quot;, and really enjoyed the mystery. So if you are going to read this book, first read Ayn Rand's major novels, or their plots will be spoiled for you. But that is a good thing!Barbara Branden has taken the incredible story of Ayn Rand's life and made it a very readable and intense drama. I guess because I knew so little going into it, everything took me by surprise. Living through the Russian revolution, graduating from college, and then slipping away to America, would have been a great story if it had just ended there! Then she goes to Hollywood, lives in near poverty, and manages somehow to write a play that makes it to Broadway. Wow!It seems every obscurity-to-fame story has a darker side, and the same is true here. And biographer Barbara Branden lived through all of it -- the triumph and the tragedy. The story of Ayn Rand is so rich and complex, uplifting and disappointing, that it just cries out to be told.And Barbara Branden has told the story, the whole story, the way it should have been told, and in a beautiful and readable style. I loved it."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"This book is honest and historic. It is not an attack nor praise of Ayn RandAnyone who has read Rand has been effected in some way. I used to be quite a disciple of Rand, but as life went on I saw and learned more and saw some flaws with Rand. Rands biggest flaw was the hubris of not believing that she could be anything but rational. Like all humans our emotions effect our choices. Rand was a great for arguing justification for her actions, to protect herself from being labeled emotional. Rand's chief flaw was she did not try to balance her emotions in her rationaliztion of the world. This is all to true in Rand's case.I have learned some good things from Rand, but this book brings an objective view of Rand( no pun intended). All thinkers great or otherwise have flaws and those who wish to think for themselves must look at how the philospher practiced what she preached.Rand was, for all her hatered of manipulation, a professional manipulator of her readers, followers and lovers. She was a propent of reason always yet she indulged in unrealistic hero worship of her husband and had the most irrational love affair with her hier-apparent. An affair that drastically hurt spread of her philosphy at the pinicle of her success. She was at the center of a philosophy that shaped the economic views of Alan Greenspan, and created the zelots like Leonard Pekoff.I do not think that every thing that Rand wrote was wrong but this book helped me to question Rand and to see flaws that the hard-core objectivist community would rather not see the light of day."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"A very thoughtful and well-written account of the life of one of the most influential women who ever lived, The Passion of Ayn Rand provides insight into its subject that can only be the result of the author's having known that subject intimately. Mrs. Branden manages to successfully to strike a balance between objective reporting and personal involvement in the story in which she herself played such a significant part. Very well balanced by Nathaniel Branden's Judgment Day, although in my opinion, Dr. Branden comes off as much less a class act than his former wife; he's more apt to throw stones at her than vice versa (I've recently learned that he revised his book and that the changes have eliminated much of his previous shrillness). Both works, however, are important.I must say, although I'm usually loath to comment unfavorably on other reviews, that some of those concerning this book are rather disturbing. They range from the \\"true believers\\" whose expression of solidarity with a philosophy that insists that one think for himself takes the form of blindly assuming that their guru is incapable of human error, to those who gleefully state that a brilliant, passionately outspoken woman is a ghoul and a maniac (I'm still trying to tough out what a reader from Arlington, Tex. meant by Miss Rand's \\"sexual perversity.\\" Did he (she?) mean \\"perversion,\\" and if so, on what basis? From where I stand, Rand had only two partners in her entire life; they were both over-21, male, and human. And if actually \\"perverse,\\" well, I'm not in a position to cast the first stone and I'd guess \\"Arlington, TX\\" isn't, either).Rand was a human being, PERIOD, and an endlessly fascinating one. That she--much to her distress--possessed human frailties in no way negates her genius or her importance, a point which both Brandens take pains to acknowledge. Because she was a public figure (by choice, I might add), and because she chose to make public her dirty laundry with the Brandens, any efforts on their part to defend themselves against her accusations should not be viewed as vengeful and hateful, especially since they both seem to walk on eggs in their efforts to take responsibility for their own actions. I'm happy to know both sides of the story, which at least makes sense when all the pieces are presented. If there are any inaccuracies in Mrs. Branden's account, I doubt very much that they're malicious. In fact, Mrs. Branden writes with much more love and sympathy than I suspect is possible for most women who might find themselves embroiled in a similar situation, and for this she is to be warmly commended. She never allows herself the luxury of being petty or vituperative, even when writing about her cousin, Leonard Peikoff, from whom she has been (and presumably still is) estranged since The Break. Quite an accomplishment, all things considered."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"I read this book years ago and it strongly impacted my life for the better, as it showed Rand's internal battles as well as her battles against the world.I recently picked PAR up once again after reading harsh criticism of it. Frankly I had forgotten what a magnificent achievement it was.I highly recommend this book for those interested in getting to know Ayn Rand from a person who was there and who interviewed well over 200 people who knew Rand, including a great deal of painstaking research. It is a thoroughly professional job and a wonderful read.Michael"},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Of COURSE Rand apologists would cite this biography as being &quot;refuted by recent articles as being both dishonest and highly inaccurate.&quot; Whose articles would those be? They are probably using another Rand apologist, Leonard Peikoff. OF COURSE Ayn Rand couldn't be married to an alcoholic, OF COURSE Ayn Rand couldn't be driven by subjective emotional desires, etc. These apologists cannot stand the fact their idol was a flawed human, and cannot get over it. (Un)fortunately, this fact is true, no human can ever meet his/her expectations of him/herself...not even Ayn Rand.This is a memoir/biography, not only does Mrs. Branden write about her idol/mentor/betrayer, but also writes about her time with this giant.Personally, I see this and Nathaniel Branden's bio of Ayn Rand as refreshing. Why? Because not even Ayn Rand could have lived in Ayn Rand's world. Everyone sets standards for themselves and then comes up with justifications as to why they &quot;had&quot; to fall short of their own standards.Galt did not, then why did Rand?Roarke did not, then why did Rand?I was caught up in the Objectivism of &quot;Fountainhead&quot; and &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; only to discover, to my surprise, these characters are pure fiction. They do not exist, and to propose they do in the real world is to reject Ayn Rand's own life. (Which some apologists try to do, or merely cover up the blemishes by justifying of dismissing away those parts that embarrass their idol.)So now why have our answer.Why Roarke and Galt, but not Rand?Because Roarke and Galt exist only in Rand's mind, but Rand exists in the flesh.Ayn Rand's life was one she preached against. She gave into her desires over her values, she ruled other people's lives instead of letting them make their own decisions, and she held others captive to those desires instead of letting others decide their own destiny.What could be more fitting?"},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"This book is extraordinarily written and full of great drama.

And to be honest, some of her ideas were beginning to sour on me.I found this book to answer a lot of questions, and to be honest, I understood Ayn Rand better after reading it. It showed her strengths and weaknesses and confirmed both things I appreciated and didn't appreciate about Ayn Rand.I think this book set out very well what it intended to do."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"Barbara Branden delivers the goods. Not only does she chronicle the life of one of the world's great figures she does it with a powerful and penetrating style, and an excellence of prose that led me to read the book over and over again. The real life story of Ayn Rand, as told by Branden, is as bold and daring as any of the characters of her great novels, only here one sees the human side of greatness, the pain, the hurts, the terrible loneliness of a great women. More than anything, this is a book of love, a real story and a real portrait of Ayn Rand's life, absent the gaudy makeup and neon glitter of Madison Avenue propaganda. If you love great writing, a great story about a great women, and the reality of the pain and suffering of the lone innovator, this is the book for you. Warning: Leave yourself plenty of time to read it, because you will not be able to stop."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"\\"The Passion of Ayn Rand\\" was to me like a drink of fresh water for a man stranded in the desert: this book provided me with the very first insight into the life of Ayn Rand as a \\"human being,\\" rather than merely her public image as a professional writer and philosopher.This biography of Rand provided the first detailed account of Rand's personal life to be published. For that alone, I am grateful. This book did not disillusion me, but it served as a ''grounding\\" device to remind me that the reality in which she and I live are NOT the \\"ideal reality\\" which she projected in her fiction. Her ideal reality is one toward which we may aspire, but not necessarily expect to encounter everyday.I can't prove how \\"accurate\\" Branden's memories are of her conversations with Rand, but it is infinitely inspiring to me that Rand accomplished so much when she had so many alleged imperfections. If the criticisms in this book of Rand are accurate, then the enormity of her philosophical accomplishments are not diminished, but are all the more profound and admirable.The form of the book begins with the appearance of a factual biography, which blends into a \\"fiction-like\\" narrative based on Branden's conversations with Rand, interspersed with \\"tape-recorded\\" conversations held with Rand and others, then metamorphosed into a poetic eulogy of Rand. Although Branden's \\"interpretations\\" of Rand are questionable, Ms. Branden seems neither sufficiently intelligent nor creative, to \\"fabricate\\" this kind of stuff. For that reason alone, her story rings \\"fuzzily\\" true. I say \\"fuzzily,\\" because she is remembering events in the way which is the \\"least unflattering\\" toward herself.After reading \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand\\" I had a greater hope. Ayn Rand was imperfect but overcame immeasurable odds. Perhaps I might do the same. The possibility of happiness, and the moral right to \\"freedom-of-action\\" were all that Rand ever offered in her philosophy of Objectivism. Rand was a realist and offered no guarantees of happiness. She only offered possibilities based upon reality and human choices in response to that reality.To anyone who understands the enormity of Rand's philosophical ingenuity, and the complexity and subtlety of her system, the flaws of Branden's book are neither surprising nor upsetting; it would be surprising indeed if a genius like Rand were NOT misunderstood, especially by those closest to her. Nonetheless, this book is (or should be) a treasured possession for all Objectivists who admire Rand's heroism within the full context of her humanity. For non-Objectivists, this biography is at least an inspiring testament to human willpower, and the ability to overcome formidable obstacles in the accomplishment of one's dreams.In \\"The Passion of Ayn Rand,\\" Branden criticizes Rand's philosophy in the same manner that Rand criticized Thomas Woolf (Branden's favorite author), without recognizing the irony of her actions. Branden seems not to realize that her harsh criticisms of Rand is to Objectivists, what Rand's harsh criticism of Woolf was to Branden herself. But Rand is the superior writer, and Objectivists have the more valid defense.I think Ms. Branden agrees with me when she says \\"...How fitting it would be if the legends of Valhalla were true. Ayn would travel to the paradise of the brave, the paradise assigned to heroes slain in battle\\":That our heroes, philosophical or otherwise, are born from the same flesh-and-blood as the rest of us, does not detract from their heroism, but renders such heroism all the more memorable, powerful and sacred."},{"Title":"The Passion of Ayn Rand","review":"I read this book two weeks ago, just after I finished Atlas Shrugged. What a contrast! I'd never before read an entire biography of an author, and it help put many things in perspective about Ayn Rand.She had a fascinating life, but not one I'd want for myself! More important, Branden paints Rand as a woman who did not live in the same reality as everyone else; it was almost as if Rand were stuck trying to life the lives of her exalted characters, but just couldn't quite make it. She resisted compromising her ideals, but gave in far more often than, say, Howard Roark or Francisco D'Anconia--often to her regret.

Although it predates Hale's book, the Sedona Method course goes back several decades with both Hale and Lester Levenson (whom Jim knew), the technique's originator. The author pontificates at length about all the ways we get hung up in life while offering very little in the way of SPECIFIC instruction for doing anything about it.I give it two stars because the information is not irrelevent, just severely limited. There are a few insights that may be of interest to seasoned releasers. Other authors, like Patricia Carrington, have managed to put their own spin on Sedona Method-like techniques and to make a valuable contribution in the process. Britt just avoids the issue almost entirely.I would very much recommend The Sedona Method by Hale Dwoskin over this space holder. Can you tell?

Nietzche happens to be my favorite philosopher so any book by him will be higly praised automatically by me.Perhaps the sole warning about this book I would give to a prospective buyer is this: Ecce Homo is not an objective autobiography. If one is looking for objectivite and exactitude in the description of life events, look elsewhere. This book is not for you. It is more of a psychological autobiography. The author explains who he is, why he is how he is and what makes him so special as well as providing glimpses about what he thought his real legacy would be. In a nutshell, if Nietzsche is already your hero,and you would love to know him more and get a glimpse of what made him tick, then, by all means, rush and buy this book. Otherwise, don't."},{"Title":"Ecce Homo","review":"This book is some sort of an autobiography of F. Nietzsche with his own short comments on his books, his literary and musical preferences, Christianity and the future of mankind. He also explains why he is a true immoralist.Nietzsche stresses the all important influence of Schopenhauer in his life: \`I very earnestly denied my \`will to life' at the time when I first read Schopenhauer.'His preferred authors are H. Heine, Byron, Stendhal, P. Loti, P. M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, A. France and G. de Maupassant. In music, he likes Rossini, Chopin, Sch&uuml;tz, Haendel, Liszt, Bizet and Bach.A true immoralistA true immoralist confirms a double negation; first, of the so-called supreme, good, benevolent and beneficent man, and secondly, of the altruistic Christian morality.He calls for \`a revaluation of all values'. Concepts like God, soul, virtue, sin and eternal life are mere imaginings and lies prompted by the bad instincts of sick natures. All the problems of politics, social organization and education have been falsified because one mistook the most harmful men for great men.ChristianityBlindness to Christianity is the crime par excellence, the crime against life. Its morality is vampirism. It is the most malignant form of the will to lie. It is a gruesome fact that anti-nature received the highest honors and was fixed over humanity as law and categorical imperative. It invented a \`soul' to ruin the body. The Bible is a product of the will to suppress the truth. Its saints are slanderers of the world and violators of man.OptimismBut, F. Nietzsche remains a fundamental optimist, because men strive for the forbidden. Therefore, his philosophy will triumph one day, because that what was forbidden has always been the truth. Dionysus will be stronger than the doctrine of the Crucified.This book is a good introduction to the raging style, the reasoning with a hammer, the main themes, the Homeric battles and the \`immoral' obsessions of a fascinating, integer, but in some aspects, controversial philosopher with a too egoistic agenda for mankind.A must read for all Friedrich Nietzsche fans and lovers of Western philosophy."},{"Title":"Ecce Homo","review":"The painting on the cover is very good. I have often looked at the picture as if the Christ in the painting is ashamed of each and every one of the people tormenting him. The painting ECCE HOMO by Quentin Massys from 1515 is in the Prado Museum in Madrid. The book itself is, as Nietzsche says about his Twilight of the Idols: \\"A great wind blows through the trees, and all around fruits drop down--truths.\\" It takes a society that is seriously going wrong to get a thinker going in the \\"And in all seriousness, no one before me knew the right way\\" direction. Nietzsche had several cultures to learn from, and sharing an interest in Schopenhauer with Richard Wagner was merely a bit of good luck compared to the depth of insight that Nietzsche was able to gain on human culture as a need to make new discoveries. Each time I read this book, I am astounded at how profound the point of view that gave Nietzsche his own distinctions ended up being his literary autobiography instead of The Will To Power."},{"Title":"Ecce Homo","review":"Nietzsche's autobiography, in summary:\\"I have never given any attention to the concept of god, not even as a child.

He was able to tell people all about their departed loved ones without requesting information or input of any kind. I was so impressed I bought the book.This book is written by a highly sceptical radio personality, who has used every means at his disposal to debunk the whole medium idea. George Anderson cooperated with the book and the testing.I was particularly interested to read some of the case studies, understand some of the rationale behind after death communications. It helped to understand in depth the passing of my brother, and by being able to get this perspective to deal with it better. I was also very interested in what he said about the nature of the afterlife. There is no hell per se, there are just different levels based on how spiritually advanced people were in life.This is the kind of book to read when you need to read it, when the time is right. I passed my copy along to my sister who was also very impressed and she in turn passed it along to someone who found it to be a great comfort. This book could be helpful to someone you know.In grief, the one piece of knowledge that might help you get the perspective that helps you to deal with the loss can be so elusive. This book can help you. I would also recommend Lessons from the Light, which focuses more on the afterlife.I hope you find this review helpful."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I first read the earlier edition of \\"We Don't Die\\" around 1996. It was my favorite book and I recommended it to everyone. I swore that if anything happened to someone I loved I would find a way to get a reading with George. I was so convinced he was the real thing. Then tragedy struck in the summer of 1998 when both my husband and son died just a few weeks apart. I contacted George's office right away, but because he was so booked up the first available $1,000 phone appointment was in 3 months. I made the appointment and waited with great expectations. I felt so hopeful that when the reading took place I would hear from my beloved son and husband and feel some relief from the horrible pain I was in. I had no other children so I had really lost my whole family in just a few short weeks.George called me at our scheduled appointment time. I can't explain what a horrible sinking feeling it was while listening to George and slowly realizing he was only telling me things that anyone could find through public records, like my husband's name, cause of death, how long we'd been married and that it was the first marriage for both of us, where we got married, etc. There were a lot of mentions in between the vital information of how much my husband loved me, wanted me to go on and be happy.... Generally, words of comfort, just what a person in my situation would desperately want and need to hear. It all seemed so fake that I began to feel disgusted, but I held my tongue and kept hoping, but he really didn't tell me anything convincing even though I sat there during the reading surrounded by knick-knacks and photos from various trips we'd taken, match books from our favorite restaurants, etc.But here was the clincher: George said that my husband and I had NO CHILDREN. I didn't correct him because I didn't want to help in any way if he was fishing for clues, but my heart really hit bottom when he said that. Toward the end of the reading I asked if there wasn't someone, anyone else, that might want to come through, but he just started guessing and asking me questions, like \\"would this person's name begin with a letter that's in the first half of the alphabet?\\". You see, the problem for George was that my son was born, and later died, in another country, so both his birth and death certificates would be difficult to find, especially if one assumed there was no reason to look for them.It pains me to say this, but talking to George 3 months after my losses actually sent me into a deeper and literally more hopeless depression because by the time the reading was over I had gone from a true believer to a person who knew right down to the bone that this guy was a fake. I believed so strongly in George's abilities before the reading, and expected to feel relieved afterward, but no, I don't believe in George anymore. I felt ripped off and hopeless. I don't know if there are real mediums, I surely hope so, and I truly hope some day I can meet one who can connect me with the ones I've lost.It took many years before I could write this review because I didn't want to hurt anyone who's grieving by saying these things. George may justify what he's doing by telling himself he's helping people, and he probably is as long as they believe in his ability. But he's still lying, and I don't think it's moral or decent for a liar to profit off of people who are fragile, hurting and devastated. If there are other mediums who are genuine, then they deserve to make a living from their books and readings. I'm still open-minded, just not a fan of this particular medium (or Sylvia Brown, whose predictions have been wrong on way too many occasions) with whom I had a very shallow, meaningless and expensive reading.Sorry if I've offended anyone, but this is the truth about my reading with George."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"It was James Van Praagh who personally recommended that I read WE DON'T DIE, and that this book was a primer for him when his mediumship was in the developing stages. I am grateful for the referral, for investigators of the mediumship phenomenon may discover, as I did, that George Anderson was initially reluctant to demonstrate and go public with his talents. Overcoming an abusive upbringing in which his sixth sense was mistakenly perceived as mental illness, George Anderson boldly transcended his fears and insecurities, and Martin skillfully describes Anderson's rise from skittish radio talk show guest to masterful bereavement counselor and evidential superstar medium.While I struggle to understand why many mediums charge large sums of money for private consultations, Anderson's credibility is bolstered by the fact that he is currently volunteering to participate the most comprehensive mediumship study to date headed by Dr. Gary Schwartz at the University of Arizona.WE DON'T DIE offers hope and encouragement to those suffering from bereavement as well as vital information for readers who want the facts about the survival of human consciousness after physical death."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"This is perhaps the most consoling book I have ever read. I read it a few months after the sudden death of a young (46) very close friend of mine. I have always believed in life after death, but experiencing grief in a whole new way left me feeling numb and questioning on a feeling level the existence of God, heaven, life after death, etc.I was also impressed with the humble and unpretentious attitude of George A. He was searching for truth and an understanding of his amazing ability to communicate with those who had died. He did not claim holiness or claim to be better than others who did not have this amazing ability.I read the next 2 books writen by Joel Martin and P Romanowski about G. A. Now I am looking forward to reading the latest book about him."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"If you enjoyed books by Dannion Brinkley, Betty Eadie, and James Van Praugh, you'll enjoy this one, too. Narrated by radio talk show host Joel Martin, this book beautifully recounts how Joel went from healthy skepticism to firm belief in the validity of medium George Anderson's gift of communicating with the spirits of people who've passed on. We read about how difficult it was for young George to grow up with his special ability, which frightened some of his teachers and annoyed others. In fact, he was almost institutionalized.Thankfully they didn't succeed in suppressing George's gift, and as an adult he agreed to be studied and scrutinized extensively to see if, indeed, he was talking to the departed. The conclusion, time and again, is that there seems to be no other explanation. (One skeptic preferred to believe that instead of receiving messages from the other side, George actually memorized volumes of information from an enormous secret computer that stored the most intimate and minute details of every person's life. Come on!)We Don't Die is full of very touching dialogue between the living and their loved ones who, through death, have moved on to the next dimension, with George serving as the &quot;tool&quot; that enables communication. Amazingly, George believes we all have this gift, to a degree.I especially enjoyed learning these points: 1. Spirits on the other side don't just idly sit around -- they have fulfilling &quot;jobs&quot; which they enjoy and value; 2. Love is the bond that continues to connect us with people and pets who have passed on, whom we loved here on Earth; 3. Forgiveness is key to spiritual growth -- some of the spirits who had been killed, for example, said they've forgiven the perpetrators and would like others to forgive as well; and 4. We see more clearly from the other side, as evidenced by those spirits who did hurtful things on Earth and ask their living loved ones for forgiveness.While here on Earth, we are to live abundantly and use our unique gifts to better ourselves and those around us. There's no need to rush death -- we all die when it's our time -- but there is no need to fear death, either. After we die, we continue to exist in another form, in another dimension. That's the message of this book, which provides hope and comfort to anyone struggling with life or with a loved one's death.-- Graciela Sholander, http://dreamitdoit.net"},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"There is no book in print, other than this one, that can comfort anyone that has lost a loved one.

At the time of my trip, I owned a small angel store. One of my customers had just lost her husband so the two of us flew to NY to meet with Mr. Anderson. He knew nothing about either of us, not our names or where we were from. He didn't know we had flown across the country praying for a sign, a connection, a message, ~anything from beyond. George Anderson picked us individually out of an audience at separate times. Both my customer and I had astounding experiences of those who had passed over. My son and her husband both came thru with messages, specific to each of us. I wrote a chapter about the experience in a book recently published,Blessings in the Mire. Anyone that knows me, knows that I was not inclined to believe in mediums, psychics, healers, and the likes, and that for the most part I think most of this is charlatans out to make a buck with their peddled wares. George Anderson changed my mind. He is a very gifted man, with an amazing life story to tell. In this book, We Don't Die, he speaks of how painful his childhood was as a result of his \\"visions\\" in his youth. Believe me, because it's true. Get this book, and then if you are in need of spiritual guidance, seek him out. I have long since moved on and no longer have my angel store; now I write books about it! But when I returned to my angel store after the NY trip and meeting with George Anderson, I called the publisher and ordered a crate of, We Don't Die, which I sold in record time.

In regard to the skeptic who challenges for some great piece of knowledge from the medium, I must say that one of the things, which convinced me of Mr. Andersen's ability, was the very lack of &quot;great secrets revealed&quot;. Mediumship has a reason and a purpose, but I don't believe it's to reveal the secrets of history nor the universe nor to give someone the winning lottery number.

Joel Martin, former skeptic of spirit communication, documents his gradual conversion through communications received from medium George Anderson. If there is a question to be asked, Joel finds it. There is an excellent account of various tests that were devised for Anderson. In Joel's transcripts of radio broadcasts made by the medium, my only criticism was that sometimes Anderson appeared to be asking too many questions of the callers and thus modified his messages from the response. In spite of these flaws, Anderson proved himself able to give accurate names, places and spontaneous comments totally relevant to the inquirer's needs. Joel Martin's WE DON'T DIE is a classic in the history of parapsychology and psychic research.

As a Medium, he has shown thousands of people who come to him, who call him over the phone, or who do a reading with him on television that he is a connector between a person and a spirit who was in that person's life here in body form, before that person died.In a 'Reading', the spirit relays signs, symbols and whatever else to George. Immediately, he jots the depictions down onto paper, then sharing the conveyed messages with the person wanting the spiritual connection. To many intrigued with the the study of the spirit world, it's quite refreshing to know that those whom had been in our lives but have died, are not just buried laying deep down under the ground, or just sitting as ashes inside of a beautiful urn. Yes, they have left their body, but they have not left us.This Medium actually became famous in the 1980's, before psychic phenomena and Mediums became as popular as is today. It fascinates many people to have Mr. Anderson communicate deep dark secrets or even acts of contrition, which are only relevant to that person and the spirit communicating through Mr. Anderson. This gives validation that the person is out of body, but lives on. Only a small percentage of people can register that they have the abilities of a Medium. Those who do have come forth and displayed their own essential gift...the same one that Mr. Anderson has but possibly receiving communication in a different fashion, as not all Mediums use paper and pen to jot down a sign.This book involves countless successful readings, replaying to us the intricate information validated from the spirit's answer for a person. I am a firm believer in different paranormal scenarios, but many scientists are not. So I firmly enjoyed watching him stump scientific skeptics because rest assured, he has been tested by the best of them...and he too at first, was his own biggest skeptic. But this book was put together with a man who stood along side of George Anderson's Readings. Nothing is fictitious, otherwise it would be stated in a Reading. A person may not want to hear from a particular spirit, but whom ever comes through to the communicator comes through to that person.Yes, I highly recommend this book to those interested in this type of valid spiritual communication. I'd say it is a perfect book for those who are just beginning to study this type of psychic ability, and for those whom are highly skeptical of what a Medium's intentions are. To me the intentions are connections, and he proves himself to have the special gift time and time again."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"This book was very enlightening.

Part of the story of his (Matt Damons' character George) psychic origins may be modeled on this real-life George's life. Would recommend if you have any doubts about an after-life, although this (as the movie) may not satisfy your religious leanings.

Both of these books have made a significant spiritual awakening; not only for me, but for family and friends that have lost loved ones. Now we know that we all will be together some day, and that crossing over {death} is just a &quot;graduating&quot; step towards a higher spiritual level. I never would have believed in communicating with the other side; including through dreams. But I was assured this was real when it hapened to me. I had 3 dreams of a friend that crossed over. The dreams were not scary in any way, but towards the last dream. My friend comforted me and assured me that he was OK, not suffering and at peace.

I came away from my session thoroughly convinced that my beloved had in fact contacted me.Later, when I got home, I took my recording of the meeting and created a transcript. Oh my God! Following the logic trail, I discovered that almost everything he said he could of gotten from his reading of my verbal and non-verbal responses, even though all I did was basically respond yes/no. For those who would try to analyze a medium's performance, a full and complete transcript is a MUST.In his book, however, only partial transcripts of selected sessions are provided. This can easily create a false impression of his actual hit/miss ratio.It was still worth the $1200 cost for the appointment, just to see this master at work! And if this guy is a cold-reader (which my personal experience would seem to indicate), you can imagine what that says about all the other mediums."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I had no problem believing in George, but I had a hard time with Joel Martin - he came across as being pushy, which made it difficult to read. After a while, I found myself calling this guy names out loud - immature, I know, but I couldn't help it!"},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I read the first two books about George Anderson by J. Martin years ago. In one of them I recall an incident where George was in school and he was in disagreement with the teacher about the fate of the last Dauphin (prince/heir to the thrown) of France. History says that he died in prison. If I recall correctly, George said that the Dauphin escaped and lived in exile; in England if I remember correctly. Well, Guess what! Recently, the alledged skull of the Dauphin was examined for DNA. It turns out that it was related to present day descendents of the last king. So much for George's &quot;psychic knowledge&quot;. I thrown down this challenge: If any psychic truly has the ability to talk to the dead, then give us information that no one alive knows. Tell us things, such as the location of the tomb of Alexander the Great, Attila the Hun, and others. I believe that James Randi is still offering one million dollars to anyone who can demonstrate psychic powers. Why hasn't ANY psychic won this money? I recently saw &quot;48 Hours&quot;, a television newsmagazine that talked about George Anderson. George likes money; he charges $1000 per hour. If he really wishes to bring hope to the world that the dead are not dead, then he should prove his claims under scientific scrutiny! Sorry people, but we do die. The dead are just that: DEAD. For what it's worth, the dead don't know that they're dead. They don't know anything. THE DEAD ARE DEAD!"},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"Ok, not literally. But haven't we all seen &amp; read similar stories? This one convinces me no more than the others. If you feel the need to give yourself a phychological crutch, this is your book. But then, you probably have more crutches than you have brain cells."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"The George Anderson book offers nothing beyond the usual drab mumbo jumbo in which \\"psychic\\" and \\"medium\\" charlatans always trade. Anderson asserts that the dead aren't dead (fresh new perspective, eh?); he says they survive; he says they love those they knew in life.Have the skills of typical believers sunk so low that they can swallow George Anderson's nonsense without, at least, laughing inwardly at their own folly?Anderson says nothing, displays nothing, and knows nothing that many better charlatans aren't entirely familiar with. He offers the usual sludge of dull platitudes unlovelied by wit or intelligence. \\"I see someone coming to you as a father?\\" Do you know someone who once acted as a father (perhaps a father, say, or an older brother) to someone, even (wow) to you? \\"He wants you not to feel guilt.\\" (Hmm. You are one of the 99.999% of people who feel some guilt in relationships, are you not?)Use this primilimany test - definitely NOT used by the authors of this ...- on such potential charlatans, in the medium field, as Anderson: Do they let the dead offer overwhelming proof that they are whom they're represented to be? For example, if a carpenter has been \\"summoned,\\" does Anderson let \\"the carpenter\\" demonstrate his honesty by showing intimate knowledge of many odd terms used in carpentry? It would be easy for skilled dead to demonstrate their skills in a fashion few charlatans could easily fake.In contrast, be increasingly suspicious when you hear vague love-peace-chant-\\"the light\\" dribble....Do, though, try to be a little critical-minded about nonsense. Don't let the world's charlatans just haul you in, like a fish."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I also lost my father, and had nothing to hold onto.

Joel Martin goes into a perorata over proving that George Anderson is indeed a medium and that he's been tested. I thought this book would be more inspiring, than this and at times it gets rather repetitious, especially when the first case presented in the book is again tried by having the relatives of the victim come for readings."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"Good reading, having lost my Dad recently I am very much hopeful life does not end \\"here\\", I want my Dad to still be here/there, just be."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"It's a great comfort during the grieving process. Whatever you believe, it still allows the thoughts of more being possible."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I have been a fan of George Anderson's for at least 25 years when I being a sanitation worker found one of his books in a pile to be thrown away. The book was Life After Life and myself being one who believes in life after death I was going to read it. Well it was great and after I read it I loaned it to a co-worker who went out on injury and never saw it again. Then going through my kindle I saw another George Anderson book and had to read it. This is a book you are going to enjoy if you believe and believe in Psychics. If you do not believe then don't read because you will always try to find a way to prove his readings are not right. I have a friend who is a very good Psychic and he has predicted a good amount of things in my life to at least being 90% right. So knowing George Anderson was the best it made it an easy read and I must say fascinating. A good read."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"Read this book many years ago after losing my Mom and it was a wonderful source of healing for me.

Not sure how true all this is, but it is interesting as hell! I remember when George Anderson had a TV special doing readings for famous people... although the only one I can remember off the top of my head is Bret the Hitman Hart. His story is amazing.

Nice to read good author and to all who's behind this book excellent!"},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"The openness of George Anderson to tests by skeptics regardinghis mediumship is so valuable in terms of proving the existence of anafterlife. As a healthy skeptic myself, I find this book particularly convincing. In fact, it is basically impossible to refute the claim that George Anderson possesses a truly amazing capacity to acquire information through extrasensory means. Of course, the evidence rests on the good faith of the authors, but there is no reason to distrust them. In every sense, they come across as honest and sincere. This a truly amazing book and I highly recommend it to skeptics and believers alike."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I have read two of George Anderson's books now. The first being OUR CHILDREN FOREVER. I have just finished WE DON'T DIE. The premise is the same in both books. After reading them it only confirms my strong belief that there is an afterlife. I am not religious and have little belief in God but I know our engergy lives on. George Anderson is a gifted Medium. He has used his spiritual powers well. I enjoyed both books but WE DON'T DIE was a bit dull in parts where the authors go on &amp; on with tales of people trying to debunk Mr. Andersons gift. I found myself skimming thru parts. However, It's a fact filled book worth anyones time to learn of life after death."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"A friend sent this book to me right after the loss of my 39 year old brother, saying it gave her comfort when her grandmother died years before.

George's words and experiences gave me hope when I had none, and gave me a new insight into the next world. I have since read all of George Anderson's books and even went to New York for a personal reading with him. George's gift of mediumship is extraordinary and his message is simple -- WE DON'T DIE! Our loved ones who have passed are very much alive and involved in our daily lives. I now highly recommend this book to everyone I know who has lost a loved one."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I don't usually like supernatural things.

For skeptics: there are some very provocative situations to reconcile if indeed you believe that the transcriptions are true. ** I would recommend it to anyone who has lost family, friends--even animals. ** I strongly recommend reading the last chapter first to get Mr. Anderson's firsthand perspective on the spiritual world and his opinion of his own powers. I think it would make the other chapters more credible and less dull because his own words are more intelligent and articulate than Martin &amp; Romanowski's."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"The most important sentence in this entire book for me was; 'the mortal life seems to be unhappy interruption of our natural state of being.' After losing our 19 year-old son 7 months ago, this book kept me from burying myself to the grief of never seeing my only child again. Considering the state of the world today, it's easy to say 'what's the point'? When the babies die young, when the innocent are born disabled, how is that fair? When a boy with such promise who always helped his friends see the positive in their lives is taken abruptly in the prime of life while serial killers live for decades, how is that fair?George Anderson not only gives comfort but explains how it all works. He talks to those who have passed over into their real selves leaving the rest of us stricken with grief. I can't help but think how much better our lives would be if we could see the big picture and how it's all fair and everything has a purpose and works out in the end. Thank God for people like George Anderson who share their gift with the world even after suffering punishment for it throughout their young lives. Thank God we're finally at time where we can not only imagine a better world than this material world behind its veil of tears, but through George we can get first hand information on who we really are, spiritual beings taking a short course being flesh and blood.

It provides a detailed look at George Anderson's experiences and also discusses the arrogrance of so called critics or establishment people who claim to be researching Mr. Anderson.Doctors and scientists seem to be more concerned about how others would look at them if they agreed that Mr. Anderson was legitimate. I remember reading about Edgar Cayce and his documented works.

I am thankful for mediums like George Anderson and James Van Praagh because I believe that they possess a wonderful gift. I recommend this book to anyone that has lost a dear friend or relative because I feel that it has tremendous healing power.

I am a discerning reader and a book reviewer for a large paper, and I am convinced that George is a gifted medium and the REAL DEAL. I liked this particular book because it was written by a journalist who watches George Anderson evolve. This book is guaranteed to help you make that transition, the one we all must make one day, without fear.

George's experiences as a medium prove, to my satisfaction: that life does not end at the grave; that our spirit/soul/self (whatever you choose to call it) merely sheds its physical shell at the moment of death; that we will be united with loved ones who've gone before us and who, indeed, are actually waiting to help us make the transition from this life to the next; that it is possible to receive messages from the &quot;other side&quot;; and that, in time, and if we so desire, we can return to the physical world as a newborn infant, with a whole new identity and family, and lead another earthly sojourn. Although I'm a practicing Catholic, George's book has given me a great new respect for non-Western religions and belief systems that teach reincarnation, ancestor worship (which is not really &quot;worship&quot; at all, but merely prayer to deceased relatives for their help and guidance), and the sanctity of all living things. It has also opened my mind to new ideas and helped me shed the arrogance of Catholicism, which teaches that Catholics alone possess the &quot;full truth.&quot; I heartily urge those who fear death (whether their own or someone else's) to read this book.

To me, this also substantiates that there is indeed life after death, as well as other planes of existence that elude conventional science's current definitions."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"When I first heard about George Anderson and this book (and his other books) I was a bit skeptical due to the overwhelming publicity of psychics nowadays. This book drew me in and I had a lump in my throat when I began to read about the readings he did and how it brought s much comfort and closure to those families. It helps me believe that my loved ones are in a better more peaceful place. Thank you for helping me know this."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I would like to thank George Anderson in person some day and I'd love to have him do a reading for me. I loved this book. Joel Martin and Patricia Romanowski did a great job writing this book and I intend to read about all of his work. George hasn't had children or a wife, so may not have deep emotions of love in this area like many of us. I think perhaps this is his karma...to help him stay neutral with his work."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"Review, The book We Dont Die,is mostly about G.Andersons psychic readingswith the families and the spirits of thier loved ones. The familiesseem to validate the info G.Anderongives to them. The book in generaldemonstrates that there is possiblyan after life. I think the fact thatGeorge Anderson,has all those psychic readings demonstrates howlife can exist after the physicalbody has gone. I would say it isa great book for anyone who is grieving the death of a loved one,it gives one hope that the soulsurvives,it is not the end of them. I found this book soon after therewas a death in my family,it has really helped me with the loss andto go on and have hope.Personallythis book about life after death helped me greatly and I had a hardtime putting it down.

It truly puts your mind at ease."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"The book of Geo. Anderson I believe is truly authentic. The book was well written..he truly has a gift, but that is exactly what it is..a gift."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I've lost my parents as well as my step father and one of my brothers - this book gave great comfort to me and my family and I have recommended it to many friends who I felt needed this lift. No matter what religion, this book helps you if you've lost someone you love."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I cannot think of another book that has had such a profound influence on my life, religious beliefs and understanding of the afterlife. George's experiences as a medium prove, to my satisfaction: that life does not end at the grave; that our spirit/soul/self (whatever you choose to call it) merely sheds its physical shell at the moment of death; that we will be united with loved ones who've gone before us and who, indeed, are actually waiting to help us make the transition from this life to the next; that it is possible to receive messages from the &quot;other side&quot;; and that, in time, and if we so desire, we can return to the physical world as a newborn infant, with a whole new identity and family, and lead another earthly sojourn. Although I'm a practicing Catholic, George's book has given me a great new respect for non-Western religions and belief systems that teach reincarnation, ancestor worship (which is not really &quot;worship&quot; at all, but merely prayer to deceased relatives for their help and guidance), and the sanctity of all living things. It has also opened my mind to new ideas and helped me shed the arrogance of Catholicism, which teaches that Catholics alone possess the &quot;full truth.&quot; I heartily urge those who fear death (whether their own or someone else's) to read this book. So, too, should anyone who has ever wondered whether this present, earthly life of ours is &quot;all we get.&quot;"},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"To the skeptic reviewers - If you don't believe, fine, but you don't have to act like such insensitive, arrogant jerks about it. You approach the subject with all the intelligence, sensitivity and charm of Madeline Murray O'Hare! I had a friend who had a personal reading with George. He told her information that was very personal and unusual to her, NOT general. She went to the reading a bit skeptical and came out of it convinced. She told me the information in the session. I'll respect her privacy, but it was to the point and very individual. I was surprised, myself. I also have a friend and a child cousin who have had near-death experiences. They had no reason to lie about their experiences and they were quite convincing. I also have an ivy-league educated scientist friend who is quite religious who points out that if you truly are intelligent and well-versed in scientific thought, one of the things you understand is how much we do not yet know about the universe. Following some of the thought of skeptics, one would draw the conclusion that just because we don't have the scientific knowledge or methodology to discover something, it must not exist. Now there's an intelligent viewpoint!I do not like the trend of millionaire celebrity mediums with TV shows and large fanbases, but I think this book has a lot of valuable information to consider. I've seen \\"the amazing randi,\\" on numerous shows (he does like the limelight, doesn't he!) and I don't see him as being any more credible than the other celebrity seekers out there. I've gone to skeptic society Web sites, where I found they were as interested in money and selling product as anyone else. Much of their \\"scientific\\" study seems instead to use pseudo-science and unobjective methodology designed to \\"disprove.\\" So, they have not convinced me. If you're one of those who question others level of \\"brain cells\\" and need for a \\"crutch,\\" time to take a look in the mirror before you spew any more hurtful arrogance. Many of us with post-graduate degrees from wonderful schools think you're wrong."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"We all have these God-given gifts and my own spiritual search and mediumship have been influenced by channels such as George Anderson.

I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"George Anderson is a medium who has helped many people reach their departed loved ones.Coming from a Catholic background having gone through the Catholic school system, George was given the prophetic gift at an early age. Since the Catholic Church didn't re-confirm his gifts, George moved on in his spiritual life with encouragement from others and in particular Joel Martin.He was introduced to the public through radio programs that Mr. Martin produced and also television. Although George was not particularly excited about the television spot he understood that this was a way to reach many who had questions about the afterlife.This book does give the reader food for thought.Other authors worth reading on this subject would be Dr. Raymond MoodyReunions: Visionary Encounters With Departed Loved Ones, Dr. Elizabeth Kubler RossQuest - The Life Of Elizabeth Kubler-Rossand Betty EadieThe Awakening Heart: My Continuining Journey To Love.

Our deceased loved ones continue to grow and learn spiritually as we do in this life. Death took on a different meaning after reading this book. I have always believed in life after death because it was a part of my religious teachings. But I could only imagine &quot;afterlife&quot; starting at the end of the world. To me, death was so final and I feared that I would forget about my loved ones as the years passed. My son died 3 months ago and I have hope that he will be with me forever in spirit. Those experiences we shared before his death and throughout his life will remain in both of our spirits now and forever. This book helped me to realize that God never intended for us to be separated by death."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I thought this was an excellent book.

As for those who have been disappointed by George or who are shocked by his seemingly high fees, I would say, first of all, to the disappointed, that a bad reading can certainly occur. Gifted individuals are not always \\"on\\" all the time...they can mess up and be disappointing...just like any other human being. Ludwig Van Beethoven, one of our greatest composers of all time, was not always \\"on\\" and he occasionally composed rather dull and disappointing pieces. Mozart, another supremely great genius, was not always \\"on\\" and he wrote a lot of what I would call classical elevator music.As for the high fees, I would guesstimate--and I could be way off on this--that George takes in a gross of $250,000 a year. He would have to pay out at least half of that for his secretary, liability insurance--he runs a great risk of being sued--, attorneys and accountant's fees, etc. As for the remainder, various taxes, federal income tax, FICA, NY State income tax, property tax, etc...these will take around 40% of the remainder so that he is left with, according to my guesstimates, around$80,000 a year net after taxes and expenses. This is not extravagant. Seattle bus drivers--with overtime--can earn over$100,000 a year!So...let's be realistic folks and realize that while gifted, George is human also and can mess up at times. Also, if you consider the context of the economic realities of our time, his $1000 an hour fees are not outrageous."},{"Title":"We Don't Die: George Anderson's Conversations With the Other Side","review":"I read this book many years ago before I experienced painful loss of loved ones. However, the book allowed me to have some knowledge on how to deal with this part of life and gave me insights into the talents of George Anderson. I have had two sessions with George and it is very clear he is the real deal. My sessions have brought me peace and I thank George for making himself available to provide a service that is greatly needed.

We lost her -- and welost him -- they couldn't attend graduations, weddings,holidays. Our grief was deep.Then she died. And at the ageof 81, he allowed a 49-year-old &quot;girlfriend&quot; toseperate him from us becauseof jealousy. We grieved evenmore, but he was having so much fun that we released himwith love, hoping for eventualreunion. Then he died of asudden heart attack, and allhope was lost. My grief wasso intense that my skin actually hurt. I spent days in bed. I read Betty Eadie'sbook to try to find out wherehe was. Until I read ofGeorge Anderson's work, I could get no peace. Now I know that my Dad is working beyond the veil on the thingsI tried to teach him while hewas here. I can let that go.I know I'll be seeing him again. And all of us in myfamily have had our eyes opened thru these Andersonbooks to be able to discernthe ways my Dad has been trying to communicate with us.I've always had a faith, butwould never have believed thepathway I'm on now.

Perhaps for this reason the personalities of the major players are drawn vividly: characters like Balfour, Asquith, Joe Chamberlain who played a major part in the convoluted politics of the nineties and Edwardian era.It seems to me this was a period of incredibly complex change: the end of the mid-Victorian sobriety, the end of Britain as an agricultural nation, the end of the hegemony of devout Christianity, the frenzied pace of reform and the development of infrastructure, and the increasingly claustrophobic atmosphere of European politics as the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the rise of German nationalism threatened the status quo.Ensor is very fair to everyone, perhaps with a slight liberal bias, but strong Tory characters like Disraeli come out well, though he's not a massive fan of Salisbury, whose diplomatic skills are perhaps underrated.Ensor's greatest strength though is his absolute mastery of the detail of parliamentary activity and legislative change, where his approach is encyclopaedic.I agree with the other reviewer (on Amazon.co.uk), Ensor is a pleasure to read, his attention to his material is unfailing."},{"Title":"Chase the Lightning","review":"This is my second favorite in a long line of favorites by Linda Winstead Jones, Linda Devlin, Linda Fallon, Linda Jones, Linda Winstead.

Though not updated with all the latest finds and discussions (and in particular about the historicity of the earlier Israelite monarchal period), it still provides the best introduction and overview of this very popular topic."},{"Title":"Archaeology of the Land of the Bible","review":"If you're looking for a book dealing with specific archaeological issues relating to the Bible, or that applies archaeological insights to biblical passages (like an archaeologist's version of _The New Manners and Customs of Bible Times_), this is not it. In a few passages, Mazar does discuss the biblical narrative, but not that many.Instead, this is a detailed overview of and introduction to the archaeology of the land of the Bible, starting well before biblical events begin in any recognizable geography (i.e., Abraham) and ending in the sixth century (i.e., the book covers most of the Old Testament period). The book provides great context for the biblical narrative -- the application, you provide yourself.In addition to being a very readable account of a potentially very dry subject, Mazar's book is profusely illustrated with maps, diagrams and black and white photographs. The footnotes are profuse and detailed, giving you ample avenue to any follow up research you desire."},{"Title":"Archaeology of the Land of the Bible","review":"This a ultimately an essential read for anyone interested in biblical archaeology. Due to its somewhat technical nature, before reading this book it would be best to familiarize yourself with archaeological terminology, along with the basic chronology of Egyptian and Mesopotamian history, as this book makes extensive correlations of what was going on in Palestine with what was going on in Egypt and/or Mesopotamia at the same time.This book does not deal exclusively with the biblical period; rather, it is an archaeological overview of the region as a whole, from the beginning of the Epipaleolithic (10,500 BCE) down to the Neo-Babylonian conquest (586 BCE). A clear picture of the material culture of the region is painted, particularly of the Canaanite civilization of the Middle and Late Bronze Age. When the archaeological data is relevant to the biblical narrative, this is pointed out. I do find Mazar's argument for elements as early as the Middle Bronze Age in the Patriarchal stories to be unconvincing, but his interpretation of the evidence is solid with regards to Iron Age.The main problem with the book is that, apart from pointing out where the evidence corroborates or contradicts biblical testimony, the focus is almost entirely on material culture. While this is no doubt important in any synthesis, no attempt is made to produce a coherent picture of either the history or culture of the pre-Israelite period. While I know this is basically impossible to do before the Late Bronze Age, the Late Bronze itself has provided us with several primary sources which remain unutilized or underutilized: the Ugaritic archives and the Amarna Letters could be detailed a lot more thoroughly than they are. The coverage of the Israelite kingdoms is significantly better, but even so, it doesn't use Assyrian and Babylonian sources nearly as much as it could. Despite this, this book is still essential reading for anyone interested in biblical archaeology."},{"Title":"Archaeology of the Land of the Bible","review":"Amihai Mazar is an expert on the Archaeology of the Land of the Bible. His book is an amazing resource for anyone interested in the archaeology of Palestine/Israel. In his book, Mazar goes into great detail concerning the various important archaeological periods. His book is very will structured and allows for easy comparison of the different time period. This book is considered by many to be the standard text on archaeology in this area. Mazar, in his book, takes a rather neutral standpoint towards the bible. Sometimes, he compares his findings to what we can read in the bible, but he does not swing either way. It is his neutralism that makes him fairly objective as well as the best read on the subject. I would personally greatly recommend this book. There are many misconceptions about how what is in the bible compares to what is really there, this book will definitly help you clear up some of these misconceptions. For students of Christianity, whether Christian themselves or not, this book is an invaluable to finding the truth."},{"Title":"Archaeology of the Land of the Bible","review":"Mazar's work is noteworthy for its breath rather than its depth. Mazar reviews a huge period of history, breaking it down into several eras and further dividing the analysis based on several categories. In each subject Mazar examines the relevant material and the prevalent theories that surround it. While the author's point of view on many of these theories is made clear in the book itself, enough information is given so that any reader can go off to research these questions for themselves.Some have attacked Mazar on political grounds. Such charges are baseless and made by those with axes to grind who are more interested in their particular points of view rather than what we can learn from the archaeological record.While it is true that any of Mazar's subtopics of a particular period could be a book in itself, none are given short shrift. Enough detail is given to give the reader a basic understanding. What makes the book exceptional is how these pieces fit together, giving the reader an understanding of the broader whole. If you are interested in this subject, Mazar is an excellent place to start."},{"Title":"Archaeology of the Land of the Bible","review":"I bought this one as a pleasure read. (Yes, I know...) I was hoping that this would be an examination of the Biblical text and checking against the archaeological record. It's not. It's primarily an examination of the archaeological record, and the Bible is really only mentioned after you get about 300 pages in and is really just an incidental player in the text. It's relevant to Scriptural studies, but not the book for a beginner. However, despite my disappointment, I read the book all the way through. Despite the fact that I have little background in archaeology, I was impressed by how clear the writing was. Mazar does a fantastic job conveying the development of the area, and discussing how the people lived in each era. If you're more interested in the Bible, this isn't your book. If you're more interested in archaeology, this book is pretty good."},{"Title":"Archaeology of the Land of the Bible","review":"I bought this book because it seemed to be the one which would give me the most complete information on current archaeological data of the Land of the Bible from earliest times, and it met my expectations completely. As other reviewers have noted, it concentrates on what has been found , rather than dealing with specific archaeological issues, and describes what the remains tell us about the community who lived there, and how they lived.There is an depth introduction explaining the geographical setting, which is one of the most concise and helpful that I have read about Palestine, as well as a thorough review of the archaeological surveys which have taken place from the 19th century to the present time (the first edition of the book was written in 1987). There is a useful table of excavations carried out in Israel since 1948, as well as summaries on the techniques of excavation, chronology, terminology, publications, ideology and interpretation.There were many things I liked about the structure of the book, the most important being that each of its chapters covered a specific era of time starting with the first agricultural communities from 8500-4300BCE, and continuing with separate chapters on the communities of the Chalcolithic period (4300-3300BCE), the emergence of cities in the early Bronze age (3000-2300BCE), the period of sparse population between the Early and Middle Bronze ages (2300-2000BCE), the development of the Canaanite city states from 2000-1550BCE, and the Late Bronze Age when the area came under Egyptian domination. The remaining 5 chapters cover the period of Israelite domination, the Judges, the United Monarchy, the Divided Monarchy, with closing chapters on Israelite material culture and a brief final review of Israel's neighbours. There is also an appendix briefly describing recent discoveries to when the book was published in 1992Each chapter is well provided with maps, photographs, tables, and diagrams, with explanatory notes at the end of each chapter rather than one big section at the back. I found the diagrams particularly helpful because they have generally been kept simple enough so that one can understand the basic concept of what is being explained. On many occasions I found these more useful than the photographs which are every good in themselves.I agree that the book was somewhat dry in places, but, nevertheless, it retained my interest throughout and I often found myself saying \\"I didn't know that\\". There were some chapters which caught my interest more than others such Chapters 5 and 6, which cover the period of the Middle Bronze Age from about 2300-1500BCE, which happens to be the period that is coterminous with the Akkadian and Old Babylonian dynasties of Iraq. I also thought that the chapter 7 \\"In the shadow of Egyptian Domination\\" and chapter 8 \\"The Days of the Judges\\" were particularly informative, with the latter having a full description on the settlements, pottery, architecture, artifacts, and culture of the Philistines and other Sea Peoples, which can be compared and contrasted with an equally detailed description for that of the Israelite tribes in the period of the Judges. In this chapter as in all for the later chapters Dr Mazar provides an historical outline which is careful delineated from the \\"facts on the ground\\".I found that the best way to read this book is to read it a chapter at a time, and then taking some time to reflect on what I had read, or perhaps reread certain parts. That was necessary because it is in great detail, and I found my eyes \\"glazing over\\" at times, which for me is always a sign that I am probably going to miss something important. I will certainly find it a useful reference for the other books on Canaan and Israel which I have on my reading list, and recommend it highly to anyone who is interested in reconciling the archaeological record of the biblical period with that of written historical accounts."},{"Title":"Archaeology of the Land of the Bible","review":"I have to agree with the other two reviews of this book.

He takes the reader through the entire archaeological history of Israel in a way that is understandable and fascinating, including great pictures, diagrams, and maps along the way. Very useful and illuminating."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"The best book in the series, this one presents HH with some of his hardest obstacles yet,to be unparalleled by any of the other books. In this installment, C.S Forrester's indomitable charactor is sent away with a very &quot;daunting set of orders&quot; to the Pacific coast of the Central American isthmus, being instructed to aid an insane land-owner in a revolt against Spanish control, to open up a route across the isthmus, and to encourage trade- all under the menace of the Spanish 50- gun ship, the Natividad.CSF reaches his pinnacle with several stunning single- ship duels in which Hornblower pitts his diminutive but capable 36- gun Lydia against the fearsome Natividad.These are, by far, the best battles in the series, and that's saying a lot.And then, of course, there is yet another problem for HH- the quick- witted and determinded Lady Barbara, to whom the captain must pledge a passage to England, although already harrassed by the turns of fortune he previously had to endure."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"This book (often collected with \\"Ship of the Line\\" and \\"Beat to Quarters\\" as \\"Captain Horatio Hornblower\\" is the best \\"boy's\\" adventure book ever, the gold standard by which all others are measured. It inspired, among others, O'Brien's Aubrey, Cornwell's Sharpe, Kent's Bolitho, and Weber's Harrington. It works perfectly as a sea story and romance, as the middle class Hornblower, Captain of the Lydia, meets and falls in love with Lady Barbara, the sister to the Duke of Wellington. Along the way he battles enemies of superior force, overcoming them as well as his own inferiority complex. Historical detail is superb and this book, as well as the series as a whole, is a superb introduction to the Napoleonic period, particularly class society in Britain. Forester passed away before he could write to Trafalgar, but Hornblower and the Atropos has a lovely description of Lord Nelson's funeral that I remember vividly 39 years later and used as a guide on a recent trip to London last month."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"This book definitely ranks among my favorite books ever, which puts it up with scifi pageturners like Ender's Game and classics such as LOTR and Dune. For the warfare, military history, or historical fiction enthusiast, this is a must read...the ship to ship duel between the Lydia and the Natividad is honestly one of the best military engagements I have read, it spares no reader the intensity and gore inherent in naval battles of the period, and is all told from the unique pespective of Hornblower, our intellectual, talented, yet insecure protagonist."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"BEAT TO QUARTERS is the first Horatio Hornblower novel that C. S. Forester wrote, though it takes place sixth chronologically. This novel is set during the Napoleonic Wars off the west coast of Central America. Hornblower and his crew are exposed to danger because of the shifting political realities back in Europe, and to complicate matters, Hornblower is forced to accept a British noblewoman as a passenger.I suggest reading this novel before reading others in the series because it really introduces Hornblower and his personality. Forester presents Hornblower as an outwardly confident and taciturn British captain who inwardly is at war with his own perceived inadequacies. Read this book first, then readShip of the Line (Hornblower Saga)andFlying Colours (Hornblower Saga). After that read some of the earlier books to experience the fun of seeing how Hornblower became Hornblower.BEAT TO QUARTERS is a fast-paced novel with many scenes of naval engagement. Forester's description at times can be quite technical for the layman, and often I found myself understanding nothing of his descriptions, e.g., a significant rearranging of the ship's rigging. Amazingly, in spite of my lack of comprehension, I didn't find these passages boring. Instead I read them with the realization that if I had been witnessing the maneuvers, I would have been just as bewildered by what was going on. Forester is at his best when he's depicting the workings of the British navy (and its socio-political realities). His portraits of these sailors at all ranks is very compelling and helps to create sympathy in the reader. Forester also doesn't shy away from the gritty realities of naval life, nor does he shy away from its mundane aspects (aspects that he describes rather interestingly).The one thing that I didn't like about this book, which certainly won't irk every reader, is Forester's annoying habit of narrating the events from the modern perspective. For example, Forester writes, \\"The phrase 'globe trotting' with all its disparaging implications, had not yet been invented, but it expressed exactly Hornblower's feeling about her.\\" And another example, \\"The day was yet to come when Florence Nightingale was to make nursing a profession in which women could engage.\\" Every time I came across an anachronistic description like these I winced inwardly. Other than these infelicities, I felt that Forester evinced a good prose style, and he is especially adept at fleshing out characters."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"For new readers to the Hornblower saga, this is the book to start with, even though it's not the first book chronologically. It introduces many main characters, like Leutienant Bush, Lady Barbara Wellesley, and of course, Horatio himself."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"I purchased this book because I could not get it as an E book for my reader ( the other brand ). It was in good condition for a used book, and got delivered faster than I expected."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"This is not a bad book or story, but the love interest angle that develops here turns out (in later books) to be too lucky. But, the story is quite decent otherwise."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"A good match for the \\"Sharpe\\" series of Napoleonic War stories set on the land (largely). You should start with the first of the series and read right through. Well written and interesting situations."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Forester eventually backtracked and wrote four books set in Hornblower's earlier career. This book introduces two important characters: Lt. Bush and Lady Barbara. Before reading the series I had already read all 20 of the \\"Master and Commander\\" books by Patrick O'Brian. When I finished that series I never thought I would meet characters as interesting Jack Aubrey or Stephen Maturin. I was wrong. Hornblower, Bush and Lady Barbara keep me asking for more. I am on the 9th book in the series, and I am going to be as depressed as I was when I finish number 11 as I was when I finished O'Brian's 20th."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"This was my first Hornblower book but I intend to plow through his whole canon, because this book was arguably one of the best sea stories I've ever read. Hornblower is a complex, wonderful character and Forester is at his best when he is dealing with the nuances and internal dialogs of the man. Suspense starts building on the first few pages and by the end, the reader is satisfied that he has read a captivating masterpiece. I love sea stories but my favorites have mostly been tales of modern seafaring. This book takes us to the British-Spanish sea battles of the early 17th century. Forester's battle descriptions are deftly done and graphic. Not only does he show the pain of war, but he masterfully shows us life aboard the massive sailing ship. There's even a hint of romance in this book which, for a disciplined captain like Hornblower, can be as challenging as battle. A very well done book. An excellent introduction to what I am certain will be a most delightful series of books."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"If you're new to the Hornblower series, start with this one. Then read Ship of the Line, then Flying Colors. The three are practically a triptych, whereas the others all feel like they have space between them. Also, since Forester actually wrote Beat To Quarters first, there's in 'introductory' quality to it that no other book in the series has. The series compares favorably with the Aubrey/Maturin series I think. Odd that they were both cut short by the deaths of their respective authors.In short, start with this and the next two as a trilogy, then proceed in any order you want."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"...or, to be more precise, I sat within yards of a major Civil War re-enactment so engrossed in this book that I managed to ignore artillery and musket fire. I am a big fan of the Aubrey/Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian, but previously looked down my nose at Hornblower, I think because I knew it solely from TV and movies. This book never slows down for a minute--not just battles but ship repair and revictualling seem gripping in the hands of Forester.Based on the films, I was not expecting Hornblower to show much internal life--he always seems to be superhuman on screen, but in the book he must struggle with his softer nature to develop his imperious style. Likewise I expected nothing interesting in the way of female characters, but it was a happy surprise to find Lady Barbara Wellesley on board ship.If you will forgive a few O'Brian/Forrester comparisons: O'Brian is funnier. Forrester's battle scenes are a bit easier for me to follow. Hornblower is a more interesting or at least complex character than Aubrey, but O'Brian has the advantage of Maturin, who not only adds character but allows for dialogue rather than the perennial internal monologues Hornblower has with himself because he has no one of rank to talk to.I hope that more seasoned readers of the series will agree with this appeal to newer readers: Even if you have read neither author, this book is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"I first read BEAT TO QUARTERS when I borrowed it from a public library in 1940. It is now 1998 and the third copy of the book is in my book case, the other two copies, being paper-backs, having been read until worn out.I might add that, in my opinion, any aspiring writer would do well to read Forester, not to copy his style, but to realise that any good author can entertain, but only the great can enthrall; and only the greatest can make you &quot;see&quot; a character (even a minor one) in only two short lines of print.His death robbed the reading world of one of its most readable authors."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Although it was the first book C.S. Forester wrote, Beat To Quarters is chronologically the sixth book in the Hornblower Series. One can see instantly why the series took off when this book hit the press. It is not only a thrilling adventure but establishes a depth of character rarely seen in its genre.This book is the first of a trilogy of connected titles that cover Horatio's rise from an unknown frigate's captain to one of the most famous officers in the Royal Navy. Posted to duty west of Central America, he is expected to navigate not only the water of the Pacific, but the troubled political waters of rebellion and shifting alliances that characterized the Napoleonic wars. He's required to engage a ship of twice his might not once but three times. And of course, he meets Lady Barbara -- destined to become one of the most intruiging characters in his life.I was surprised to find little discontinuity with the &quot;prequel&quot; books that were written after Beat to Quarters. The book almost seamlessly blends with the cannon of Horatio's life, referencing his previous adventures with the Castilla and Captain Pellow. The only real continuity problem is that Bush seems to have lost his memory of the events in the second and third books.This books works because it doesn't try to confine itself to a simple genre. It is, of course, a splendid action adventure and wonderful historical fiction. But it also works as a simple character drama -- establishing three powerful characters -- the taciturn Hornblower, efervescent Bush and charming Barbara -- and creates memorable scenes built solely from conversation and interaction."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"The first Hornblower book that Forester wrote, and the best. Exciting action, wonderful characterization--particularly Hornblower himself, who is a three-dimensional human with failings, not a cardboard cutout action hero--and even a bit of romance for those who like that sort of thing (me! me!). The scenes with Hornblower and Lady Barbara were so evocative and delightful--I felt as if I was sitting on the deck with them under the stars, listening to their conversations. I would recommend that the series be read in chronological order of Hornblower's career, rather than the order in which Forester wrote them, but BTQ is the jewel in the crown."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Hornblower series are not bad. Unfortunately, I read Aubrey/Maturin (which is much, much better) first. Basically, one could classify the Hornblower series as very good adventure, as opposed to Aubrey/Maturin, which could be classified as very good literature. I started with Midshipman Hornblower, which is probably the best book in the series, and recommend the sequence of reading published on the cover of the books. If you have not read O'Brien yet - good for you!! Start with Hornblower to warm up (it's only 11 books), and then sink your teeth in Master and Commander of Aubrey/Maturin (20 books)."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"One of the strengths of the C.S. Forester series about Horatio Hornblower is that Hornblower's character is developed in great depth in a variety of different ways in each book. Beat to Quarters places Hornblower at the center of a spectrum between madness and mental incapacity on the one hand, and being ruled by the emotions and passion on the other hand. Hornblower finds it quite challenging to deal with both extremes, and you will enjoy reading about his reactions.To make the story even more delicious, it involves a series of misadventures based on the slowness and uncertainty of communications. Those who have studied the War of 1812 will probably remember that the Battle of New Orleans was fought well after the British and Americans had already made peace. But the word had not yet gotten to New Orleans. Similar issues are involved in this book.Unlike most of the other books in the series, Beat to Quarters will probably be as appealing to female readers as to male ones. For over half of the book, Lady Barbara Wellesley is a central character. Unlike the earlier books where male-female relations are made as simple and brief as possible, Beat to Quarters shows how two outstanding people of opposite sexes might come to respect and appreciate each other, despite vast differences in their circumstances and social standing.Beat to Quarters is an extremely important book in the series, because it sets up major plot developments in Ship of the Line (the next book chronologically in Hornblower's life in the series) which many people feel is the best action book that Mr. Forester wrote about Hornblower.If you have not yet read any of the Hornblower novels, I strongly urge you to begin with Mr. Midshipman Hornblower and continue through in the order of Hornblower's chronological life, rather than the order in which the books were written. Mr. Forester went back and added books here and there in the chronology, later in his life.How can you keep your focus strong, by balancing your emotions and thoughts? What benefits will you achieve? When should you be willing to let emotion reign?"},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Beat to Quarters is the sixth book in the eleven book series covering the exploits of Horatio Hornblower. It is also, in my opinion, the best one out of the ones I have read. It's story flows from one point to the next and there is plenty of action in this installment.The first thing I should mention is that Mr. Forrester's description of life onboard a War Ship is quite accurate. Being a member of today's Navy, it's amazing to see just how little has changed in 200 years. Sure, the ships are made of steel, we have satellite communications, etc... However, much has remained the same. We still spend hour after hour cleaning the ship, drilling for action, etc... and Mr. Forrester does a wonderful job capturing this.The second thing about this novel I enjoyed was the description of the battle between the Spanish Warship and Hornblower's Frigate. I was on the edge of my seat wondering how Captain Hornblower would be able to win a battle against the much more powerful Spanish ship. I'm sure you will enjoy this book for these reasons and many others. IF you like good historial Drama then I would HIGHLY recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Though 'Beat to Quarters' falls in the middle of the Hornblower series it was the first written, as well as one of the best.

After defeating a Spanish warship and handing the vessel over to the rebels Hornblower recieves shocking news: Napoleon has invaded Spain. Now that Spain has become Britian's ally Hornblower must reagain control of the Spanish warship from the rebels and give it back to the rightful owners. The action that follows is the naval adventure that author C. S. Forester is known for. Also, Forester throws his gallant protagonist a curve ball by introducing him to Lady Pamela Wellesely, sister of the Duke of Wellington. The attraction is sudden and unexpected but more than a little complicated. One of the best novels in the series, 'Beat to Quarters' is consistantly exciting and absolutly entertaining. Fans of the series and those new to it will applaud Forester's first Hornblower novel."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Once your get started, you can't stop, and it's satisfyingly corny.

If I had a son, I would encourage him to read them when he was old enough. In THIS age, they convey true integrity, along with true courage...Oh yeah, and true adventure! Not just combat adventure, but how the characters in the political world of the Imperial Navy of the 1800's can appreciate the humility, modesty, and dedication of one of their own.And as many have said before me, the detail is incredible, as if Forester was there.

Needless to say over the years my paperbacks have seen their finest hour from many rereads.

I finally took the time to order the 1st book and experience it myself. My background as a long time boater (sail) and having worked as a commercial fisherman endear all maritime books anyway. I found this first Hornblower novel by Forester to be a quick and enjoyable read - very detailed in the life aboard a British Naval frigate and Hornblower wins the reader over as he display's the many offsets between normal human vulnerabilities and the rigors of command. I highly recommend reading this book before watching \\"Master and Commander\\" it provides a wonderful primer to the film. I chose to read the 1st novel written as opposed to keeping with chronological order of Hornblowers career - I'm not sure if it makes a difference. My goal was to follow the authors creative schedule - I think chronologically Midshipman Hornblower would be the 1st in the series.If you like books about the Age of Sail you will enjoy this novel...tothemax"},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Even though this is the first Hornblower novel written, I started reading the series in the Chronology of his life. The first was Mr. Midshipman Hornblower. This is the sixth book that I have read.Now that I have read this book and if I was asked which order to read them, I could argue for either way. This book does an excellent job introducing Hornblower and leaves you wondering what adventures he had prior to the events of this book. I'm happy with the order that I read the books, but would have been just as happy reading them in the order written.The major item that seemed like a discrepancy from the earlier books is that Lt. Bush seemed to be a new acquaintance of his on this voyage, though the other books showed that they had a long history together.Either way, I can see why this book started a whole series of sequels. It is great story telling with interesting characters and great lessons on seamanship. I highly recommend this book to lovers of action and adventure who like a thinking hero."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Although Midshipman Hornblower describes the beginning of Horatio Hornblower's naval career, Beat to Quarters was the first Hornblower book that Forester wrote. As a result, it stands well on its own, and doesn't require any background provided by the other books in the series. It is also a much better book than Midshipman Hornblower. For want of a better comparison, Midshipman Hornblower introduces and describes the character, whereas Beat to Quarters truly develops the character.Additionally, Beat to Quarters is simply a compelling read. Hornblower begins by sailing his ship to the Pacific coast of Central America, where he is to foment a rebellion against Spain. His mission is complicated by the rapidly changing diplomatic situation in Europe, which causes many plot twists. We are also introduced to an interesting lady, whose presence threatens to complicate Horatio's own domestic tranquility. Throughout, Horatio Hornblower is an intriguing character, and this book is worth reading."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"The entire series of the Hornblower books are a must read. Forester was able to tell stories that had no boring sections, unlike Master and Commander, a book written of the same period and about the same types of life. This was Forester's first book of the series, but I think it is best to start with the first of the eleven books, all paper back and all done by the same publisher with the same type of cover illustrations. I read the entire series many years ago and found a fair number of inconsistencies based largely on the fact things happened in the books covering Horblower's earlier life that were not considered when Forester started the series. Some still remain, such as Hornblower's ability to speak French. As a younger officer he spoke it well. Later, he knows only a few words. Still, the books are so excellent it is best to overlook the inconsistencies."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"\\"Beat to Quarters\\" was the first book that C.S.

This book is full of diplomatic intrigue and naval action and serves as a great introduction to the series (although you should not start with this book if you want to read them in chronological order).This was the first Horatio Hornblower book that I read, although I had seen the A&E; TV series. As a devotee of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin series, I was pleasantly surprised with this Hornblower book and I found Hornblower a much more authentic character than the superman of the TV series. Still, it is hard for me not to compare Hornblower with Captain Aubrey: although I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I find Aubrey a much more fun and likable character than Hornblower. Hornblower is a much more serious and deep character who is driven by self-doubt.This is a very good book, and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in naval warfare or historical fiction. It is a great account of naval life and warfare during the Napoleonic era. C.S. Forester started a genre with Horatio Hornblower, and this is the book that started the Horatio Hornblower series."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"This book in stands out from the its predecessors in the series, it is much better.

He has the dreads and doubts but does his duty anyway.This book is the father of not only the rest of the series, but of all the naval sagas that would follow and a fine series of movies for the big screen (Peck) and small (A&amp;E). Quite a legacy."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"I am an avid reader of sea novels, and I truly believe this is the best I've ever read. It manages to keep a good deal of action going throughout, but the presence of the character of Lady Barbara allows the human side of Hornblower's character to develop as well.

ForesterBeat To Quarters is the best account of an adventure at sea that I have ever read. It's part of a series by C.S. Forester, about Captain Horatio Hornblower, a sea captain who must fight his inner self to appear the iron-nerved, quiet, model captain that he wants his crew to see. Inside, he is a talkative, nervous, and incredibly smart man who has worked his way up the levels of sea faring.In this book, he must fight with his inner self as he performs many missions for the British government. It's the year 1808, and Captain Hornblower is sent to a country in Central America to congregate with an insane leader that goes by the name of El Supremo, to try to start a rebellion against the Spanish. After capturing a Spanish ship with almost twice the size, guns, and men as his named the Natividad, and giving it to El Supremo, Captain Hornblower is told that the British are no longer at war with the Spanish, and that he must re-seize the ship and stop the rebellion. Captain Hornblower continues to follow the almost impossible orders of the British, using his remarkable seamanship, while also carrying a British noblewoman onboard for a trip back to England. Through all these incredible tasks, he manages to stay alive, keep his self-image, and win the heart of every sailor in his crew.Beat To Quarters is an excellent book, and although it is not the first book in it's series chronologically, it was the first written and so possesses an introductory quality that the other books don't. I would recommend this book to any reader who wants to read a remarkable account of a sea adventure, even if you haven't read any other books in the series. This book is a great, exciting read, and the author C.S. Forester did a superb job writing it."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"This was the first Hornblower novel written. The original Hornblower motion picture was based on this novel and the following two novels (\\"Ship of the Line\\" and \\"Flying Colours\\"). The author later went back to fill in the details of Hornblower's early career, explaining the early relationship with Bush, etc. You could actually start reading the novels with this one, but it is better to start with Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, and follow Hornblower's career from the beginning. C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a fictional biography of Hornblower which fills in a fictional account of his early life. C.S. Forester later wrote \\"the Hornblower Companion\\" which should probably be acquired when you start reading the series.Hornblower is sent off to the Pacific to aid a revolutionary leader who is in rebellion against Spain (an enemy of my enemy is my friend), a dangerous practice (Germany later aided Lenin to start the Russian Revolution during World War I). After arming the revolutionary army, and capturing a Spanish ship which he gives to the rebel leader (who has him under the guns of a fortress), he discovers that Spain is no longer at war with England. Slow communications across the ocean caused many miscues during that historical period.Having turned loose a rebel army, Hornblower now finds he is allied with Spain, and must now fight the rebel army he created. He must retake the ship which he had captured and turned over to the rebels. He is fortunate that the rebel leader is not a seaman, and prevails at some cost in casualties.Hornblower also acquires a romantic interest, meeting the woman he later marries as his second wife (see Commodore Hornblower), a woman with considerable influence at court. As usual with Hornblower, he gets no prize money but lots of official recognition, so starts out in the next novel as a financially poor captain in command of a ship of the line.The three novels, \\"Beat to Quarters,\\" \\"Ship of the Line,\\" and \\"Flying Colours\\" should be read as a trilogy."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"No matter how large your queue of books-in-process (waiting to be read) is, drop them all and read the Hornblower series.

Its orders were to seek an alliance with a rebel government against Spanish America and to take, sink, burn or destroy a ship with three times the firepower of the Lydia. The book displays the shrewdness of its captain, Horatio Hornblower, who's calculated leadership accomplishes its duties and does it with effienciency. However there are twists in the plot that derail Hornblower's orders from the admirality in the Pacific as well as the need to take on board a female passenger seeking a way home due to unforseen circumstances. One note to take interest in the book is the introspection from the captain. As the captain of the ship, Hornblower must seem imperturbed even in the most distressful situations in order to maintain calm amongst his crew. But in private Hornblower anguishes about keeping the crew in control, maintain the operation of the ship, devising the tactics of the battle of maneuvering the ship and determining when to fire upon an enemy ship, as well as other problems that can come up. He also has a wife in England whom he thinks about. The female passenger in the book didn't really develop a romantic relationship until the second to the last chapter and the author isn't very thorough in developing those kinds of plots anyway. The battles were the most intriguing in the book and the aftermath of both battles left the captain with some challenging problems of which you needed to read on in order to find out.All in all one of the better books in the series."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"It is the year 1808 and Hornblower, with the 36 gun ship HMS Lydia, is sent somewhere west of Nicaragua to join forces with an insane Spanish landowner to fight the Spanish government.

I enjoy it more each time. The character of Captain Hornblower is an excellent leadership study. While the uninitiated reader may question Hornblower's efforts to remain distant from his men, the military leader will recognize in Forester's hero a human being struggling to maintain a necessary distance from men whom his orders may kill. His moment of self-satisfaction at a perfect landfall after weeks out of sight of land, his self-doubts as he makes momentous decisions without contact with higher authority, and his sobering knowledge that, as captain, he is all alone make us believe that Horatio Hornblower is a very real man.The battle scenes are extremely well written, and the presence of Lady Wellesley, which could seem contrived, adds to the quality of the book by showing the reader one more facet of Hornblower's personality. As she sees through his protective callousness, so do we.After nearly a decade in the Naval Service, I still view the Hornblower saga as the best naval fiction I have ever read. The only book which approaches Forester's ability to place the reader into the minds of men on board a ship of war is Wouk's The Caine Mutiny.I cannot praise this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"If you are reading it you have to have this one. Buy it!"},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"c.s. forester is very good at making hornblower both believable and someone we care about. the sea battles are riveting. didn't have much of a plot though, and it's always painful to read the casual racism in novels of this era. the presence of lady wellesley on board for most of the story didn't really add anything, either."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Forester may have helped create the genre of historical naval novels, but , quite frankly... Patrick O'Brian was the more capable writer. Forester's Hornblower is a cardboard figure compared to O'Brian's Maturin and Aubrey.Perhaps O'Brian's work could be considered &quot;derivative&quot;... but this would be a good example of the pupil trumping his Master.As light reading, with a fascinating dose of well-researched 19th C. naval history, I think O'Brian is the place to start, despite the &quot;longevity&quot; of the Hornblower saga.But.. reading both authors will give you material to form your own opinions about their relative merits."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"I just don't relate to any of the reviews. Did any of you read the same book that I did? Specifically, did any of you read it any more recently than, say, when Dr Martin Luther King was assassinated?Practically every character is introduced with derogatory racial statements. The author has painfully outdated attitudes against every single non-English person in the book. I learned a new slur for southern Europeans while reading the second chapter (page 19, and throughout the book). All Spanish sailors are sweepingly condemned as talkative, lazy, and incompetent.Of course, Europeans fare better than non-Europeans. The people in Central America are all swarthy, dirty, and ragged. Their loyalty and convictions are constantly suspect. Nearly every person in the villain's service is disparaged as multiracial. Not described -- disparaged. The most fearsome and least sympathetic characters, such as the major domo, are those multiracial characters with some African blood.Speaking of Africans, Lady Barbara Wellesley announces within minutes of setting foot on the deck that she will have to lock up her black maid because otherwise the maid will unashamedly have sex with every possible man on the ship: '\\"It is not on my account, Captain, that I need a key. It is Hebe here whom I have to lock in unless she is directly under my eye. She can no more keep from the men than a moth from the candle.\\" The little negress grinned widely at this speech, showing no resentment and a good deal of pride.' (page 110 -111). Lady Barbara then explains that her method of keeping her maid in line is simply to beat her into submission -- just the kind of sweet lady you want for a story's love interest, right?I've read the entire Aubrey/Maturin series repeatedly. Jack Aubrey would have had nothing but contempt for Hornblower. He's a scrub with absolutely zero respect for the men under him. The lower deck consists solely of men that can't do anything except wring their hands unless an officer tells them what to do. (Yes, these would be the same men that are supposedly at risk for self-organizing a mutiny in the first pages of the book.) He flogs twice a week. He lies to and deliberately manipulates his junior officers. He deliberately tortures them with unfelt displays of serene chat about playing cards when they would rather be preparing for battle because he thinks it might improve their opinion of his god-like infallibility.His first lieutenant is best characterized as the son who wants his father's approval -- and will never get it, because his father is a stuffed shirt. Hornblower's hang up about talking to his staff results in withholding critical information. The men under him are supposed to mindlessly obey his orders like automata, and nevermind that a little bit of fair warning would have saved at least one life.There are certain stupidities in the storyline, like the author's decision that Hornblower would be the sole person aboard that speaks any Spanish. Nevermind that this is unbelievably unlikely in a collection of nearly 400 sailors that had spent so many years at war in and around the Mediterranean, and that lifelong sailors picked up a few words here and there of all sorts of languages. The average sailor's speech might not amount to much more than \\"Woman\\" or \\"Beer\\", but speaking none at all is 'poetic license' at best.In the initial capture of the Natividad, the timing on the action is completely wrong. The ship drops sails, closes a significant distance, fires a broadside, and lashes its yardarms to the Natividad -- in the length of time that it takes Hornblower to run from one end of his smallish frigate to the other; nevermind that in the very first pages of the book, just getting up the masts and setting (all) the sails takes 24 minutes, firing three broadsides in five minutes was considered a quite good rate back then, it takes a couple of minutes to lash spars together (especially when your opponent is trying to kill you at the time), more than a few seconds to get dozens of men up and down the masts so that you can do any of these things, and a fifty-yard dash (Hornblower was actually running less than that distance) is usually measured in mere seconds--as in, less than ten of them. But somehow, the author thinks that Hornblower's running from the quarterdeck to the bow takes just as long as all of the above, which is absurd.There are things in this book that are well done -- they do exist, and for that, see all the other reviews -- but overall I cannot recommend it, and I hope that future readers will go into it with more awareness of its contents than I did."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"A Character loosely based on Nelson, Hornblower's series takes you through being a Midshipman to being an Admiral in the Napoleanic Wars. This series was created during WWII and was the most popular series in England until James Bond came along. The author went on to write other books (like the African Queen), but will always be remembered for this great combination of action, character-development and historical realism. This is a great book for anyone; but as a teen, it was the first series to introduce me to how fascinating and worthwhile reading could be."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Beat to Quarters (1937), also known as The Happy Return, is C. S. Forester's original Horatio Hornblower novel. It fits sixth in the chronology. In 1808, Hornblower, captain of the frigate Lydia, sails to Nicaragua to aid a mad warlord in his revolution against the French. Complications ensue, as usual, including the married Hornblower falling in love with another woman (which is rather unexpected).Beat to Quarters has a fair mix of action and drama, although things drag along at times. The climax of the book is a fifty-page sea battle, during which Forester immerses the reader in naval warfare and at the same time overloads him with nautical details.Beat to Quarters was written over ten years before any of the chronologically-previous novels, and there is a noticeable difference in style and tone. For one, the narrative here does not flow as well as it does in Forester's later writing - he gets bogged down in details and he has a tendency to repeat himself. Hornblower is still fundamentally Hornblower - he is self-loathing, insecure, posturing and hypocritical, although his manner is not quite the same and he has manifested a bizarre habit of saying, \\"Ha - h'm,\\" all the time.It will become clear to anyone who has read the Hornblower books that Forester did quite a bit of retconning when he went back to write the novels of Hornblower's early career. Notable examples include Hornblower's age and his relationship with Lieutenant Bush, and there are quite a few other small things.On the whole, Beat to Quarters is a decent novel not with out its problems, although its flaws are easier to forgive knowing that Forester was still finding his way with Hornblower. New Hornblower readers would do better to start with Mr. Midshipman Hornblower."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Recently I was consumed by the O'Brian series, devouring all in a short time. Since I an a surgeon, Maturin was appealing. Simply out of curiosity, I returned to Forester, whom I have not read in thirty years. There is no comparison. The writing flows,the language is not contrived, the battle scenes are riveting. Contrasting the description of his feeling towards Lady Barbara is just wonderful. Beat To Quarters is the best of the two series that I have read."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"I don't get it... why is this book so highly rated?There must be a lot of nostalgic old folks who read these as kids... Or in light of having read the entire series, have decided to have an unusual opinion in order to sound erudite in matters of Hornblower. Or they could know something which I don't; however, let me respectfully submit that Beat to Quarters is pretty mediocre as action/adventure/historical fiction novels of the 1930's go. The characters seem contrived, the archvillian hopelessly cliche, and the storytelling is painfully explicit. Not to say that I didn't enjoy it, because I did -- the pacing is good, and as forced as it may seem, Forester is trying to create interesting, complex characters, which pays off in the later novels. The writing improves tremendously too, so keep with them if you can.Righto, the summary. Horatio Hornblower is captain of the frigate Lydia, the sole English ship wandering about the Pacific. Horatio is marked by his reserve and and critical powers which he applies as vigorously to himself as that which surrounds him, but despite all this, he is garrulous, and therefore has a habit of saying \\"Ha... H'm\\" in conversation to avoid speaking too much. Lieutenant Bush is loyal, but, as we are told, unimaginative, so it's up to Horatio to come of with all the brilliant plans. He has been sent on a mission to aid in an uprising against the Spanish in Central America, but, as the delegate of a morally disinterested third party, he finds that alliances can be slippery things... There's a bit of romance mixed in with all the sea battles, but since Horatio never quite gets clear of trouble, there's not a dull moment throughout the entire 250 odd pages... That's probably all I can say without giving away the rest of the story -- I recommend Beat to Quarters for anyone who wants a light read and is a fan of seafaring stories of the Napoleonic era.We have to compare O'Brien and Forester, right? From what I've read of both of them, O'Brien is the better writer, but Forester is a lot more readable. Hornblower doesn't feel as historic, which is partly because Forester didn't do his research quite as throughouly, but also because O'Brien succeeds in creating characters which feel genuinely \\"foreign\\". Jack and Stephen are not men of our time to be sure, but this also makes them a lot more difficult to relate to.Well, there's my two cents. :)"},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"I understand that this is the first Hornblower book written. That explains a lot. It is actually the sixth, chronologically, in Hornblower's career.First of all, Lieutenant Bush is back. But, it is not too well described the relationship and history between Bush and Hornblower. But, this is the first book written, so at the time of writing, there wasn't any history....Anyway, Hornblower is his typical self. Very unsure of his skills and abilities and far too worried about keeping up his image in front of the men.The story is excellent. A seven month voyage on a secret mission. Hornblower follows his orders explicitly. Never to touch land until his destination. Well, imagine how the world of politics can change in seven months. Hornblower has had no new information about the war since he left England.Enemies are now friends. Friends are now enemies.As for the action scenes.... This is one of the best described ship to ship sequences I have ever read. As usual, Hornblower is outgunned. However, he has the smaller faster ship and is able to outmeneuver his opponent. The battle lasts well over 12 hours of his time. It is interupted by a driving storm and night.At dawn, the enemy is sighted. There is little or no wind. Hornblowers lowers the boats and begins a stern chase by being towed. As he closes, the other ship uses it's heavier weight of iron to deliver broadside after broadside at extreme range. Hornblower has to endure this for several hours before his smaller guns are within range. At that point, the training and discipline of the English sailors takes it's toll.With the politics aside, this book is a great read."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"The original Hornblower novel. This book started the popular 17th/18th century naval historical fiction trend.Beat to Quarters is the story of British frigate on assignment off the Pacific coast of South America. Forester does an excellent job portraying the roles and responsibilities of a commander on foreign station. The story line is well put together, reads easily and moves quickly.The story concentrates on Captain Hornblower, the commander of the vessel. Many of the details that we currently expect to see in naval historical fiction dealing with ship operation and interaction with the crew are only partially developed. At the time Beat to Quarters was written, there was no assumption of knowledge based on prior reading. There was no other similar reading available!Overall, Beat to Quarters is worth reading both as a classic and because it is a good book."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"It's interesting to read the first of the Hornblower books within its chronological order. As the first published, but chronologically within the middle of Hornblower's career, it offers some unavoidable dissonance. As another reviewer stated, it feels more \\"introductory\\" than even the chronological first of the series. Hornblower doesn't yet feel as well developed (or as likable) and some of the details seem just little off from the chronologically earlier books (although that might just be my memory). But that aside, this is no slouch of a book. Forester demonstrates his historical and action-scene chops throughout, and the Lady Barbara subplot brings a whole new layer of personal complications."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Beat to Quarters was the first of the Hornblower books that Forester wrote. It's a tale of adventure off the west coast of Central America during the early part of the 19th century. Among the problems that Captain Hornblower faces are the changing politics of Spain, are they on our side, or against us. Are we supporting the rebels fighting Spanish rule, or helping them? Hornblower has to capture a much larger Spanish ship twice, once from the Spanish, and once from the rebels he turned it over to. Like all the Hornblower adventures, Forester includes a lot of detailed description of the daily life and hardships of life in the English Navy during the age when ships were of wood and men were of iron. After his final sea battle, which sinks his prize and prevents him from gaining prize money, Hornblower has to careen his own ship on a hidden beach to patch it up before the long trip home. He meets Lady Barbara in Panama, who is to be his future wife and love, but that is for a later story. Whether you read them in the order written, Beat to Quarters first, or in chronological order of Hornblower's life, it's a rousing good tale of the sea, of men and of honor."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"This book is the 5th in the \\"Horatio Hornblower\\" series by C.S. Forester. It is in my opinion the best book of the series, and this is high praise, because this is one of the best adventure series in all of literature.In this novel, Captain Hornblower, Captain of HMS Lydia, a British frigate, is dispatched to the west coast of South America, on a mission to make trouble for Spain, which has allied itself with Napoleon, against whom Britain is in a desperate struggle. At first, all seems to go well, but events beyond Hornblower's control intervene, and soon he is fighting battles and using his wits. It is all wonderful adventure.Forester's writing is taut. His storyline is brisk. The novel moves from adventure to adventure in a manner that is absolutely absorbing. This book never drags. This is a story of adventure and hardship. Captain Hornblower, El Supremo, Lady Barbara are all unforgettable. The battles at sea are so real you can smell the powder. This is a great story.This is one you'll want in hardcover, because you'll want to read it over and over and perhaps later introduce to your children and friends."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"The Hornblower novels are famous as the first in the age of fighting sail novel revival. First published in 1938, this and the following two volumes (Ship of the Line and Flying Colours) were quickly reissued on the eve of WW II as a trilogy, with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth. These three &quot;Captain&quot; novels come midway in Hornblower's career, but were written first.Set midway in the Napoleonic era, with Britain against the Spanish, then with them (as Hornblower learns to his chagrin), we first encounter Hornblower as already a frigate captain, with frequent references to mysterious battles and escapades in his past. Currently he is dealing with the consequences of a secret, long, seven month voyage across the Pacific to a dead-on landing in Central America, during which he has vowed not to utter an unnecessary word! Captains are already omnipotently separate from their men, but HH goes to an extreme out of fear of some career-ending embarrassment. Indeed there is little dialogue, aside from interior monologues. We learn considerably about the running of a ship under sail, but the detail and jargon is not so heavy as in the Patrick O'Brian novels, nor is the language so authentic. (If overwhelmed by either at first read, there is an admirable book on all the terminology, Dean King's wryly titled A SEA OF WORDS, where you can learn of the origins of such common expressions as &quot;scuttlebutt, the bitter end, in the doldrums,&quot; as well as the esoteric sailing terms.) &quot;Hornblower&quot; might be thought to be a joke name, but as a character he is much too serious and shy, indeed full of self-doubt (that never threatens to pull the story down), and not too lovable.Once on station, Hornblower engages in diplomacy with all parties, and fights battles with a more powerful ship. His greater battle is with his petulant self concerning a young Lady who has imperiously sought his aid to return to England, which leads to some delicious scenes at sea as Hornblower's emotions gradually overman his desire to have her speak well of him to the Naval Lords in aid of his career. Forester balances well the setting, action, and characters, but with a lighter tone and fleeter pace than O'Brian (whom you might wish to read only after the Hornblower saga). I think most people would find something to enjoy in this novel of adventure on the high seas."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"This is unquestionably the best of the Hornblower books, and also the first written. The only problem is that you can't stop at one because the story doesn't end at the end of the book so naturally you have to get the next one to find out whether he ever gets to make love to Lady Barbara and marry her. So you read the next two books but they are all good. It's hard to stop reading any of these books."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"My love of seafaring stories began withThe True Confessions of Charlotte Doyleas a young girl. I then discovered theMutiny on the Bounty (Back Bay Books), enjoyed it enough to readMen Against the Sea: A Noveland loved it anymore. I've seen the A&E; miniseries of Horatio Hornblower, and between my enjoyment of that production and love of the seafaring genre, I wanted to check out the Hornblower books.Beat to Quarters is the first book that Forester wrote. In this book Hornblower is already a captain, and an experienced one at that. If you've ever seen the Gregory Peck movieCaptain Horatio Hornblower, it's based on this book. After the success of this book, Forester went on to write more Hornblower books, five of which would deal with Hornblower in his earlier years at sea. I began in the middle of the Hornblower series (in terms of Hornblower's experience) based on recommendations to start with this as it was Forester's first book, and a better introduction. I believe that was a mistake.This book is good, but not outstanding by itself. The reason that I continued on to read other books was because I had the A&E; miniseries experience, and felt that other books in the series would be better. In this book, Hornblower has forced himself to become more gruff and restrained in an effort to maintain an appropriate distance from his crew. Unfortunately, it resulted in an element of emotional distance from me as the reader as well. I think more experience with a younger Hornblower is needed to be able to have the appropriate appreciation for this one.So, if you haven't read Hornblower, I would recommend beginning withMr. Midshipman Hornblower (Hornblower Saga), which is a collection of 1 or 2 chapter stories of his midshipman years. It is from this book that the A&E; miniseries obtained the basic plots of the first four episodes. It gives a very good feel for who Hornblower is. ThenLieutenant Hornbloweris a more typical cohesive narrative, and it's where I felt the real fun began. I look forward to continuing on through the series, and I think I will appreciate this book more after reading of Hornblower's career and experiences up to that point."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"C. S. Forester, Beat to Quarters.Patrick O'Brian, Master and CommanderI've begun reading C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels for the fourth or fifth time and I'm enjoying them almost as much as the first time through. Last year, I read about half of Patrick O'Brian's stunning Aubrey-Maturin sea novels for a second time: they didn't lose a thing in the rereading, they're so good. Both authors knew their subject matter thoroughly -naval battle in the age of sail, the sea campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars. Both succeeded admirably in conveying the nature and feel of life at sea in crowded, sometimes ungainly, often elegant wooden sailing vessels that in the heat of battle often became floating coffins for the men who inhabited them. Self-doubting Hornblower and his loyal lieutenant Bush, ebullient Jack Aubrey and his surgeon-spy friend Stephen Maturin are men we easily come to admire, full-fleshed characters. The love stories which form a second melody in many of the books in both series are engrossing; you root for the course of true love, for Hornblower's indomitable Lady Barbara and Jack's virginal and stubbornly maternal Sophie.There are differences. O'Brian is the more consistently superior writer and you laugh more when you read his books. Forester has the annoying habit of telling the reader about changes (largely naval practices) that occur later than the events described rather than, as does O'Brian, simply letting the details of the narration build up a sense of past times in the reader's mind. But Foresterr doesn't indulge himself often and it's a very minor irritation in a splendid narrative that spreads across how eleven novels.The ambition of these writers is abashing. How did they keep narrative focus through eleven (in Forester's case) and eighteen (O'Brian's) books? How did they succeed -and succeed they truly did--in creating real characters who mature from book to book and communicate their humanity as well as their heroism to readers of a time two hundred years later? These are exceptional books."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"I came to Forester's series on the &quot;recommendation&quot; of David Weber, who attributes to Forester's Hornblower the inspiration for his highly enjoyable space opera Honor Harrington series. Having read only the first, I must say I am glad I took the time to read (or listen) to it, as Horatio Hornblower is a character that one can like, admire, and sympathize with, even having never served in the military.I found Hornblower to be a character of great depth. While I pity his self-deprication, I admire him for it. I see the contradiction, the struggle in him, and I sympathize. I admire his sense of duty and his willingness to carry it out. I admire his compassion in a compassionless business, but his duty takes prescedence. While I don't always agree with him, he is a believable and likable character.I don't know if Forester assumed that everyone who would read his novels was a seaman or if everyone in Britain in the 1940's WAS a seaman, but there is a great deal of jargon in the novel. I'm afraid that, having grown up in suburban America, I have no idea what the difference between a mizzenmast and a mainmast, what a forecastle is, which one is the quarterdeck, or (I looked up the others but still can't figure this one out) why they would SAND the decks for Hornblower's morning walks. I'd rather NOT have to look these things up in order to enjoy the book.Forester has no gift for dialogue; there is not much speaking in the books, but for some reason, though I love dialogue, I don't mind it that much. I wish he would have dwelt more on some of the conversations between Hornblower and Lady Barbara, but I can live without them. Their relationship grows in a believable way nevertheless.I am told this is the best book to start the Hornblower series with, and I believe it. It explains some of the relevant nuances the of Post-Napoleonic British Navy to the reader and gives a true feel for what it MIGHT be like to be a Captain in His Majesty's Navy. Despite the jargon, I did not feel like I was missing anything.A good book overall. I will read the rest."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"This is not the novel by CS Forrester. It is a GUIDE.

And that is a wonderful thing."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Beat to Quarters is a wonderfully written novel. Captivating from the very beginning, they start out at sea so you don't have to get through any boring introduction of the book. Although it has a rather complex plot, with Captain Horatio Hornblower having to deal with his worries about the French and Spanish, the Natividad, and later on El Supremo as well as his newly found feelings for Lady Barbara, it is a very interesting read. It is a good place to start reading the Hornblower series. Although it isn't first in chronological order, it was written first and it does introduce the series quite well."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"The series about the life of Horatio Hornblower is amazing. I am currently needing book 6, Beat to Quarters, which i will purchase tonight. C. S. Forresters writing style kept me up all night. I finished some of the books in less than 24 hours because i coulden't put it down, it was so exciting. Hornblower's life of sailing through molten shot and through a hail of grapeshot (bullets) is so amazing, i almost wanted to live during his time (exept the fact that i would probably die at a young age.) Unfortunatly, Mr. Forrester did not live to finish his story, and so book 4 is uncomplete. However, the books are written out of order, so you can enjoy readin about almost of Hornblowers life."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Well, I'm just writing this because by 3/4th way through the book i found out that the pages were missing. I was enjoying the book extremely and then there, two chapters were gone. Though I got the end...you know how it is when it happens to you.So I'm wondering if it's the case with anyone else. And the sad thing is that I read the book 2 years after actually buying it (I had to get through 20 books of Aubrey/Maturin)and it would be silly to ask for return now.But, the book was fast-paced with action - though at first it was difficult to cope with Hornblower's character, knowing just a little bit about him I could say he whined a lot :l, not outwardly, but - and I hope to read about his early years, intact."},{"Title":"Beat to Quarters","review":"Though I'm not a huge fan of maritime adventure novels, this one was quite enjoyable and in my opinion is much more readable than the Aubrey/Maturin series. Horatio Hornblower is a much more engaging main character, and C.S. Forester does an admirable job of including enough detail about seamanship without making it a boring, technical manual. I couldn't say the same for Patrick O'Brien's Master and Commander, the first installment of the Aubrey/Maturin series. Beat To Quarters isn't so much a maritime adventure novel as it is simply an adventure novel that happens to take place at sea.There's a little bit of everything in this book - some good battle scenes, a bit of humor, and even some romance. It's one small step above \\"fluff\\" fiction, a good summer read at the beach.It took me a long time to figure out which book in the series to read first. Beat To Quarters was the first one Forester wrote, even though it chronicles the middle the main character's life. (Five books in the series detail earlier periods of his life even though they were written later.) I would recommend starting with this one. It has the feel of a complete novel, with a beginning, middle, and end, and it doesn't reveal anything that would spoil the works that precede it in the series."},{"Title":"The history of Troilus and Cressida (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"One of his lesser known works, Shakespeare's Trojan play is also one of his most intriguing. Not quite a burlesque, 'Troilus and Cressida''s lurches in tone, from farce to historical drama to romance to tragedy, and its blurring of these modes, explains why generations of critics and audiences have found it so unsatisfying, and why today it can seem so modern. Its disenchanted tone, its interest in the baser human instincts underlying (classical) heroism look forward to such 20th century works as Giraudoux's 'The Trojan War Will Not Take Place' or Terry Jones' 'Chaucer's Knight'; the aristocratic ideals of Love and War, inextricably linked in this play, are debased by the merchant-class language of exchange, trade, food, possesion - the passionate affair at its centre is organised by the man who gave his name to pimps, Pandarus, and is more concerned with immediate sexual gratification than anything transcendental. The Siege of Troy sequences are full of the elaborately formal rhetoric we expect from Shakespeare's history plays, but well-wrought diplomacy masks ignoble trickery; the great heroes Ajax and Achilles are petulant egotists, the latter preferring the company of his catamite to combat; the actual war sequences, when they finally come, are a breathless farce of exits and entrances. There are a lot of words in this play, but very few deeds.Paris, Prince of Troy, has abducted Helen, wife of Menelaus, King of Sparta. Led by the latter's brother Agamemnon, and his Machiavellian advisors Ulysses and Nestor, the Greeks besiege Troy, demanding the return of Helen. However, Achilles' dissatisfaction at the generals' endless politicking has spread discontent in the ranks. Within Troy, war takes a distinct second place to matters of the heart. While Paris wallows in luxury with his prize, his youngest brother Troilus uses Pandarus as a go-between to arrange a night of love with his niece, Cressida. When one of the Trojan leaders is taken prisoner by the Greeks, the ransom price is Cressida.There is only one character in 'Troilus' who can be said to be at all noble and not self-interested, the eldest Trojan prince Hector, who, despite his odd interpreation of the quality 'honour', detests a meaningless war, and tries to spare as many of his enemies' lives as he can. He is clearly an anachronism, however, and his ignoble slaughter at the hands of a brutal gang suggests what price chivalry. Perhaps the most recognisable character is Thirsitis, the most savagely cynical of his great Fools. Imagine Falstaff without the redeeming lovability - he divests heroes and events of their false values, satirises motivations, abuses his dim-witted 'betters' and tries to preserve his life at any cost. Written in between 'Hamlet' and 'All's Well That Ends Well', 'Troilus' bears all the marks of Shakespeare's mid-period: the contrapuntal structure, the dense figures, the audacious neologisms, and the intitially deferred, accelerated action. If some of the diplomacy scenes are too efective in their parodic pastiche of classical rhetoric, and slow things down, Act 5 is an amazing dramatic rush, crowning the play's disenchantment with love (with an extraordinarily creepy three-way spaying of an infidelity) and war.The New Penguin Shakespeare is the most accessible and user-friendly edition for students and the general reader (although it does need updating). Unlike the Oxford or Arden series, which offer unwieldy introductions (yawning with irrelevant conjecture about dates and sources) and unusable notes (clotted with tedious pedantry more concerned with fighting previous commentators than elucidating Shakespeare), the Penguin's format offers a clear Introduction dealing with the play and its contexts, an appendix 'An Account of the Text', and functional endnotes that gloss unfamiliar words and difficult passages. The Introduction is untainted by fashions in Critical Theory, but is particularly good at explaining the role of Time ('When time is old and hath forgot itself...And blind oblivion swallowed cities up'), the shifting structure, the multiple viewpoints in presenting characters, and Shakespeare's use of different literary and linguistic registers."},{"Title":"The history of Troilus and Cressida (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"I think this is one os Shakespeare's most underrated plays, probably because of all the uncouth characters. Based on Chaucer's rendition of the story, T and C are Trojan lovers, and she is then traded to the Greeks in exchange for captive soldiers. Aside from this, the women of Troy are wanton and lustful, and the men are prowess driven. If you can deal with this, you will really enjoy Shakespeare's ability to wrap this into all kinds of twists and turns. It delivers a mixture of satire, comedy, romance, tragedy, and a semi-historical (in that people at the time probably believed the Trojan War really happened). Interestingly, this mixture of laughs and tragedy is reminiscent of war novels I have read about Vietnam. The romantic dimensions give this play its edge, and somehow WS manages to make it plausible in spite of all the killing and deceit going on at the same time."},{"Title":"The history of Troilus and Cressida (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"I know readers who claim to prefer this play to Chaucer's \\"Troilus and Criseyde\\"--which tells you something either about their inability to read Chaucer or their jaded sense of humor. Shakespeare's version of the story is every bit as dark and sardonic as Chaucer's is light and satiric. In fact, this must be the Bard's blackest comedy, too strained, disconnected, and unfocused to pass muster as \\"tragedy.\\" In fact, if we take seriously Ulysses' oft-quoted speech on \\"degree\\" (accepting one's limits as a requirement for cosmic order) and Troilus' confirmation of an up-ended moral universe (\\"the bonds of heaven have slipped!\\"), there's no longer room for the heroic or tragic in the modern world Shakespeare has created in this play.Despite containing some of the playwright's most memorable and eloquent speeches, it's the cynical tone and absurdist context, not story or character, that we remember from the play. Somewhat like Hitchcock in \\"Rear Window,\\" Shakespeare places the reader in the position of deviant-voyeur, subjecting him to both the testimony and proof of Thersites' recurring reminder that, where heroism and love are concerned, all is \\"war and lechery.\\" If we decide to stay the course, we're rewarded at play's end with Pandarus's speech to the audience, promising to bequeath us with \\"his diseases.\\" It's shocking that Shakespeare got away with such material in a pre-penicillin era, but no less noteworthy is the audience's masochistic compliance (in itself, a potential commentary on the degradation that Shakespeare forcefully exposes and criticizes in this play).The play often scores with modern audiences because productions opportunistically go \\"over the top\\" with exaggerated visual and verbal bawdry. The textual version is necessarily five stars because nothing can touch Shakespeare (except perhaps in this case Chaucer). Still it's a good thing that the guardians of public morality aren't better readers or this one might not make the cut in some venues where Shakespeare is performed. In fact, that situation could soon change if acting companies continue to substitute for Shakespeare's language gross and attention-getting stage antics, using the master wordsmith as a license for selling sensation."},{"Title":"The history of Troilus and Cressida (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"The first thing you will probably notice about this play is that it seems longer than his other plays. But if we are willing to look past this, it is a rather good play that explores the theme that personal dissension is the root of chaos and the unreliability of romantic love. This play deals with the last stage of the Trogan War. It begins with Trojan Troilus expressing his love for Cressida to her uncle Pandarus. Pandarus (who for now is Cressida's guardian) consents to Troilus's quest. In the next scene, Cressida will not admit to her uncle Pandarus that she likes Troilus, but she later reveals to us she does. (Some nice comedy.) 1.3 is a rather well drawn scene where the Greek King Agamemnon is frustrated because Greece has not been able to defeat Troy after all this time. Part of the reason may be civil dissension in Greece. The Greek warrior Achilles is more after his own glory than performing his duties. Because of this, when an invitation to fight Hector to decide the outcome comes, Agamemnon chooses the less able, but more modest Ajax. Onto Act 2. Act 2 Scene 2 emphasizes the theme of this play yet again. Priam and Hector honestly feel that the Trojans should just give back Helen to the Greeks and end all this. It makes sense does it not? But Troilus (like Romeo) is a romantic and not a rationalist, and he persuades Priam and Hector to hold onto Helen. (By the way, we can forget about any valuable input from Helen. She shows herself to be an airhead. Or as the great Isaac Asimov puts it: \\"She appears as a vain, silly woman with an empty head unaware (or uncaring about) what she has caused, and incapable, apparently, of making an intelligent remark.\\" Onto Act 3. Troilus and Cressida confess their love for each other, and for now they are happy. (Along with Cressida's uncle Pandarus.) But this is not to last. Cressida's father (of Greece) wants his daughter Cressida back and Agamemnon is willing to give Troy back their Anteor in return. Agamemnon continues to show contempt for Achilles and his swollen ego, and there is a comical scene where everyone ignores Achilles. The less effective but more modest Ajax continues to win praise. Onto Act 4. 4.2 has the sad scene where Troilus and Cressida realize that they must part, but with a gleam of hope, Troilus plans to see Cressida behind enemy lines. The parting in 4.4 is well drawn. Onto the battle between Hector and Ajax. It takes place, and the battle ends with the 2 praising each other with respect. Perhaps things can even come to a peaceful conclusion, but Achilles and Hector express their contempt for each other, and peace looks less likely. Onto Act 5. Troilus sneaks behind enemy lines to see Cressida, but to make a long story short, he sees that she no longer feels anything for him. Troilus leaves in a bitter rage. (Such is a short romance.) Act 5.3 is a memorable scene where Hector's wife tries to convince Hector to stay home, but like Calpurnia, she can not convince Caesar to stay home. (Even when Hector's father and sister try to help.) And now, the fire flies. War breaks out. The balance of power swings back and forth. Hector kills Achilles's friend Patroclus and when Hector's vanity leaves him vulnerable, Achilles kills Hector in a less than honorable fashion. Troilus survives, but he fears with the loss of Hector, Troy will fall. If you like this story, you may wish to read Marlowe's \\"Dido Queen of Carthage.\\" That play focuses on Aeneas and the surviving Trojans as they plot their next move."},{"Title":"The history of Troilus and Cressida (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"This is perhaps Shakespeare's most underrated play. It isn't about Troy. It's a play about treachery winning and fair play losing.It also regales us with very funny lessons on vanity. A salacious Trojan aristocrat (Pandarus) a Greek oaf (Ajax) and an angry, irreverant Greek servant (Thersites) provide the humor.Troilus and Cressida starts with some very dirty jokes about getting a woman, having sex with her, and getting herpes. Then we are shown the military glory of Troy as the commanders parade before the citizens. A later scene illustrates the determination of the Greeks besieging Troy. They've lived on the shore in tents for seven years rather than in palaces like the Trojans. The play ends with a broken heart and a large scale battle scene.On a smaller scale, the war between Troy and Greece is reflected in the lives of two lovers. Troilus loves Cressida, secret meetings are arranged by Pandarus, and when circumstances change, Cressida's heart turns away, thus breaking Troilus's.Despite the sad ending, this play isn't a tragedy in the normal sense. Tragedies are usually about the tragic hero throwing away his advantages by making a tragic mistake, that is by presuming to something that is beyond him. For instance, Richard II stops a trial by combat where God would have given victory to the righteous. Hamlet having the chance to kill his uncle during confession instead decides to wait so that his uncle's now contrite soul is NOT given the chance to go to heaven by dying straight after confession. Both Richard and Hamlet usurp God's prerogative to judge men.In Troilus And Cressida, the Trojans are shown to be noble and strong, the Greeks crafty and sly. When the Trojan commander Hector dies, it isn't through a tragic flaw, it is through an excess of nobility as much as through Achilles's treacherous lack thereof. Hector isn't the victim of his hubris. He loses because the Greeks win, and the Greeks win because they cheat.There was no way that Shakespeare could write something like that happening in England, or even Italy or Rome. Who would be the winners and who would be the losers?. Therefore, he sets the play in Troy, discomforting many critics for whom anything set in Troy ought to be about valor and honor, not about our baser instincts. And where is the moral lesson if the base win over the noble? The only safe course for Shakespeare was to set it somewhere familiar enough to engage the audience but alien enough to keep the audience from identifying themselves with either party.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"The history of Troilus and Cressida (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"I didn't know anything about this play when I bought it for school, and it is now one of my favorite Shakespearean plays."},{"Title":"The history of Troilus and Cressida (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"I purchased this edition for a class.

The valiant Troilus, son of the Trojan king is enamoured of Cressida, also of Troy. Meanwhile, the Greek hosts have laid siege to the city, and the warrior Achilles refuses to fight, encouraging further interaction between the two sides.

This would certainly explain why the play lacks his usual orginization and focus. Perhaps he was inspired by Christopher Marlowe's &quot;Dido Queen of Carthage&quot; to combine the timeless Greek Mythology and his mastery of the language. But despite the lesser impact, orginization, and focus of Marlowe's attempt at this, the play is worth reading. Shakespeare offers a valid theme. (Personal interest is often the root of civil chaos.) There is some well placed comedy. Classic characters of Greece such as Agamemnon have some striking passages. When total war breaks out, the images are quite memorable. After the Trojans are defeated, Troilus' final speech of revenge is a satisfying conclusion. If you like this play, you may wish to read Marlowe's &quot;Dido Queen of Carthage&quot; afterwards. The events in Marlowe's play would follow the events in this play."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz was and still a source of inspiration to me, to my family and to my friends.Do not look upon him as simply a Jewish scholar, because he is much much more than that. He is a man for all seasons; a man of goodness, intelligence, knowledge, and wisdom. A philosopher, a teacher, a mentor and a pillar of our civilized world.His wisdom, and his teachings enriched our hearts and minds. This book reveals the multiple aspects and facets of this great man. The Rabbi's books are always rich with stories that come directly from the heart and a brilliant mind.Scholar, teacher, mystic, scientist, and social critic, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz is regarded as one of the greatest rabbis of this century and hailed by Time as a \\"once-in-a-millennium scholar.\\"In the United States, he is best known for his monumental translation and commentary on the Talmud. He has been a resident scholar at Yale University, the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton, and the Woodrow Wilson Institute in Washington, D.C. Rabbi Steinsaltz has founded a network of educational institutions and outreach programs in the United States, Israel, Great Britain, Australia, and the former Soviet Union.He is the author of hundreds of articles and more than 60 books, including We Jews: Who Are We and What Should We Do?, which was issued by Jossey-Bass earlier this year. He has been featured on Good Morning America and National Public Radio, and in publications such as People and Newsweek."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"This book gave me a some interesting insights into the Jewish faith. There are some great explanations on the concept of angels(no they aren't cherubs with wings) and that the idea that words themselves are sacred. The book however lacks detail in other areas (example: why are there only good or bad angels, but not neutral angels?). At other points the book gives you a little bit on reincarnation, but after you read about it you want an additional chapter on the subject!I would also have liked a comparison to other religions, as the book tends to focus more on what something is rather than why. For example there is information on the tradition of not mixing meat and dairy, but I found myself still wondering why this was important? But to be fair the book does pack quite a bit into less than 200 pages.So this book is good for opening doors on the subject, but don't expect a Cliff Notes overview or definitive encyclopedia. I did find it an enjoyable read, and liked the fact that it touched on a broad range of subjects which include Jewish views on faith, food and sex. On the whole it's a good quick read on a deep subject."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"I read The Strife of the Spirit - the first half of it was an amazing book - about the meaning of life, of struggle, and presented the thesis that \\"inner peace\\" is a lie - an escape from life and its duties. (The second half was much more Hasidic in outlook and I found it less appealing.)Seemed like Steinsaltz would be a good place to start for a little background on mysticism.This book was good, written in Steinsaltz's clear prose, devoid of jargon (you don't have to know anything about kabala to read it). However, it doesn't really acquaint you with kabala in anything but a roundabout way. You won't know the terminology, history, or practices by the end of the book, just an overview of the worldview and outlook. It does contain beautiful explanations of many of the symbolic, mystical, and theological aspects of Judaism. (Especially the last chapter on the Kiddush ritual, which seems to have been added as almost an afterthough, yet was one of the prettiest pieces in the book.)Don't get me wrong - Steinsaltz is a genius, maybe even someone you could call one of the geniuses of the generation. Anything by him is worth reading. But if you haven't read anything by him, I'd recommend starting with The Strife of the Spirit (may not be in print but is widely available used on the internet).

Although I have really just begun this study, I recommend his work, among with that of others such as Daniel Matt, to anyone with an interest in Kabbalah.The Thirteen Petalled Rose is a relatively short book of just under 200 pages. It's content is divided into ten sections: Worlds, Divine Manifestation, The Soul Man, Holiness, Torah, The Way of Choice, The Human Image, Repentance, The Search for Oneself, and Mitzvot (commandments). While all of this information was wonderful, I found the author's presentation of the four worlds especially compelling.Traditional Kabbalistic sources describe four known spiritual realms called, from higher to lower, Atzilut (emanation), Beriah (creation), Yetzirah (formation) and Assiyah (action). Steinsaltz expands on these traditional divisions quite clearly noting that there are many levels within each of the known spiritual realms as well as other lower realms not thought of as part of the four worlds as listed above.Steinsaltz begins with our world, the world of action, explaining that this observed world is a part of a vast array of worlds, most of which are spiritual. He points out that these worlds do not exist somewhere else but in another dimension and describes a dynamic relationship between worlds with a very real exchange of influence occurring. He stresses that occurrences in our world impact on other worlds and can affect significant change in the spiritual realms. I could not agree more.The author works through each of the spiritual dimensions in highly coherent way explaining concepts and terminology in original and insightful ways. He explains, 'higher' and 'lower' worlds (for example) in terms of 'nearer' and 'farther' or degrees of 'transparency' to the divine light. And tells us that, as one descends through the worlds materiality becomes greater and a sense of independence is felt with an ever increasing intensity. This blocks the divine light and obscures, per the author, the unchanging essence that lurks beneath the personality.I find Steinsaltz's understanding of divinity, angels, humans and the reality we inhabit impressive. I imagine a reality of not four but almost innumerable levels with good deeds and sacred actions radiating upward and outward, expanding and elevating, and ultimately touching the divinity to which we are all connected.I feel that I have come away from this reading with a clearer understanding of the nature of spiritual beings and the very fundamental differences between angels and man. Additionally I found the text validating on a personal level as it is my deep-seated belief that there are many largely imperceptible dimensions beyond our own limited understanding of what is. I could not recommend this book more highly!You may read the complete review of this wonderful book and others on my blog, The New Age Review."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"This is a hard book to review. As others have noted, it is not so much a book about kabbalah as a book of kabbalah. It reads like a manifesto or, perhaps more accurately, a medieval kabbalah text. The book is a not a scholarly work about what kabbalists have believed; it is a positive statement of kabbalism itself. As such, the book is hard to evaluate, for on what grounds is one to judge it? One could compare it to other primary texts of kabbalah, but on what basis is the comparison to be made? Consistency? Well, I have read enough medieval texts of kabbalah to know that they are not always consistent among themselves, and consistency is a very poor criterion of evaluation when applied in this way. (Are we to say that Maimonides was a bad writer because he didn't agree with everything his predecessors said?) So, then, how should the text be judged? On the basis of its content? Surely this is right, but given the nature of the text I think that only a kabbalist can really judge it, and I'm no kabbalist. I can say that I am a Christian with little background in kabbalah, but that I found the book fascinating. Some of the book was completely opaque to me, but much of it made good sense, and much of this was interesting and useful. I learned a lot about Judaism - though the book is a work of kabbalah, much of it characterizes mainstream Judaism, I believe - and I also learned some important things about prayer, holiness, and God. So, I think that even a Christian with no prior exposure to kabbalah can learn something of personal value from this book, though I suspect that many such readers will find the book too strange to tackle. I do not mean to imply anything negative about such readers here; I only want to write a responsible review. How Jewish readers will receive the book I cannot speculate, though I suspect that while much may sound strange to them, much will also sound familiar. At any rate, one could always read the other reviews here for a Jewish perspective on the book."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"If you want an insider's view of the Jewish mystical tradition known as Kabbala, start here.This book is so well written, with such knowledge and care and belief, by such a very bright, worldly mind as Adin Steinsaltz's, that his is the one to read. So why do I only give it four stars? Well, first the good stuff, because I do recommend it, after all:This is probably Steinsaltz's most popular work. It primarily covers Jewish mysticism, but is subtitled more generally as \\"A Discourse On The Essence Of Jewish Existence And Belief\\", so in many ways the subject is practical Jewish mysticism and Jewish theology. It tries to remove or condense the most esoteric aspects of Kabbala, at least until the end; and focus on the fundamental and practical ideas contained in it, so that it can be understood and appreciated by the average person.Chapter 1 is very beautiful, and the book continues on in the same vein as that chapter, being mostly easier to understand as it goes along. There is (again,) quite a bit of 'practical magic' mixed into the mysticism, including a very wise chapter about prayer that seem to be great advice to anyone who needs to think seriously about any subject that must be well understood, whether it is one's prayers or anything else of importance.This is all very challenging but facinating and credible until the 13th and final chapter (titled 'Patach Eliyahu', and only found in the revised edition published in the last decade.) Here's where I might loose some observant Jews, but please stay with me. But I think it fair to say that at this point, the reader reaches a most boring and -- in the face of a dab of healthy skepticism -- superstitious finale to an otherwise fine and even wonderful exposition on Kabbala and Jewish theology for anyone interested enough to pick the book up.Steinsaltz is erudite and writes with great precision all through the book about various aspects of the Jewish God and soul; but his thesis falls apart in this last chapter to those who do not assume it to be true, mostly because of the litany of assumptions he makes without any explicit justification, about the metaphysical reality of the universe. This, as he simultaneously tries to be very reasonable and analytical and constructionist in tone. The chapter is an analysis of some earlier mystical writings which bend credibility in a way that Steinsaltz refuses in any way to address or even acknowledge.These mystical writings are supposedly the written log of a gathering of prophets, living and dead, who are discussing the nature of God's creation. This by itself is not necessarily beyond belief, but the gravely serious and specific details about the various paths that God's light takes thtough the various worlds, is done without the slightest hint of objectivity, and at times Steinsaltz seems in his analysis to cease speaking to the reader and switch over to addressing God himself in his pronouns.Steinsaltz folds in what can only be described as outlandish mystical definitions into otherwise very logical, scientific reasoning in his final description of the nature of the universe, which according to Kabbala is primarily about the Divine Light passing through the ten Sefirot. These Sefirot are channels of divine energy with very specific qualities that are known and explained by Steinsaltz, and which are supposed to transport this light through four very particular worlds in very particular ways, even though God himself, who is described as the sole hidden source of the Divine Light and ultimately as being the light itself; the God-light is *known* to be utterly unknowable.For most of the book, Steinsaltz stays away from the technical details of how the universe channels this light, and he lets the beauty of the action of God's light passing down through humans here on earth take center stage, in ways that can be understood in terms of one's own experience. But in the final chapter, he states too many ideas without any kind of justification which assume a very particular (in an intellectual as well as spiritual sense) mystical vision of the universe, as if the sefirot are obvious facts, as if he lives on a planet where they are objects for everyone to see like trees or clouds and he's just telling you some meteorological or botanical details. And he writes as if we are supposed to go along and assume that Planet Steinsaltz is the real universe.Because of this approach, his otherwise lovely writing seems at best more like fanciful literature by Frank Herbert or J.R.R. Tolkien, than serious philosophical inquiry in which assumptions are examined with critical scrutiny. This is totally ok in the earlier chapters, but the last chapter loses any aesthetic quality and suddenly sounds almost cultish in it's serious presumptions of what a reader should accept about things unseen and otherwise unknown. No doubt Steinsaltz didn't write to be merely aesthetically appealing, but without the beautiful sense of his desire to share the wonder of his God's light, the final chapter becomes cold, harsh, and both more absurd and less human than the rest of the book.But \`The Thirteen Petalled Rose' is at least wonderful literature. And for true believers, it must read like some kind of final theory of everything."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"spirituality is hard to expose in the physical word, but it is there and Rabbi Steinzaltz has been able to translate his experience and complex knowledge into a language that is within reach.

However, The Thirteen Petalled Rose is a very difficult book. Adin Steinsaltz is not easy reading. I would say that it is his precision that makes this work difficult to comprehend in the same way I felt The Essential Talmud was difficult to comprehend. I guess that much does not need to be said, for those are the people who will purchase this book, take a crack at reading it, become frustrated, and put it down. Given the popularity of Kaballah, that is how the author will get much of his funds. However, I don't believe that was his mission at all, for as we know, not all pennies are created equal.I wanted a hard copy of this work because I knew from the other rave reviews of this work that I wanted to have a printed copy of it, rather than just an electronic book. If someone spots this book on my shelf, and has heard of it, I think it seeing its presence will possibly spur great conversations.That I was able to read it, and benefit from it is probably due to all those countless hours I have toiled in Tanya study. Otherwise, I may have become overwhelmed. Additionally, The Thirteen Petalled Rose should not take the place of daily Tanya study though it has some information that the Tanya does not, and it is key information, especially since I can't consider myself frum from birth."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"I have to admit that most books I read, others consider very heavy and difficult.

It is written a very easy to understand manner that would make it acceptable to anyone interested in the &quot;meaning of life.&quot; The author takes intimidating subjects like the sefirot or &quot;tree of life,&quot; and explains their relevance to our lives in a manner suitable for even novices of scripture or anyone searching for some meaning for that matter. I can see coming back to this book time and time again for methods of approaching subjects of the Torah to those that reject its validity in our lives or those that like to portray it as irrelevant in today's society.

The discourse on \\"Worlds\\" includes abstract but not difficult to follow ideas of how energy, thoughts, actions and feelings affect other dimensions (\\"worlds\\"). The description of the domain of angels and their interaction in the human realm is very lucid and enlightening. The mysteries of the Kabbalah are touched upon in terms of how the ten Sefirot connect to organic Reality. The mystery of life is revealed as events in our world affect the nature and quality of relations, in terms of light and power in other worlds. The importance of the study and practice of mitzvot can not be over emphasized. It is words and deeds that help illuminate our soul and bring about blessings which make the world a better place. Through human will, the intersection of all worlds occurs, because the human being has the power to change the fixed order of things.Rabbi Steinsaltz's description of that which is \\"Holy\\" is exceptionally clear. Holy means separation, that which is Holy is untouchable, distinctly \\"Other\\", and can not be understood or defined. He does however reassure us, despite the transcendental nature and distance of that which is Holy, human beings can become more receptive and open to Its influence. He connects time, space, and the soul of humans with the effects of the Sefirot in our realm, along with the performance of mitzvot. The results of all these connections and interactions can be described as concentric circles or a helix of energy between realms. He describes how the spark of life in man, when expressed as a creative urge brings more divine influence into the world and thus expresses the image of G-d.The two last chapters, \\"Repentance\\" and \\"Search for Oneself\\" complete this discourse of how Jewish thinking views the role of mankind in connecting with the Divine expression of G-d. The Torah is seen as a plan of human action, a guide for the proper ways of thinking, behaving, dreaming and desiring in the world. The higher levels of repentance, called Tikkun, are described. The purpose of genuine Tikkun is to correct the effects of past misdeeds by creating new patterns that outweigh past wrongs. From this correction, a new condition is created, as merits are derived from past transgressions. The Jewish thinking and discourse developed by Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz in this book is a wholistic framework which describes a path of self-discovery. He answers many questions asked by human beings since the beginning of time, such as, 'Why am I here?' 'What is my purpose in life?' The unique separate existence of each person is expressed in the sentence, \\"Myriads of sparks reflect the primal light everyone of them with its own situation, its own set of circumstances.\\" [p.148] On the other hand, for the person who seeks to connect to the world, other human beings and ultimately G-d, this book provides a special path to follow. Erika Borsos (erikab93)"},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"The unfolding of the heart of Jewish spirituality, like removing petals from a rose, until the stem remains, a nourishing channel from the powers of life's soil, to be discovered in the sefirot of Yahweh (or, the mystical science of the Kabbalah which lies under the surface of Judiasm like a great anchoring mass under the tip of an iceberg).This is a beautifully written look at thirteen tenants of Jewish spirituality, and how those aspects apply not only on a metaphysical level, but in one's daily life. It is recommended reading for anyone who can appreciate the primal elements of any long-standing philosophy, Jewish or otherwise, or for those who can appreciate literary poeticism. In short, perhaps the rose is the heart, and we only need to remove the petals one by one, to know each, and then to let them go, until only the force of life, viz., God, remains."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"I have literally given this book to at least a dozen people over the years. It is a profound instructional manual and guide to the beyond and to the here and now. Rabbi Steinsaltz is a unique thinker and a wonderful spirit for all of us, especially Jews, who often wonder: What are the underlying profound beliefs of my people. Too often,we cannot find these beliefs in the synagogue, but Rabbi Steinsaltz is more than a teacher, he is a direct path to profundity and hope."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"Most of this book outlines the world view of the kabbalistic wing of traditional Judaism, paying great attention to the alleged facets (or sefirot) of the Deity. It doesn't really explain how Jewish thinkers reached these conclusions, so it isn't likely to be useful to people who are not predisposed towards mysticism. Nor does Steinsaltz explain the role of non-Jews in his worldview: if Jewish behavior affects the various \\"worlds\\", is non-Jewish behavior relevant?There are a few points I liked in this book though. He explains the relationship between the spirituality of prayer and the precision of halacha: ideally, the two combine to create a balanced religious personality, one not limited to emotion or intellect alone.His explanations of the Sabbath and of Sabbath-related rituals, especially his chapter on the Sabbath meal and Kiddush, were clearer to me than some of his other chapters. He points out that most Sabbath-eve rituals were intended to replicate the Temple in some way, while others recall some other Torah event. For example, we cover two pieces of bread before the meal to \\"recall the bread from heaven, the manna, which on the Sabbath day came down in double portions covered with a layer of dew.\\" Similarly, we drink wine to recall the wine used as part of Temple sacrifices."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"This is an excellent book! I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to Christians who are searching for some meaning in life. This book explains what Jesus meant when he said, &quot;In my Father's house are many mansions.&quot; It also explains what Paul meant by &quot;seeing through a glass darkly.&quot; Since there is no doubt that both Jesus and Paul were Jewish mystics, it makes sense that explanations for their teachings can be found in Kabbalah! Excellent reading!"},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"Allow me to spark your curiosity as tohow truly insightful and provocative this book is:First paragraph of the first page:\\"The physical world in which we live.the objective observed universe around us,is only a part of an inconceivably vast system of worlds.Most of these worlds are spiritual in their essence;they are of a different order from our know world.Which does not necessarily mean that they exist somewhere else,but means rather that they exist in different dimensions of being.What is more, the various worlds interpenetrate and interactin such way a way that they can be considered counterparts of one another,each reflecting or projecting itself on the one below or above it,with modifications, changes, and even distortionsthat are the result of such interactions.It is the sum of this infinitely complex exchange of influence back and forthamong different domains that comprises the specific world of realitywe experience in our everyday world.\\"And, near the end of the book:\\"When a man [or woman] learns that just as he broods over himselfso does God yearn for him and looks for him,[she] is at the beginning of a higher level of consciousness.From this moment he can begin to followthe guiding strings that are leading him,usually with enormous toil and labor, toward the focal point of himself.For in truth it is not one question with two sidesbut a meeting place of two questions,that of man seeking himself and of God seeking man.Together they can approach a solution of the problem of man's existence.And in the search for this solution, within this desperate exploration,this going after God, man will rediscover himselfas well as the definition of his particular being.\\"...In between these two paragraphs there are numerous mystical insightsfor those who long for spirit-rich dwellings for their souls that arealtogether hospitable and caring, nurturing and grace-full!"},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"The introductory chapter Worlds speaks about the vast system of worlds that interacts with ours, explaining that every aspect of human existence consists of both matter and spirit. The world of action is one in a general system of four dimensions called emanation, creation, formation and action. The nature and missions of angels are examined, those who have existed from the beginning and those that are created through mitzvot. Chapter 2, Divine Manifestation, deals with continuous creation through the divine power. The Sefirot, their names and their qualities are explained. In many ways the order of the Sefirot is mechanical although the individual may cause alterations in their operation and pattern. Ultimately the relationship to the Divine is individual.Next the concept of the Soul is explored. Each individual soul is special and unique and made up of a particular combination of different Sefirot from various dimensions. There are also different levels to the soul and it strives ever to return to its source. Chapter 4 discusses holiness with reference to the architecture of the Temple. Holiness is manifested in place and time: the hours of the day, days of the week and cycles of the month and year. The significance of holy days in this system of time is also discussed here.The relation between Torah and the world is that of idea and actualization. Torah shows one how to relate inwardly and how to behave outwardly. The Torah regulates the whole of life, serving as a type of blueprint. The sacramental body of Knesset Israel is the inner content and closely tied to the essential holiness of the world.Israelis the priesthood of the earth with great responsibilities. Chapter 7, The Human Image, explores the prohibition against idolatry, with interesting remarks on the nature of the Hebrew language which prefers figurative and symbolic terms above abstractions. Thence the plethora of anthropomorphisms in the Bible.Symbols are significant to every reality of existence. There is meaning in colors and their relationships, flowers and fruits, types of living creatures, kinds of plants and minerals. The central Sefirah of Tif'eret stands for the concept of beauty and is a harmonious blend of elements such as beauty, truth and compassion. The author next deals with the concept of repentance which embraces a variety of ideas fundamental to the existence of the world. It is a primordial phenomenon with two meanings, embedded in the root structure of the world and was established as an option for mankind before it was created. Repentance allows an ascendance even over time, and denotes return, turning about and response. Not just a psychological phenomenon, it effects real change in all dimensions. This is a most comforting thought.The Search For Oneself is the subject matter of chapter 9. This is a search which cannot be compartmentalized philosophically, psychologically or scientifically. It is a process of both the individual seeking itself and God seeking man. The system of mitzvot is the design of coherent harmony, manifesting in prayer and blessing, modes of conduct at specific times, dietary regulations and relations to others. Steinzalts also discusses the Halakhah here, which is a formal structure that defines the order of mitzvot. The purpose of this system is to refrain from harmful actions and to act with the intention of improving the order of life.Prayer, an activity blending the inner & the outer, is analyzed with reference to communal and private worship, its institutionalization, fixed schedules, the soul's need of it, preparation, concentration, study and as a service of the heart. Chapter 12 is an additional note on the Kiddush ritual. Chapter 13 concludes the book. It is an in-depth look at the Patach Eliyahu, the second introduction to the Tikkunei Zohar. First the full text is provided, and then every sentence is analyzed and discussed. This is a most beautiful and thought-provoking study and includes an illustration of the Ten Sefirot.The Thirteen Petalled Rose is not an easy read nor immediately accessible. It requires concentration and reflection to digest the wealth and profundity of Steinsaltz' kabbalistic interpretation. Understanding this classic of mysticism requires real effort and persistence but it is well worth it. I have found that the book illuminates and explains many aspects of spirituality and cosmology that I have not previously been able to reconcile or conceive of in total. As such it provided very valuable integrative knowledge.Other works on Jewish mysticism that I have found to be illuminating:Zohar: Annotated & Explainedby Daniel C Matt,The Essential Zohar: The Source of Kabbalistic Wisdomby Rav P S Berg andThe Truth Behind the Bible Codeby Jeffrey Satinover."},{"Title":"The Thirteen Petalled Rose","review":"Well, the header says it all--I would keep this book for my children; it speaks in almost prophetic language.

I am familiar with Gloria Allred and was looking forward to gaining insight in her thoughts and legal accomplishments.In my opinion she tried to cover too much. I wish she would have covered fewer cases with far greater depth. Much of the historical background, legal complexities, human factors and contemporary context were left out. Each case that I listened to degenerated into my cause is rightous and anyone who is against me is wrong.I was expecting more."},{"Title":"Fight Back and Win: My Thirty-year Fight Against Injustice--and How You Can Win Your Own Battles","review":"The best part of the book: Introduction by Lisa Bloom, Allred's daughter. We got a glimpse of the woman behind the media. Second best was Chapter 1, Allred's own all-too-brief biography.The rest of the book consisted of a rather smug collection of \\"wins\\" in the diverse areas of civil and criminal law. Allred reminds me of a fierce mother bear, fiercely protecting her cubs. She'll go far more than the extra mile to win justice for clients and causes, especially those related to discrimination and sexual assault or harassment.It is important to understand that Allred thinks (at least in this book) like a prosecutor. Putting away the bad guys is good, she says, and good for society. At one point she says prison is designed for punishment as well as rehabilitation -- but from everything I read,today's prisons are all about punishment, and about making angry people even angrier. Allred never does the math: $20,000 a year to keep someone in prison, but zero dollars available for mental health and drug rehab for many.Major disappointments:(1) Allred never considers what happens when women make false accusations against men. I've been friends with 2 males who have been falsely accused of harassment and (in one case) spousal abuse. Both were so astounded they didn't take steps to protect themselves. They were left bitter and hostile to women, when eariler they were strong supporters of feminism.She also rants about exposure of women who come forward with accusations. For example, Kobe Bryant's lawyers raised questions about whether evidence was consistent with having multiple partners in 3 days. Yet this question is legitimate: any decent defense lawyer will seek evidence for alternative interpretations of the evidence. Accused men and women have rights, too.(2) Allred suggests women take self-defense courses and save up for legal fees. But realistically, why not suggest that women use some common sense? One of Marv Albert's female accusers complained that Albert had harassed her -- but then entered his room a year later to \\"help him send a fax.\\"Come on, folks! This gets lame. Why didn't she call a hotel bellman or security guard as an escort? Why not suggest that parents (and hotels) train young women, \\"Don't go into a guy's room alone unless you have solid reason to believe he's trustworthy.\\" We teach college students to ask for a \\"safe walk\\" to their cars at night. The same principle applies here.(3) Finally, as I read, I became increasingly curious about who pays for Allred's clients. Did Amber pay Allred's fees on a massage therapist's salary? Did the District Attorney use tax money to help a witness for the prosecution (when defendants rarely have adequate funds to do the same for their witnesses)? Or did Allred accept the case pro bono to reap publicity, not to mention fees to \\"negotiate\\" Amber's book contract?All these approaches are (as far as I know) legal and ethical. But we'd get a better sense of how justice is done if we knew whether prosecutors actually recommended Allred to the witnesses and/or paid her legal fees. And if someone else paid, we'd get a whole new perspective on alliances in each case.It's hard to believe these clients just picked up the phone book and saw \\"Allred\\" under A's. Even if these witnesses saw Allred's name in the paper, I would like to know.A much better book:The Defense Is Ready: Life In The Trenches Of Criminal Law by Leslie Abramson and Richard Flaste. Written nearly ten years ago, it's a thoughtful look at the justice system, even when you don't agree with everything Abramson has said and done."},{"Title":"Fight Back and Win: My Thirty-year Fight Against Injustice--and How You Can Win Your Own Battles","review":"I am absolutely breathless - you MUST read this book to believe it!I was expecting this to be another antiwar feminist rant against the Patriot Act.What a shock!On page xii, her book states \\"I fight to protect children from Michael Jackson.\\"Astonishing!

There were lots of new facts to be learned about her and what molded her decisionto enter women's rights law - specifically, that she was raped, had an abortion, and earned less than her male counterparts. The remaining chapters were, unfortunately, not as great as the first. I would have preferred, I suppose, an autobiography of Gloria, but the book basicallyhighlights the biggest cases from her career. There is the Amber Frey case, OJ Simpson, Hunter Tylo, etc., and the end of each chapter concludes with a snippet of \\"fight back and win\\" advice. The advice, however, is unrealistic for many of us ordinary folk - Gloria tells us how to handle the media, courtroom testimony, police investigations, etc. I was thinking - how many of us are really going to need advice on criminal court cases? If you are interested in reading about some of Gloria's more high-profile cases then the book will be interesting but, if you want to learn more about the woman herself, just read the first chapter or wait for an autobiography."},{"Title":"Fight Back and Win: My Thirty-year Fight Against Injustice--and How You Can Win Your Own Battles","review":"Gloria shows her true colors.

Some pieces are of mainly historical interest, but not most. Neither is it a 'religious title', in fact it is nearly irreligious in places. It merely takes issue with arty types like Mr. Kipling, G.B. Shaw, H.G. Wells, and Whistler. It is also vintage Chesterton, at his usual paradoxical, oblique, witty, funny, slapstick, sardonic, jolly, and generous best.It is a positive and happy book, but it was accused of Negativism in its day (Kafka said Chesterton was so full of joy that you might almost suppose 'he had found God'--perverse but honest.) Another exasperated opponent, said that if he was so clever and all-knowing he should write down his own personal positive beliefs. So he did. They are still read today, and many who enjoy 'Orthodoxy' (1908) will enjoy this, its progenitor too, which is impossible to summarize, so I have given a thumbnail of each chapter.CONTENTSChapter 1. Introductory remarks on the importance of orthodoxyThe examined life - meaninglessness of modern subjective attitudes of not owning your own point of view. Decline of respect for reason and rational argument - political correctness, or 'Good taste, the last and vilest of human superstitions'. To know a man's worldview is to know him. Pernicious effects of subjectivism in literature and the arts.2. On the negative spiritEssential need for positive belief - no society can prosper on negative laws alone. Progress in human rights of liberty, education, free speech, and tolerance are only guaranteed with 'a definite creed and a cast-iron code of morals'.3. On Mr. Rudyard Kipling and making the world smallKipling considerable poet but no true patriot, but proto-fascist. [GKC probably first to spot this.] Worships strength and discipline, empire-building, for their own sake. 'He admires England, but he does not love her'.4. Mr. Bernard Shaw***GOOD***[GKC being good friend of GBS.] GBS brilliant and witty, but hopeless subjectivist. GBS attacks all pretensions as 'every moral generalization oppressed the individual; the golden rule was there is no golden rule'. But then why should we allow Him to make the One Rule that rules them all? Perpetrates errors of sociologist/anthropologist, still with us today.5. Mr. H.G. Wells and the giants***GOOD***Wells' faith in Evolutionism (as opposed to evolution) shown to be false - 'the scientific fallacy...of not beginning with the human soul...but with some such thing as protoplasm'. The demonstrable fact of original sin in the universal existence of selfishness. Wells' Utopia assumes selfishness can be cured by ignoring it, not curing it. 'Heresy of immoral hero-worship' (ie, celebrity).6. Christmas and the aesthetesEssential nature of ritual. Attacks 'The religion of Comte, generally known as Positivism, or the worship of humanity'. Comte's attempt to institute a secular religion - ritual the only sensible part of his theory as it expresses the deepest meaning and emotion. 'Take away what is supernatural, and what remains is the unnatural.'7. Omar and the sacred vine***EXCELLENT***Correct attitude to wine and the good things of life. Not a mere mean between excess and teetotalism but a proper enjoyment of what is good. 'Drink because you are happy, but never because you are miserable...poetical drinking...is joyous and instinctive'. 'Happiness is a mystery like religion, and should never be rationalized...If we are to be truly gay, we must believe that there is some eternal gaiety in the nature of things.'8. The mildness of the yellow pressTabloids. No so much sensational as stunted, mendacious, and silly. [So no change there then.]9. The moods of Mr. George MooreSatirical. Pride, least attractive of all faults.10. On sandals and simplicityGentle mockery of the vegetarian impulse.11. Science and the savages***GOOD***Materialism (philosophical). Sociology/anthropology inadequate methodology. Starts by excluding what they pretend to disprove existence of. Study of primitives less revealing than study of one's own soul. [cf. Pascal Boyer]12. Paganism and Mr. Lowes Dickinson***EXCELLENT***Dickinson represents ancient Greeks as 'an ideal of full and satisfied humanity', ie, he is a humanist/New Ager. Replaced by Christianity because rational but sad pagan virtues such as justice and temperance insufficient. Great Christian virtue is humility. Mystical and happy values of faith, hope, and charity are essential, even if seem irrational.13. Celts and Celtophiles***GOOD***Race: a non-concept [genetically ahead of his time!]. Nationhood: a definable spiritual concept. Irish a nation, not a race.14. On certain modern writers and the institution of the familyDefence of the family against Nietzsche & co.15. On smart novelists and the smart setAnalysis of 'penny dreadfuls' and 'halfpenny novelettes'.16. On Mr. McCabe and a divine frivolityUse of humor defended in serious debate (against po-faced atheist).17. On the wit of Whistler***EXCELLENT***Errors of relativism in art as in ethics: illustration of the mutable camel. The artist Whistler: 'He was one of those people who always live up to their emotional incomes, who are always taut and tingling with vanity'. Three type of satirist who are also great men (illustrated by Rabelais, Swift, and Pope. Whistler talked too much about his art to be a great artist.18. The fallacy of the young nationA nation may be chronologically young and spiritually old, or vice versa. Eg, Ancient Greece and America.19. Slum novelists and the slums***EXCELLENT***Patronizing novelists writing of the lower classes, eg Somerset Maugham. Undemocracy in Britain.20. Concluding remarks on the importance of orthodoxy'Man can be defined as the animal that makes dogmas.''If we want doctrines we go to great artists.''The more we are certain what good is, the more we shall see good in everything.''We have a general view of existence, whether we like it or not; it alters, or, to speak more accurately, it creates and involves everything we say and do, whether we like it or not.' True."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"This book is a sort of prequal to Chesterton's most famous apologetic work, \\"Orthodoxy.\\" \\"Heretics\\" is a collection of papers that Chesterton wrote to expose what he considered to be the unhealthy philosophies of his day.

From the viewpoint of Chesterton, \\"Heretics\\" is the critique of bad philosophy and \\"Orthodoxy\\" is the defense of good philosophy.The trouble with \\"Heretics\\" is that it is such a local book. What I mean is that this book is a series of analytical criticisms of specific men during that specific time period (late 19th century to early 20th century) and it is easy to miss the points Chesterton makes if you are not familiar with the philosophies and views of the men he is critiquing. That isn't to say this book isn't one Chesterton's finest works. Yet, I would certainly reccomend \\"Heretics: The Annotated Edition\\" to anyone who is not very familiar with these particular early 20th century English writers which he is referring to in this book. The annotated edition makes it much easier to see what Chesterton is saying. For although people change over time, philosophies generally remain the same; and that is why Chesterton's criticisms of these philosophies are still relevant. And as stated earlier, this book, in a way, sets up the groundwork for \\"Orthodoxy,\\" which is still considered a masterpiece; and almost certainly worth reading for anyone who does not understand or sympathize with the sentiment and romance of the Christian faith."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"George Bernard Shaw, the subject of one of the essays in this book, once wrote that morals were for the middle class. The lower class couldn't afford them and the upper class could afford to do without them. Modern day &quot;thinkers&quot; assail the Judeo-Christian ethic as irrelevant to any class and pride themselves on their thoroughly contemporary avant-garde world view. How ironic it is that this thoroughly modern iconoclasm has been around for at least 100 years.Chesterton weighs in on the &quot;heretics&quot; of his day who prided themselves in their heretical superiority to conservative orthodoxy. These heretics seem to have had a worldview not much out of step with modern avant-garde thought. Chesterton's critique of these ideas is lucid, lyrical, and logical. The passage of 100 years has obscured the context of much of what he says, but his conclusions are as timely today as they were yesterday."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"A fantastic book by a great writer, highly recommend it for anyone interested in Apologetics, or just fun argument should definitely read it. While this review will hardly do justice to him, Chesterton is amazingly complex, and while sometimes incorrect, offensive, or fallacious, he is always intelligent, witty, and generally has an opinion very much worth listening to. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"G.K. Chesterton wrote HERETICS c. 1905. Yet this book is still timely in that popular gurus change opinions and social theories very quickly never realizing how dated the newest fad becomes. Chesterton had the rare ability in exposing many new fads as actually some varient of some ideas that were in vogue during Ancient History.Chesterton never engages in ad hominem arguments. He is careful to metion the merits of those with whom he disagrees. Chesteron focuses on the logical fallacies of his critics and never engages in bitterness or smear tactics.Readers should carefully read Chesterton's cirticisms of G.B. Shaw. Chesterton asserts the validity of Shaw's Socialism. Chesterton does not argue with Shaw's socialist views per se. He does critisize Shaw's tendenacy toward a mechanical view of society and politics. One should note that in spite of their repeated debates and crticisms of each others' work, Chesterton and Shaw remained life long friends.Chesterton has some interesting comments on political power. Chesteron was probably not a democrat, and his views beginning on page 168 are note worthy. Chesterton remarks condemns those who pick a Caesar. He remarks that people falsely look favorably on such an individual because he, the Strong Man or the Caesar, is not an ordinary man. In other words, men may domocratically opt for someone whom ordinary think is better. This is a form despotism or slavery where the ruler has the sanctions of the victim. Other rulers hold position by heredity right whereby men accept this notion only because of the social order rather than false praise or respect for someone who may be evil and take advantage of men's sychophantic blind obedience to self appointed knaves.Chesterton has good insight regarding the abuse of language and different rules for social classes. If some poor soul is arrested for stealing, he/she is accused of theft. If some who is wealthy is arrested for the same crime, the comment is that the wealthy person has an illness called kleptomania. To paraphrase Chesterton, the wealthy want to make laws ( or in their case excuses)while decent people want to obey the law and expect everyone to do the same.G.K. Chesterton writes well and uses reason as his guide. He did not get angry when his critics attacked him for his personal appearance. He was a large man. Chesterton could laugh at himself. However, he got angry when men attacted honesty and truth. Chesterton was a champion of himself or his work. He was a champion of reason, truth, and honesty. Whether one disagrees with him, Chesterton is well worth reading for his prose, knowledge, and logic."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"As he himself affirmed, Chesterton was criticized on numerous occasions for maintaining a seemingly irreverent or flippant tone and attitude while writing about subjects that inherently demand the utmost sincerity. To superficially read Heretics might be to understand the apparent validity of such criticism. On the surface it seems as if Chesterton could not have cared much less about the philosophies of the prominent individuals that he attacks as heretical throughout this work, let alone the vague conception of orthodoxy that he utilizes as a basis of comparison. However, these claims against Chesterton only appear valid until the reader ascertains that the author's wit, jocularity, and jovial nature are not to be confused with insincerity. The light touch that Chesterton applies to heavy though is not an indication of indifference, but rather a testament to the acuity of his mind and subtle genius. It might not, it seems, have been possible for Chesterton, or anyone, to have been more serious and sincere. Chesterton cared very much, and that is what sheds light on Heretics' almost impossibly simple truth.In Heretics, Chesterton outlines the popular philosophies of his day which stood in opposition to not only logic but also that which the author maintained as truth. Amazingly, more than a century later, the same truth is still available and apparent to those who seek it while the same philosophies, although perhaps slightly altered, still stand in direct contradiction to what Chesterton understood to be unmistakable truth. What might be the greatest truth so easily recovered from the pages of Heretics, yet which remains so hidden from the view of the masses, is the incomplete substance, as opposed to the mere falsity, of many philosophies. Chesterton's work, however, was, as he admitted, left unfinished with regard to Heretics and later fulfilled with the publication ofOrthodoxy. If Heretics presented a problem, Orthodoxy presented the solution. Both are timeless classics, and both should be read if an understanding of Christianity in relation to apparent philosophical and ideological truths is sought."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"Just begain reading \\"Heretics.\\" I wish I had found this book, and Chesterton, 30 years ago when I was 20 instead of now when I am 50.Ideas and actions can take decades sometimes a century or more to \\"bloom.\\"During 1905, Chesterton identifies errors that have bloomed and guide/justify our day's thinking & action -- runious errors.Can't wait to finish.Should be required reading."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"Gilbert Keith Chesterton was one of the most influential English writers of the 20th century. His prolific and diverse output included journalism, philosophy, poetry, biography, Christian apologetics, fantasy and detective fiction.Chesterton is constantly at odds with today's world. This is why he is probably more worth reading than any of his contemporaries, like Oscar Wilde, and even GB Shaw and HG Wells, because today, today we live under their liberal values. His writings on the subject of democracy should be required reading for anyone with the right to vote: our society is almost completely ignorant on that subject, to its tremendous detriment. Nearly every essay in \`Heretics' is a revelation; and \`Orthodoxy' is practically a study in how subtle and surprising good sense can be.In Heretics, Chesterton has this to say of Wilde:The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde. It is the carpe diem religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.He writes of Shaw:After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.You are about to read one of the most intelligent, well written books ever produced.Orthodoxy: The Romance of Faith"},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"Heretics consists of penetratingly intellectual, yet humorous, good-natured, and good-sported, polemics against various philosophies and art movements of Chesterton's day. Most of the people he attacks are people I did not recognize by name, but their philosophies as he describes them were easily recognizable. He hits them from some rather unique angles, making this a very refreshing read for the philosophically-minded.He gives his opponents due credit and spends the first portion of most of his essays talking about what's *right* about what these people are saying. For the most part he takes a \\"something's missing\\", rather than \\"this is wrong\\", approach, trying, you might even say, to build them up rather than tear them down. In this way Chesterton is the \\"yea-sayer\\" that Zarathustra wanted to be in that one chapter of Nietzsche's work.He doesn't push Christianity too strongly in this book, but mentions it enough that you know for sure where he stands. If I ever finally decide to (re-)embrace Christianity, it will be in no small part due to Gilbert K. Chesterton.For a large chunk of my life I regarded Christianity as a pit of psychological death, where people go to turn themselves off and become drones. Turns out this was just my own experience growing up. Without shutting off my critical faculties, I've been nurturing a more open-minded attitude about it, and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised.If your hangup about Christianity is that Christians are lame people, this is the book for you. Chesterton strikes me as having been more \\"fully alive\\" than most people I know."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"Unlike Chesterton, I am not Christian, much less Catholic. I identify with Montaigne or Thoreau and appreciate Twain. Yet, I have never read so much logical, wise and witty argument in a small book, with the exception of the great Dane Piet Hein's grooks (short poems very popular in English translation around 1970). Like Twain putting down the Judeo-Christianity of the Bible, or Wilde on the vogue for things Japanese, Chesterton the conservative will thrill all readers who enjoy carefully crafted tracts, carrying wild trains of thought all the way to the end of the line.Each Essay takes on novelists, poets, philosophers, clergy and so-forth, mostly well-known in his day, introducing some of their work and what they stand for. If Loren Eiseley once re-introduced the symbolic essay to English in the 60's as Annie Dillard once opined in Best American Essays, Chesterton's essays each center on an idea he associates with each person. Three names I recall off-hand are Kipling, Shaw and Wells. The idea associated with Kipling is that he embodies the globe-trotter (what we called a jet-setter in the 60's) as opposed to the farmer who stays put. The world traveler thinking to enlarge his vision, becomes jaded and mentally blinkered as the world \\"shrinks\\" due to the greater speed of travel, while the humble man who never goes out the gate imagines a boundless world and enjoys a blessed life of enchantment. As I paraphrase the argument, it sounds trite, but it, and many others in the book are phrased so well, one can read the essays many times without sharing the fate of the traveler.Please note, my five stars are for the book itself. I think the paperback's cover makes it look like a cheap Christian tract rather than the masterpiece of a subtle man of faith which provides food for thought as fresh today as on the day Chesterton wrote it. I include quotes from Heretics in half a dozen of my books in English and think he may seem less dated than I will in a hundred more years!"},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"There are not many items I like about Chesterton, but there are a few. For one, he is intellectually honest. He doesn't attack or slander past infidels; instead, he names those he disagrees with, and instead of attacking the arguer (ad hominem), he instead is honest enough to attack the argument itself (modern apologists could take a page or 3 from his book). His sense of humor is good, & his prose is lovely. What then, is there not to like?Well, in chapter one, he states: \\"All the tortures torn out of forgotten hells could not make him admit that he was heretical.\\" Which is in and of itself a ridiculous statement, as the history of the Inquisition proves. He inveighs then against freedom of thought & speech in a most invidious manner. He says also, that a landlady should be concerned with the tenant's philosophy more than the tenant's income. This is (IMHO) a possible argument for rental discrimination: not Xtian? Leper, outcast, unclean! He does weigh in on the concept of \`immediate victory', & I couldn't agree more. He does pay compliments to Shaw & Kipling. But most of this chapter devolves into bad philosophy.Chapter 2 is GK's more insidious attempt to target progress as Man's downfall. He states: (quote) Nobody can be progressive without being doctrinal; I might almost say that nobody can be progressive without being infallible at any rate, without believing in some infallibility.(unquote) What? Progress is progress - one must define parameters a little more clearly. In GK's terms, the progress spoken of is Man's change of heart, in respects to putting humanity above divinity, at least IMHO.In Chapter 3, he rather pays Kipling huge compliments, but says RK is unpatriotic (of course, this is when England viewed India as an annexed country, & so is excusable). Mostly it is a complaint of the lessening of the natural world by exploration. GK is so verbose at times; it is hard to grasp his meaning.Most of the chapters, as they go, usually compliment the men criticized and targeted. I can see having a problem w/Shaw: he had some ridiculous political theories (approving Stalin, downplaying the Holocaust, that sort of thing: I have some problems w/that also, & I am an atheist). But in Chap. 5, he rails against applying the label of hypocrisy against his beloved Church, as if the men composing it are of some mystic order that is above that sort of thing. & his odd take on humility? Quote - Humility is so successful that it is mistaken for pride Endquote. But false modesty is also a sin, & can very well be that selfsame sin. He inveighs against interfaith, as if it were a curse. & this one is truly foolish: Quote: That is why religion came so early into the world and spread so far, while science came so late into the world and has not spread at all,(End quote) is revisionism, pure & simple. GK casts a blind eye (as most apologists do) to the fact that Xtianity has fought & squelched progress at every turn. He defends Xmas (& honestly, it is a forgivable holiday at best, no argument). But he claims, throughout the book, that faith is an absolutely essential ingredient to living, which it most certainly is not.So I give Mr. Chesterton 2 stars: one for his wit and elegant prose, & one for his intellectual honesty (& the Internet abounds w/bad examples of this: Xtians reviewing & criticizing books they haven't read). But he fails on multiple points. He proposes the insidious concept of labeling, as if only Xtians are truly worthy (Antinomianism). He tries to demolish other viewpoints, & fails due to ineffective analogies & excess verbiage. If you desire rhetoric for rhetoric's sake, rhetoric that supports what you want to hear, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"Chesterton writes in a style uniquely his own. \\"Heretics\\" is not a book of the theology of heretics. It is rather a critique of the culture of secularism and modernity, a culture that has moved \\"beyond\\" the quaint discussions of religion and universal truths.Chesterton smartly blasts this view that intelligent and enlightened people no longer condescend to consider dogma that would divide the society and determine a truth over against a lie. He points out the hypocrisy, arrogance, vacuous arguments, and inanity of secularism and what today we might call \\"progressivism.\\"The main thrust of this book is to highlight the universal truths of creation and humanity especially that have never been refuted only ignored.

We can talk about minutae but not about eternal truths of maximum significance.This book is about offending those who claim to be above offense. For orthodox Christians like Chesterton, humor is a spiritual virture and satire is its expression. He is a master at writing satire and eloquently offending his targets while probably making them smile. He writing seems to go astray often but always returns to achieve its objective.Who are the heretics of Chesteron's book? We all are when we deceive ourselves and ignore the truths of God revealed in Jesus Christ. Chesterton gives us permission to laugh at ourselves and our culture while returning humbly to our Creator for whom we have been created for his pleasure."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"\\"In former days, the heretic was proud of not being a heretic. It was the kingdoms of the world and the police and the judges who were heretics. He was orthodox.... All the tortures torn out of forgotten hells could not make him admit that he was heretical. But a few modern phrases have made him boast of it.... The word 'heresy' not only means no longer being wrong; it practically means being clear-headed and courageous.\\" Chesterton begins here and goes on to discuss, in twenty separate, though connected, essays, the fallacies of various literary \\"heretics\\" of his own time (the first edition of this book came out in 1905). Some, such as George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells, definitely fit the strict church definition of a heretic. Others held views that were wrong in his opinion but that did not necessarily contradict the teachings of orthodox Christianity.Chesterton usually compliments the strengths of the people or groups he discusses before criticizing their weaknesses, except in those cases which he believes hold almost no merit whatsoever. His writing is insightful, easily understandable, and--best of all-funny. On the writings of George Moore, an Irishman whom Chesterton thought was overly self-absorbed: \\"We should really be much more interested in Mr. Moore if he were not quite so interested in himself. We feel as if we were being shown through a gallery of really fine pictures, into each of which, by some useless and discordant convention, the artist had represented the same figure in the same attitude. 'The Grand Canal with a distant view of Mr. Moore', 'Effect of Mr. Moore through a Scotch Mist', 'Mr. Moore by Firelight', 'Ruins of Mr. Moore by Moonlight', and so on, seems to be the endless series. He would no doubt reply that in such a book as this he intended to reveal himself.\\"Some of his criticisms are arguable; for example, Chesterton, because of his strong admiration for Ireland, dismissed any theory about the importance of Ireland's Celtic origins altogether (apparently some Englishmen were excusing their poor treatment of Ireland by arguing that England was superior because it was Teutonic and not Celtic). He has something of a point, since the theory is often exaggerated, but because Ireland and other \\"Celtic\\" countries do share many common cultural characteristics, the Celtic theory cannot be completely dismissed. And C. S. Lewis believed part of Chesterton's critique of Rudyard Kipling to be somewhat unfair. Generally, however, Chesterton is very accurate. And he is unfailingly interesting. Who else could finish debunking \\"tolerance\\" by saying \\"Turnips are singularly broad-minded\\"?Chesterton was a convert to Catholicism, but most Protestants will find very little to disagree with religiously in this book, which should be required reading for every modern politician. Chesterton, the traditionalist Liberal (then defined as a supporter of liberty) is neither neatly liberal, conservative, or libertarian by modern definition; liberals will find themselves squirming as he tears apart their weakened concept of democracy, and conservative militarists should squirm as he unveils the failures of British imperialism, which is not unlike their own ideology. Libertarians can do some wiggling of their own when Chesterton comments, \\"The modern man says, 'Let us leave all these arbitrary standards and embrace liberty'. This is, logically rendered, 'Let us not decide what is good, but let it be considered good not to decide it'.\\" Ouch. Though Chesterton penned \\"Heretics\\" over a hundred years ago, most of the ideologies it dismantles are still very prevalent, and it is as timely now as the day it was written."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"This collection of essays is 'Chesterton the Critic' at the top of his game, cutting through intellectual and artistic pretension to get right to the heart of the matter. Some of the people he wields his pen against are still well known names (like H.G. Wells and George Bernard Shaw); others will only be known to serious students of the late Victorian age. But, the book is surprisingly relevant nonetheless. Partly, this is because our own day is still deeply haunted by the errors of the 19th Century so it's not difficult to name for yourself modern proponents of the ideas that Chesterton rides out to do battle with. But it is also due to the fact that Chesterton's method is never just attack. His winsome, witty, warfare of words is ordered toward revealing the hidden or neglected truths that his interlocutors deny or reject or just miss.And those turn out to be important truths about some of the biggest perennial questions:Why should it matter what someone's philisophy is?What's wrong with subjectivism?What is the most secure ground for human rights like free speech, tolerance, and liberty?What is the difference between good patriotism and bad patriotism?Are human beings more than animals?Can we build a great and just society without first addressing human selfishness?Are human beings incorrigibly ritualistic?If so, what is the difference between good ritual and bad?What is the correct attitude toward drinking and other indulgences?Why is sensationalist media so consistently boring?What is the proper relation between the ideas of nation and race?Is Christianity a benefit or a hindrance to society? and how so?Is there any value in \\"low\\" entertainment like romance stories and action/adventure films?Does humor have any place in serious debates about the most important things?Is there any such thing as \\"good\\" art or is it all in the eye of the beholder? to name a few.It's also important to note that Chesterton does not just denounce from on high; much more often he is explaining how he came to change his mind or notice something that he had missed before.Not surprisingly, this book got under the skin of a number of Chesterton's contemporaries. One of them threw out the challenge that if he was so clever and all-knowing he should write down his own personal positive beliefs instead of just criticizing others. So he did. That's how Chesterton's little classic 'Orthodoxy' (1908) came to be."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"Heretics is somewhat neglected in Chesterton's oeuvre, possibly because it is an early work (1905), and many of the writers discussed are out of fashion now. Yet, I believe Heretics contains not only his best writing, but it already establishes the main themes of his life's work.Technically, it is a book of literary criticism, but from an unusual point of view, that of his subjects' philosophy.\\"I am not concerned with Shaw as one of the most brilliant and one of the most honest men alive; I am concerned with him as a heretic--that is to say, a man whose philosophy is solid, quite coherent, and quite wrong.\\" (p. 22)Brilliant though he was, Shaw expected reality to conform to an inhuman ideal:\\"He has all the time been silently comparing humanity with something that was not human, with a monster from Mars, with the Wise Man of the Stoics, with the Economic Man of the Fabians, with Julius Caesar, with Siegfried, with Superman. Now, to have this inner and merciless standard may be a very good thing, or a very bad one, it may be excellent or unfortunate. but it is not seeing things as they are.\\" (pp. 62-63)This is excellent writing, whether we entirely agree or not. It may be a little unfair to Shaw, but it is fair to life.Chesterton is often called an optimist. But he knew the other side, as anyone reading Alzina Stone Dale's life, The Outline of Sanity, can find out. Joy in living, good beer, conversation, balance, sanity, these were achievements, not just nature.I have managed to find a couple of books by George A. Moore, including his autobiographical novel portraying the Paris of the Impressions of the 1870s and 1880s, Confessions of a Young Man. One tends to regard it as a memoir, and Chesterton did so. Chesterton attacks his egoism, the interest in the world as related to his own temperament:\\"We should really be much more interested in Mr. Moore if he were not quite so interested in himself. We feel as if we were being shown through a gallery of really fine pictures, into each of which, by some useless and discordant convention, the artist had represented the same figure in the same attitude. 'The Grand Canal with a distant view of Mr. Moore,\\" \\"Effect of Mr. Moore through a Scotch Mist,' 'Mr. Moore by Firelight,' 'Ruins of Mr. Moore by Moonlight,' and so on seems to be the endless series.\\" (pp. 131-132)That has to be one of the funniest sentences ever written, and I could barely type it for laughing. A bit later on the page, Chesterton gives his vision of originality:\\"Thinking about himself will lead to trying to be the universe; trying to be the universe will lead to ceasing to be anything. If, on the other hand, a man is sensible enough to think only about the universe; he will think about it in his own way. He will keep virgin the secret of God; he will see the grass as no other man can see it, and look at a sun that no man has ever known.\\"There is no space to mention all the wonderful writing in Heretics. I will mention his often expressed view of the narrowness of the larger world, where one can choose one's companions, as opposed to the nation, the neighborhood or the family, where one has to take people the way they are, with all their foibles.\\"The best way that a man could test his readiness to encounter the common variety of mankind would be to climb down a chimney into any house at random, and get on as well as possible with the people inside. And that is essentially what each one of us did on the day he was born.\\" (p. 190)As always, Chesterton's ideas are eminently discussable! No commentary of mine could do justice to the variety, wisdom, and good humour in this book. The best thing would be to find a copy and read it.I have the John Lane edition, 1905."},{"Title":"Heretics","review":"Charming Edition!A sister book to Orthodoxy, which is a must read.

Is this imbalance due to the male-oriented corporate culture, child rearing issues, biased recruitment and promotion policies, all of the above or something else entirely?

They also detail how they formed the \\"Financial Times/Stock Exchange (FTSE) 100 Cross-Company Mentoring Program\\" as one solution to the problem.

The interviewees, speaking anonymously, tell it like it is, in PC-free terms: the Boys Club... the Queen Bee syndrome...2. It lists specific pipeline-priming actions that women and employers can take3. The cartoons are excellent!The book canvasses opinions from gatekeepers for board positions. One such group is the \\"Kings\\": highly influential males in the largest firms. Another group is headhunters. They deny looking only for Anglo-Saxon male candidates who have run large businesses. They point to the \`third sector' boards (NFPs, charities etc) and to academia, both of which are hiring pools they consider.Another valuable perspective comes from women in the \\"marzipan\\" layer - that's the one just below the board. They said the key factors hindering women's advancement were mostly cultural issues and women's own shortcomings - not flexibility and childcare.One critical intervention is to change the culture. The authors provide a painful list of micro-inequities - the little unfair actions that, singly, are not worth making a fuss about, but that add up to an alienating environment for ambitious women. Simply being able to put a name to such discourtesies, however, helps everyone express and address them.The book makes a great read both for more senior women who aspire to Board positions, and also to younger women, helping them confront \\"issues and barriers of which they as yet have no inkling.\\" It was affirming to find a book full of the issues we talk and write about at Professionelle.co.nz."},{"Title":"Milagrosos Alimentos Curativos de la Biblia","review":"Despues de la Biblia, este es unos de los mejores libros, tiene alimentos para cualquier enfermedad, como prevenir y curar.

Needing a career change, she tendered her resignation and went to work as an apprentice to private investigator Harvey Baltimore who is suffering from multiple sclerosis. Alex Shanahan does most of the leg work while Harvey does the research; together they make a great team. Right now Alex is undercover as a flight attendant for Orange Air trying to get close to Angela Velesco, a senior flight attendant.The chief of security at Orange Air wants Angela's prostitution operation disbanded and that takes proof. Alex believes that Angela might have killed a competitor but that doesn't stop her from trying to get Angela to hire her as a business consultant. Since Angela has major trust issues, Alex must pretend to pass the test that is set for her. As Alex gets a closer look at the operation, she finds that Angela uses blackmail to get what she wants, making the private detective even more determined to stop her even though she has to put her own life in danger to do it.It is a long time (too long) since readers had a chance to read something new about Alexandra Shanahan but it was well worth the wait. The well written storyline is plausible leading to the audience eagerly turning the pages to see what happens next. There is a lot of action in FIRST CLASS KILLING especially the scenes when the heroine comes very close to getting caught in her masquerade. Lynn Heitman tells a very compelling crime thriller complete with blackmail, murder, and an internet run prostitute ring.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"First Class Killing","review":"I am a fan of Lynn Heitmann and had been waiting a long time for this one. I read this author because her thrillers usually take place at airports or in a plane (I love airplane disaster/thriller books). THIS IS WHAT MAKES HER BOOKS DIFFERENT!!!However, this time around, although mention of planes and flying is made in passing, the crux of the action takes place on the ground - turning this thriller into yet another standard, average book.The writing was excellent and the lead character is fun. But, I was extremely disappointed by the fact that only about 15% of the book takes place in the sky."},{"Title":"First Class Killing","review":"Lynne Heitman's latest mystery is yet another fast, absorbing read, and she proves once again just how well she knows the innerworkings of the airline industry.

And, with this saga, she takes her main character, Alex Shanahan, through the difficult first steps necessary to become a real private detective, though Shanahan seems lucky to be alive after this physically brutal adventure. It's also clear that one of Heitman's favorite new characters is a hired thug with a penchant for wildly colorful sports coats.

This story was NOT set on a plane. Not even at an airport.What I love about Heitman's books is that her previous stories involved high intrigue and suspense in either a plane or an airport. This is what makes the stories SUSPENSFUL for me. When the author removes this component, she is simply writing another thriller.While this book was exciting and a very good read, I felt disappointed.Please, Ms Heitman, for the next book - go back to the planes..."},{"Title":"First Class Killing","review":"Having read and enjoyed the first two \\"Alex Shanahan\\" novels, I was happy to see that a third one was available and quickly added it to my personal library.

I hope that this series and its aviation themed mysteries is around for a while. I'm going to enjoy \\"seeing\\" Alex become a full-fledged private eye.I would have given this novel five stars, except for the one disappointing aspect of it-namely the final chapter. There is a resolution, but it's only hinted at, leaving the reader to fill in the blanks on their own. I thought I knew what happened, but it would have been nice if the ending had been as fully fleshed out as the rest of the story.Finally, for those who thought more of the story should have taken place in the air, I am glad that the old \\"Make love in the lavatory,\\" routine was absent from this story."},{"Title":"Valentino Forever: The History of the Valentino Memorial Services","review":"\\"Valentino Forever: The History of the Valentino Memorial Services\\" is a terrifically entertaining and informative book for anyone intrigued with the fact that Rudolph Valentino's death has been formally recognized by generations of fans since his untimely demise in 1926. Tracy Ryan Terhune has amassed a wonderful array of documented details and a plethora of rare photographs pertaining to the evolution of this quirky Hollywood tradition and put them into highly readable, present day perspective. I particularly enjoyed reading about the original \\"Lady in Black,\\" a legend in her own right, and her successors. Just when you think there's nothing new to learn about the legend of Valentino, Mr. Terhune surprises and delights with a story decades in the making."},{"Title":"Valentino Forever: The History of the Valentino Memorial Services","review":"What a great book! It gave quite an insight into the yearly services for \\"The Great Lover\\", as well as entertaining reading about those who attended them. I highly recommend this book, it's fascinating."},{"Title":"Valentino Forever: The History of the Valentino Memorial Services","review":"For nearly 80 years, a memorial service to honor the memory of Rudolph Valentino is held every August 23rd at Hollywood Forever (formerly Hollywood Memorial Park). What may seem as a bizzare ritual to some (over the years, it has been just that), it is also a heartfelt tribute to a silent star who, it really seems, will*never* be forgotten.Tracy Terhune has taken great pains to take us back through the years to experience the grief and remorse felt by family and fans in 1926 and onward through the decades as the memorial services continued amid acrimony between competing factions of Valentino fans and the drama of the mystery of the original and one and only \\"Lady in Black.\\" Having amassed an amazing collection of original materials that belonged to Ditra Flame, the Lady in Black (it appears she never threw anything away and thank goodness she didn't), Mr. Terhune sets out the story, the highlights, the bitch fights all in an entertaining and very readable fashion. One cannot help but be impressed with the photographs in the book. It is profusely illustrated, many of the photos are one-of-a-kind and have not been seen since they were used in the newspapers in August 1926 (if they were previously published at all). It's fun to see all the players through the years and all the new faces who were born decades after Valentino died, who take part in paying tribute to this day.While books on Valentino's life abound, the story of the ritual of the only annual memorial held in Hollywood for a departed star was a story that needed to be told. With a literal cast of thousands, Mr. Terhune does just that, he tells it like it is, warts and all when warranted! Ultimately, the book is quite touching and heartwarming to think that there are still so many people who are touched by this silent and shadowy figure. It is a unique phenomenon, a story that needed to be chronicled and Mr. Terhune wove a tale that is quite an entertaiing read. Anyone who loves old Hollywood would love this book."},{"Title":"Valentino Forever: The History of the Valentino Memorial Services","review":"This book delivers exactly what it promises.

Thank you, Tracy for such an amazing book."},{"Title":"Valentino Forever: The History of the Valentino Memorial Services","review":"\\"Valentino Forever\\" is a unique study on the memorial services honoring the anniversary of Rudolph Valentino's death that have been held at his crypt at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery from 1927 to the present day. Tracy Terhune--who runs an eGroup on the silent film legend and was a speaker at at least one of the memorial services--brings together all the news accounts, letters and paraphernalia to complete a thorough study not told before.Many colorful characters were involved in the services, the most famous of whom were the Ladies in Black. The first known Lady in Black--considered by most who follow the memorials to be the original--Ditra Flame, is covered extensively and her essay \\"Red Roses At Noon\\" is printed in its entirety at the end of the book. Other Ladies in Black included a former Ziegfeld Follies star who was Valentino's last date before his sudden death who claimed to have been his wife and bore his child and would plunge into drug addiction. Another Lady in Black announced she was taking over for her mother who she claimed was an early love interest of the actor and the true original Lady in Black.Other peculiar characters who attended the memorials at one time or another included Amanda, the spiritualist, \\"Rudolph Florentino\\" who had made his apartment into a shrine for the star, dressed in sheik garb and tried to communicate with Valentino through seances, a speaker who talked about Valentino's reincarnation, visitors dressed in gaucho or Arab attire, etc. This quasi circus atmosphere makes for some fun stories, not to mention the in-fighting between competing Valentino Guilds as well as the guilds and Valentino's family. The book does slow down in spots as the memorials themselves were bogged in a rut of repeating speakers and stories.There are many photos of the services most of which were never before published. It is the definitive account of the Valentino Memorial services. My main criticism, though, is the organization and presentation of the book. The book runs in chronological order but, it would have read more smoothly, I think, if it were divided up with more sub headings. Terhune mentions Rudolph Florentino at one point (quite an intriguing name), but doesn't explain who he was until later. There are many long quotations but they are not indented. They are printed like the rest of the text and, sometimes running for multiple paragraphs, I found it easy to lose track of where the quotes begin and end. There are also quite a few typos.Presentation aside, this book is a must for those who cannot get enough Valentino. It includes a foreword by Emily Leider (also a Valentino Memorial participant) who wrote the definitive Valentino biography, \\"Dark Lover.\\" An epilogue is provided by Donna Hill who runs a Valentino website and is working on a book. It is 239 pages and very well-illustrated; albeit the illustrations are photo copy quality, they are rare and unusual."},{"Title":"Reinventing Yourself with The Duchess of York: Success Strategies and Inspiring Stories from Weight Watchers Leaders","review":"Great book, but she loses stars for not coming up with anthing NEW or original.

I read Thje Secret Adversary first and then ordered the rest of the series. Partners in Crime is really a bunch of short stories featuring Tommy and Tuppence and their various adventures. The two sleuths remind me of Mr and Mrs Peale from the old TV series. Very entertaining and fun to read. I especially like that the stories are short ---- I read every night to relax into sleep.I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"The first time I read Tommy and Tuppence, about 30 years ago, they were my least favorite Agatha Christie characters. However, when I reread this book recently, I loved it. It is a collection of short stories about cases handled by T & T, each one mimicking the style of other fictional sleuths. Some of the clues and solutions to the mysteries were brilliant. The one in which their clerk Albert lassoes the bad guy made me laugh out loud, nearly scaring my cat off the back of the couch. I absolutely loved the one about the clergyman's daughter whose inherited fortune was mixed up with potatoes. Christie takes ordinary events and everyday occurrences and turns them into imagined fantasies. All of the stories are puzzles, of course, challenging you to try to figure out the solution. None of them contain graphic violence, irrelevant sex, or profanity. Great entertainment."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"A very enjoyable read. The small size of the paperback makes it good for travelling while the story takes your mind off the delayed flight."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"My oldest daughter started checking out Agatha Christie novels from the library. She says they are cool. She left a couple books in the van last week. I brought them in and started reading Partners in Crime.Partners in Crime is a collection of short stories tied together with an overall story arc. The partners are a husband and wife team who solve mysteries. Tommy and Tuppence Beresford are asked by the Secret Service to take over a detective agency in an effort to flush out a master spy. The Beresfords agree. As detectives they have several adventures. Every chapter or couple chapters has a single mystery. With the last chapter being when they capture the master spy that no one else had been able to get a handle on.The stories take place in the early 1900's in England. The mysteries happen at various locations and different levels of society. I figure my daughter is learning a little bit of history as she reads these stories.They are fun. If you haven't read an Agatha Christie book before, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"Partners in Crime is an enjoyable collection of mystery short stories involving the droll Tommy and his cheeky wife, Tuppence.The stories are bound together by a main thread, in which the Beresfords battle against boredom by taking up a Detective Agency under assumed names. As they tackle each case, Christie lampoons various detective fiction by having them solve the case \\"in the style of\\" a popular fictional detective, starting with (of course) Sherlock Holmes.A clever, rewarding device, especially since Christie finishes with having her characters poke fun at her own famous hero, Hercule Poirot.As with the other Tommy & Tuppence book I've thus far read (I'm reading Christie's fiction in the order of publication, so I believe this is their second appearance), the writing is light and whimsical and just a lot of fun. You might think of Agatha Christie's novels as being one undifferentiated mass of mystery fiction wrtiting, but you'd be wrong: within her genre, Christie wrote all sorts of types of stories in many different styles. What sets Tommy & Tuppence apart is a light, ironic sense of humor about itself and mystery fiction, in general.A fun read. Four stars."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"While waiting for the spies from Moscow to show their hand, Tommy and Tuppence, aka Mr &amp; Mrs Beresford, took over a detective agency known to be associated with the Moscow spies and masqueraded as the real owner Mr Blunt and staff. A fair number of legitimate cases unrelated to the spies came their way, and the two played the game by pretending to be famous fictious detectives, including Father Brown (creation of GK Chesterton) and Sherlock Holmes (creation of Arthur Conan Doyle). They solved the cases with more than an element of fun, typical husband-wife oneupmanship, female intuition etc.While entertaining, the backdrop of the detective agency being a Trojan horse for counter-intelligence was rather naive and unrealistic. It presumed the Russians did not know the faces of the English traitors they recruited, and once the trap was exposed, they would prefer to spring it rather than leave it alone."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"Tommy &amp; Tuppence Beresford take over a detective agency for Scotland Yard, and delve into a variety of mysteries, domestic and international. With almost every adventure, Christie users other literary detectives as inspirations for the Beresfords to solve crimes, including her own Hercule Poirot. I haven't read Christie in ages, and it was a delight to do so again. Her plotting is marvelous. My favorite thing about Agatha Christie's works is her ability to portray human nature in all its details, thereby providing clues to motives. I learn a lot from her books!"},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"No one does it better than Tommy and Tuppence. Amateur sleuths in their own way, they were not to be underestimated because both have their own ways to solve crimes, and even more interesting banters in between crime-solving.

These charactes are a bored couple who desire to give up the doldrums of normal life to go fight crime. The husband is a bit of a straight man and the wife is a witty hellcat. They often attempt to solve crimes using the M.O. (method of opperation) of famous litereary detectives...with varrying degrees of sucess... However, even when they dont solve the crime its still a delightful romp...this book is set up into about 17 short stories...each one a new adventure that will leave you satisfied...Well Done Ms. Christie."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"I've been a fan of Tommy and Tuppence, but had only read two stories about them previously.

Ol' Aggie set the standard for the age."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"Great reading by chapter. It is enjoyable to read stories by chapter and end up with the finale. Easy reading, although confusing a times."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"First appearing inThe Secret Adversary, Tommy and Tuppence are now a happily married couple looking for their next adventure. Contacted by their old friend and intelligence agent Mr. Carter, they agree to take on an amateur detective agency. With the real owner found to be involved in espionage, Tommy takes on the identity of Mr. Blunt in the hopes that by keeping the business open, the international spy-ring will continue to believe that it's a safe rendezvous point for the exchange of secret information. They're told to keep a lookout for a man who will come to them with a particular code-word - until then, they're to run the agency as though it were a real business, as taking on real cases will help their cover story.This is the framing device for a collection of short stories about what Tommy and Tuppence get up to in the wait for the mystery man. There are thirteen altogether, some of which are summarized by Tuppence herself: \\"one jewel robbery, two escapes from violent death, one case of a missing lady, one young girl befriended, an alibi successfully exploded, and alas! One case where we made utter fools of ourselves.\\" It's an eclectic mix of stories, and one gets the feeling that they were crafted from random notes that Agatha Christie had lying around the house or stuffed into a desk drawer. Seeing the opportunity to revisit two characters she enjoyed, they were cobbled together in order to create a short-story anthology that has the wit, banter and liveliness of Tuppence and Tommy as its main attraction. They are certainly appealing characters: both deeply in love with each other and with life, and having a great time throughout.Along for the ride is their friend Albert, who enthusiastically takes to the role of a receptionist for the agency - he provides a couple of laugh-out-loud moments in the way he embraces his new calling. Likewise, many of the stories themselves serve as parodies of other famous detective novels: Tommy and Tuppence adopt the methods and idiosyncrasies of various other sleuths in a rather tongue-and-cheek way throughout the stories. Much likeThe Labors of Herculeshad each story correlate with one of the legendary tasks of Hercules, each of these stories in some way channels the tone of another mystery writer. As such, it contains a lot of references to other works, many of which are obscure to the modern reader. In fact, as I'm not a voracious mystery-reader, the only one I recognized was Sherlock Holmes (obviously) and Christie's cheeky use of her own Poirot.This isn't Christie's best - in fact some of her mysteries and ideas are downright bizarre, including Tommy outwitting an assailant by pretending to be blind, and one mystery that boils down to solving a simple riddle. Some aren't even mysteries at all. It's clear that \\"Partners in Crime\\" was an experiment or a bit of fun on Christie's half, but anyone who enjoys the duo of Tommy and Tuppence will appreciate this. The touching thing about their appearances both here and in subsequent novels is that they age alongside Christie. By their final appearance inPostern of Fatethey are in their twilight years, but here at least, the book ends with Tuppence making a special announcement that promises an entirely different adventure for the two of them."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"A sometimes quirky, sometimes deadly serious mystery anthology. In my humble opinion, this is one of Agatha Christie's best outputs. It takes the reader through a series of interrelated yet \\"stand alone' short stories that tell of a couple of former spies and mystery buffs, Tommy and Tuppence Beresford. Once again they take up the mantle of protecting the British Empire while also pretending to be private detectives in an agency that British intelligence suspects is an enclave for enemy spies. In each crime they solve they act similar to one of their favorite detectives from fiction...in some cases with hilarious results. i think this is a must read for fans of Ms. Christie."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"I enjoy Agatha Christie mysteries and of all the ones I've read,I like the Tommy and Tuppence stories the best."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"Agatha Christie's continuing adventures of Tommy and Tuppence.

Tommy and Tuppence are amongst her most attractive characters. Tommy is a pleasant young man who tries to be serious and responsible, but is also the perfect partner for Tuppence whose exuberance and willingness to take risks moves the action into some hair-raising situations.Here we see them in the second book in the series, where each chapter is a parody around a famous fiction detective of the time. Many of these \\"detectives\\" are long forgotten, but the style of each one is mirrored in the activities of Christie's characters in a collection of credible but interesting situations. Agatha Christie was not only a good writer of detective fiction, but she was also a very clever woman. Nowhere is this more evident that is this volume.The Kindle format is great.

The two go through all sorts of machinations to try and prove their importance to their clients, claiming to be called away to important cases by Scotland Yard. They also mimic the methods and habits of famous literary detectives. There are even several bows to Christie's own Poirot, as they attempt to use \\"the little grey cells.\\"I must admit that Tommy and Tuppence are my least favorite of Christie's detectives. Still, a lesser Christie is still better than a good many other mysteries.

A London detective agency has been found to be involved in espionage and its owner has been picked up--but government authorities want to keep the agency open in hope of tracing its illegal activities. How would Tommy and Tuppence like to take on the task?This set up provides the frame for a series of short stories in which Tommy and Tuppence handle various legitimate calls upon the detective agency even as they hope to make contacts that will break the spy ring. There is Lawrence St. Vincent, whose lady-love has agreed to marry him... but only if he can solve a unique riddle. There is a stolen pearl, the odd scam, and a few murders as well--and, of course, espionage constantly in the background.Along the way, Tommy and Tuppence have fun by adopting the methods, with considerably varied result, of famous fictional detectives such as The Old Man In The Corner, Sherlock Holmes, and even (albeit briefly) the celebrated Hercule Poirot. It is all very light hearted, lightly written, and as always when Christie elects to trot out Tommy and Tuppence the great attraction are the characters themselves--sharp, witty, and having a good time.This collection of short stories comes no where near the brilliance of THE TUESDAY CLUB MURDERS, featuring Miss Marple, or THE LABORS OF HERCULES, only slightly less fine and featuring Hercule Poirot. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining sort of thing, and most readers will enjoy Christie's comic touch with her material.

Although happily married for several years, Tuppence still craves adventure and Christie offers plenty of it in this collection of generally lighthearted stories.Tuppence's craving for adventure meets its satisfaction when a superior from Scotland Yard asks them to front the Blunt Detective Agency, pretending to be Blunt and his associate in an effort to capture a criminal gang from Russia. The Beresfords jump at the opportunity, with Tommy augmenting his sleuthing abilities by studying the great fictional masters, like Sherlock Holmes and even Hercule Poirot. Many of the stories are interconnected, such as \\"The Clergyman's Daughter\\" which begins with a tale about a possible poltergeist forcing a poor young woman to sell the house she inherited, that then ends in The Red House\\" when Tommy and Tuppence discover the natural reason behind the supernatural events. Other standouts include \\"Finessing the King\\"/\\"The Gentleman Dressed in Newspaper\\" where a murder at a costume party has all fingers pointing in the wrong direction, and \\"The Man in the Mist\\" where Tommy and Tuppence encounter a possible ghost in connection with a strange murder.\\"Partners in Crime\\" is an enjoyable and easy read. Tommy and Tuppence are definitely likable characters, and while the stories are rather dated, the wordplay and sheer fun that these two characters have is infectious. It is not by far Christie's best work, but it is an enjoyable departure from her regular sleuths, Poirot and Miss Marple."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"Tommy and Tuppence Beresford have been married for six years. They first met as blackmailers in the 1922 Christie novel \\"The Secret Adversary.' The two have been involved in secret service work and have survived World War I. They live in Bloomsbury in London as the book begins. Tommy is employed in a mundane desk job for the British Intelligence Agency. Tuppence (nee Prudence Cowley) is a bright young socialite who is bored with daily life longing for excitement and danger.The British Intelligence Agency asks the Bersefords to assume aliases as they take over the Blunt Detective Agency. Mr. Blunt was arrested for engaging in espionage for the Russian Communist regime. The Bersefords begin their work with gusto taking on several knotty criminal cases. They imitate the techniques of famous detectives such as Christie's Hercule Poirot and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.There are several cases which the twosome solve during the course of the 215 page book. This is very lightweight Christie but her ingenious mind does use her \\"little grey cells\\" enough to keep her inquisitive readers guessing\\"whodunit?\\". Light! Entertaining! Fun! Enjoy yourselves with a few hours with Tommy and Tuppence!"},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"Tommy and Tuppence Beresford's romance and postwar adventures were told in THE SECRET ADVERSARY. It is now 6 years later (1929) and the pair are comfortably settled into married life.Tommy has a job in the Secret Service, working for Mr. Carter whom they had met during their earlier adventures, and is reasonably content but Tuppence is bored. The housework only occupies a few hours in the morning leaving her longing for earlier, more exciting times. Just as Tommy warns her to be careful what she wishes for his boss arrives to offer them an adventure.He requests the pair take over a detective agency that is a front for Russian spies. The plan is to keep the agency going until the Secret Service can capture the rest of the spy ring. In order to keep up the front of the detective agency Tommy and Tuppence take on various jobs that come along. They are great fans of detective stories and model their detection techniques on the &quot;Classics&quot; the popular fictional detectives of the day.This collection of light hearted adventures is charming and cleverly plotted. It is wonderful to see what has happened to the delightful characters of not only Tommy and Tuppence but also Albert and the mysterious Mr. Carter. So why a 4 instead of a 5 star rating? The problem is with the use of the fictional characters as role models. Other than Sherlock Holmes few of the other detectives (Dr. Thorndyke, Inspector Hanaud, Max Carrados, Reggie Fortune, Inspector French, Father Brown and The Old Man in the Corner) are very well know today. Still, it is possible to enjoy the stories without knowing who the inspirations were."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"The detectives in this book are none other than Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, a lively husband-and-wife team who enjoy adventure.PARTNERS IN CRIME opens as most Tommy and Tuppence books do -- they are bored with life and crave adventure. Their wants are answers when The Chief visits them, and informs them of a failing detective agency. The Chief asks them to take over the failing detective agency and look for a mastermind criminal whose symbol is the number 16. Tommy and Tuppence agree, and the result is adventure and many humorous experiences.PARTNERS IN CRIME is a great example of Agatha Christie's lighter side. She placed some very funny material in the book, making it very enjoyable. I would recommend it to any Christie fan.PARTNERS IN CRIME is also worth reading just for the last line in the book, delivered by Tuppence. She says something that will force the reader to smile and say, &quot;Awww...&quot;"},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"When I read this reader's opinion of Partners in Crime, I agreed 100%! Very well put! An excellent book - I immediatley went to the library after reading this book to check out another Tommy and Tuppence novel, but it seems that in the other Tommy and Tuppence novels with the exception of The Secret Adversary, Tommy and Tuppence are middle aged. One of the reasons I enjoyed Partners in Crime so much is their lively youth, not to mention the romance, excitement, and humor!"},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"This was an enjoyable book, I will say. However, since it is a collection of strung together short stories which merge into one story, it seemed a little disconnected. It began with Tommy and Tuppence taking over a detective agency at the request of Mr. Carter, and the rest of the book until the end detailed their escapades as inexperienced detectives. I get the idea that maybe if I was more familiar with some of the older mystery books it would make more sense, because evidently Tommy and Tuppence are attempting to copy their methods.So, this was an enjoyable book with some of my favorite characters of Christie's, but I liked their first book, The Secret Adversary, better in the end."},{"Title":"Partners In Crime","review":"A Tommy & Tuppence Adventure.

The narrative, designed for the general reader, presents Paul not as a distant saint on a pedestal, but, realistically and appreciatively, as a vital and seminal personality. The book incorporates the opinions of various schools but also debunks some legends and long-held textbook views. Rome is shown as a ruthless modern totalitarian state. The Jews are shown as a surprisingly major and popular minority in the Empire until the Revolt in Jerusalem changed their fate. Paul's influence is seen in a novel way: not spreading the faith among the lower classes, but preaching to well-educated Gentiles who attended the Jewish synagogues and were well acquainted with Judaism; these Gentiles, in turn, radiated the new Christian faith into pagan society."},{"Title":"Cemetery Nights (Poets, Penguin)","review":"These poems are packed with emotion and are able to eerily cut to the heart of many issues of society and humanity (especially those of the human spirit and condition in the modern world) that bear examining. The writing itself is simple yet complex. accessable, yet in many ways riveting... check this one out!"},{"Title":"Cemetery Nights (Poets, Penguin)","review":"This collection of poems that give you the feel of very short short stories from time to time, is a remarkable, respectable piece of work. Stephen Dobyns who's maybe known for his Saratoga crime series and recent successes like \\"Boy In The Water\\" or \\"The Church Of Dead Girls\\" is two things at one time: a writer of mystery and crime stories ... and a poet. The beautiful, astounding way of Dobyns is how he interconnects those two styles, that give his words not only imaginary power when it comes to good fiction but also deep insight and a very dark touch that makes the hairs on the back of your neck step up and cold water running down your back while the somkey winds of apocalypse and doom caress your face. Cemetery Nights is the evidence for everybody that SD has become a master of these two styles, his vivid imagination and that dark feel his work produces. It is a mature work, a comforting refuge for those of you who seek literary pleasure.His words are powerful, like ice-cold fingers prying gripholds into your memory so that they will remain there for ever, verbal fingerprints engraved in your mind, like letters hatched in the stone of a grave ... on a gloomey cemetery night. Stroll through hidden paths of darkness, desire, longing, death as well as life and maybe, if the moon shines just right and there are no gray clouds torn in front of the night's only light, you see a reflection of yourself in the smooth surface of a gravestone ... but beware of the dead, they don't pass away erverytime, because in death everything is contrary to life - so death means life and life is death.An Advice: because this book is unavailable here that does positively not mean that there is no way to lay your hands on it.

What better way than to read them in a first British edition printed to wartime economy standards. I know many Americans interested in Churchill will have seen or heard of \\"Blood, Toil, Tears and Sweat\\" which is the edition that came out in the US in the early forties, but You Really Need To Hold The British printing (made with Britsh Blood Sweat and Tears), so that you can feel the emotion and the history. . .well, that was a bit over the top. . .but I have always maintained that the poetry and emotion of Churchill's speeches brought together the British Peoples from all the corners of that extinct Empire, and is why we are living in a relatively free world now. . .

While I've been looking for copies of the old out-of-print books, some of them are really collector's items now and out of my price range. This reprint includes the illustrations and looks very similar to the originals.Beware of the version which may be available from Tredition Classics. (I ordered The Dutch Twins from this publisher.) There is a huge difference, and I should have heeded the warning of one reviewer about the lack of illustrations in Tredition Classics. The latter has none of the charming illustrations I loved as a child. It doesn't even start each chapter on a new page, but just runs them together.

With trusty off-sider, of course.Holmes has a significant problem in that he has never been in a plane before, and they have to cross the world to chase the bad guy. Much air-sickness ensues (and no cocaine). However, their pilots turn out to be Richard Wentworth and Lamont Cranston!Then of course, there is their African connection.Light, fast, and entertaining foray through Farmer's Wold Newton imaginings."},{"Title":"The adventure of the peerless peer","review":"Three and a half stars for this one, but first, a bit of background: Hugo Award winning fantasy/sci-fi author Philip Jose Farmer had long been keen on heroic literary figures and, specifically, on pulp heroes. To satisfy this fascination, he imagined the Wold Newton universe, in which he hypothesized that the meteorite which crashed into Wold Newton, England in 1795 was the source of the family-tree of \\"supermen\\" whose feats have since then been fictionalized in books. Two members of this family are Sherlock Holmes and Tarzan of the Apes. In 1974, Farmer \\"edited\\" John Watson's THE ADVENTURE OF THE PEERLESS PEER, which chronicled the fateful encounter between the Great Detective and the Jungle Lord.In 1916, set in the throes of the first World War, Mycroft Holmes of the Front Office sends his brother Sherlock and Dr. Watson on a perilous mission to regain a stolen formula. Their adversary is the dangerous German agent Von Bork, whose criminal exploits Watson had previously chronicled in \\"His Last Bow\\" (His Last Bow: Some Reminiscences of Sherlock Holmes (The Oxford Sherlock Holmes)). But very inclement weather and the whims of their mad pilot cause Holmes and Watson to be captured by a zeppelin. However, this German aircraft is itself rendered so structurally damaged that its crew and captives are forced to abandon ship. They parachute into the dark African jungles, and, this is, naturally, where Tarzan of the Apes makes his appearance.THE ADVENTURE OF THE PEERLESS PEER, at 127 pages, is more of a novella than a novel. It's a brisk and fun read, and it isn't for everyone, definitely not for the Sherlock Holmes purist. So read this with a grain of salt, maybe two grains. I happen to have enjoyed reading this one, but, then again, I've read a lot of Philip Jose Farmer's fantasy/sci-fi stuff and figured this one to involve more high adventure than cerebral mystery solving.The author's presentation of Tarzan is close enough to Burrough's original take, with Farmer placing him very much in his prime and firmly in his arboreal purview. But, you could look at Farmer's portrayal of Holmes in one of two ways: Holmes is either realistically humanized or is misrepresented, and woefully so. THE PEERLESS PEER takes place in 1916 and presents Sherlock Holmes and John Watson as decidedly older gentlemen in their 60s. Maybe that's why they spend much of the time wheezing for breath and seemingly in stark terror (yes, sadly, even Holmes). Figure in too that they're mostly out of their element as much of the events take place inside rollicking, storm-tossed airplanes and in dense, exotic African jungles. Nevertheless, it's offputting to see Holmes depicted as less than he is, even given his advanced years. For much of the book's first half, Holmes doesn't get to do much more than be airsick and bitterly complain about flying as he's ferried thru the air to his mission destination, which he doesn't even reach.Also disappointingly, if you're a hard core Sherlock Holmes fan, there's a dearth of deductive analysis here. Holmes does figure out Greystoke's true history and there's a bit at the end, when he ferrets out the formula's location. But, if anything, it's Holmes' study of bees that saves everyone's hash. I guess, with regards to how Holmes was written, I'm not too pleased with Farmer. But, at least, Watson has a very happy ending. Again, with this book, a grain of salt. Maybe two grains.Farmer strays from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's somewhat detached and clinical style. Rather, Farmer affects a tone that is brisk, action-oriented, and sometimes even wink-of-the-eye. Not surprisingly, given that Farmer's inclinations and sensiblities lie more with Burroughs than with Doyle, the narrative pace is more suited to a Tarzan adventure than a Holmesian mystery. He also throws in a few puns and in-jokes, the most groan-inducing of which is: \\"Holmes commented several times that he could use a little cocaine to relieve the tedium, but I believe that he said that just to needle me.\\"Farmer isn't about to miss out on this opportunity to have others of his Wold Newton family-tree cross over into these pages. He peppers in early sightings of John Dickson Carr's future sleuths Gideon Fell and Henry Merrivale. Even better, we see in action the great but quite demented aviator G-8 and, also, Colonel Kentov aka Lamont Cranston aka the Shadow (this is before he became the Shadow, of course).The McGuffin itself is rather silly, involving some formula which details a bacteria tailored to consume all the sauerkraut in Deutschland, thus devastating the enemy's food supply and morale. But, being the McGuffin, its silliness is negligible. For the interested Tarzanphile, with regards to chronology and continuity, this adventure seems to take place somewhen around the events ofTarzan the Untamed (Tarzan #7) (Vintage Ballantine, F751), when Lord Greystoke still believed his wife Jane to have been killed by Germans. For those who might want to look into Farmer's other Wold Newton novels, there are, among others,Wind Whales Ishmael,The Other Log of Phileas Fogg,Barnstormer In Oz/a,Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life, and his bible, the awesome mock biography of Lord Greystoke,Tarzan Alive: A Definitive Biography of Lord Greystoke (Bison Frontiers of Imagination). Philip Jose Farmer is also known for his well-regarded Riverworld and World of Tiers series. One of my favorite novels by him, however, is the fantasticDark is the Sun; it's worth giving a try.Side note: due to copyright issues, this book was later rewritten by Farmer as \\"The Adventure of the Three Madmen\\" to be included in his anthology bookThe Grand Adventure.The Jungle Books (Signet Classics)'s Mowgli takes over Tarzan's place. But it's just not the same."},{"Title":"The Education Gap: Vouchers and Urban Schools","review":"Paul Peterson and William Howell are revolutionaries in their field--Education Public Policy. This book is so great because it lacks the ideological and political biases that permeate nearly 90 percent of the voucher books out there. Despite what the previous reviewer stated I wish to defend Howell and Peterson's book (which needs no defending from me). Their book which is put out by the Brookings Institute (hardly an ideologically driven think-tank Brookings is the model of centrism) Howell and Peterson formulate their empirical data from randomized field trials. RFTs are the gold standard in empirical research studies that seek to compare two groups of individuals while controlling for one factor. In this case Howell and Peterson are able to control for the much noted self-selection bias problematic to many voucher studies and show that African-American students from similar economic and educational backgrounds score significantly (1 standard deviation)higher when they are educated in parochial/private schools than in their neighborhood public schools. A wealth of research from 99.9 percent of all the other scholars studying this topic have in one shape or form supported that finding--that black students do improve upon going to a private school viz. a voucher. Only Alan Krueger and Zho (2004) of Princeton discredit parts of the study, but they refuse to control for baseline data which does not allow them to control the self-selection bias. Furthermore Krueger et al. uses a questionable racial classification scheme where self-identified black/hispanic folks are reclassified as African-American/non-hispanic. In the final analysis its hard to disagree with Peterson and Howell and the above reviewer does so at his own peril. These folks are professionals in the truest sense of the word and they work at the venerable Harvard Program on Education and Governance Policy--please don't try to mislead people into thinking they are overly ideologically motivated."},{"Title":"The Education Gap: Vouchers and Urban Schools","review":"This book is a requirement for some urban educ classes I have coming up this semester.

I also worked through most questions in the Kaplan MCAT Workbook and several of the Examcrackers books. One thing I noticed very quickly is that had my background not been very strong, those books would have been useless. The key to performing well on such a grueling exam is to review old college materials (notes, textbooks, etc.) and to be a good student in the first place. Any review should just be that, a review and not instruction in materials with which you are unfamiliar. This book is a decent review but not necessarily a complete review. I believed that the physical sciences section was particularly weak when compared to the questions on the MCAT. For a much better review, I worked questions from my old college physics and chemistry books.

Sure enough, he found himself in a Mountain Valley War on the side of the minority. The minority is a majority when they find out who Trent really is! He is non other than Kilkenny, the fastest gun around and the greatest fighter too. Before it is over, he'll have to prove it. Check this book out. L'Amour is especially good at describing the fight scene and he does it expertly in this saga of old west fiction."},{"Title":"The Mountain Valley War (Thorndike Western II)","review":"I am reading L'amour for the first time and all in a mix depending on which books I get hold of first. I was a bit disappointed with this one. I like the funny wry novels better than the serious/gunfighter ones - and this falls into the serious gunfighter genre, it seems.IN this second book Kilkenny has drifted to Idaho into the mountains and properly filed for some land himself. Unfortunately he and his fellow 'nesters' have aroused the ire of the local land baron, 'King' Hale. Hale hadn't been interested in the land until the nesters came along, now he is ruthlessly driving them out aided by his violent son 'cub' and the tacit help of some of the locals including a shop owner who refuses to sell them any goods.Kilkenny now calls himself Trent and doesn't want to be drawn into anything he doesn't have to, but unfortunately it is brought to his door, his neighbour is ruthlessly murdered and his children hunted. They escape to Trent's cabin and then Trent himself is threatened. He refuses to budge but joins up with the other nesters and fights for what is his.What I liked about this book and other L'amours is that people are generally not simply black and white. Some of Hale's men are actually good men and they recognise in Trent a similar spirit which makes the action more complicated and richer for it. Also within the nesters there is Cain Brockman, whose brother Abel was killed by Kilkenny/Trent and has sworn revenge. Cain is a good man who fell in with a bad lot now trent has to use his persuasive powers to convince Cain of this.Like I said this is a rich and complex novel, a good easy read to take up an afternoon."},{"Title":"The Mountain Valley War (Thorndike Western II)","review":"The second of the three novels about Lance Kilkenny, a man with an unwanted reputation as a gunfighter, now he's got himself a small piece of land, a few head of cattle and has hung up his guns. A good novel, though personally I favour the other two Kilkenny novels (&quot;The Rider of Lost Creek&quot; and &quot;Kilkenny&quot;) but this one is not far behind. It's obvious that L'Amour knows his characters well, like all good writers for any medium should.

Mad Coyote Joe has obviously tried all of his recipes because everything in his book is delicious besides being easy to prepare. He has also chosen a popular setting for preparation of his culinary masterpieces.

(Innovators in Education)is the first book that became available at my local library, so this is the one I read first. Holt soundly condemns methods used in public schools at the time (methods that have improved very little since then!) and I found myself agreeing with the majority of his opinions.He doesn't just argue against these methods, though. He also provides some alternatives. This book is packed full of great ideas for helping (not making!) children to follow their natural learning inclinations. I particularly love the way he explained certain Maths concepts. Not being mathematically minded myself, this is perhaps the first time in my life that I have fully understood some of these concepts!This book is a must-read for anyone embarking on the homeschool journey, but I also recommend it to parents, grandparents, teachers and anyone else who cares for the children in their life."},{"Title":"What do I do Monday?","review":"Any and all of John Holt's books are to be treasured. Way back in the fifties I read them eagerly when my first son was in primary school! First I read \\"How Children Fail\\", then \\"How Children Learn\\" and others whose names I have not retained. They all deal with the kind of issues that made and make school learning hell or at least boring for really bright children, and they resonated with my soul and encouraged me to do better for my own son -- now nearly 60 and an amazing original and independent thinker leading a deeply satisfying life. For goodness sake, try it; you'll like it!!"},{"Title":"What do I do Monday?","review":"I had heard great things about John Holt and was really disappointed in this book. Maybe part of it was that after reading about Charlotte Mason and reading books by John Gatto, it didn't seem so revolutionary to me. But Holt quoted psychologist Robert Liang extensively in this book, which to me seems like the most outdated psychobabble (granted this book was written quite awhile ago), saying if you make ____ mistake with your kids they may turn out schizophrenic!He then continues on with different teaching techniques, which is also surprising since the unschooling movement generally refer to him as the source of their inspiration, but say you should not \\"teach\\" children, letting them learn as they become motivated to do so. So if you're looking for unschooling information you won't find it here. It also has odd references like to a school in which teachers express anger to the students to make things \\"real\\" and children seem to be allowed to hit each other sometimes."},{"Title":"Man of War","review":"This volume in the Bolitho series does not need, or deserve, a long review. If you like the series about \\"we happy few,\\" then you may want to read this, too. This is certainly not the place to start, as many references to earlier characters and situations of \\"the Bolitho legend\\" are oblique in the extreme: suitable for constant readers but hardly explaining the rushes of sentimental emotion among them that Kent offers here. Although this Capt. Bolitho, son of the revered admiral of earlier books, is young, he is not involved in much action because Napoleon has been finished off. Instead, the British are now pursuing American slave traders in a rather secretive fashion, and Bolitho has found a girl, another lost soul, to agonize upon. So, this is far from a sea-going swashbuckler of the sort found in the first ten or so books of this now-26 volume series. However, with its greater emphasis on manly sentiments among aging and retired sailors and their women on shore, this story is likely to appeal to a broader spectrum of readers of historical romance fiction than naval fiction is wont. This book is in a way of a love story between Adam and the lovely Lowenna, and also between Kent and his characters.Many of the scenes are interior, either in offices, homes, or inside the characters feelings. Kent makes it easy to tell good officers from bad: if the lieutenant knows his men's names he's good, if he don't he ain't. In fact, however, there's very little of the conflict between ranks that is a staple of nautical fiction (and powering whole books earlier in this series). This, despite the fact Adam Bolitho is now a flag captain and under the potentially oppressive thumb of his admiral. But Admiral Bethune has too much respect for the revered Bolitho name! In fact, this book lacks tension or much suspense due to its pervasive sense of nostalgia and a scarcity of open conflict, either at sea or in the halls of Admiralty.In the few scenes of life at sea, Kent is usually more careful than here to give wind and sailing directions so you can imaginatively follow the maneuvering. I think his mind was on other matters, a different kind of sea tale. As always, McBooks Press does a nice job of the somewhat antique typefaces, while avoiding the crowded little text of yore."},{"Title":"Man of War","review":"I've read all 26 books in the Bolitho series and thoroughly enjoyed the vast majority. Alas, &quot;Man of War&quot; stands alone as the weakest offering in the series. Foremost among the literary casulaties is the carefully perpetuated overarching series theme &quot;We happy few&quot;. Sadly, it is overwhelmed in a pea soup fog of never-ending, tedious-beyond-words introspections by a proliferating cast of characters. Absent too are a compelling, coherent plot and the expected ration of expertly described naval engagements. Indeed, for those readers who &quot;live&quot; for the battles, be forewarned: you'll have to endure almost 300 pages of (pardon the pun) navel gazing to reach the only engagement in this 318 page book; and even then the reward is slight when compared to other books in the Bolitho series.To be fair to Reeman/Kent, the Bolitho series has arrived at a point in the history of the British Empire and the Royal Navy where there's not all that much exciting to write about. Still, he presses on; and it would seem there are enough loose ends in &quot;Man of War&quot; to suggest at least one more book is in the offing. If &quot;Man of War&quot; is a window on what the future holds for this mostly enjoyable series, it's time for Reeman to bring it to a merciflul end and let the Bolitho legend enjoy fair winds and following seas into a well deserved retirement."},{"Title":"Man of War","review":"For some time, I thought Alexander Kent was slipping a bit. His books have become more tedious and soap-opera like in concept and content. In this book, Man of War, the author filled the pages with non-action. The dead hero, Richard Bolitho is never far from the minds of the major characters in the book and so it appears in the mind of the author as well. While the time period was one of peace and hunting slavers seem to be a major letdown from fighting the French, the author could still add some excitment to the story. But instead, we are treated with a lot of talk, a lot of emotional repression and by the book characters. This is a very slow going book where many things are said but very little take place. The author is no longer the same man who wrote the initial books of the series that was filled with swift tale of action, seamanship and interesting characters, good and bad.This book is still readable and for any Bolitho fan, it should provides several hours of interesting reading regardless of its overall quality. But if a first time reader of Bolitho series start off with this book, such a reader probably won't touch another.In my humble opinion, the series should have ended with the death of Richard Bolitho since the series as it is, cannot let go of him."},{"Title":"Man of War","review":"While understanding the comments made by other reviewers, I can not agree on the low ratings. It was nice to have some 'action' with others in the series, i.e. sister Nancy, John and Unis and others.Not all of the series need be sea battles, in fact it was nice to have some shore duty. Certain things were very obvious, such as the end of Kate, while others were nice to see, i.e. Thomas Herrick showing up and saying John had told him about Richard asking for him at the end.It would be nice to have some happiness show up, it seems the last few books have been I loss after another. All in all, not as good as some earlier books, but not as bad as some think either."},{"Title":"Man of War","review":"Alexander Kent, I could never really do the man justice by reviewing his writing. I have actually read 27 of his books of the \\"Richard Bolitho\\" series back to back in less than 90 days. They are a great read."},{"Title":"Man of War","review":"Adam Bolitho, frigate captain, finds himself with a new role to play: that of flag captain to Vice-Admiral Sir Graham Bethune, who once sailed under the command of Adam's famous uncle, Vice-Admiral Sir Richard Bolitho. With Sir Richard dead, the Bolitho house and estate at Falmouth belong to Adam now. But Adam remains a bachelor; so the estate operates under a faithful steward's control, with Sir Richard's motherless fifteen-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, living in the nearby household of her father's widowed sister.That's where things stand personally for Adam, who wants nothing more - beyond the sea and the Navy - than to marry Lowenna, the lovely artists' model from an earlier book in this long running series. For now, though, he must put to sea and take his new command to the West Indies with Sir Graham on board. The slave trade, outlawed in England and therefore for English ships, operates most profitably for captains and owners from other nations; and catching slave ships as they violate the British Empire's territory is now Adam's mission. Which is complicated by the presence of his uncle's long time love, Lady Catherine Somervell, who shelters under the protection of a man suspected of illegal slave trade involvement...and who is now the object of Sir Graham Bethune's unsolicited and unrequited passion.I am glad author Kent decided to continue this series with Adam Bolitho as its new protagonist, because I've been reading his Bolitho novels since the 1970s. They are in my opinion the best of their genre, and as usual I enjoyed this one thoroughly. I did find some of the writing concerning Sir Graham's motivations a bit, well (pardon the unintentional pun) at sea. \\"Where did that come from?\\" But those few lapses did nothing to spoil the book for me, and I will continue to read these novels for as long as Kent continues to write them.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Knowledge and compassion. She has worked with the Cambodian refugee community in the Puget Sound (Seattle) area for over a decade. With the skill of a veteran writer, Harrington brings the clashing of the American and Cambodian cultures to the forefront in a haunting tale of murder and intrigue.This story might easily have been clipped from the lead article of a recent Seattle Post-Intelligencer news article. It is that timely. The crime, the emotions, the mistrust of police and politicians, and the wariness of the Cambodian refugees is real enough. I suspect it occurs to some extent with all immigrants. The author brings a set of characters to life in such a way that the reader cannot help but become involved in their struggle. The reader may not know anything about the Khmer when they begin reading page one, but they will know and understand plenty by the time they turn the last page and close the book. It is more than just a book about murder, police, and mystery. It is a book about people trying to balance their lives, trying to &quot;walk in American ways while honoring their Cambodian customs.&quot;As readers, we get a history lesson and a well plotted mystery.Although the names of some of the characters will have your tongue or your eyes, twisting and turning to get a grasp of them, don't worry, you'll quickly get everyone sorted out...from Patrewski to Sovath Sovang to the protagonist, Bridget O'Hern.Ms. Harrington has a crisp writing style that is quite refreshing. There is a breeziness and sense of humor lurking in the words that too often would be edited out by lesser writers. Or over written in tired cliches, by lesser writers.cj"},{"Title":"Death Stalks the Khmer","review":"In Seabell, by their choice, a large community of Cambodians live segregated from the rest of the citizenry. Bridget O'Hearn, while not Asian, has come to know the Cambodian people from her work for the SouthEast Asian Assistance Agency. When Hahn Lys and his wife are found dead in their apartment the SEAAA appoint Bridget to serve as liaison between the community and the police. Enter Detective Jack Patrewski. He and O'Hearn set out to unravel the mystery surrounding the deaths and in doing so find themselves embroiled in an even greater mystery. Before long O'Hearn is convinced that the deaths relate back to the old Khmer Rouge days while whispers of bad karma surrounds much of the thinking of the residents. O'Hearn is viewed by many within the community as an unwelcome intruder, while others believe she is a helpful outsider.Death Stalks The Khmer is the well wrought product of writer Harrington, who like her Bridget O'Hearn is well versed in the intricacies of the Cambodian refugees living here in this county. Harrington has peopled her work with a fine assortment of characters. The clash of cultures resulting from transporting a large group of people from their own land to what is considered to be a safer enviornment is presented in a deft manner in this well crafted ethnic mystery. As in life, the old generation presented in Death Stalks The Khmer clings to the old ways while the younger generation yearns to be wholly American.Steinbeck's displaced Okies are evocative of the struggles facing those who fled the terror of Pol Pot and now live in an enviorment very different from that they have always known. This fast paced thriller is reminiscent of the drama found in the works of Dashiell Hammett."},{"Title":"Death Stalks the Khmer","review":"Patricia Harrington's knowledge of the Cambodian refugee community provides an extra layer of realism in &quot;Death Stalks the Khmer.&quot; The protagonist, Bridget O'Hern, is a compassionate and intelligent woman who plays a major role in helping the police solve two murders among the Cambodians-in spite of the strangle hold of an evil man who is considered to be one of their own.The characters are well defined and the story fascinating, but this book goes far beyond the mystery to be solved. By acquainting us with the world of the Cambodian refugees, Harrington educates us about the culture of a group of people who live among us, but about whom most of know very little.This is Harrington's first novel, but I predict we will see Bridget O'Hern and Seattle police detective Jack Patrewski again. At least, I certainly hope so.Janet B. Fudala, Ph.D.CEO, Educational Solutions"},{"Title":"Death Stalks the Khmer","review":"I am not a professional writer/reviewer but I have read enough books in my almost 60 years to be a professional reader. I was quickly pulled into the mystery by the descriptive dialogue and the desire to know more about the people who had survived the Khmer Rouge era. I like most Americans have seen the news stories and the movies about the horror of that reign of terror but had given little thought to the pain the survivors have had to endure. I thank Patricia Harrington for reminding me how fortunate I am to be an American."},{"Title":"Death Stalks the Khmer","review":"As a recent transplant to Washington, I am thoroughly enjoying the 'view' of the area through the eyes of the protagonist, Bridget O'Hern. Ms. Harrington's writing is good, and I can hardly wait to read future books in this series. The story line is quite interesting. I totally recommend this book to others."},{"Title":"Death Stalks the Khmer","review":"Unless you live in the Pacific Northwest, and specifically, Tacoma, Washington, you might not be aware that we have substantian Asian communities. I have driven through the Cambodian neighborhood of which Harrington writes. It's on the extreme eastside of town, and the houses were built for WWII military personal and their families--no longer in the best of shape. What Harrington does in this book is capture the plight of the refugees--all that Pol Pot residue--they brought to the United States with them, of which the rest of us are totally unaware. The protagonist, Bridget O'Hern, is a laid-back (at least on the surface) middle-aged professional woman. What a nice change from the disfunctional thirty-somethings that are starting to blend together. At the usual pace, approximately once a year, that a book in a series comes out, I am beginning to find it hard to remember which woman is the PI and which is a Park Ranger, which has a landlord for a mentor and which has an owner of a cab company. And not once in Harrington's book did O'Hern jog, work out or pursue one of those agrivating pursuits that remind me I should be exercising instead of reading! Instead, she gets dragged into providing cultural explanations to the local police when a local Cambodian and his wife are murdered. Harrington is best at talking about the Cambodians and the baggage they brought here, less adept at creating spine-tingling peril. After having read it I find myself looking at the Cambodians with whom I deal with more interest and compassion. I look forward to another mystery with a non-physical fitness women who is intelligent and not overly enthused about kicking bad guys' behinds."},{"Title":"Death Stalks the Khmer","review":"I learned a lot about southeast Asian culture during an enjoyable read. Although not a big mystery fan, I was hooked from the start."},{"Title":"Death Stalks the Khmer","review":"The story is set in the Puget Sound area. The main character is a woman who works as a consultant with organizations. One of her clients--a group that serves Cambodian refugees--has had an employee murdered. Bridget is asked by the director of the organization to help the police since she has some understanding of the Cambodian community.This story explores the beliefs of the different Asian refugee groups, how they are misunderstood by other Americans, how unscrupulous people can take advantage of them, and how difficult it is for them to leave their past behind. I found this all very interesting and I enjoyed the local setting. I was surprised by the ending. I would like to see more stories from Harrington. I think she has a good start!"},{"Title":"The Roots of Russian Through Chekhov: A Study in Word-Formation","review":"I read this book back in the early 90's as a part of my Russian Language studies, and it has never left my mind. I found the selection of stories to be engaging and often humorous. The emphasis on learning the roots of the words has been a skill that has helped me ever since to understand the language better. In particular, it helps with reading comprehension. When you come across an unfamiliar word, with a known root, it greatly enhances your chances of understanding the meaning. Excellent book for an intermediate Russian Language student."},{"Title":"The Yale Book of Quotations","review":"A good quotations collection will give the definitive wording of quotations, provide information as to the quotations' sources and eliminate spurious sources, and be interesting enough to read or browse in its own right, even when no particular quotation is sought. The Yale Book of Quotations does all of these things, and it does them better than its nearest competitors (Bartlett's Familiar Quotations and The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations). The Yale Book of Quotations is the first new comprehensive collection in many years, and it has benefited from a rethinking of the quotations selected, the use of modern databases to track quotations back to their origins, and comparison with those original sources to assure accuracy.The immediately noticeable difference is a selection that is more likely to appeal to a modern American audience. Bartlett's has pages of quotations from Dryden, most of which inspire neither recollection nor pleasant surprise. Yale has 12 quotations from Dryden, which is enough to include all the genuinely familiar Dryden quotations. On the other hand, Yale has 23 quotations from George W. Bush, many uttered after Bartlett's was last updated. Yale includes extensive selections of proverbs and sayings, political slogans, television catchphrases, and other familiar lines. In general, although Yale's use of literary quotations is comprehensive (there are, for example, 455 quotations from Shakespeare), the quotation selection tends to be relatively less literary and more inclined toward quotations of contemporary interest, particularly to Americans. It may be for this reason that, frankly, Yale is just a lot more fun to browse.Less dramatic, but perhaps ultimately a better indicator of usefulness, is the impressive level of research that went into compiling the Yale Book. Have you ever wondered who said \\"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch\\"? Yale cites to several authors who used versions of this line, the earliest of which (\\"such a thing as a 'free' lunch never existed\\") was in the Reno Evening Gazette on January 22, 1942. It is unlikely that such an obscure source could have been located without modern databases. It was indeed Horace Greeley who said \\"Go West, young man\\"; Yale spends a quarter of a page discussing this quotation, which it notes is one of the great examples of the prevalence of misinformation about famous quotations (both Bartlett's and Oxford get it wrong). The Yale Book of Quotations offers a level of scholarship and reliability that is simply not otherwise available."},{"Title":"The Yale Book of Quotations","review":"A copy of this handsome new volume was given to me for my eighty-first birthday, so, at that age having so little time to waste, I immediately set about to test this YBQ against my much older Bartlett's (1968 edition).YBQ is certainly more fun. Harry S. Truman appears, of course, in both books, but it is the YBQ that quotes Harry's letter to Paul Hume: \\"I have just read your lousy review [of my daughter's concert] .... You sound like a frustrated old man who never made a success, an eight-ulcer man on a four-ulcer job...\\" No, nothing like that in good old Bartlett's.YBQ has the wit, and is obviously more up-to-date, but I must say that Bartlett's is better organized, and has more scholarship, at least scholarship of the kind that I appreciate.I was happy to see that both books will give you one of my favorite lines of poetry, usually cited in the original French, from Villon: \\"Mais o&ugrave; sont les neiges d'antan ?\\" ('But where are the snows of yesteryear ?'). Both books have this line, in both French and English, but only Bartlett's will lead you to it if you look for the French 'neiges' in the index. To find the line in YBQ, you need to look in the index for 'snows,' not actually a word used, even in English, by those who love this line.Speaking of indexes, well, the YBQ's is awful. It is radically shorter than Bartlett's. It will not lead you to a page number but only to the name of the writer-source of the quotation. And these sources are not always easy to find in the body of the YBQ because the page headings are organized in an eccentric way.But my biggest problem with the YBQ arises from its quirky way of dealing with disputed attributions. Shapiro, the YBQ's editor, is good about signaling when there is a problem. But he feels called upon to come down on one side or another about whether a given quotation is genuine or spurious.Here are some examples:Concerning George Washington and that famous hatchet, Shapiro tells us \\"apocryphal\\" (p. 804) without bothering to tell us why he thinks so. Lenin's statement about \\"useful idiots,\\" Shapiro says, \\"seems to be a myth\\" (p. 452). On the other hand, he comes down on the side of authenticity in the case of a statement made by the Nazi-era Pastor Niem&ouml;ller (p. 551). To his credit, he seems neutral in the case of an alleged statement by Adolf Hitler (p. 361).These questions of attribution are difficult, and absent a great deal of research, are difficult to make. I think that he is almost certainly wrong about Niem&ouml;ller, but nobody will expect him to be an expert on everything. It would have been much wiser for him to simply state, in most if not all these cases, that there is doubt about authenticity, to give whatever sources are available, and to let it go at that.YBQ has a total of 1067 pages. Not bad. But my old Bartlett's has 1750 pages, each one of which seems denser than those of YBQ. Much of the difference comes from the fact that Bartlett's has a magnificent, thorough index of quotations, taking up 593 pages. YBQ's index of 212 pages is no by means puny, but it doesn't compare. Fortunately I do have enough space for both of these works, and they now stand side by side, in uneasy companionship, on my long-suffering shelf."},{"Title":"The Yale Book of Quotations","review":"Amazon has it a bit wrong on this page, as Joseph Epstein wrote the foreword and not the book. This excellent work is edited by Fred R. Shapiro, who also wrote,The Oxford Dictionary of American Legal Quotations. Mr. Shapiro is an associate librarian and lecturer in legal research at the Yale Law School library.Quotes can be elusive buggers with attributions mistakenly attached to numerous celebrity names and quote books have a reputation of not always being accurate or reporting sources (right or wrong). The Yale Book of Quotations seeks to change that by tracing quotes back to their original source. It took a number of years, a lot of digging through databases, paging through old books and newspapers, and contributions from a dedicated bunch of researchers to make this happen.Fred R. Shapiro'sThe Yale Book of Quotationsis highly accurate and very useful for people trying to find out who was the first to say what, so if you need to spice up that speech with a couple of useful quotes, or just impress your friends with your quote trivia ability, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Yale Book of Quotations","review":"It is my strong belief that any person, in any profession, can benefit from a well placed quote or two. I purchased this book because good quotes are often overused and poorly sourced, and a good source of strong quotations can be invaluable.I was pretty disappointed with the book once I got it. The emphasis seems to be on determining the exact wording and true original source of the quote: Very important details indeed, but accurate boring quotes are still boring quotes. The Yale Book of Quotations seems to have missed the point. Often we want to motivate, prove a point, or illustrate an idea with the use of quotations, and this utility of quotes should have been the primary focus.I find the book to be only 1/2 as useful as I had hoped (deciding between 2 and 3 stars was tough). When I think of the hours spent by researchers and collaborators to find an original source, my mouse creeps toward the middle star. When I think about the full page dedicated to Mick Jagger and Keith Richards quotes, which are, in fact, all excerpts from original sources that are available today (you guessed it, Rolling Stones albums), my pointer jumps sharply to the left.Its not a bad book, just not what I expected. Not as useful, not as interesting. So don't make the mistake I did, and find out what this book offers before you make the purchase."},{"Title":"The Yale Book of Quotations","review":"During the past 25-30 years, I have purchased and then made frequent use of dozens of anthologies of quotations (including revised and updated editions of Bartlett and Oxford) and consider The Yale Book of Quotations the most entertaining and enlightening of them all. As editor Fred R. Shapiro duly acknowledges, he had the substantial benefit of state-of-the-art research methods and resources that were not available to his earlier counterparts and thus was able to trace more thoroughly the origins of quotations he selected. Correct attribution is especially important to those who are, as Joseph Epstein characterizes them in the Foreword, \\"highly quotatious.\\" Here several such corrections. \\"We are like dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants\\"(Bernard Chartres, not Isaac Newton), \\"War is hell!\\" (Napoleon, not William Tecumseh Sherman), and \\"Murphy's Law\\" (George Orwell, not Edward A. Murphy, Jr.) Shapiro also includes a number quotations not found in previous anthologies. For example, \\"Whatever does not kill me makes me stronger\\"(Friedrich Nietzsche) and \\"Live Fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" (William Motley). The 12,000 quotations are arranged in alphabetical order by author, with source and date of origin cited.I especially appreciate Shapiro's provision of 200 memorable \\"Film Lines\\" (Pages 258-269) that include some of my personal favorites. For example:Adam Cook (Oscar Levant) in An American in Paris (1951):\\"[My face is not] a pretty face, I grant you, but underneath its flabby exterior is an enormous lack of character.\\"General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) in Dr. Strangelove (1964): \\"Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed. But I do say no more than ten to twenty million people killed, tops, depending on the breaks.\\"Captain (Strother Martin) in Cool Hand Luke (1967): \\"What we've got here is failure to communicate.\\"Dr. Moreau (Charles Laughton) in Island of Lost Souls (1933): \\"[The natives] are restless tonight.\\"Howard Beale (Peter Finch) in Network (1976): \\"I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell \`I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!'\\"Harry Lime (Orson Welles) in The Third Man (1949): \\"In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed - they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy, and peace and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.\\"This is an anthology to be kept near at hand, perhaps on a coffee table, and will encourage and generously reward occasional browsing.

The attitude we adopt toward the Arab minority will provide the real test of our moral standards as a people.\\" Albert Einstein (1955)\\"You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance, and Germany doesn't want to go to war.\\" Chris Rock (quoted in Calgary Sun in 2003)\\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.\\" Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891)Using meticulous research to trace quotations to their original sources, Fred R. Shapiro was able to determine the validity of a claim such as Yogi Berra's, \\"I really didn't say everything I said.\\" He probably didn't make all the statements attributed to him but he did make that claim, Shapiro confirms, during an interview by Sports Illustrated in 1986. Shapiro will gratefully welcome corrections of information provided in this volume as well as suggestions of new quotations for future editions.

C. Fields, Dorothy Parker and Oscar and Sappho, Paine and Plato and Johnny Rotten, as well as that mother of invention, Anonymous. (See \\"Political Slogans.\\")The heroic Fred R.

Again and again this freshly researched compendium reveals the earliest source and precise wording of many a modern catchphrase. Did Nietzsche actually assert that, \\"Whatever does not kill me makes me stronger\\"? If Voltaire didn't claim, \\"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it\\"---and he didn't---who did? The ingenious Keyword Index enables you to find out.

Thumbnail photos gladden many entries (the one of Mae West will startle most readers), and a characteristically sparkish foreword by editor and essayist Joseph Epstein only adds to \\"value for money.\\" In \\"Wuthering Heights\\" Merle Oberon cries, \\"Bring me back the world!\\" (See \\"Film Lines.\\") Ladies and gentlemen and others, here it is."},{"Title":"The Yale Book of Quotations","review":"I am not finished reading--it's hard to know what finished would be--but I am sure this work deserves the full five stars. I started reading it straight through, but kept getting delightfully sidetracked, remembering another quotation, like an old acquaintance. The editors have done a tremendous amount of research, especially in tracking down many early attestations, especially for modern American texts.This is such a solid reference book that it can't hurt to note that there is no Platonic ideal collection. Though what's included is massive and well-selected, part of the fun is to see what is absent too. Sure, I recall Jimmy Durante saying \\"I got a million of 'em\\" (included), but I found his \\"Everybody wants to get into the act\\" (not included*) at least as quotable.[*Correction: The quotation _is_ included, though not under Durante but under Radio Catchphrases; I could have found it in the keyword index--which could be improved--but assumed it would appear under Durante; and I heard it on TV; in any case, a cross-reference at Durante would have been helpful.]Though the front matter clearly delineates the format, one could question omitting known political speech writers credit in political quotations, for example, in Agnew's unhappy phrase \\"nattering nabobs of negativism.\\" William Safire will be not amused. Oh well. Was the single Loyola quote representative? The evidence for attributing \\"damned lies, and statistics\\" to Disraeli, rather than Courtney or another, seems to me rather questionable. For example, YBQ cites a 1895 statement of a letter writer who thought Disraeli said it; but in a 1894 book Price Collier attributed the saying to Walter Bagehot. {Later research showed that Charles W. Dilke [1843-1911] used the saying in 1891; and it is attributed to Dilke by one who knew him.)Absent: \\"the whole nine yards.\\" This appeared in Vietnam GI slang in 1966. By then \\"Montagnards\\" were slangily called \\"'yards.\\" In 1966 Navy Chaplain and anthropologist R. Mole published a book on Nine Tribes of Montagnards in I Corps area (the north of South Vietnam). To get all of them as allies, perhaps, gave rise to the phrase for the full compliment, the whole nine yards. But there is admittedly no consensus on this yet. [Update July, 2007: In 1942 Admiral Land used the words \\"the whole nine yards\\" in testimony at a Senate Defense hearing on a rapid increase in shipbuilding at nine new shipyards; that may be the literal origin of the later, metaphoric phrase.][Update July 2012: \\"the whole nine-yards\\" has now been found in a 1956 publication, nearer to the WW II Liberty Ship unprecedentedly-productive nine shipyards]As Saul Lieberman reportedly said in introducing G. Scholem's lectures on Kabbalah, \\"Nonsense is nonsense, but the study of nonsense is scholarship.\\" (Though other tradents report that he said \\"history,\\" not \\"study.\\")In any case, this is a fine reference work. [An example of the flawed index: \\"Murphy's Law,\\" \\"Anything that can go wrong...\\" (and variants, listed in \\"Modern Proverbs\\" on p. 529) is not indexed either under \\"Murphy\\" or \\"wrong.\\"--something went wrong.]"},{"Title":"The Yale Book of Quotations","review":"This is an outstanding collection of quotations, with a strong emphasis on today as well as yesteryear. The approach is fresh. While the book includes the familar standards (Churchill, Shakespeare, Kennedy...) it expands its scope to include pop-icons (e.g., memorable lines from television, theater, movies, even comic strip and cartoon characters). Quotes are arranged by author and, within, in chronological order. The back of the book provides an exhaustive \\"keyword index\\" for readers seeking quotes on a particular topic. The presentation is very clean, easily readable. A nice feature, each quote is in context (where and when said) and accompanied by citations to similar sayings (e.g., the phrase \\"iron curtain\\" is usually attributed to Winston Churchill in a speech at Fulton, MO in May 1945, but was uttered by Joseph Goebbels (of all people) in the same context the February before.) Unlike ponderous references so familiar, The Yale Book of Quotations is actually fun to read, a few \\"authors\\" at a time.

But, getting ready to deliver a new speech, I now have the desire to pepper it with entertaining quotations, to illustrate my points.To do so, one can go off of one's memory, but, as Joseph Epstein points out in his witty introduction, one will miss the mark: the quote and the attribution will most likely be wrong. So much for illustrating one's point!Still, what I like most about this book is the sheer entertainment value. I keep it next to me on my desk, and, in a free moment, I would rather graze through it than surf the Internet.The quotes are obviously weighted towards American authors and pop culture icons of the last 50 years. It includes famous lines in films, advertising and music culture. The chances that your quotation will hit the mark with your audience are greater with this book.One note of caution: you shouldn't read this book looking for an author's most literate quote. The purpose of the book is to provide the most famous quote and nail down the attribution. Nevertheless, that shouldn't prevent you from deriving immense pleasure from just reading the book from page 1 to 851."},{"Title":"The Yale Book of Quotations","review":"What is a 'quotation'?It is something which someone has said which has been repeated so often so as to in effect become part of the collective consciousness. It is a 'saying' which has become 'immortal' at least for the foreseeable future.The YBQ seems to understand however that the foreseeable future is not forever and so reduces the space it gives to pre- modern quotations and adds more from contemporary American life. It includes less matter than its ertswhile predecessor the 'Oxford Dictionary of Quotations' but provides more spice and story. It too uses the most modern of electronic means in hunting down the ' true source' of its quotations. It for instance will not rest content with attributing Henry Kissinger the well- known quotation 'Academic politics is so bitter, because the stakes are so low' but traces it back to a Columbia University political - scientist Wallace S. Sayre who reportedly repeatedly said this in the early 1950's. Editor Shapiro seems to take special interest in providing carefully researched attributions for the quotations.All in all works like this are an unending source of 'dipping in' reading. Like the Talmudic sea there is no end to them and one can begin anywhere get lost in the middle and remain there for an unreasonable period of time.There is no end to the next interesting thing which may come up anywhere.One of course will always find no matter how comprehensive a 'missed quotation' from an author one especially favors.I would only say that with the rise of the 'Internet Culture' and with so many millions of people making their gems of wisdom available to the worldwide readership that perhaps a corollary to Warhol's famous five minutes of fame for everyone should be instituted in the next great quotation work. That one should be one in which each human being is given a chance to contribute their own favorite gem to the world.A signature- sentence or sound- bite for each 'MySpace' sounder- off.In the meantime however the 'Yale Book of Quotations' is a tremendous treasure of memorable sayings which no doubt will be much mulled, and highly enjoyed by its readers."},{"Title":"The Yale Book of Quotations","review":"This book is great!

The title alone spoke to me (and most of the women I know). With it's common-sense, Christ-centered approach to living, THE WORN OUT WOMAN gives practical advice on slowing down and regaining control.I love that the book is 'interactive' with many suggestions on things to do and a reading/study guide for each chapter. This is the type of book you want to get for every woman you know who is doing too much and being all things to everybody -- and slowly killing her soul in the process!I'm going to lead a discussion group on the book because I know so many women who can relate. WE ARE TIRED and looking for a better way! God Bless the authors for bringing it to the forefront and summing it up with one of the most appropriate titles I've seen in a long time."},{"Title":"The Worn Out Woman: When Life is Full and Your Spirit is Empty","review":"Dr. Steve Stephens and I have had a tremendous response to this book. At one of the seminars where we spoke, one lady came up with dozens of red, yellow, and green tabs poking out from the pages. She explained, &quot;The red tabs mean I need to take action on these ideas right away. The yellows will be next and the green I can get to more leisurely.&quot; Thelma Wells, National Speaker for Women of Faith, writes, &quot;Years of research, counseling, and success are jam-packed in this practical, powerful book.&quot; Bestselling author Liz Curtis Higgs wrote, &quot;Just reading it gave me a sense of peace and the gentle assurance that I CAN make some positive, healthy changes in my too-busy lifestyle.&quot; Elisa Morgan, President of MOPS International writes, &quot;Ahh...at last--a pathway out of the insanity!&quot;If you are interested in working through the book with a friend or in a group, there is guide in the back of the book. There are fun ideas to try at the end of each chapter. Because we know women are busy (why else would they be feeling worn out?), we've kept the chapters short and practical.There's three kinds of clutter in your life...schedule clutter, space clutter, and soul clutter. The book covers them all. (There's even a chapter on how to get a better night's sleep). Dr. Steve and I have found, a woman cannot unclutter her life until she unclutters her heart.

The ideas she shared from her book were so practical and necessary for every worn out woman out there in the world! It was as if she was speaking directly to me when she described what a worn out woman is and how I got this way. After hearing her speak I just knew that this book was something special and I bought a copy. This book is truly inspiring and a must read if you want to break free of being overwhelmed, stressed, tired and just plain worn out."},{"Title":"The Worn Out Woman: When Life is Full and Your Spirit is Empty","review":"So much of the advice given in this book is stuff I've heard or learned on my own over the years. You'd think that would make this a 1 star book but nothing could be further from the truth. The way the authors write and share information is very uplifting and motivational. They remind us of what we already know but simply ignore and they give us \\"the okay\\" to slow down and really get real with ourselves. I, for one, really needed this book. I've been on overload for awhile and though I knew it was time to slow down, I just coudn't get myself to do it. I'd slow down in one area only to pick up something in another area. I've read this book twice, in two weeks, and I have already begun to implement much of the advice. My hope is that by answering all the questions in the book, and being real honest, I'll be able to stick to the changes and live a much happier and less stressed life. I'd recommend this book to home business owners everywhere--we women put far too much on our own shoulders and it's time to lighten the load."},{"Title":"The Worn Out Woman: When Life is Full and Your Spirit is Empty","review":"Every woman who feels worn thin by life should read this book!

McCarthy and the Senate","review":"The main idea of the book is that McCarthyism was a product of McCarthy and the Republican Party, which tried to regain power by claiming to be the gang who would save the country from the communists. The republicans went along with the extremes of the demagogue, showing that their level of civility was no better than McCarthy. The result was an orgy of destructive behavior that caused immense harm to the United States. One of Senator McCarthy's main venues for his campaign was an investigation by a senate committee. If they were looking for spies it is unlikely that a committee could have found anything that Mr. Hoover had not already discovered. The main purpose of these committees was to get headlines and set people up for perjury convictions.Today there are many mini-McCarthys on radio and television but fortunately they do not have the power of subpoena or the ability to require testimony under oath to set up the perjury trap.The evils of McCarthyism like movements are going to continue in this country. This book may be of help in preventing them from doing more harm."},{"Title":"Greek grammar (A Blaisdell book in the humanities)","review":"Like the reviewer below, it took me some time to get the hang of using this book--and I agree also that it was worth the effort. _Greek Grammar_ is not a textbook, and it is definitely not a good place to start if you are teaching yourself. Like other nineteenth-century grammars (Gildersleeve's Latin grammar, for example, also highly recommended), this work starts from the assumption that you already know the basics. Once you've got a fair grounding in accidence (inflections, etc.) and can read a little prose, however, you are bound to start wondering &quot;why&quot; about all those rules. That's where Goodwin comes in. Thorough, systematic, carefully cross-referenced with plenty of examples (all translated), this is a veritable encyclopedia of classical Greek. It demands careful study, but it repays you for it handsomely. The only two provisos I have are that the print is very fine and may be hard on tired eyes, and that some of the terminology may differ from that used in modern texts (e.g., Gavin &amp; Betts &quot;strong aorist&quot; vs. Goodwin &quot;2nd aorist&quot;). I bought my copy when I was just starting Greek, and it sat on my shelf untouched for over a year. Now, however, I use it all the time."},{"Title":"Greek grammar (A Blaisdell book in the humanities)","review":"When I first tried to work through Goodwin's Grammar in learning ancient Greek, I was astounded at the sheer impenetrability of his system. It took me at least two weeks to find the verb &quot;to be&quot;! But once you get the hang of it, there's nothing like it for systematicity, thoroughness, and detail. Next to the LSJ lexicon, it's the most important volume for any student of classical Greek."},{"Title":"Greek grammar (A Blaisdell book in the humanities)","review":"There is a new reprint of Goodwin's original version.A Greek GrammarMy question is why did they not reprint this newer edition? I now own both books. A quick over view suggest the the 'Goodwin and Gulick' edition may be better than the original.I have not compared these books in great detail, but I would at this point recommend buying a good used copy of this edition first. It is cheaper, it is more up to date (albeit still circa 1930, it is hardcover in a nice binding, and it has a type set and lay-out, which is a bit more user friendly. Also, if you decide to buy the reprint of the 'Goodwin' grammar, buy the Macmillian press edition. I own a 1963 hardcover edition, it has a great binding and is much better than the the new soft cover I bought for my friend; the contents are exactly the same."},{"Title":"Greek grammar (A Blaisdell book in the humanities)","review":"As I tend to shy away from Grammar;and this book doeshave an air of rigor;it sat on the shelf for quite some time.Also,I am primarily interested in Biblical Greek;the socalled \\"crappy greek\\". However,I can handle a little Aristophoneset al from time to time.At any rate,the book found it's way into my hands and Idecided to roll with it. Allowing for several breaks in order tofreshen up the mind and eyesight;I was able to patiently workmy way through it.This book is based on the Attic dialect with plenty examplesof the others. This authoritative,compact book has:breadth,depth,and mass.Most of the time you will find clarification of definitionsand concepts when you most need them-as you are reading along.In addition,this book is thorouhly annotated and indexed-virtualyself referencing. There is something to be said for 19th centuryscholasticism.This 451 page book is divided into five main sections(witha lot of little sections). They are: Part 1 - Letters,Syllables,and Accents Part 2 - Inflection Part 3 - Formation of WordsPart 4 - Syntax Part 5 - is a brief treatment of Versification.The Author does not call upon you to worship at his Altar;but rather,intends to make this difficult subject accessible tothose who are willing to make the effort and take the time. Also,makes for an excellent general reference.Whatever works for you. Although,I still don't find theGrammar aspect of language overly exciting;for those who want to increase thier understanding and appreciation of Greek-this onewill do it.This book suits my purposes well-it's a keeper."},{"Title":"Xylophone Rags of George Hamilton Green","review":"These are fun xylophone standards to play. I play these on my marimba with hardish yarn mallets and it sounds fine. The range of the music is of course only about 3.5ish octaves, so it will fit on most instruments. Don't be fooled by the preview, there are full size sheets of xylophone-only music included. The print size is fine and easy to read. each solo is 2 pages I believe, but you are supposed to repeat sections like crazy. All of these sound good and contain the obligatory sections expected of ragtime music.I wouldn't consider this appropriate background music to perform at a function, though, it is a little too attention grabbing. All the pieces are two mallet, but technically not too difficult. The only difficulty lies in getting them up to the recommeneded tempos, but I think most people would never know if you were only playing at 3/4 speed."},{"Title":"Xylophone Rags of George Hamilton Green","review":"There are a lot of complicated songs in this book.

Thank you"},{"Title":"Between Craft and Science: Technical Work in the United States (Collection on Technology and Work)","review":"This book provides a fascinating view of how people really work and learn. The book is based on a series of ethnographical studies of different technical professions; for instance, software support people and emergency medical technicians. The main gist of the book is that there is a gap between work practice and theory: work practice is filled with disjunctures, ironies, and ambiguities whereas work theory resembles a sterile ideal type."},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes: Great Lakes Ghost Stories, Superstitions and Sea Serpents","review":"This book is an amazing array of compiled stories which tell the eerie history of the Great Lakes. More than just a list of ghost stories, it gives us an insight into those who spent their lives (and often risked them) on the ships that have plied the lakes over the years. The story of the Hudson in particular is not one to be read before bedtime; it leaves one wondering just who or what controls the forces of the lakes, and how and why a calm great lake can instantaneously turn into a raging torrent. Stonehouse should be congratulated on the background research and variety of stories that go into the text. All in all, a very satisfying read."},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes: Great Lakes Ghost Stories, Superstitions and Sea Serpents","review":"Since the days when the fear-producing words &quot;Here be Dragons&quot; were inscribed on ancient maps, the lure of the invisible has drawn men to the water with their ships. The Great Lakes, seven of them if you include Lake Champlain, along the New York-Vermont border, (and Lake St. Clair, between Lakes Huron and Erie) are no strangers to the unseen.Frederick Stonehouse, a noted scholar and author of thirteen prior books about the Great Lakes and their maritime history, encountered tales of the paranormal throughout his years of research. Nonplussed by them, he tucked them away. In his preface, he confesses to 'not knowing exactly what to do with these stories'. Eventually, however, there were so many of them, he began to look at them with a different eye. He found that they assumed credibility because the people who told the tales believed so strongly in them. Beginning with the Gibralter Point Light on Lake Ontario in Toronto, one of the oldest lighthouses on the Lakes, right up to yesterday, when the author himself experienced -- something -- you'll be fascinated with this book, and its many illustrations, glossary, bibliography, index, and the thoroughly enjoyable appendix.Tales such as the captain who continued to be a part of the crew on his beloved ship, and who saved it from certain disaster, to the list of boats carrying the same name -- Ontario, or a variant thereof -- all of whom went down in a five day span in October, 1874. Superstitions abound -- a Friday departure spelled certain disaster, for instance, as did cats, blasphemy, whistling, or women on board. It must be stated, however, that many of the disasters cited here occurred during the 1800s and early 1900s, primarily in the days of wooden ships.However, steel hulls and electronics cannot guarantee safe journeys, either, as in the case of the Edmund Fitzgerald. During the launch, several events happened which, one hundred years earlier, would have labelled the ship a certain jinx. Modern science has pretty much put that idea to rest, and in recent years, divers and scientists have come up with possible scenarios to explain the sudden disappearance of the ore-hauler in the storm of November 10, 1975. What they can't explain however, are the oddities surrounding succeeding events, all involved to some degree with the Fitzgerald. For instance, the wardroom bell falling off the wall of the Canadian submarine tender, Cormorant, the ship sent to rescue the Fitzgerald's bell and bring it to the surface, where it is to be part of a memorial to the sunken ship and her crew, all of whom went down with her. The Cormorant's captain said, &quot;It's never fallen before, and we've been through 30-foot seas with it!&quot; Haunted lighthouses, superstitions, ghost ships, ship board and underwater ghosts, lakeside spirits, sea serpents and other creatures, and messages from beyond are the sections of the book. The oldest ghost ship is the Griffon, from 1679, and the Sieur de La Salle, which left Green Bay on September18 of that year bound for Niagara, and was never heard from again. The old-timers call this sailing off 'into a crack in the lake', and literally hundreds of ships have taken such a voyage in the years since the Griffon. Haunted Lakes is an enjoyable look at a variety of unexplained, miscellaneous phenomena, such as ghosts (of ships and other creatures, including lighthouses); sea serpents and other mostly unseen things. It's a fascinating look at the ever-present subject of ghoulies and ghosties and other things that go bump -- or splash -- in the night. There's even a ghost horse! True. Louie by name, the poor creature was abandoned on what was then called Yeo Island in Georgian Bay, after being shipwrecked in 1828. His owner promised to rescue him, but for a multitude of reasons, didn't. So many mariners told of seeing the ghostly white horse, still waiting patiently, the island eventually became known as Horse Island.This is not the scariest book you'll ever read, but on a cold, dark and windy night, when you're all alone -- perhaps another book would be a wiser choice. This one is a dandy companion for a nice, bright sunny day -- preferably beside a calm, peaceful lake."},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes: Great Lakes Ghost Stories, Superstitions and Sea Serpents","review":"Stonehouse provides a fun book that delivers what it promises: legendary tales and ghost stories centered around the Great Lakes. Stonehouse doesn't attempt to prove or debunk any of these stories, and nor should he. He's just trying to put on the record some of the tales that make the rounds. This is a good collection and each story is told well. The Great Lakes are imposing and mysterious at times, which this book captures."},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes: Great Lakes Ghost Stories, Superstitions and Sea Serpents","review":"Page after page of haunted lighthouses, haunted ships, haunted shores, ghost ships, ghost lights, sea serpents, lake monsters, sunken ships, talking ships, missing ships, messages in bottles and other mysteries. At 198 pages there are tons of tales but not much in the way of details - names have been changed or withheld, there are few dates and many of the stories have no endnotes. In other words, they have no written sources, but are based on oral stories, myths, passed down from sailor to sailor. Reading this book is like having a light meal - it tastes good but afterwards you want more. Lucky for us, there is in fact a Haunted Lakes II by the same author."},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes: Great Lakes Ghost Stories, Superstitions and Sea Serpents","review":"Once I started to read this book I had to keep on reading until my eyes are so tired. Thanks to Mr. Stonehouse, I am once again loving history of these great ship wrecks .. Mr. Stonehouse sure dug up a lot of interesting stories. Some of them I just find them to be funny and some of them got my heart racing for more. I am hoping Mr. Stonehouse dont stop writing stories of Haunted Lakes. I just know there are many more ghost stories of the Great Lakes that needed yet to be told . yes, I have also read Haunted Lakes II"},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes: Great Lakes Ghost Stories, Superstitions and Sea Serpents","review":"Haunted Lakes is a book that you want to read because you are looking for a collection of good ghost stories and you want to be entertained. This book is not a scientific analysis of the supernatural. Unlike the book Lost At Sea, Stonehouse tells the stories in an entertaining way and then moves on. He doesn't take a lot of time trying to prove or disprove the authenticity of the story. Determination of authenticity is left to the reader.The book is set up so each chapter includes several stories from around the Great Lakes region. The chapters include collections of stories on lighthouses, ghost ships, sea creatures, hoodoo ships, and sailor's superstitions just to name a few. The stories are layed out in a sensable manner within these chapters. Each story is short and to the point so if you are not interested in a particular story, a new story is at most a couple pages away.I can't say enough about the author's story telling ability. Many authors try to give a very dramatic account of a story and in the process they bog the story down with too much fluff. This is not the case in Haunted Lakes. The author refrains from distracting flowery writing. He lets the stories provide their own drama.If you are looking for a light reading book that you can pick up and put down at will, read this book. If you are looking to prove or disprove supernatural events, don't read this book read Lost At Sea. Stonehouse provides an entertaining collection of ghost stories that is ment to be taken lightly. Grab this book, fire up your imagination and enjoy. If you like it, there is a part two also available."},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes: Great Lakes Ghost Stories, Superstitions and Sea Serpents","review":"While Stonehouse is an accredited Great Lakes scholar, Haunted Lakes Part II is a complete and total waste of paper. It is nothing but Volume One with a few extra chapters thrown in."},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes: Great Lakes Ghost Stories, Superstitions and Sea Serpents","review":"Historian Fred Stonehouse continues his shift toward more commercially successful books with the Haunted Lakes series. Unlike Stonehouse's previous books, which represented significant contributions to the Great Lakes maritime history genre, Haunted Lakes sacrifices historical value for commercial appeal. Stonehouse has admittedly created a book of tall tales, which is sure to introduce him to a wider audience, but I can't help but long for his previous works, which, although dry, were interesting and valuable references. I can only hope that future volumes don't speculate that the Fitz was sunk by a UFO.I still found Haunted Lakes very entertaining, but after a while some of the stories began to sound contrived."},{"Title":"Haunted Lakes: Great Lakes Ghost Stories, Superstitions and Sea Serpents","review":"This book was a great read and shead light on several things about the Great Lakes I never knew.

However, the thought provoking questions and exercises, take some time and allows one to view her life as is and how she would like it to be. The self-affirmations are excellent, because many people do not know what or how to say them. The survival kits provide good practical ideas of what a person should do if she is going through a bad time or has negative feelings. The inserted graphics, developed for the young person, with or without text are colorful and interesting . Vanzant also makes several interesting points about the role the Creator should play in a young woman's life. I feel that the book is valuable for any woman.

It digs deep into the history of Portugal, even before Portugal, and Lusitania (the Roman province where most of Portugal is now), and discusses treasures like the recently found cave drawings of the Coa valley in the Douro. It also has other interesting features like a chapter on music and one on birds. There is one on wine too. This is a serious work that also makes good beach or bedtime reading. It is something to be thankful for at a time when a lot is being published on Portugal, but the quality varies. I have read some amateurish books on Portuguese language life and culture and World cultures Portugal. After that experience, it is refreshing to have something you feel is a competent work like Livermore's traveller's history.

Ms. Unger's thoughts flowed, drawing the reader into Ridley's world and making that world so real. Using the literary device of telling the story in the first perosn and \\"talking\\" directly to her readers, Ms. Unger enables the reader to understand Ridley, to feel her happiness, her confusion, her fear, and her despair. The characters and their actions, even their motives, are so realistic and believable.I was so enthralled by the story that I read this book in one day, staying up until 2:00 am to read despite being exhausted. I had to know the outcome. (The first chapter leaves the reader wanting those answers!)I predict that this book will be a best seller. It could be listed in several genres: drama, mystery, and suspense. It is an excellent read, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to be entertained, or to those who want a \\"thought-provoking\\" experience.This book is a definite \\"steal\\" at $.79. Grab it now because the price will definitely be going up!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I am half-way through this book and have pulled out my magnifying glass in search of the \\"suspense\\", \\"plot twists\\", and \\"gripping story\\". The only 'thrill' in this book so far is the one between the sheets for the heroine and her 'Harlequinesque' romantic interest. The critical reviews of this book are misleading. This book is nothing but an adolescent, chick-lit, Harlequin Romance novel with the usual predictable superficial characters. In my opinion, the only reviews worth a pinch of salt are:\\"Her engaging narrative wins us over\\"\\"... a likable chatty heroine..\\"Every other review is utter tripe and a marketing gimmick to entice people to purchase in the Thriller genre! It is anything but a thriller, and I mean anything because I don't think the author is even quite sure where to go with the plot line.I liked the author's style of writing and I don't think it is badly written, nor a bad story. It really is not the author's fault that I am giving it a two star. It is the publisher's and the critical reviewers.I would not have bought this book if it were shelved in Harlequin Romance, nor Young Adults, or some chick-lit mystery! But that's where it belongs. That is not my interest.Instead I was conned into buying a suspense/thriller... and it is nothing of the sort.On the plus side, though, and to the author's credit, I will continue to the end because she writes very well and I like her narrative description. Long-winded albeit, unproductive in as far as it advances the hokey plot, but enjoyable reading all the same.Too bad about the marketing con, though! I am entirely convinced now that they are not to be believed - not even the \\"so-called\\" bestseller lists. My first stop will be the readers reviews, and not those 5-star reviews either - they are usually nothing more than a synopsis of the story line and some friend review."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Lisa Unger is a wonderful new author.

During her fifteen minutes of fame she does various news shows and is featured in all the local papers, little does she know just how her newfound fame will upturn her entire life. Soon after saving the boy Ridely receives a cryptic note asking if she is the senders daughter. However, being that to her knowledge she was not adopted Ridely does not take the note too seriously, but upon further digging Ridley soon finds that some secrets are better left buried.'BEAUTIFUL LIES' is a must read thriller for any true fan of the genre and Unger is a fresh voice to look out for."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Really enjoyed this well-constructed thriller which I read in nearly one sitting while on vacation and noticed several others on the plane reading it too. The POV is from the perspective of an intelligent, independent woman thrown into a situation forcing her to question everything about her childhood and family. The plot is revealed gradually in stages, and while not every development is totally shocking, the general suspense level is high and the pace is brisk. Her take on NYC was very authentic and characters well-drawn, particularly her family. Almost like a DeMille/Lee Child/Nora Roberts mash-up largely set on the scenic Lower East Side and environs. Look forward to her future offerings!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Lisa Unger's first novel is a success of the highest magnitude. The storyline is an oldie but goodie; a series of events have led the narrator to reevaluate her identity. Is she who she thinks she is, or is she someone else?Ridley Jones is the narrator, and her personality comes shining through via the writing. As she navigates the precarious twists and turns her quest takes her on, there are action scenes aplenty, humor, realistic dialogue, and enough eroticism to keep most anyone happy.This book kept me guessing all the way to the end, and I give Unger's debut a five-star salute."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Ridley Jones is a freelance writer who, at the beginning of this well crafted thriller, finds herself trapped inexplicably in the basement of a derelict building in lower Manhattan pursued by a group of men who want to do her harm. She has six bullets left in her gun and they are coming to get her. How she landed herself in this improbable predicament is the essence of this suspense thriller as we travel back to the time when Ridley becomes a national celebrity for saving a young child from being hit by a truck. With her face posted everywhere, someone contacts her claiming that she is his daughter. As Ridley questions her past, she realizes her whole life has been a lie.Lisa Unger (formerly Lisa Miscione) is a very talented storyteller. She has an innate ability to create some strong female heroines. Ridley is a remarkably ordinary person forced into extraordinary circumstances beyond her control. The plot itself is quite riveting and I could not put the book down over the course of the single day it was read. The problem is that the book is overwritten. There are excessive descriptions with some that are quite clumsy. (\\"There was something ugly about his face. There was a cold meanness to his aura.\\") Other descriptions are pointless such as the depictions of daily minutia. (Do we really need to know she ordered a coffee and pastry while passing through a Barnes and Noble?) This bulks up the book unnecessarily and slows down the plot. Yet, Lisa Unger tells such a compelling tale that all the excessives can be forgiven."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"There were moments when this book was a page-turner but the author kept getting in the way too much. I really don't like being addressed as \\"you\\" by a cheeky NewYorker especially when I'm being lectured to about how \\"life is about choices\\" or some other cliches. The plot was an interesting one but unravels in the second part of the book with some very unconvincing events. Also, the author didn't know when to end the book -- editors could have cut out about the last 50 pages. I kept waiting for an unanticipated twist at the end. For all the build up, the book just peters out. Disappointing."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Book Club ReviewBeautiful LiesLisa Unger(2 1/2 stars)Our book club's book for February was BEAUTIFUL LIES, by Lisa Unger. Now, there is an interesting story behind how we chose this book.As a group we have been disappointed by later books in series we've read (for example, by M.C. Beaton, Sue Grafton, Nevada Barr, and others). So we decided this time around that we were going to pick an author we've been wanting to read but NOT choose his or her most recent book, but rather the first book in the series or by that author, so that we would have that sense of \\"freshness.\\"So, that said, a lot of us have heard good things about Lisa Unger, so we decided to start with her first book, and BEAUTIFUL LIES is it.The story takes place in New York City, where freelance writer Ridley Jones (who lives a quiet, not super-exciting life) saves a child from being hit by a car in Manhattan. The press coverage makes her face recognizable in the media, and that's where the trouble begins. A man emerges from nowhere, saying he is her father - not the man who raised her in suburban New Jersey, a respected doctor.In the meantime, a mysterious stranger moves in upstairs from her in her rickety east side apartment (she lives above a pizzeria), and he starts enmeshing himself in her life a little too aggressively. She starts falling for him, and together they start trying to unravel the mystery of her past. But Ridley never quite knows whether he's truly in love with her or just using her for his own (undisclosed) purposes.As a group, we had mixed reactions to this book. For the first hundred pages or so, it is a fast and intriguing read. Then it starts to get annoying. The narrator is constantly interrupting her story to talk directly to the reader (\\"Let me ask you, reader, how you would have felt in this set of circumstances\\"), a device that some of us were OK with and that some of us found extremely offputting. Then she starts crying on every other page, turning herself from a somewhat strong and independent woman into a whiny, crying complainer - not something that is particularly enjoyable to read. THEN, to make matters worse, she starts doing really, really stupid things - like agreeing to meet a total stranger on the edges of Van Cortland Park (in the Bronx) in the middle of the night, by herself. Huh? Ridley lost a lot of us at that point, and she never got us back.Finally, there are several plot points that aren't resolved. I understand that they are resolved in the sequel, but few of us expressed a desire to read it.So, our verdict as a group who hadn't read any Lisa Unger before - We know she's supposed to be good, but maybe she's one of those people (unlike M.C. Beaton) who got better as she went along. About half of us gave the book a thumbs up (if not an enthusiastic thumbs up) and half give it a thumbs down. Sad to say, those who gave it the thumbs down were turned off and won't read more Unger. I personally would give her another chance because I think she's a good writer, but probably not for a while.By the way, this discussion led us into interesting discussions of what turns us off (i.e., sets us against reading an author again) and what opens up our mind (i.e., makes us want to read more by the author or give the author a second chance). We decided that whiny, annoying characters set us against an author's later books, or if we read a later book in a series, the sense that the book has been \\"phoned in\\" ends up being a deal breaker. On the other hand, if we don't particularly care for a plot but feel that the author has created good characters and is a good writer, we will give her a second chance to win us over."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"If the concept of the author was to create a main character who is stupid and irritating all at the same time then she has succeeded beyond her wildest dreams.So if that is what you are looking for in a mystery, you should get this book, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I'm of a mixed mind as to how to rate this book. The story line did capture my interest and I kept turning pages because I did want to see where Ridley Jones would take me in her extraordinary journey. The story premise was inventive, although I did figure things out well in advance of the author's exposition of the big mystery. By the time I read about it, it was more like, \\"Well, yeah, no kidding.\\"The heroine is a blend of level-headed and steady, but with a clearly shallow take on Jake, her love interest. A few too many descriptions of his \\"ripped\\" physique wore me down. Her love for her brother, Ace, described as \\"mythic,\\" was not comprehensible. It's hard to get past Ridley as fairly one-dimensional and uninsightful, in spite of a fair bit of sermonizing on the wisdom of the universe and truisms according to Ridley. No heroine is perfect, though, and you just have to forgive some of it.There was repetition of description - \\"aroma\\" kept catching my eye, and 47 instances of the word \\"choice\\" used as in the \\"you have to make a choice.\\" I felt beaten over the head by it. And on the topic of description, there was way too much narrative and recollection. I would much prefer to see a scene and infer the message than to be told over and over how people are, what they think and why. There were also a couple of POV shifts that caught me.Most grating of all, though, was the constant shift to talking to the reader. There were countless instances of this, and each time, I was reminded that I was reading instead of getting lost in the story. I don't want to be talked to by the author.As a first novel, it ain't bad, but it could have used a lot more editing. The beginning was disjointed and frustrating, and the ending went on interminably. Just when I though we were done, I turned the page and there was another chapter. To be fair, there was one really nice surprise in the book that was nicely handled and pleasing. So all in all, I'd rate this book as 2 stars."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Like several other readers I picked this book up when the Kindle price dropped to the bargain price of 79cents and I just got around to reading it this week.OMG, I am totally declaring this book to be my most awesome deal of the year.

I mean, who amongst us hasn't at one time or another suspected we are adopted because (sorry Mom) there is no way we can share genetics with all those other people.Second, awesome suspense that left me on the edge of my - well pillow since I was mostly reading in bed.Okay, I realize I'm gushing but this is absolutely one of my top books of the year. Off to explore her other titles."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"The book had a great start, then fizzled by Chapter 2. It read like a first book and she would have benefited from some much needed editing. Even as a \\"beach book\\", I'd give this one a pass."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Initially, I really enjoyed this novel. Unger writes with a definitely a different style and voice for the narrator of a thriller, but at first it felt fresh and exciting. Unfortunately, it became a rather tired tale very quickly. The plot was predictable, with a solution lacking a basis in solid facts. Overall, it read more like a romance novel than a thriller. It was hokey, unimpressive and used unoriginal characters and relationships. All in all, I was rather disappointed. The most interesting thing was that the adoption motif that I just encountered in Trollope'sBrother & Sistercarried through to this book."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This book had promise. What could have been a tense novella turned into a long series of lectures about \\"how life is.\\"I like it when a book causes me to reflect on my own life, not when it dictates how life should feel to me using generalizations. Show, don't tell! The huge chunks where the main character describes how life is like this-or-that felt very condescending and really hurt the pace of the book. It is great for the character to feel emotions, but when they are dissected and explained to death, they lose any punch they might have had.The story premise was good, and I wanted to know what would happen-- in the beginning. Unfortunately, most of the secrets were let out pretty early on. If some of Unger's tangents would have been cut short and some action put in their place, this could have been a good book. Instead from about mid-point on I was bored and disconnected from the characters. When the last bits of \\"the truth\\" came out, I was beyond caring, and so I was not too disappointed that there were no great revelations anyway."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Beautiful Lies has a fantastic and original premise, involving a woman who rushes into Manhattan traffic one day saving a boy's life. She becomes an instant celebrity as a guardian angel, but her fortunes turn when she receives a letter that includes a press clipping of a young woman murdered in the seventies whose daughter was abducted, with a note that reads, 'Are you my daughter?'I'm in for the first hundred pages or so, and then the book starts to turn into a predictable story with every cliche suspense moment including the car that tries to run you off the road, and the stranger in your hallway who's backlit with menace. To be honest, this started to play out like a classic Lifetime movie, once she meets her dark and sexy neighbor who seems to be harboring his own 'beautiful lies' when he isn't flexing his rock hard abs. The other thing that began to drive me crazy was the way the author continually broke the narrative to address the reader directly like a girlfriend she was chatting on the phone with. (\\"The way I saw it, there were a couple of other biggies. Tell me if you agree.)Why? You can't hear my response, Ridley.The book also never completely wraps up ,leaving a gaping hole as to who orchestrates the events that transpire. I guess, at the end of the day that wasn't the point. It's not a horrible book, just not a very original or suspenseful one. Unfortunately anyone who reads these kind of books with any regularity will have seen it all before. I'd classify it as chick lit, subheading:Woman in peril with hunky mysterious neighbor."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I'm not one to leave a book unfinished, but an est 40% through this one, I've closed the cover.

You are right, and this isn't one of the better versions of this plot in the worst of the romantic novels storylines."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Ugg, I really did not enjoy \\"Beautiful Lies.\\" The problem was that I was about 1/3 into it before I realized, and I wanted to see the ending. Turns out I didn't have to keep reading, because the novel concluded exactly as I'd suspected it would! In addition to the predictable plot, the main character and narrator, Ridley, annoyed me to no end. Plus the writing style was not my thing; too many \\"By now you're probably thinking that I'm crazy.\\" stuff--just a personal gripe I guess, but I don't like it when the narrator talks to the reader."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Ridely Jones....what did you accomplish in the end other than hurt the people that loved you the most?

Was the author in a hurry to finish off the book?!?!Well,thats the feeling i got.I agree with another reader...how did this book get so many stars??Unbeleivable.

Lisa Unger had me hanging on by the skin of my teeth as I followed the action in BEAUTIFUL LIES. It's one of the best psychological thrillers I've ever read. The followup to this book is just as good. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I was introduced to Lisa Unger's writing through her latest novel, Die for You. I was so spellbound by her writing and her story that I had to have more. Reading Beautiful Lies was a sore comparison. I kept thinking how did I come across this book?! I was really looking for a thriller and this book is a tad suspenseful but it's overshadowed by Unger's main character, Ridley. At first I was indifferent to her but then I realized I couldn't stand her!! She's crying in 3/4 of the scenes or else she's screaming, and sometimes it's both. And I didn't feel like the author did her job in leading us to believe either emotion was necessary or authentic, so basically she came off as a drama queen, but not even one you could sympathize with at times. Her relationship with the male lead was too quick and she was too trusting of him yet overly critical of people who had been in her life for years. Add that with the fact that the plot brought up more questions than it answered and you have this poorly written tale. Skip this and check out Unger's other work instead!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This book has an excellent idea/concept for the story, it's just not that well written. Obviously the editor didn't do a very good job editing and suggesting changes that could have moved this book into a much better category for me. The authors use of 1st person narrative is used in too loose of a \\"conversational style\\". She too frequently asks the reader questions about her state of mind or what we think of her state of mind and it got annoying by the end of the book. The use of foreshadowing in the opening of the book was a mistake as well because it gave away too much. It spoke of a lack of confidence in the material and was used to hook the reader rather than just tell the story."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Poor Ridley, the herione, gets tangled up in finding herself. She is the daughter of pediatrician and his wife. She works as a free lance writer and is basically free to do as she wishes. One day she saves a toddler from being hurt of killed. It is captured on film and a nice story came of it. Then her life fell apart: she was recognized as one of many children who were kidnapped way back when from abusive houses by her father and a private investigator. Between the two of them they help (force? coerce?) her to find a lot of information that was buried long ago.In the beginning, I was wondering if this was to be a weird pcycho were is the truth? Who is honest and who is not? Who can she trust? ETc. It turns out to be more of a romantic thriller. I is well enough written and a lot of interesting sidelights are presnted that it is enjoyable, but it is not a great story, just pretty good."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"First third of the book is fabulous: exciting, tense, makes you eager to find out what in the world is about to unfold. Writing is very nice, flowing, easy, keeps you swept up in the story, I didn't want to put it down. A definite page turner. Loved our girl Ridley, the protagonist; the other characters were less than likable or interesting.Unfortunately the story soon becomes predictable...could see it coming a mile away and it began to feel repetitive. The most amazing part was that it turns out there wasn't more to it than there really was. So many implausible events, Jake turns up everywhere without even trying. And boy, by the time I got to the last page I didn't care who what or why anymore: it ends up feeling like much ado about nothing."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This book was truly wonderful.

Fortunately for us, she can't help but try to find out, and with the help of her mysterious and gorgeous new neighbor, she starts digging into her past, and secrets that someone doesn't want her to uncover.The story is told in a first-person conversational style that I found irresistible. In her narration, Ridley speaks to the reader: \\"I know you're wondering why I said that...\\" \\"You might be wondering why I told you all that...\\" etc. The plot unfolds with believability as well as suspense. This is definitely a page-turner and a nail-biter. The action is neatly resolved at the end; it isn't vague and the reader is not left hanging, yet I want to read more about Ridley's life.

The main character spoke directly to the reader at times, which I know from other reviews might have been annoying to some people, but it wasn't frequent enough to bother me. What did bother me was the fact that Ridley (the narrator) kept saying things like, \\"Did I realize that I sounded like I was twelve?\\" And even more annoying to me was \\"I didn't know why I was doing this, but...\\" She really never seemed to have much conviction or intention, and when you know that people are out there trying to kill you, that's not great."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I love reading and will pick up just about anything just to have something to read but I have to say that this book was S0 bad that I couldn't finished reading it.

Lisa Unger is a talented writer - her style is straight-forward and poignant without being flowery, but the story was missing too many pieces and didn't come together the way a good thriller or mystery should.Bottom line: the story is compelling and the book is a fast-paced read, but the ending is too poorly developed for this to be a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I wish I could give this book 3.5 stars--I think it really deserves more than 3 stars because I read it in just two sittings, but it's definitely not a 4-star book.

(Talk about serendipity!)Of course, there are the requisite supporting players....the ex-boyfriend, the new stud, the grizzled cop, and those who want the truth kept quiet. Don't want to give away the entire plotline, so suffice to say that it's a good read for a rainy afternoon."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Breathless narrative of silly plot (adolescent fantasy premise: what if I am not who I think I am? what if I was found on the doorstep by my parents?)Pathetic lack of character development (could be that I just read Zadie Smith's \\"On Beauty\\"--which has more character development in a single paragraph than this whole book--but if you're thinking I'm a snob, I also just reread Michael Connelly's Black Ice--Harry Bosch is a masterpiece)East Village depiction is not bad in an NYU undergrad sort of way."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Ridley Jones has led a relatively charmed life, the daughter of wealthy parents, with an equally impressive philanthropist \\"uncle\\" (recently deceased) that left her a comfortable trust. The only blight on the landscape is Ridley's brother, Ace, a young man lost to his family in a sea of drugs, unable or unwilling to come in from the cold. A freelance journalist, Ridley is coping with the loss of her uncle, the recent disappearance of her brother and a breakup with a longtime boyfriend. All that changes with one act of heroism and the delivery of an envelope containing a picture and a question: \\"Are you my daughter?\\"Suddenly half-formed doubts and subtle untruths loom in Ridley's imagination; she is jarred out of her complacency, distant alarm bells ringing in her subconscious. With characteristic impulsiveness, Ridley tumbles into a torrid affair with a new neighbor, finally entrusting him with the nightmare twist her life has taken. Strong and assured, Jake offers to help Ridley track down the envelope's sender, using his police contacts. They inch closer to a shattering truth that will tear Ridley's world wide open, exposing her to the harsh reality that nothing is ever what it seems. Questioning her parents, Ridley gets only evasions, so she pursues the mystery on her own, with Jake as backup, increasingly conscious that Jake keeps much to himself. In an adrenaline rush, Ridley clings to whatever fragments of truth remain, clinging to Jake as they support each other in their emotional devastation.Ridley is tangled in a very sticky web of denial, rapidly developing a bad habit of ignoring the truth when it is too painful. In this stilted manner, in fits and stops, Ridley comes closer to the dark secret her parents have hidden and an unsavory connection to the criminal underworld. The attraction of this protagonist is her very human response to stress, danger and the drastically altered landscape of her life, although she has an irritating tendency to preach as she goes about her investigation. With a natural curiosity, a quick temper and a terrible fear of the inevitable, Ridley grasps for small moments of comfort and security in a world suddenly devoid of both; the closer she gets to the truth, the more dangerous her journey becomes, friends and lovers turned to enemies and liars in a complicated game of hide-and-seek where Ridley is the quarry.Through this quirky character, Unger spins an intriguing and unusual tale, her youthful protagonist as complicated as her suddenly unpredictable life. This is an identity crisis on a grand scale, Ridley on the cusp of an abyss that will forever fracture the easy security she has enjoyed. But Ridley is nothing if not stubborn, relentlessly pursuing an elusive truth in spite of her terror.

The initial download was about 2 months ago, but I never got past the first page. However, I picked the Nook up a few days ago, upon the completion of a project and was surprised at how entertaining it turns out to be. I am not quite finished but wanted to come by Amazon to see what others had to say - AND to see if any readers shared the complaint that I have. I find that, at times, Ms. Unger is way too descriptive with a scene. Way too many adjectives and 'dragging on' about a instance that we've long ago grasped. There are actually parts I skipped because I felt beat over the head with a situation.The positive is that I am enjoying the book. I like that the story jumped right in and began to unfold and tell itself rather than draw out unnecessarily. I can't say that Jake, to me, is believable. He comes with his information too quickly and avails himself in ways that would creep me out. Could it be the protagonist had a few cob webs since the demise of her engagement? Don't know. But just a little too eager to overlook the mystery of this man because of his stick and thug presence.One more thing. People providing a review...please don't tell us what the story is about because we can very easily read that on the jacket. Tell us what you think and move on. Makes it more interesting.Thanks!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This is a great book if you're looking for a light quick read. It borders on implausible but if you're willing to suspend reality a bit it is entertaining and enjoyable. It was suspenseful and at times predictable but at other times kept you guessing. I liked that the ending wasn't wrapped up in a neat little package, as so many authors tend to do, but allowed for some things to not be resolved which is more true to life.There were times that the author was overly descriptive of scenes which were not pertinent to the story but not so much so that it ruined the book. Unger also injects pearls of wisdom throughout the story which I enjoyed. It caused me to pause at times and think \\"what a profound thought\\" - I particularly liked her insights regarding the choices we make.I recommend this book and will look for her others that have come out in recent years."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"What a remarkable and gripping story Lisa Unger presents in Beautiful Lies. She spins a tale that is both heartbreaking and fascinating as she wrote in such a way that made me feel as though Ridley, the main character, was speaking right to me, explaining what she was feeling and thinking during her incredible experience of sorting through the family secrets. Ridley is a free lance writer who had a happy childhood and grew up in a nice home. One day she gets a photo which turns her whole life upside down and takes her on a dangerous journey to find the truth. She gets to the point of not knowing who she can trust but makes some good decisions that help her discover truth and happiness.One example of an insight Lisa Unger shares through a section where Ridley is speaking directly to the reader that really stood out to me is this from p. 98-99:\\"And we stood like that. The joining of hands is highly underrated in the acts of intimacy. You kiss acquaintances or colleagues, casually to say hello or good-bye. You might even kiss a close friend chastely on the lips. You might quickly hug anyone you knew. You might even meet someone at a party, take him home and sleep with him, never to see him or hear from him again. But to join hands and stand holding each other that way, with the electricity of possibilities flowing between you? The tenderness of it, the promise of it, is only something you share with a few people in your life.\\"This is real thriller filled with lots of insights into how people arrive at the choices they make and is definitely a page-turner. It takes a close look at how we develop and evaluate relationships with others. \\"Beautiful Lies\\" deals with identity issues, mob activity, abduction in the name of protection, selling babies, judging others, family dynamics, romance and betrayal.I highly recommend you read this book--it's fantastic! Well written and packed with action and suspense right from the start. I say this is a must read!P.S. I agree with the comment about some of her descriptions being boring and long; however, those can easily be skipped. To me, these descriptions created a picture in my mind to help me feel as though I were seeing things through her eyes."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Let's just say I sat up all night reading this book and finished it in two days. The plot of this book just keeps getting better and better. When you think you have it figured out, you're thrown another twist in the story. Each relationship is different yet special in it's own way and it keeps you so hooked because you just have to know what's going to happen between everybody. I love how real the dialog is between characters. It's honest and brutal sometimes, but so is life. There is so much love and so much hate throughout the book that you really feel for some of the characters and can probably relate on a very real level. Can't wait to read Sliver of Truth, the sequel to this book! Definitely recommend this book, and have to all my friends."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Let me begin with a caveat: I don't read that many mystery books. But the reason I don't (clunky, over heated prose and stock characters) was not the problem I had with this book. Unger has a nice, witty sense of self-awareness in her writing that had me rooting for the book(and she paints a nice picture of the East Village, NYC). I liked the main character quite a bit. But the problem with the book is that the \\"horrific\\" discoveries the main character makes about something in general and something about herself do not warrant all of the intrigue and shock on her part. I'm not going to ruin the plot for those interested in reading this. But suffice to say that any reasonable person would be thankful rather than shocked or hurt upon discovery of the \\"beautiful lie\\" that leaves the main character bereft for far too many pages. In addition, it is difficult to understand why such desperate efforts are made by so many respectable people to maintain a cover up of what could well be thought of as an heroic mission undertaken many years in the past. To simply treat some morally complicated act as if is was evil merely for the purpose of creating suspense, particularly given all of the truly evil things there are in the world (or even just the East Village) just seems silly."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Had I read the reviews here before getting this audio, I would have skipped it! Unfortunately, I was stuck on a long car ride with only this book to listen to. It was pretty dreadful. Too long, overwritten, unlikable characters, silly situations, predictable scenarios, repetitive, awkward. Wasn't there an editor involved in this mess? I cannot believe this was a bestseller and a BookSense book!All of the \\"mob\\" stuff was just not at all believable, nor were many of the \\"action scenes\\". The flimsy-at-best premise of the book was not strong enough to carry all of the weight that the author attached to it."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Wow, I really liked this book. As other reviewers have noted, the exceptional part of this book is less about the plot -- although I liked the twists and turns just fine -- and more about the author's writing style. I particularly liked her characters. So many authors create \\"paper doll\\" characters -- flawless, uninteresting, and ultimately one-dimensional people. This author chose to give her characters imperfections, quirks, and subtleties that brought them to life for me, and made the book much more interesting and made it seem as though the author really knew these people. Ridley's mother, in particular, was beautifully drawn. A woman who loves her children immensely, but is overly concerned with appearance, and who withdraws when things do not go well. I can't wait for the author's sophomore effort, and hope it comes out quickly!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"It seems to me that the author was deliberately giving the reader clues before Ridley figured them out. This didn't bother me. What did irritate were the Jake parts that I felt should have been published by Harlequin. After the tenth time hearing about his \\"ripped abs\\" tattoos, and sexual prowess, I expected to look at the cover and find Fabio with a shirt unbuttoned to the navel. It was a great premise and parts were really well written so hopefully Ms. Unger's next hero will be more believable and interesting."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I am perplexed by the good reviews this book is getting. As a thriller, this book gets 0 stars. You can see every plot twist coming from the beginning. The only reason I kept reading was that I thought that perhaps there would be a major twist at the end that would shake everything up and make it worthwhile, but no.There are a few instances of inspired writing, but these are diluted by the repetition of the idea until it's just annoying.If you want to read a novel about a woman's search for her identity, then it's fine. Just don't expect any brilliant surprises."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"It all started when Ridley saves a little boy from being run over in the middle of the street. That fifteen minutes of fame - are going to cost her like you wouldn't believe.A grainy photo and the words: \\"Are you my daughter?\\" are shoved under her door, and this starts the entire train of destruction. Everyone she knows has been lying to her, from her parents to her brother, her ex-fiance and friend, Zach and his mother, Esme. Even her deceased Uncle Max lied to her. Everyone is telling her that, because of her act of bravery, it's bringing crazies out of the woodwork, but for some reason, that doesn't ring true for Ridley, and she becomes determined to find out why.And it seems that the only one she believes she can trust is Jake, a man who recently moved into her apartment building. After a little research, Ridley learns that the woman in the photo, Teresa Elizabeth Stone, had been murdered in 1972 and her 18-month-old daughter, Jessie Amelia Stone, went missing. It was believed that Christina Luna, father of Jessie, had murdered her and disappeared with the child. With Jake's help, she gets in contact with the man who sent her the photo, Christian Luna. He'd found Teresa's body that night, and Jessie missing, and he ran, knowing that he would be a supsect, for Teresa had a restraining order on him, and he'd been banging on her door, drunk as a skunk, earlier that night.But as Ridley is talking to him in the park, he's shot dead beside her, rifle shot to the head.Lies upon lies tumble, and Ridley becomes even more determined. Whether or not she is Jessie, she's going to find out what happened over thirty years ago. Who killed Teresa Elizabeth Stone? And what happened to Jessie?I'd had high hopes. I'd heard such good things about this author that when Crystal suggested this book as a Buddy Read, I jumped on it. I think we both may be regretting the idea.It's not that it was a bad book. The action was superb, the mystery was great, the plot thick, the lies, deceit and twists ties the reader up in knots. The characters have you wondering, but the main character, Ridley... oh, boy, where do I start?You can tell she grew up in a bubble of her parents love and money. Naive, she knows about bad things in the world, but she really had no idea. Reading about it is one thing, but being involved is another, and her eyes are being opened rather drastically, rather quickly. But the rambling... OMG, the rambling! It screams FILLER! It may give you an idea about the kind of person she is, how she grew up, yada, yada, yada, blah, blah, blah, but enough is enough! At one point, she even jokes that we might be upset at her rambling but that there's a point to it. I'm sorry, but there was stuff rambled about that had no bearing to the story whatsoever. The rambling drove me crazy, and I even had my husband look at me funny when I yelled: \\"Get to the point, already!\\" Not once, but three times.And while I did feel that spark, that click between her and Jake, the relationship hit high really quick... too quick. First the sex (which is painfully really nothing to gossip about whatsoever,) then the I love you's inside a week? Are we really supposed to believe that? Sure, I felt that connection, but the rest went way too fast. Sorry, Ms. Unger, but readers of the suspense/thriller genre are not that naive.And the ending - perfect set up for a second book. And honestly, I wasn't happy... Not. One. Bit. Way too many unanswered questions, plus we still don't know who actually killed Teresa Stone. Now I feel like I'm being forced to pick up the second book, Sliver of Truth, in order to find out. To me, that screams: guaranteed sales. From an author's and publisher's stand-point, that's awesome. From a reader's stand-point, a huge load of B.S. At this point, I'm not sure if I'll pick up Sliver of Truth. I feel cheated, and I don't like feeling cheated.I can't say it was a bad book, cause it wasn't - not to me, anyway. But it wasn't the greatest for me. Do I recommend it? *shrug* The choice is yours."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I saw the negative reviews of this book before I decided to read it, and although they do have some merit (i.e. not much character development, some contrived action scenes, etc), overall I found the book rather riveting. The writing is excellent. Unger does an outstanding job of describing emotions rather than just trying to rely on action sequences as a crutch. I almost gave the book three stars because the entire premise of the story is awfully hard to swallow and the plot is very linear, but the quality of writing and the fact that I couldn't put the book down earned a fourth star. In short, it's not among the best books I've read, but it was still an exciting story."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Okay, if I think this novel is excellent, why didn't I give it five stars instead of four? Well, I almost did. But I guess the reason I didn't was because there were times when I thought Unger was throwing words into this novel just to fill the pages. Then I'd turn the page and she'd take off on a full-suspense prose that had me thinking, \\"oh boy, here we go again\\". For a first novel, Lisa Unger's book was exceptionally well written. Even the editing of this book was amazing because I didn't run across one thing that I thought was in error. No spelling errors, no typo errors, and even the punctuation was good. She graciously thanked all those who helped her and with good cause. Unger's main character, Ridley Jones, kept me in suspense, but starting out I thought she was sort of wimpy. Wait, you say, the gal jumped in front of on-coming traffic to save a kid. Yeah, well, that was a great start. But she lacked backbone in more places than one. However, the masculine hunk, Jake, filled the void. I thought Ridley jumped into bed with Jake a little too soon, but hey, one has to remember the times we live in, and, I suppose that happens. Unger kept her sex scenes clean, not trashy. And I always like that when romance comes into play. Over all though, Unger's plot was one that I thought was truly excellent. And just when I thought the end of the story was near, here she'd come again with more excitement. To be honest, the flow of this prose was very very good, the characters, especially Jake, were exceptional. But the plot was a near and dear subject that Unger wrote about with good knowledge. It's sad to think these things happen in today's world, but we all know that they do. I highly recommend this book to all readers of fiction. You won't go wrong. I'll be watching for Unger's next novel."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"If you've read Nicci French, you will recognize the opening hook of this book, only Nicci French did it much better (and with a watermelon!). Almost everything after that hook (young woman performs heroic deed, is captured in paper, attracts attention of at least one potentially dangerous man) is pretty predictable and disappointing.I'm not really a thriller snob. I don't mind a little romance thrown in with my suspense (there's a reason I mentioned Nicci French - I like her!) and I don't need a thriller writer to be Hemingway. But \\"Beautiful Lies\\" just really doesn't work even as an escapist book. The other reviewer is absolutely right that this book reads sometimes like a Harlequin romance novel. (From about twenty years ago.) Other times, the tone makes attempts at doom and foreboding. Everything is communicated by an overly familiar, \\"aren't I cool?\\" narrator who is not in fact too cool -- her commentary reads kind of like your aunt's idea of \\"what one of those Sex and the City girls might say.\\" At no point does she convince me that she actually IS cool. In fact, despite the overfamiliarity, at no point in this book did I believe it was a real person narrating this story, even though that's obviously the tone the author was going for. On top of that, the plotting was not surprising or new in any way, and every \\"twist\\" in this book was telegraphed from a mile away.I know I sound harsh, but I'm just disappointed, because I really wanted to like this book. The writer obviously has talent, and this was a good idea that could have been better developed. Plus, there are occasional glimpses of interesting, thoughtful writing. But they're way too few and far between to make the other 90 percent of this book worth reading.I finished this book with the impression that Unger strayed from the book she wanted to write and ended up trying to write a Nicci French book instead. I wish this author would write the book I saw occasional glimpses of here, when the narrator knocked off the cutesyness and the book got a little darker and more interesting. I have a feeling that if she wrote that book, it would be good. Till then, though, I have to give this book a very disappointed two stars (with an extra star for potential)."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Ridley Jones is content with her life. \\"I have loved and been loved by my parents...I love my work, my friends, the place I live,\\" she muses at the opening of BEAUTIFUL LIES. Happy with her East Village apartment, surrounded by a loving family, Ridley's only real trouble is her wayward older brother Ace, a drug addict who has been cut off from the rest of the family and who regularly disappears into the underbelly of Manhattan, reappearing only when he needs Ridley to give him money.All of Ridley's assumptions about her comfortable life evaporate in a second, though, when she achieves her 15 minutes of fame after saving the life of a small child. Instantly, her name and photo are plastered all over the city, even throughout the country. Ridley enjoys her brief fame, until she receives an alarming letter from someone claiming she's his daughter. When Ridley later receives a 1970s newspaper clipping featuring a photo of a murdered woman who looks just like Ridley herself, she isn't sure whom to believe.Ridley's questions to her parents are met with secrecy and defensiveness. Is it possible that Ridley's entire existence has been nothing but a series of beautiful lies? Soon enough, she is thrust into a full-blown mystery that may involve her whole family, her ex-fiance, and even the sexy new upstairs neighbor. On the run, unsure of whom she can trust, Ridley must use all her resources to delve into a past she never knew or even imagined.Readers will devour Lisa Unger's terrific debut work of fiction. An emotionally charged suspense novel with a likable heroine, this sexy thriller rockets like a racecar through the streets of Manhattan. New York City is actually a vibrant character in its own right, which uses real neighborhood locales to enhance its air of authenticity. The narrative's tone, with its second-person addresses to the reader and some philosophical musings that occasionally interrupt the action, may seem intrusive to some readers. The combination of truly enthralling plotting and emotional self-discovery, though, will draw in even the most reluctant readers, who certainly will label Unger as a new suspense author to watch.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Couldn't put it down.

Lisa Unger is an amazing aurthor!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I pretty much read the whole book in all of two sittings over the course of a single day, which says a lot about this book: (a) this was an enjoyable book; (b) it was very fast-paced; and (c) it was the perfect length to serve as a fun distraction for a quiet day at home.Yes, the plot was somewhat predictable at times, but that didn't really detract much from the book, simply because of the fast-paced way that the author laid it all out (had the author dragged out a predictable plot, that would be an entirely different story altogether!).I look forward to reading the next book featuring this protagonist (Sliver of Truth) on another quiet day!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I read about one book a week, mostly mysteries and thrillers. This is one of the most riveting stories I have read in a while, but the book does suffer from excessive prose which slows it down. Still, I had a hard time putting it down because I was anxious to learn the next twist in the plot. I listened to the audio version of the book and the narrator is excellent."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I enjoyed this novel very much. The narrator and main character, Ridley Jones comes across as likeable, the hero, Jake is hot but not so macho that he is unrealistic. Ridley's life begins to unravel when she rescues a toddler from running under a car and she has 15 minutes of fame - which she enjoys - but then the mystery begins. In no time, every aspect of her life is questionable and in danger from a conspiracy which came out of a desire to do good, thirty years previously.The writing is engaging - the narrator addresses the reader from time to time, which shouldn't work, but does - and the pace is fast and furious.All in all, I thought it was a pretty good thriller. Apparently it is the first of Lisa Unger's books, so I shall be buying more in the near future."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"BEAUTIFUL LIES, by Lisa Unger, is an average thriller that is worth reading because of the narration of the main character, Ridley Jones. Ridley grew up in a wonderful home with great parents, and now lives as a freelance writer in cozy apartment in New York City.Through random chance, a stranger sees her picture in the paper, and Ridley receives a letter and an old newspaper clipping. The letter claims the man knows something about Ridley's past. Ridley meets a handsome, mysterious guy who just moved in next to her, and he helps her on her quest to find out if the girl in the newspaper clipping from many years ago is actually her.Other reviewers have claimed the plot was easy to figure out, and I have to agree. It was so easy to see where this novel was going, and that took away some of the fun. That was a shame, because Ridley was a sympathetic and interesting character.Ultimately, this is a novel about a young woman who lived a great life, but it was full of lies. She called them beautiful lies, because her life was great up until that point. The question is, how does the truth change the reality of her past. Does it change who she is? Does it change how she feels about those around her."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"What a waste of money and time. I cannot believe that this book is on any best-seller list. From the first chapter I should have known to put it down. All the rhetorical questions Ridley asks makes me want to throttle her. \\"Like you know what I mean?\\" I actually SKIPPED 100 pages in the middle of the book, and didn't miss a beat with the story. The entrie book sounds like it is coming from a 7th grader writing a note to her BFF in class. The \\"heroine\\" reminds me of Alicia Sliverstone's character in the movie \\"Clueless\\".Save yourself the misery."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"\\"I'll be there in a second\\" I said to my wife. Why did I say that, I wondered, as I stared down at my brown Ugg loafers that I was wearing, somewhat incongrously, with cargo shorts. People always say \\"in a second\\" when they are actually going to take much longer. And wouldn't it be better, really, if we were all more honest? \\"I have to finish writing this review,\\" I told her.That passage (from my life) captures the style of this book. Shallow but heartfelt observations about life, plenty of name-dropping descriptions of people's clothes and lives, and surprisingly long asides in the middle of dialog. All this occurs, however, in the midst of a page-turning, if somewhat predictable, romantic thriller. And, for me the best part, the core of the book is an identity story. I am interested in identity stories, and some of Unger's description of her heroine's recasting and gradual reinterpretation of her life as she learns about her identity make up the best part of the book and were sufficient to hold my interest. Otherwise, as a pure romantic thriller, you can do better."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I absolutely had to read this in two sittings! I couldn't get enough. I purchased the book expecting a twerty lifestyle which may have been why I was not disappointed in the girlish lingo. Just enough romance to remind the married of falling in lust and love!Very pleased to find that I can reunite with Ridley sooner than later in Sliver of Truth!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This was a fascinating story with a lot of twists and turns. It was recommended on the Weekend Edition of the NBC Today Show and proved to be a great choice. This is one of those books where you can't wait until you reach the end but then wish it would continue a while longer. Excellent choice for suspense and mystery fans."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I was really surprised that I liked this book as much as I did. Lisa Unger told a good story and I felt that I got my moneys worth with this book. I look forward to reading Ms. Ungers next novel."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Ridley Jones is a 30ish writer living in an East Village apartment in New York. She becomes a reluctant hero of sorts when one Indian summer she dashes into the street, and sweeps a toddler from in front of a van. Ridley saves the child's life and as luck would have it, a photographer caught the action the moment the rescue happens. Ridley's heroic dead was captured on film and the story and Ridley's photograph makes the news.Ridley lived a fairly uneventful life up to that point. Her father is a well-respected pediatrician; her stay-at-home mother keeps the family rolling smoothly along. The only disruption in their comfortable suburban life is Ridley's brother, Ace. Ace has a serious drug problem.Soon Ace's drug problem seems a minor problem, though. AfterRidley's photograph appears in newspapers, strange things happen and her life begins to spin out of control. She questions her parentage, hooks up with a mysterious new boy friend, and finds skeletons in her family's closet that bring her close to danger from many unexpected fronts. And what is the secret behind her Uncle Max, and why did he spend much of his vast fortune to fund Project Rescue, rescue houses for abused women and children? These are things Ridley had never thought about before.Beautiful Lies kept me turning the pages. There is mystery and suspense and the story is interesting. Something keeps me from giving this book more stars, however, and I think it is because I never feel empathy for Ridley. I never crawl into her skin and feel all the pain she is supposed to be feeling due to her circumstances.The big secret Ridley is trying to uncover is revealed too early in the story, not that it was done on purpose, it is just a little too obvious. I did keep reading, however, to see if my suspicions were right (and I was), so the novel is a success. I read it to the very end.The 374-page thriller carries with it a possible dark side of a program that shouldn't have a dark side, but certainly makes you think about it. Author Lisa Unger is working on her next novel. I'm anxious to see it."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This novel is fantastic! Especially in the way it transcends tired old boundaries that seem to be in place which people use to classify books by genre. Those classifications are so vague and were originally used by companies to market books. Adherence to a particular type of formula should never be the litmus test for a good book. I love how Lisa Unger gives us a unique story that contains a lot of different elements: introspection, intrigue, suspense and even a little dark humor and more wrapped up in elegant prose that keeps you turning the pages until the very end. And then leaves you wanting more. She has a wonderful gift and I applaude her work. To me, great writers are those who are able to pull you \\"inside\\" the world they create, and that is certainly the case with this novel. I felt as though I were on the gritty streets of New York City, hearing the car horns and smelling the street vendors as I walked alongside Ridley, while her story unfolded.As for the reviewers below who give it less stars, I am sure they are the same people who look for mindless reads that follow cookie cutter formulas and do not challenge or open their minds to a new experience, story or introspective thought in the way that Ridley (And the author) do in Beautiful Lies.This is one of those books that I wish I could read again for the first time!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Lisa Unger's debut is decent but the overall plot was pretty predictable. The writing style bothered me at times with Ridley Jones, the main charcater, talking to the reader for reasons unknown. All that being said, it wasn't bad, just a little formulaic."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I read a lot of novels, many not so great but fun nonetheless for escapist reading. What a treat to read a book by a terrific writer, with so much more than just action and adventure. The descriptions and narrative are just great! It truly was a \\"can't put it down\\" book. I wish there were many more of Unger's books to get me through the summer. Hope she can write quickly!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This was a book club read for our group, and I loved it from page one. As other reviewers have noted, the main character speaks directly to the reader at times, and gives her philosophy of life, which is right on - and one of the best features of the book. No, it isn't perfect (and I give it four stars instead of five because the other members of the book club weren't as enthusiastic) but for a first book is a great start, and I can't wait to read more from this author.As with many other fast-paced twisty books, I definitely recommend reading the whole story straight through as much as possible to get the best experience. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"My best friend gave me this book while I was vacationing in Europe otherwise I probably wouldn't have purchased it on my own. I was hooked right from the beginning. Being a NYC girl, I enjoyed reading about The Big Apple and could visualize the places that Lisa Unger so vividly decribes. I enjoyed her writing style and could relate to her emotional states in some of her situations. I don't think the book was so much of a mystery, but it held my interest until the very end. I am looking forward to reading another book by Ms. Unger. It you'd like a good read with a few twists, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I've read 2 novels by Lisa Unger, this and \\"BlackOut.\\" Based on these books, I'd read anything by her. Her characters and situations are unlike most in this genre, which keeps it fresh; and you just don't want to put the book down for curiosity about what happens next. The heroines in \\"Beautiful Lies\\" and \\"BlackOut\\" are both rather unconventional, and maybe not particularly likeable or believable, but I enjoy this twist on the usual mystery thriller, too."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"After reading Die For You I had to get my hands on the rest of Lisa Unger's novels so I started at the beginning. Beautiful Lies did not disappoint. While it seems there's definitely a common theme in her novels (waking up one day and finding out your life is pretty much a big lie) they're hardly just rehashed tales.Ridley Jones lead a storied life. Loved by her mother and father and her favorite uncle, solid job. Very story book childhood. One decision she makes in her life leads her down a road that reveals it was all a horrible lie.Walking out onto the streets of New York City, Ridley sees a toddler who's lost the attention of his mother and is in danger of being hit by a vehicle she makes a decision: she's going to save the child and she does. She's a hero. She gets her 15 minutes of fame. That one decision is the catalyst for a series of events that will throw the life and identity she thought she knew into a tailspin.This is a very well plotted book with many twists and turns. At one point, thinking myself clever, I thought I'd actually figured it out about halfway through the book and I thought to myself 'a little predictable if not still enjoyable'. In a way it was predictable, but the actual events and people at the center of the events that unfold aren't who or what I expected. Apparently I wasn't as clever as I thought ;) And that's also a sign of a well written book. One where you think you have it figured out only to have the rug pulled out from under you. But not from any last minute plot devices. Just from tight plotting and talented writing.With lots of twists and turns and well written characters I am now officially a fan of Lisa Unger and I look forward to reading the rest of her catalog."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This book is not easy to pigeon hole. Unger's writing style is a cross between first person, almost a journal and even something of a blog at times. She breaks all the rules, but as the saying goes it's OK to break the rules as long as you know them, and Unger knows them, clearly. Still, be warned if you aren't a fan of nontraditional writing styles you should either avoid this book or open your mind to some great new writers...I suggest the latter.Ridley Jones is both the narrator and main character in this novel, which seems to focus on how the little choices we make each day change the course of our lives. I didn't feel a lot of suspense through the book, but it did make me think and I read it in less than two days...a mark of a good read if it pulls me away from other things to finish it. In Ridley's case her little choices added up to one big one...saving a young boy's life, which led to the unraveling of her own. To me the subject was brilliant...I often womder what if I hadn't stopped impulsively to apply for that job where I met my husband? Or how many times have we avoided a deadly wreck because we left the house 5 minutes late? Ridley finds out that her life has been a lie based on little choices she makes. Unger's literary style works perfectly with this type of writing. I would have liked a bit more mystery or suspense but overall it really held my attention. Certainly recommend it."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Are You My Daughter? With those four words Ridley Jones easy going, nice safe life comes crashing down all around her.After enjoying her 15 minutes of fame for saving a toddler from certain death by taxi on a NYC street, Ridley Jones finds that there is a downside to all the publicity she receives as a hero. One of them is a picture of a man, a woman and a little girl with the mystifying question scrawled across the bottom. After thinking it is some sick joke Ridley decides to confront her parents, who reassure her that she is indeed their child. But there is a nagging doubt at the back of her mind. When Ridley meets her new neighbor, the very appealing Jake Jacobson, she tells him her story. Offering to help her find out if there is any truth to her doubts Ridley and Jake begin a roller coaster search for the truth that confronts all the Beautiful Lies we often live with without even knowing they are lies.I enjoyed this suspense mystery very much. It was nicely paced, well written and kept me guessing until the end. I have the sequel Sliver of Truth already. A very good and entertaining read that doesn't take the easy way out by tying everything up in a neat bow, lots of loose ends and questions remain. High recommend."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Overall, I did enjoy this book quite alot (audiobook). It was different from the other authors I have been reading. I enjoyed the audiobook's reader (Ann Marie Lee) as I think she did a good job especially with the protagonist, Ridley Jones. The book, in general, had good characters and the storyline kept me on my toes and guessing but I did figure out the primary mystery of the book quite easily.What kept this from 5 stars? Not overly excessive but just a bit too much descriptive romance for me. Romance is a genre that I don't read and when a mystery has more than I feel is needed then I have to knock it down a notch.I am listening the the sequel SLIVER OF TRUTH now so I definitely recommend BEAUTIFUL LIES by Lisa Unger."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Many children, particularly the more introspective ones, consider at one time or another the possibility that they were adopted as babies and that their real parents are somewhere out there in the world, unlikely ever to be found. Usually, and thankfully, most get over it so quickly that the experience is soon completely forgotten or, at most, looked back upon as some silly piece of romantic thinking that now embarrasses them.Others are so secure, happy, or maybe just so oblivious of life's possibilities that such a thought never crosses their minds.Ridley Jones was one of those.She was one of those, that is, until life played one of those little tricks on her that come along when one least expects them. Ridley makes the \\"mistake\\" one morning of performing a heroic act for the first time in her life, something so brave and unusual that it catches the attention of a newspaper photographer who just happens to be near the street corner where Ridley makes her move. The resulting newspaper photo turns Ridley into an instant celebrity, even in a city like New York, and for a day or two she is all over the news.And that's when Ridley's world begins to fall apart. First arrives a letter and an old photo from someone who saw her picture in the paper, along with the intriguing question, \\"Are you my daughter?\\" Despite the assumed absurdity of the question, Ridley is intrigued by the faded photo of a woman holding a toddler, a woman who looks very much like Ridley herself.Beautiful Lies considers the impact that seemingly trivial decisions can have on the lives of those who make them and those to whom they are closest. The decision to have that extra cup of coffee or to delay leaving home until a favorite song finishes playing on the radio, for instance, can be the difference between being involved in a fatal accident or arriving at an intersection a few seconds after the accident has occurred. In that same fashion, Ridley Jones comes to realize that the photo taken to document her heroic act, an act resulting from a spur-of-the-moment decision on her part, killed the person she believed herself to be and gave birth to a new one she did not recognize.Encouraged by the new neighbor to whom she is strongly attracted, Ridley finds the courage to search for the truth about herself and the woman in the old photograph. Along the way she will question every relationship she has ever experienced, including the ones with her parents, her drug-addicted brother, her fianc&eacute; and his mother, her beloved uncle, and her newly acquired lover. She will be chased and threatened by mobsters, barely escape sudden death, and forced to make fateful decisions that might very well imprison some of the people she loves most in the world.Beautiful Lies is one heck of a ride but its sometimes comic tone and predictable, though farfetched, ending makes it difficult for the reader to believe that its main characters are ever really in danger of being eliminated from the book's plot. Consequently, the tension level felt by most readers is unlikely to equal the concern for the characters that one would expect from the events being described. That said, Beautiful Lies is filled with snappy dialogue and the kind of plot that will have readers considering moral issues and the impact of chance on their own lives. Some readers will likely be put off by Unger's conversational writing style, a style through which she maintains an ongoing dialogue with the reader throughout the course of the entire book; others will love that quirk."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I must admit I started reading this book when it first came out and after about 70 pages it didn't do much for me so I stopped reading it. I just finished reading Lisa Unger's third novel BLACK OUT - a stand alone novel not about Ridley Jones like her first two. It was one of the best books I have ever read so I had to revisit this book and am I ever so glad I did.I did find the beginning 70 pages again to be slow but after that Lisa Unger truly comes into her own and provides a subperb edge of your seat thriller with nail biting suspense. Her novels have a level of depth and the story is a highly entertaining journey that results with a very plausible and satisfying conclusion. Her characters are very believable and she does an excellent job of revealing their true personalities slowly so that many appear mysterious and end up not being what they first appeared at all. She is also an expert at dropping the red herrings - realistic plot developments with twists and turns that will shock you and keep the pages quickly turning. Even if you thing you know what is going on you will be shocked at how she masterfully brings all the pieces together.The novel begings with Ridley Jones jumping in front of a car to save a little boy and the media attention of her actions brings her face to the attention of many people. She receives a picture of a little girl with two adults and she looks like the woman. The picture asks ARE YOU MY DAUGHTER? Thus begins the mezmerizing journey. Ridley turns to those closest to her and slowly all the comforts of the life she thought she was living slowly disolve. Those she trust suddenly seem to have ulterior motives and secrets seem to be running rampant. She meets a new man Jake who seems to bring much needed intimacy and trust to her life but then she wonders if she can even trust him. She suddenly doesn't know who anybody really is.The plot builds with amazing suspense as it tells a very believable story. The title BEAUTIFUL LIES means something very important in this book. But are beautiful lies a good or bad thing? Lisa Unger is now one of my favorite authors. She writes with intelligence and provides no holds barred thrillers with never ending suspense. If you have not read her yet give this book a shot. You will be very glad you did. This very talented author will probably become a favorite of yours too.Excellent debut."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I loved this book. It was captivating and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Worth the read, very entertaining."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Ridley Jones is a successful thirty-something freelance journalist from New York. Her life is normal until the day she rescues a child and her picture is all over the news. She receives a letter with a picture of three people -- a man, a woman and a child -- that says, \\"Are you my daughter?\\" From then on, her life isn't the same. Her parents, or the people she once believed were her parents, are obviously hiding something. Her junkie brother, Ace, resents her and someone wants her dead. There is a mystery surrounding an organization put together by her uncle involving the help of children in troubled homes. On top of everything else, an attractive and mysterious man named Jake steps into her life just as she begins to question everything around her. Who is Ridley? What is in her past and who is trying to keep her from finding out? There are various twists throughout the novel.I like the buildup of tension and suspense in this. You get the answers in a timely but fast-paced fashion and you can't wait to know what happens next. The heroine has a great voice. I love the way the author describes New York. She doesn't romanticize the city -- makes it as dark as the plot of this novel. The story is kind of complex and you're confused for a while, but the author puts its pieces together nicely. There are areas in which the plot and narrative become annoying. For instance, there is a scene where Ridley demands the truth from one of the characters, but she keeps pushing the character away or interrupting him or picking fights. I almost threw the book across the wall and yelled, \\"Just let the man talk!\\" Ugh. Other than that, this is an enjoyable and suspenseful effort. Lisa Unger is a great writer and I recommend Beautiful Lies."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"The fascinating storyline held my interest with the multiple twists and turns and the plot was interesting and not too predictable. This is an intriguing mystery that transcends genre! A fun read for the entertaining value.

It was a little bit predicatable. I think that the author tried to shock the readers but fell short on them at times. It's not a bad book. I bought it when it was 79 cents and it was worth reading."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"The basic plot not the worst, but the writing is. How did this saga slip the editors desk? So many times I wanted to mark up the page and reconstruct sentences to make them stronger. Redundancy abounds. The flickering light senario, was just one that was used too often. Descriptions seemed to be an effort to fill the page rather than build character. Was tempted to give this one two stars. It is readable but hardly good writing.

Although I figured out most of the ending, I liked finding out how she tied it all together."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"It seems that many people didn't care for Beautiful Lies.

In fact, I would have paid much more."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This is written in first peron which I hate. It was also too long. There were way too many pages of Ridley.s thoughts. The storyline was original but the book would have been much better if written at a faster pace."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"but, it was only $0.79 for the Kindle version so I bit the bullet.I read a novel or two a week and I'm not much of a critic. I see entertainment in nearly every book I read. With that being said, I really felt this particular book was definitely above average. I was hooked within the first couple of pages. The author purposely leaves you without your bearings, trying to sort out who is who. Then she reveals the story with a very descriptive narrative that left me quite annoyed when I had to put the book down to tend to life. I still managed to read it in less than 2 days, because I HAD to."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I found this book to be a real page turner. I enjoyed it from beginning to end and finally stayed up late last night to finish it. The author real made you feel as though you were the best friend of the main character and she was just talking to you about what was going on in her life. Although I thought I had the plot figured out there were many twists and turns before I eventually figured out how it would end. I can't wait to read another book by the same author!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I listened to this book on CD, it was probably the most mind numbing ten hours of my life. This book had an interesting premise but the execution left me wanting to scream. The main character Ridley was so stupid and insipid a character that I actually lost my patience. I really hate when authors are repetitive to the point of annoyance, this is one of those cases. Not only is Ridley the saddest character I have run across in a long time, not because of her situation but because of the way that her character comes across. If I were to meet here, she would get on my nerves inside of five minutes, the conversations just drag on forever. The conclusion of this book was watery and there was no \\"ah-ha\\" moment, just more vague conversations. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, it was recommended to me by Amazon.com because of my book purchases. Most of the time, its dead on, this book was a disappointment, big time!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"If you have some tolerance for a self-centered heroine, this is a great fast-paced book that you can read on a plane or stick in between more serious reading or even read in parallel with something else. The book kept me engaged. The ending, as several have remarked, wasn't the most satisfying possible, but it was the sort of loose-ends thing that life itself can be either. A good idea for a gift box at Christmas. Not so great for a book club. Does not make you think, develop any discussion points or present the locations interestingly, nothing. Just plain entertainment."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"if you didnt see this ending coming, for shame! I figured out the \\"twist\\" halfway thru and wondered what Unger had in store for the second half of the book. The answer? Not much at all. It was a slow, laborious read. And as the first book I read after Black Out, it was a real disappointment."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I was interested in purchasing the Kindle version of this book but saw that the price had been $0.79 and now it is over $7.00!!! Why the change?"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I'm conflicted when it comes to Beautiful Lies. There was a part of me that enjoyed the book; there were times in which I couldn't walk away from the story. However, there were things about this book that bothered me on so many levels. I've identified a few of them below:*For starters, there was Ridley. She has to be the most annoying protagonist I have encountered in a long time. I didn't appreciate her inflated sense of self, especially when she would interrupt the flow of the story to say, \\"I know what you're thinking.\\" I didn't particularly care for her convenient ignorance that seemed to materialize simply for the sake of suspense. Her rambling was out of control; I kept skipping these long sections of nothingness while screaming silently for her to get to the point. Finally, I never believed that Ridley was in her 30s; due to her immature actions and speech, her true age seemed to be that of a teenager.*There were too many inaccurate and murky details. For instance, Ridley was named after Ridley Scott, but Scott didn't make his first feature film until the late 70s, which was long after Ridley was born. How could her father have named her after a famous director who didn't become famous until Ridley was six or seven years old? In addition, time and space were too ambiguous. It seemed as if Ridley was walking the streets of NY alone at the most implausible times. Other details, such as the phone in her pocket with the open line, were murky and unnecessarily confusing as well.*Finally, a lot of the suspense/action scenes were too neat and easy. The diner scene, the meeting with the attorney and the climax were just a few of the neat and easy scenes that completely defied the laws of probability. I found myself saying aloud, \\"Ok, that would never happen.\\"As I mentioned earlier, a part of me liked the book. I simply would have liked it a lot better if I hadn't been distracted and annoyed by the elements mentioned above."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"When I staerted reading this book I really couldnt put it down. It has all the ingredients for a page turner. Why the 3 stars you ask? That's one reason. She is conatantly asking the reader questions and making &#34;asides&#34; I enjoy being a bystander not a participant. I also noticed how the main character was inconsistant, smart at getting some things and slow at other times. The way the author wrote was that you really wernt too far ahead of wat the characters knew, however, when Ridley or Jake made their apiphanies found myself saying &#34;yeah no crap ( no $?*!) I already knew this&#34;The book is an easy read and is a good mystery type book. I would have payed more for the book as for the most part enjoyed the read."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"A very quick read and one that holds your attention from the start. I found the story to be inventive and plausible. Also, the ending was believable in that not every question was answered and all loose ends neatly tied up. I found the heroine to possess realistic emotions."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"The whole time I was reading this book, I felt like I was reading the work of someone in high school. Just very juvenile way of story telling, bad editing...and the plot was a bit much. Don't think I'll be reading any of her other books."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I've read close to a hundred mystery-thrillers this year, and this one easily ranks among the top ten. I normally don't care for \\"literary\\" thrillers, but I thought BEAUTIFUL LIES was very well done.The plot is straightforward and intriguing. Ridley Jones is a freelance writer in her mid-30s who leads a relatively quiet life. That changes when she dramatically rescues a toddler who wanders into traffic. Ridley's heroic act makes her a media sensation, and raises her public profile. As a result of the media attention, Ridley receives a strange message from someone claiming to be her father--but she already has a father. This leads Ridley to investigate the truth about her background, which leads to some disturbing discoveries.Overall, this book is a lot of fun. I read it in one day. Lisa Unger is a very good writer and knows how to craft a good suspense plot. I agree with some of the reviewers that Ridley's ruminations about life can get slightly tiresome, but I didn't think it interrupted the flow of the story. Overall, I though Lisa Unger did a good job of balancing the plot with the more literary elements of the story.My one major quibble is that BEAUTIFUL LIES isn't a debut novel. Lisa Unger is the married name of Lisa Miscione, who has written four previous crime novels for a different publisher. So if you want to give a new author a try, don't buy this book. However, it is well worth a read, and I highly recommend it overall."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Ridley Jones rescues a three year old boy from getting hit by a van in the streets of New York. Purely coincidental, she gets her picture in the New York Post and her fifteen minutes of fame. Her ex warns her how strangers will be fascinated by her. However, nothing prepares her for the picture in an envelope she receives. At the same time, she has sexy new neighbor that she falls hard for. Ridley will discover Jake's lies as well as several others. She longs for her life the way it was just a few days ago. Who is on her side? Her first-person narrative reads like a journal; at times emotional other times rambling. By and large it was a mesmerizing work of fiction"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"There was something magical about this story and the way it was written. It was like drinking coffee with a friend at a little caf&eacute; as she shared the tragic experience she just went through. It was totally mesmerizing, thought provoking, and poignant that I couldn't put the book down. It is not a quick read by any means. Rather, you find yourself drawn into the story, swept away in suspense and finally left on a distant shore, exhausted but relieved to be at the last page. The ending itself is not neat. There are many questions left unanswered but the major ones have been dealt with and satisfactorily left behind. I could not find any complaints about this tale. It was thoroughly intriguing."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Horrible disappointment, I won't read anything else from this author. Main character is unlikeable despite the bravery shown in saving a youngster early in the novel and the tragic things that she struggles to remember early in her childhood. You would think yourself able to empathize with this character but she insists on being an ass throughout the book. I was even able to see the author and her attitudes in this book and work up an intense dislike for the her. She takes pains to describe all the physical attributes of her lover, which are apparently abundant, but never tells us what she looks like. Her attitude in the book is that the character would only be interested in this \\"Adonis\\", who makes her breakfast and brings it to her in bed. All the while she mouths platitudes about how looks mean nothing to her. Of course he is an artist, who does metal scultpture no less. How maculine. As a romance novel which I detest, I give this 2 stars. As a thriller or mystery I was hoping for I give it zero. A terrible, overrated author and one of the ten worst books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I was disappointed that the this book did not sustain the wonderful promise of its early premise. I thought the characterizations and plot development were very predictable and pedestrian. I don't usually read books that are written in the first person (I simply don't like that vehicle unless it's a memoir), but I read this one because it had been recommended. Perhaps I was not enthralled because I had just finished reading two amazingly well-written novels (The Girls by Lansens and Water For Elephants by Gruen). This first effort by Unger was not as well done as these other two, so the comparison was unfavorable. It simply didn't hold my interest and I didn't value the main character as I did in the other two books. I found it very mediocre."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Great book-- suspense,great detail, excellent read. I could not wait to move to the second book in the series"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This was an OK read, quick and easy. It was engaging enough, and enjoyable, but certainly not on my list of must-reads. If you're looking for a book to curl up with on a dreary winter weekend, this is a decent choice."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I'm looking forward to January when I cam buy a copy of SLIVER OF TRUTH, Lisa Unger's sequel to BEAUTIFUL LIES.\\"Everyone's always talking about how the truth will set you free and how nothing bad can come of facing it. I strongly suspected, in my case at least, that the truth was going to suck completely, that all my beautiful lies had been so much better.\\" Ridley Jones is a successful free-lance journalist in New York who rescues a young boy and then finds out that this simple act, the rescue of a child, has deadly consequences involving Project Rescue, a well-financed group of nuts who believe that abused children should be \\"rescued\\" from their abusers by any means necessary. This takes up most of Ridley's life from then on, and probably accounts for the reason that her parents, Dr. Ben Jones and his distant, beautiful wife Grace, wound up naming her \\"Ridley.\\" Ridley falls in love with an enigmatic stranger, Jake, her neighbor in Manhattan's trendy LES, where a severe yet goldhearted landlady, Zelda, rules the roost. Jake is sort of strange and it's apparent to Ridley that he's keeping secrets from her, yet she has no way of knowing that Jake, too, was once a victim of a scandalous ring of criminals.I wondered what would happen to Ridley's career working free-lance for Cinde Nast journals. Until she gets distracted, she has the sort of assignment most free lancers would kill for, interviewing Uma Thurman for VANITY FAIR. She treats Uma in the most cavalier way possible, completely stands her up, and never seems to think twice about it. OK, maybe Uma needs good press right now, for she's not at the top of the popularity polls, but I wonder if Lisa Unger, the talented thriller writer, thought about what would really happen to a journalist if they treated Uma Thurman as shabbily as Ridley does. The irony, of course, is that Ridley should have enlisted powerhouse Uma Thurman to help her in the action adventure comic that her life becomes. In KILL BILL mode Uma would have made mincemeat of Ridley's dozens of enemies.I also wonder if Uma really has a publicist called Tama Puma, as Ridley says. \\"Tama Puma,\\" Ridley ponders. \\"What kind of name is that, anyway?\\"Since you, Lisa Unger, made up that name, you should have the answer yourself. To me, \\"Tama Puma\\" isn't any odder than \\"Uma,\\" and it even rhymes with it. I guess we give Hollywood stars leeway to have unusual, creative names, far more leeway than wwe allow their assistants.That said, BEAUTIFUL LIES is a significant leap from the prose style of THE DARKNESS GATHERS, the last book by this author I read. She has a married name now, and more than that, Lisa Unger is twice the writer as \\"Lisa Miscione\\" used to be. Maybe a neew outlook on life has brought greater depth to her writing. Maybe moving to Shaye Areheart Books also helped her with details."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"What a tremendous journey of twists and turns with real and likeable characters!

Well, okay I put it down for three meals but that was all.Ridley Jones is the New York City hero of the week when she saves a toddler from being run down in the street. Her face is plastered all over the papers and she make appearances on all the morning news shows. Everyone recognizes her wherever she goes. Then she receives a package in the mail, in it is a photograph of a man, a woman and their baby. And suddenly she begins to question everything she thought she knew about her self, her life and the people she loves.I thought this was so well done. I loved the characters. The way Lisa Unger tells the story...I just thought this was a great story, very well done, a book to get lost in. I never wondered what the editor was thinking. I give it an A+"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!The story was captivating from page one....but beyond that, I got sooooo much out of this book.

The plot was very interesting and not at all predictable. The story had me so hooked that I had to finish the book in one day.On the downside, the writing was really strong in some parts and then suddenly fluffy in others. There were a couple of places where I felt I was reading something in the vein of chick lit or romance (not knocking that genre but not what I expected).The only other negative was I felt the story didn't wrap itself up to my satisfaction. I would have liked all the questions poised to have been answered.Would recommend this book, however, as a light mystery read."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"As someone who lived in NY for years,and worked as a freelance writer, I can say that Lisa Unger gets it right.

I can't believe this book made top book lists, who are these people?!!!!The author's style of writing is very adolescent and annoying. The plot was predictable so therefore the book dragged out when this book could probably have been a short story. The narrator kept on directing rhetorical questions to the reader which really put me off about the book as well.

The premise is fascinating and made more so by the fact that one could imagine this type of thing happening in the real word. The characters are richly developed and the story moves at a good pace. I highly recommend this title!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I didn't give this book five stars b/c if most readers are like me, they don't believe the five star reviews come from real people.Having said that, this book was un-put-down-able. I read it at traffic lights. I read it at every meal. When I finally put it down at night, I dreamed about it.Now, the DaVinci Code, it ain't - nothing could be. But not because the story isn't as good. This story is every bit as good as the god-book of all fiction. But because, at times, and not until the end, the first person gimmick of directing questions at the reader (\\"What do you think?\\") is a little off-putting. That aside, it is a really, very well-written story that sucks you in and makes you feel like you're standing on the sidewalk watching events unfold with your own eyes.Yesterday I actually stopped people I know and told them, \\"You have GOT to read this book.\\" That doesn't happen often.If you enjoyed The Time Travelers Wife or Digital Fortress (or any of Dan Brown's \\"other\\" books), I guarantee you will love this book.A comment to the publisher (clearly Lisa Unger had nothing to do with this): This book, physically, is very cheaply made. The paper is not of good quality and the binding is very loosey-goosey. I was very disappointed in the way it felt in my hands. I hope that as the book gains popularity and requires reprinting, you will take this into consideration."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I read this book in just a couple of days. Had it not been for kids, I'd have read it in one sitting!Unger's characters are well-drawn. Her pacing is perfect! Her scene-setting is vivid, and her voice is refreshing. The ONLY complaint I had, and it's a minor one, is the first person narrative directly addressing the reader, (\\"What do you think?\\"). I can't decide if I like it or if it's too cute for the room...I have a sense that Ms. Unger will mature into her voice and this technique will ripen and glow over time. Right now it's a little off-putting. But it didn't in any way detract from my total absorption in this book and my hearty recommendation!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This book is so freakin' predictable. Real-life crime stories on TV are far more entertaining and they are REAL. There were so many questions left unanswered (I smell an even lamer sequel coming on...) But the worst part??? The Q & A interview at the end of the book between the main character and the author! WTH?! So basically, the author interviewed her fictional self. Because no one else will. Because she's a terrible author. How did this ever get so many good ratings?! Do yourself a favor and find a more intelligent author who writes strong female leads and who actually does some research on law enforcement before writing about it."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I had such high hopes. This book had starred reviews which were apparently (forgive me) \\"beautiful lies.\\" I enjoy a good thriller, even if it isn't high art. But this isn't thrilling. It's slow. And the writing is belabored. Lisa Unger, the author, can't let a noun go by without attaching three or four adjectives or descriptive dependent clauses. People don't just sit on a couch. They walk across the warped, green, linoleum floor and bend their creaking knees to lower themselves, tiredly, to the velvet red couch bought second-hand on a street corner in Williamsburg on a rainy Thursday when no one wanted to be up but the sun was too bright to do otherwise. See what I'm saying? The main character enters a cheap pizza joint and the story stops for an entire page while we read all about the paneling, the floors, every person sitting in the place, and the posture of the proprietress. In other hands, maybe this would be interesting, but here it is like you're trapped in a conversation where the other person REFUSES TO GET TO THE POINT. Maddening. Do not waste your time."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"WOW!!! I predict a wonderful future for Lisa Unger's first novel, \\"Beautiful Lies.\\" I forecast its presence on the NY Times Bestseller List for many a moon. However, unlike a number of successful bestselling novels, this one is well written. It also has a most original plot and a quirky, three dimensional protagonist, as well as realistic minor characters. And, oddly enough, there are no real villains in a story where bad things certainly happen. In the novel her main character, Ridley Jones, says/thinks \\"there are no heroes or villains in real life, 'only good and bad choices.'Our gal Ridley is a thirty-something freelance writer who does work for Vanity Fair, New York Magazine, The New Yorker, etc., so she is pretty successful. But rents are high in New York City and even successful freelancers are hard pressed at times to come up with the rent. Ridley does not have this problem. She inherited a healthy sum of money from her uncle, \\"who wasn't actually an uncle,\\" but her father's best friend. He absolutely adored her. This money cushions her against potential poverty and allows her freedom from financial worries. And \\"freedom\\" is a concept of immense importance to her.Ridley's \\"fairly uneventful life\\" is turned upside down one morning...the morning she gains a bit more than her share of 15 minutes of fame. She sees a toddler about to be hit by a speeding truck and leaps into the street to save the boy. Fortuitously...or not, a photographer is on the scene and Ridley, in full action, appears on the cover of the local papers. The story is picked up by the morning talk shows where she and her family bask in the glory of her brief but bright spotlight. They have no idea what her moment of fame will bring her...like an envelope in the mail containing a note and an old photograph. The faded photo is of a young woman - who could be Ridley's double, a man and a little girl who resembles Ridley Jones as a little girl. The note includes a phone number and the question, \\"Are you my daughter?\\"Unhinged, our heroine seeks reassurance from her doting father, a successful pediatrician, and her mother, a controlling, uptight woman. They slough off the incident and tell her that some wacko is having a joke at her expense, insisting that they are her birth parents. Still uncertain, she looks for her older brother, a drug addict who lives on he streets, and when she finds him he makes some disturbing comments which fuel her confusion.Then she meets her handsome and mysterious new neighbor, Jake, a sculptor and a real hottie. Her life will never be the same.Set in Manhattan's East Village, just a few blocks from where I live, Ms. Unger really brings the neighborhood to life with her wonderful descriptive writing. \\"Beautiful Lies,\\" a taut psychological thriller is 375 pages long and I read it in 2 sittings. It is truly UNPUTDOWNABLE!!! I can't recommend a book more highly than that!JANA"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It wasn't necessarily about the story, although I was riveted, and compelled to turn pages to learn the outcome. Plain and simple, it was about the writing. Lisa Unger's style is refreshing and original. I felt like she, through the voice of her protagonist, was in the room with me, telling me this story.Beautiful Lies is a first-person account of a young woman named Ridley Jones, who contemplates a single act, and the events leading up to this act, that change her life forever. She became a momentary celebrity after saving a child from being hit by a car. Because her heroic and selfless deed was inadvertently videotaped, the world witnessed it on local and even national television, and her exposure enabled the truth of her identity to be exposed as well.Throughout the tale, Unger/Jones \\"talks\\" to her reader. \\"I know what you're thinking,\\" she often writes. At first I found this a little annoying, but ultimately, I had to admit in each case, she did know what I was thinking. She had me that hooked. Throughout the story, she interjects little gems of wisdom regarding family dynamics where her parents and brother (her biological parents and biological brother???) are concerned, which had me nodding my head and saying \\"yes!\\" One of my favorite lines in the book is: \\"It's strange how memory gets twisted and pulled like taffy in its retelling, how a single event can mean something different to everyone present.\\" Ultimately, the mysteries are revealed and all the characters--particularly the parents, the mysterious uncle, drug-addict brother, sexy man upstairs, ex-boyfriend and his mother, and the mob-linked laywer--are relevant and satisfying.This is a great, fast read and I recommend it for readers who appreciate good story telling and down to earth characters.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"If there's anything better than discoving a really great first-time author, I don't know what it is. I LOVED Beautiful Lies. Basically, once I'd picked up the book, I just couldn't put it down until I'd finished it.The protagonist, Ridley, was so real. She told her story in the first person and addressed the reader directly. I swear, I could be friends with her.And the story she had to tell... It started so plausably and got so convoluted. But I was with her every step of the way. Unger made me buy a fairly far-fetched plot. But mostly, I just wanted to know what was going to happen. What HAD already happened to this girl.Here's how it begins: Ridley Jones is a successful freelance journalist in NY. She's a happy person with a loving family and a good life. One day a random act of heroism gets her photo splashed across the news for a week. In the wake of her brief celebrity, she receives a photograph in the mail. It's a photo of man she's never seen, a woman who bares a striking resemblance to her, and a two-year old girl who looks like she did as a baby--though she's never seen a photo of herself that young. The accompanying note says, \\"I think you're my daughter.\\" Ridley is not adopted.The story aqccelerates at a break-neck pace from there. But aside from great characters, and a strong plot, this is an exceptionally well-written thriller. It's being billed as a \\"literary thriller,\\" and I don't know that I'd go that far, but this novel is way above average.I can't wait to see what Lisa Unger writes next. I hope she writes fast!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I thought I would love this book. I eagerly awaited its arrival from my book club. I was so disappointed. The premise seemed so promising but instead, I found the book predictable and unbelievable at times. The strangest feeling I had was that I didn't like ANY of the characters and that's a first for me. I didn't care if any of them were in danger. None of them were likable -- especially the heroine and her hunky boyfriend. I had to force myself to finish the book hoping the whole time that it would get better. This is coming from someone who adores a good novel full of mystery and intrigue."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"Simply ridiculous. Ridley's reactions to the secrets that are exposed are contrived and unbelievable. How did this book get so many 5 star reviews? I imagine its fans also loved the Twilight books..."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I read this novel in only 2 days, could not put it down because I wanted to find out what was going to happen. A woman gets \\"15 minutes of fame\\" through rescuing a little boy, and then out of the blue receives a package indicating that the people she thought were her parents might not actually be her parents. And when she tried to uncover where the package might have come from, she finds out some information that certain people do not want anyone to know about (and puts herself in possible danger by doing so). I had my suspicions about how the story would wrap up early on... but, not to give anything away, there were too many things that did not quite seem to make sense when I reached the end. NOT because I am too stupid to figure them out. Some things regarding who the father actually is (when you find out, you may have the same question... see my post in the forum below after you've read it), and the so-called shady connections of the lawyer in the story seemed kind of, well... let's just say that it seemed awfully contrived just to make the plot \\"thicker\\" and to throw the reader off the scent, and not something that might have realistically happened. And, there were some other items that were intentionally never really resolved at the end - you want to know WHY things happened, and the author either to be quirky or because she can't think of a reason herself (seems almost like she was under a deadline to get the book done and couldn't pull it all together adequately in time) gyps you out of a resolution after you spend your valuable time reading the whole thing."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I liked Lisa Unger'sFragile: A Novel, so I decided to check out her first novel, Beautiful Lies. Gosh, what a disappointment! The main character of this novel is the most immature, self-centered and annoying thirty-something you could ever imagine. You'd be hard pressed to find a 12-year-old as immature and bratty as Ridley.Ridley calls herself a writer, even though she never really writes anything. She never had to work for a living and has always been pampered by her relatives. This privileged life bores her and she decides to entertain herself with a touch of drama. The entire novel is about Ridley running from one man to another (her father, her brother, her former boyfriend, her new boyfriend), trying to get them to make her feel \\"safe\\" and \\"comforted.\\" When the safety and comfort they provide is not up to her standards, she runs out dramatically and rushes to the next man in line.This character is the biggest drama queen you can imagine. Every trivial little emotion she experiences or thinks she experiences gets analyzed to death. She blows every tiny little thing completely out of proportion and obsesses over it endlessly. I lost count of how many times she \\"almost\\" had a nervous breakdown for absolutely no reason. To give just one example of her drama queen skills, when her boyfriend asks her whether she prefers to call the person she is curious about on the phone or would she like him to go take a look at their house first, Ridley compares this choice with having to choose the method to kill yourself.Ridley regularly breaks into endless quasi-philosophical monologues filled with the most mind-numbing platitudes you can imagine. Equally annoying is her tendency to address the readers directly to tell them what she knows they must be thinking right now and why they are wrong in thinking it. The so-called mystery in this novel is pretty much non-existent. Anybody who is a little bit less of a drama queen than Ridley could have solved it in 15 minutes.In short, unless you like reading about spoiled rich drama queens, don't waste time or money on this book. I got the Kindle version for 78 cents, but I would have been pretty annoyed if I had to pay the full price for it."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I had not heard of Lisa Unger until I noticed her newly released paperback version of \\"Beautiful Lies\\".I read the back cover and was intrigued.

That's hard to do in a novel, much less your first attempt.My guess is Lisa Unger is going to have a very long stay at the top of her genre.The characters were very believable, and the plot nice and fresh.Definitely worth your time.

I figured her father was the pediatrician involved, there was baby stealing etc. etc. But, I was intrigued and couldn't wait to see how she was going to manipulated the reader and twist the plot. Well, there was nothing, nothing, very few \\"surprises\\".Too much was repititous, abs and stretched teeshirts, over and over; jeez; cover some other areas of the guys body.The first person narrative was ok--showing the character's personality and quirks very well. It did limit the story though.The absolute worst part and the reason for so few stars is---- spare us the cliches and lectures. Good literature will deliver those points to the reader without stating them. In this genre, maybe one time but over and over was not good. I actually cursed at the book. I am 60 years old; I have already thought about, many many times, the minor happenings that can change your life drastically, and I have already noticed, that life, while sometimes not, depends on your own choices.Lecturing to the reader throughout the book (a easy read mystery, non thriller) is disrespectfull and condescending.

There were also some plot twists that really didn't add anything to the story. So let me start picking it apart.The biggest problem was the author tried to write it so there was no villain in the story and to make all those who did wrong sympathetic, and I think that may have been the fatal flaw of the story.Take the Max character. There's a plot twist that he's really Ridley's father, but for me it just wasn't believable and seemed to be an attempt to make him sympathetic that just didn't work. There was nothing in the opening prologue that introduces us to Teresa Stone that would explain why she would lie to the wrong man that he was the father. And when the man got abusive, and she had to get out a restraining order, why wouldn't she tell him she lied? So the whole twist about Max being Ridley's father fell on a false note. The fact that it came from the two lying adoptive parents made it suspect and since Ridley never followed through with a DNA test on Christian Luna, the man Teresa Stone said was her father, and just accepted what lying parents said, the truth will never be known.The truth will never be known about Teresa Stone's murder, either. Why was she the only parent murdered of the children stolen by Project Rescue? Who murdered her? No satisfying explanation was offered."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I found this novel to be very predictable in its plot and characterisation. Of course the heroine had to be rich, talented and beautiful (well, basically)- her father was a doctor, she seemed to want for very little and had an enviable job interviewing 'celebrities'. The artist boyfriend wasn't fat and ugly and he had a very intriguing life story to suck in the heroine. The mythical rich 'uncle' was so \\"Daddy Long Legs\\" etc. The unfortunate brother living in a squat and disillusioned about life and the world, was such a cliche- and of course he still had some humanity and treated his talented sister civilly (while soaking up her money, as he had to, being a 'typical' dependent druggy). And why do people in certain countries have to think of killing others as the only solution to a problem? Just imagine if something like this happened in your neighbourhood... it's beyond the pale, even if it's meant to be fantasy. To me, this novel was just a mishmash of other authors' themes with some nice phrasing here and there. I'm being generous with the 2 stars!"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"um, yeah, golly, gee whiz...While the premise of this book sounded like a winner, I felt almost as if I was reading a Nancy Drew mystery, or a rejected Charlie's Angels script.

Anyway, just a girl in dopey love with the \\"hottie\\" private investigator - no matter that he nearly gets her killed and could possibly be a murderer... Why do so many women like these kinds of situations? D U M B.The book had an interesting storyline about kids being taken from abusive families and being sold to well-to-do families that would bring them up without the abuse. But then there was all this 'mob' cloak and dagger BS...Sorry, but this book was poorly executed. I guess if it was marketed as a teen-mystery or something, it might be okay, but for serious fiction, it was hopelessly lame and immature."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"The mysterious conspiracy at the core of the story is a little too easy for everyone to figure out except our heroine Ridley; and the epilogue is unsatsifying in that it spends more time contemplating the nature of free choice and not enough telling us who specifically wanted to kill the good guys. Nonetheless, this was a very good debut.It's billed as a literary thriller according to some reviews. To be honest, the parts of this book that work best are the thrills and - and especially the romance. It bogs down most when the author does try to get literary -- as in that overly talky epilogue. Until you get to that point though, it's a great thrill ride. The heroine is strong-willed, witty and likable; and her hero -- oh, my, he was fantastic. Dark and brooding and dangerous yet (of course) sensitive and artistic too. This is sort of a steamy romantic suspense novel for us over-educated Bridget Jones types who like to pretend we don't really read/believe in romances.One big quibble that made me nuts -- the heroine says early on she was given her name for the director Ridley Scott. But she was born around 1970-72 and Scott's first feature film came out around 1976-77. Prior to that, I believe he worked as a director at the BBC. Call me crazy, but it seems unlikely that a New Jersey pediatrician would be naming his daughter after an up-and-coming television director in Great Britain on the off chance that the guy will eventually become one of the world's greatest living film directors. Maybe there's a cult film prior to \\"The Duellists\\" that I just don't know about . . . ?"},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"The story/mystery definitely held my attention.

The story was gripping and fast paced, the characters well thought out and by the end of the book I wasn't left with any gaping holes in the plot or unanswered questions.Some of the plot was little predictable and in places a little far fetched but it didn't detract from my enjoyment overall. The writing style was a good indicator that Lisa Unger is going to be around for a while and enjoy some success.

Lisa Unger is a fabulous writer and she keeps you involved with the story in unique ways.

I am usually quick to skim through a paragraph because of superfluous adjectives. However in this case I found it added value to the story.

This is a well written story that kept my attention to the end. I will look for more books by this author."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"This is the only Lisa Unger book I have read and I purchased it due to the low price. If I had it to do over again, I would pass. The mystery was very thin and too easy for the reader to solve.

At some point I may try another, but not without sampling it first."},{"Title":"Beautiful Lies","review":"I've got this book on my E-reader, and it only cost me 99 cents. I hadn't read a thriller in a while, so I was looking forward to reading it. Unfortunately, I was let down by the book no later than chapter 4. To me, the author tried a bit too hard to create suspense. The vibe I detected early on was something like, \\"trouble's brewing.\\" but not in a suspenseful way. It was more as though Ms. Unger was telling us instead of just showing us and allowing it to develop. Good suspense should surprise you, thrill you, chill you, and maybe freak you out. I didn't experience any of this. In addition, the lead character, Ridley, was devoid of personality. None of the characters had any depth and I really didn't care what happened to any of them. The book inadvertently revealed itself very early on. Once I realized that nothing about it was original, it was pretty easy to unravel the mysteries. I eventually just started flipping pages until I got to the end."},{"Title":"What Is Random?: Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life","review":"A well meaning, but totally sloppy book -- botn in writing style and clarity of thought. Interesting for the range of topics it suggests relate to its subject, although its coverage of them is aweful. It is somewhat useful for the references it offers, in case the frustrated reader is still interested enough in the topics to try and make up for the book's own failures by reading up on them elsewhere. As for the rest, it is hard to follow and confusing on all but the most elementary points."},{"Title":"What Is Random?: Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life","review":"Beltrami's newest is a comprehensive view of randomness without ever coming to grips with any meaning of the concept. Sure, definitions are given, but simply the usual algorithmic so prevalent in recent popular works on computers. The interesting binary-string examples are in no way random in any intuitive sense of the word; they merely serve to illustrate his somewhat prolix text. If you are new to this field, these ideas, and the development of algorithmic &quot;randomness&quot;, then this is an outstanding book and to be recommended highly. If you are looking for something beyond the semantically sterile notions of reductionist randomness, then this book will leave you wondering why you bothered reading it."},{"Title":"What Is Random?: Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life","review":"For entry level (and with an elegance that goes far beyond that), there is nothing like this. I have been rummaging through sources looking in essence for this book -- one which straightforwardly, using common sense and logic wherever possible, with a masterful use of language, great clarity and also a sense of deeper aspects of the topic, walks me sensibly up through the concepts. I would rate this above anything I've seen from more popular authors (such as Nassim Taleb). This author is a great teacher, again a term I very rarely use, and I reserve for only the highest praise. The &#34;look inside&#34; feature confirms it. This book is bringing about a sea change in the level of my understanding, and is opening the doors for me to move readily to more technical books. I read maybe three books a week, and rarely am I brought to such rapt enjoyment, such an immediate sense of reward and gain for my time. I wonder why so many authors digress into noisy tangents and don't follow the thread and build block upon block so well as this one does!"},{"Title":"What Is Random?: Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life","review":"This book is contains a fairly substantial (from the layman's point of view) discussion of randomness. It discusses the fundamentals of probability, information/entropy, etc. It ends with an appendix of \\"technical notes\\", an appendix on binary notation and 6 pages of references. But it has no exercises, and presents its material as if the layman could assimilate it by simple passive reading. Not so. You need a paper and pencil. You need to manufacture exercises to master or even understand the material. I am comfortable with algebra and basic calculus, but got lost and gave up after a couple of chapters (I did not break out pencil and paper).If you are not mathematically sophisticated enough to just \\"get it\\" by reading, I suggest you buy a real textbook, where the author is actually makes a commitment to teaching, rather than mere exposition."},{"Title":"What Is Random?: Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life","review":"This is a wonderful book both for the science and mathematics laymen and also for those scientists whose experience with random phenomena may be limited to a particular application area. Professor Beltrami, with great erudition, wit and literacy, leads us on a fascinating journey through current mathematical thought on &quot;What is Random&quot;. Using examples from diverse fields, such as Statistics, Engineering , Anthropology (evolution), Linguistics, Psychology, Computer Science etc., he demonstrates how critical a role randomness plays in current scientific thought, and we see over and over again. clearly, how much of our &quot;organization&quot; hovers between order and disorder. We learn that the difference between a Shakespeare sonnet and the random output of a Monkey pecking at typewriter can be expressed in terms of its algorithmic complexity and that often, the difference between beauty and boring is often a mixture of just the right amount of randomness and redundancy. And also, for the non neophyte, Professor Beltrami offers a uniform vision of randomness connecting its many diverse faces. The mathematics throughout is the minimum required to remain rigorous and will not be daunting to the non-mathematical reader. Appendices with more mathematical details are available for those who wish to probe a little deeper. Accessible, readable and in many ways charming, I wholeheartedly recommend this book as an all around good read."},{"Title":"What Is Random?: Chance and Order in Mathematics and Life","review":"This is one of the best popularizations of mathematics that I have ever read.

Each scholar has museum expertise and each possesses an observant eye for stylistic and technical details, ideal qualifications for producing a complete catalogue of an artist's works. The strong point of this book is the text, which is accurate and written so well that it is comprehensible to both the scholar and the general reader. Whereas both authors contribute to the first two sections, the catalogue, which fills nearly half of the book, is largely the work of Tom Henry. Professor Henry is thoughtful and meticulous in his work. He has viewed every painting first hand to give each work careful attention.The book is arranged as a typical catalogue, with an explanatory text followed by a chronological survey of the artist's works. The first section contains five chapters that record the major episodes of Signorelli's career, divided more or less by decade. Each chapter is followed by endnote documentation. The general overview is followed by twenty-two full-page (sometimes double-page) color plates, also arranged chronologically, that highlight Signorelli's major works. The last two sections consist of a complete catalogue of Signorelli's paintings with black and white images and a general bibliography. The authors list one hundred and forty-eight works, including autograph works, collaborative pieces, and paintings begun by Signorelli but finished by others. The authors also introduce twenty-three paintings not found in any previous Signorelli catalogue; they list eight works of uncertain attribution; and they reject sixty-four works. Selected drawings are included alongside paintings to which they relate.Any weaknesses in the book lie in layout and design. The publisher was generous with color plates. However, the designer and authors must not have discussed the choice or placement of the 39 high-quality, full-bleed details of paintings interspersed throughout the opening pages and the five overview chapters, for they are not necessarily placed near text that discusses them. Each chapter is preceded by a color detail on the left and a white page with a chapter heading on the right. Although the details are taken from works discussed in the chapter they accompany, they may have no relation to their facing text, are never cited in the text, and often do not illustrate the authors' points. A few photographic diagrams in the catalogue section reconstruct the possible arrangement of various parts of mutilated altarpieces. One photograph gives a partial sense of the total space in the fresco program at Orvieto, Signorelli's acknowledged masterwork.Both authors keep Signorelli's importance in his own day in the forefront of their passages as they point out his major contributions to Italian Renaissance painting. The superb scholarship and accessible text of Henry and Kanter should help raise Signorelli from his undeserved relative anonymity to the prominent position he held in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries."},{"Title":"Fanny and the Regent of Siam","review":"If you have read \\"Louis and the King of Siam\\" you will definitely want to read this. Whereas the story about Louis is strictly historical and very detailed, \\"Fanny and the Regent of Siam\\" is more of a novel based on real history (rather like Margaret Landon's \\"Anna and the King of Saim\\", it claims to be about 75% factual), it is a bit light on factual detail especially in the first few chapters.The Story is about Fanny Knox (daughter of the British consul) and her husband Phra Preecha. The Regent is Somdetch Sri Suriwong who is deeply offended when Fanny marries Preecha instead of his own grandson Nai Dee. The ultimate consequences of this are dire.One of Fanny's other suitors was Louis Leonowens (son of Anna (subject of \\"Anna and the King\\" and \\"The King and I\\")), who ended up marrying Fanny's sister Caroline Knox, when it became apparent that Fanny's affections were directed elsewhere.This story clearly illustrates the lack of power wielded by King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), during his youth, while Siam was under the Regency of Suriwong."},{"Title":"Born lucky Reflections of life on a northern Michigan farm","review":"I bought this book after Elmer had passed away.

If I were giving a rating for characters, I'd give it four stars, but unfortunatly, the story is really lame. The improvment over the last book, &quot;Fortune's Wheel&quot;, was that a lot of the soap opera dramatics have been toned down, but they're still there. Also, characters do a much better job of communicating, for the most part, and avoid a lot of petty arguments that plagued the last book. However, it's still very melodramatic and silly, with subplots that really become irritating after awhile. There is entirely too much going on at the same time, and the cliffhanger ending is a total cheap shot.Part of what I find so troublesome is the whole telepathy thing that seems to know no boundries. Anything can be achieved through telepathy. When it gets to teleportation and (shudder) TIME TRAVEL, well, it's gone a little too far, and the whole time travel storyline causes the entire plot to colapse within its own paradox by the end. I'm really getting sick of all the telepaths and Leskas. Isn't there anyone else on this planet besides telepaths?And speaking of Sholan society, this was another huge problem I had. Actually it was more of an uncomfortable feeling than a problem. The sexual freedom that the sholans have was just unnerving and it didn't work for me. They don't have any problem with sleeping around, in fact, they do it a lot. When the Sholans aren't grinning, flicking their ears, or drinking c'shar, they're having guilt free sex. I'm sorry, but creatures who are capable of every single human emotion except jealousy is just stupid. Their concept of love is totally warped in this area.So why did I finish reading it? Well, like I said, in spite of myself I liked these characters. I've grown fond of them and have been willing to put up with the insipid story line because of that. I like Kusac, Carrie, Vanna, Garras, Konis, Merral and the rest. There is a real sense of honor and friendship among them. I even grew to like Kaid by the end, eventhough I pretty much couldn't stand him for most of the time. But by the end he finally cracks and starts to show some emotion. I grew to like him the same way I grew to like Konis in the last book.I don't know if I'll read the next one. I can't take much more of these rediculously stupid plots. The books are also much longer than they need to be, because for over 750 pages, there just wasn't a lot of content inside."},{"Title":"Fire Margins (Sholan Alliance)","review":"I have a very bad habit when it comes to books. Two habits actually -- I always try to finish a book that I start, no matter how bad it is, and I try to finish a series if I start one. Sometimes the books start off really great and then take a wrong turn somewhere and plunge into the depths. Or a so-so series begins to get it together about halfway and I get hooked.Sadly, in Lisanne Norman's ongoing series of science fiction novels, this hasn't been happening. Set in the far future, where humanity is starting to colonize the galaxy, but things aren't turning out too rosy. They've landed smack-dab into the middle of a long, drawn out war between the Valtegans, a reptilian species, and the Shola, a race of feline telepaths.Now in the third volume, we're dealing with Sholan mythology and legend, and with the troubles of humans and Sholans intermingling, bith in personalities and in genetics. The story also picks right up where the previous novel ends -- Carrie, Kusac's human mate, is suffering from her battle to keep him and the loss of their unborn child. Kusac, the Sholan part of the pair, is fighting with his family and the telepathic guild and the Brotherhood to keep the human and Sholan bondpairs from interference from the more traditional elements of Sholan society. And especially from Lijou and Esken, who seem to have personal grudges against Kusac, the Humans, and the self-appointed guardian to Kusac and Carrie -- Kaid.In fact, a lot of this story centers around Kaid, his past relationships, the one that he has with Dzaka, and especially with Carrie and Kusac. The other large plotline in this story is a growing rebellion that is being launced by a religious fanatic who feels that all telepathy is evil, and naturally, it's up to Carrie, Kusac and Kaid to fix it, and they use a religious rite of passage known as the 'fire margins' to fix it. Unfortunately, no one has ever returned from the fire margins alive, either...This is marginally better than the previous novel, but I am not filled with much hope for the next one in the series either. While the author has certainly come up with an interesting premise for her human-feline races, and there are brief moments of excitement and action, this is still a pretty leaden work that steadily plods along.A very average read. Somewhat recommended."},{"Title":"Fire Margins (Sholan Alliance)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I thought the idea of Leska links and the culture of the Sholans was original and very inventive. I do wish I would've started this series in the beginning though, because some the book can be difficult to understand in the beginning if you don't. However, I just bought the entire series and will read Fire Margins again so that I can get the entire feel of the book and understand it more.This book was a good piece of literature and I hope she continues writing."},{"Title":"Fire Margins (Sholan Alliance)","review":"I absolutely loved Turning Point and Fortune's Wheel. I liked Carrie and Kusac, and even Kusac's family. Even Kaid. All that has been destroyed in this book for one main reason. Carrie and Kusac had a wonderful relationship, and there was no reason to destroy it, along with the story, but destroy it has been done. By allowing Carrie to have an approved affair was absolutely disgusting, the worse because it was sanctioned. There was no need for that. Not only that, I tortured myself by reading the later books and it only got worse.Read the first two books and STOP THERE. The rest of the books are not worth your time."},{"Title":"Fire Margins (Sholan Alliance)","review":"i've read the first four novels in the series, am almost finished with Dark Nadir. my only dissapointment is that the next book is not yet available. believable aliens, great heroes! i can't wait for stronghold rising!please hurry, ms. norman!"},{"Title":"Fire Margins (Sholan Alliance)","review":"Well, there was no science, no logic, no true conflic (even though there is war) and a bunch of romance: this equils a no - brainer.

I know this wouldn't apeal to the male audiance (I am woman though)To much pointless relationships and no action. All in all, I don't think it is right to burn a book, but this one sure did get my bon-fire started rather well! This book is NOT recremanded unless you like those pointless romances with no real steady plot."},{"Title":"Fire Margins (Sholan Alliance)","review":"It says something that I've read up to the third book, but sometimes I wonder why I'm still reading it. I suppose it's because the story itself is really good despite problems in style, and the secret soap-opera lover in me likes the interplay between the characters, particularly the romance between humans and the feline Sholan. Ms. Norman has steadily improved her writing since her amateurish debut in Turning Point, but she still seems to be childish in her style . . . it's like a drama written for teenagers, with emotional histrionics, people being immature, plots randomly thrown in for tension, etc. The main draw for me is the Sholans themselves, and the touchy-feelie closeness you experience as you read. A good read, but intellectually and stylistically still immature."},{"Title":"Fire Margins (Sholan Alliance)","review":"I've read all three books in this series, and I loved all of them, but especially this one.

I can't wait for book #4. :"},{"Title":"Fire Margins (Sholan Alliance)","review":"Fire Margins is the third novel in the Sholan Alliance series, following Fortune's Wheel. The initial work in this series isTurning Point.In the previous novel, Vanna has saved the lives of Carrie and Kusac when they suffer Contact Deprivation and Kaid has saved Carrie from an impulsive assassin. Carrie interrogates a Valtegan prisoner, who promptly commits suicide. Carrie, Kusac, Kaid and Vanna are taken to Shola, where Carrie meets Kusac's family...and his betrothed, Rala Vailkoi. Carrie becomes pregnant, but loses the fetus in a duel with Rala. Vanna is then kidnapped by Dzaka and taken to view a Valtegan skeleton found among Sholan ruins.Carrie and Kusac, and the other Leska pairs, are being used as political tools by the Telepath Guild, the Brotherhood of Vartra, and the Sholan military. They have found temporary protection with Alien Relations, which mandates all mixed Leska pairs to be housed on the heavily secured Aldatan estate. However, they need to establish independence from the Guilds and Clans. To do this, they decide to visit the Fire Margins and become the En'shalla -- in the hands of the gods -- Clan, but several events, including the wounding of Carrie and Kusac during the duel, have precluded this effort.The Fire Margins are not a physical place, but a situation encountered in a trance. No telepath has every returned from the Fire Margins, but Carrie and Kusac believe that telepaths who are able to fight will have a much better chance. However, they need a third person to form a triad and they choose Kaid.This novel begins to explore the role of the Sholan gods in society. It includes several direct contacts between the characters and the god Vartra. What is Vartra and what do the Fire Margins have to do with him?(...). Moreover, the control that Sholan females have over conception almost totally eliminates unwanted pregnancies. Indeed, the Sholan males are completely dependent upon the good wishes of the females if they want to have cubs; even rape doesn't work against a determined female. I can see where that would bother many males in our society, as evidenced by the deeply felt opposition to birth control.Once again, this series dwells on the doubts and conflicts among the main characters. This novel focuses on Kaid more than the others, but Carrie, Kusac and other characters have problems of their own which they must work out on stage.Recommended for all Norman fans and anyone who enjoys psychological motifs in a SF setting.-Arthur W.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the solution to this mystery is quite apparent about halfway through the novel. I sort of wanted to shake Mrs. Oliver and Poirot and ask them how they could be so obtuse and not realize the solution. The quirks our beloved Poirot typically display are all gone here; all that is left is rather dry prose and a mystery that should have been shortened by about sixty pages. Having said all of that, it does make for a quick read that does not require much thinking. If you are looking for a great example of a murder-in-retrospect book by Christie, I would recommend \\"Five Little Pigs\\" instead."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Poignant story contains more dialogue than action but does have one of Christie's best twist endings, which is also a real heartbreaker.

Personally, I enjoyed this book. Christies narrative is top notch and the solution to the mystery is neatly tied up and intuitive. I tought Christie did an excellent job of taking the reader from point A to point B and all the way to the end. Little clues were dropped along the way, as well as a few blind turns. As always, Christie's characters are interesting and well-written. My only complaint, and its a minor one, is that the solution was a bit predictable. Not necessarily a bad thing."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Hercule Poirot's friend Mrs. Oliver has so many godchildren that she has lost track of them, and she has not thought of her god daughter Celia Ravenscroft for many years. She receives a visit from Mrs. Burton-Cox, a woman whose son wishes to marry Celia. She has a strange request--that Mrs. Oliver find out whether Celia's mother killed her father or vice versa. She does not reveal her reasons for wanting this information, but her request sends Mrs. Oliver right to Poirot who does much of the sleuthing for her. The two friends take separate paths in order to interview as many people as possible who can remember things from the Ravenscrofts' past. Mrs. Oliver dubs the witnesses as \\"elephants\\", people who will not forget important details which may help them solve the case. The mystery in this particular novel is not as difficult for the reader to unravel as it is in most of Christie's books, and that spoiled the fun for me a bit. Uncharacteristically the author reveals too many clues too early in the book, but it still is worth reading."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Great bookI bought this book on tape by John Moffatt (no! not BY him, but read by him). This book proves a theory though; there's a significant change in Mrs. Christies writing over the years; the nice young lady who writes well-puzzled, crafted, formula, to-the-point murder mystery; and the old lady who's slightly bitter to the modern world, but writes more real and cozy books, about peoples lives. More relaxed and less upthight books. This book falls into the latter category. That doesn't mean it' a bad book, no-no! It's good, but different from earlier works. The later books seem to be more relaxed, and more about looking back, and viewing things from a distance; about great characters telling(not acting)great stories! This book really has a realistic ring to it; it has good, funny characters. It's not as \\"British murder mystery\\" as some of her other work, but more real, somehow.PS. Those of you who didn't like the book, get a hold of John Moffatt's reading, he's great! Really makes the characters come alive!!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This mystery novel with 'Elephants' in its title uses the word elephant metaphorically to identify humans with long memories. The protagonist, Ariadne Oliver, with help from investigator Hercule Poirot, contacts such 'elephants' to find the answers to a twelve year old double suicide or murder-suicide; that being the mystery.Story has nothing to do with real elephants and no elephant ever appears in it. Enjoyable typical of Christie stories I think."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"i was so astonished when reading this book as it kept me on the exciting pace with the good plot....(not near perfect as in death on the nile, murder on the orient express and and then there were none)but it took me to the upper level of curiosity....try this one..."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Celia Ravenscroft is but a little girl when both her parents commit suicide. Never did she worry about the real reasons for that dramatic event, until today when she stands on the verge of getting married to Desmond Burton-Cox. Only one question suddenly seems of importance: Who killed whom, Celia's father or mother? Reason enough for Ariadne Oliver, Celia's godmother, to pay a visit to her old friend Hercule Poirot. The famous sleuth persuades Mrs. Oliver to delve -with his guidance, of course- into the past, to find the persons who are like elephants, the persons who will still remember the important details about this all-but-forgotten tragedy.Elephants Can Remember is Agatha Christie's next to last work of detection and the author shows clearly signs of age, which is understandable since she was eighty-two years old and in failing health.Elephants Can Remember is a \\"murder in retrospect\\" mystery. Although Christie has proven to fully master this format -see Sparkling Cyanide and Five Little Pigs- she now quickly looses touch with the story. She is forced to sow the narrative together with vague memories of a series of old spinsters and suddenly even events that should easily be remembered are covered by the veil of forgetfulness. No surprise that the plot is total confusion. It is less a mystery than a scrapbook of memories. Action is less important than atmosphere, which makes the story quite tedious and difficult to hang on to. Nevertheless, the experienced reader will figure out the solution to this not too mysterious mystery halfway through the book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This must be the worst Agatha Christie book ever. It's her very last Hercule Poirot novel, and one can see that the writer is very old by now (82). There is no freshness left in her prose; it is stale, predictable, corny, and generally trashy. As other reviewers have said, the material contained here would barely be enough to sustain a short story. To make a full-length novel out of this really is ridiculous. The book fails at what normally is Agatha Christie's greatest strength: the plot and the denouement. With dozens of pages left to go, the reader *knows* the solution! Unheard of in the world of Christie; if for nothing else, then for this the novel cannot be rated higher than 1 star. However, the characters and dialogs are boring and cliche-ridden as well, so the book has no redeeming qualities either. Nothing ever happens on the 200 pages of this book; no crime, no mystery, no real conflict among characters; it's all just endlessly boring talk, talk, and nothing but talk about the past. The only interesting thing, perhaps, is to contemplate the autobiographical hints Christie gives us in describing one of the novel's detectives, Ariadne Oliver -- a mystery writer. But these hints are only interesting because they throw light on our favourite writer, Agatha Christie -- they are not interesting in themselves and therefore do not improve the book's literary quality. It was excruciating to have to wade through the turgid prose of this book; this title cannot be recommended to anyone except extreme Christie enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"\\"Elephants Can Remember\\" does not read like a typical Hercule Poirot mystery. Agatha Christie's famed detective is drawn into an old case by his friend, the amateur sleuth and mystery writer Ariadne Oliver. The case involves what was apparently the double suicide of a loving husband and wife, and the concern that these past actions might have left a horrible impact upon their children.The story switches between the findings of Ariadne Oliver and Hercule Poirot as they each go in search of 'elephants' who might remember what happened around the time of the accident, because after all, an elephant never forgets. While there is no definite evidence as to what happened, there are those who have never accepted the double suicide theory because they couldn't answer the question why. But with Poirot and Mrs. Oliver working together, a long-unspoken truth is certain to be uncovered.\\"Elephants Can Remember\\" is classic Agatha Christie, in terms of mystery. It's central mystery has a unique, if perhaps a little predictable, twist, the denouement of which is quite evenly paced and satisfactory. However, this might be one novel where the time period of the plot is more glaring than others. The prose is heavy-handed at times and one does get a little sick of all the mentions of 'elephants'. The characters are borderline two-dimensional and, therefore, the reader does not care about them, even if they are still interested in the mystery at hand."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I know Christie was pretty old when she wrote this book, so it pains me to be so negative, but her age really does show. The story isn't interesting, the mystery isn't mysterious and the characters are paper-thin -- even Poirot seems like a shadow of his usual self. The exception is Ariadne Oliver, who gets a remarkable amount of development for someone who ostensibly is just a side character. This is her final appearance in a Poirot mystery, and she gets an excellent send-off. The same cannot be said for Poirot. This is the final Poirot novel that Christie wrote, though not the final one that was published, since she wrote his real finale years earlier and set it aside to be published after her death. I haven't read it yet because I cannot bear to, so I'm saving it to be the last new Christie book I ever read. I just hope it's superior to this one!In this one, Poirot and Mrs. Oliver are trying to figure out what happened to the parents of one of Mrs. Oliver's god children. They were found shot to death in the woods, but what happened? Did the father shoot the mother or vice versa? Was it a suicide pact? Mrs. Oliver is asked to investigate by a woman she meets at a luncheon, then proceeds to go about interviewing a lot of people she hasn't seen in many years, to ask questions about what was happening in the family, to try and put the pieces together with Poirot, who is busy talking to the police. It's quite similar toFive Little Pigs (Also published as Murder In Retrospect), another Poirot murder in retrospect. The difference is that you'll be able to spot the solution to this one miles off, as I was. I can now say that about only three of her books (Peril at End House: A Hercule Poirot Mystery (Agatha Christie Collection)andThe Mirror Crack'd (Miss Marple Mysteries)being the other two) and sadly, it doesn't make for a very interesting read. More annoying still is that in this book, a character writes to Poirot and tells him that in order to solve the mystery, he should find and interview person X, because she might be able to help them with the truth. And so after pages and pages of wasted time, Poirot finds and interviews X, and she KNOWS THE ENTIRE EXPLANATION TO THE MYSTERY. She is flown to England, she tells her story and then the mystery is solved. So tell me again why Poirot and Mrs. Oliver were even needed?! That guy could've talked to this character himself anytime he liked! Christie also employs a method I've seen her resort to in just one other book -- she has Poirot, the master detective . . . hire a detective! In lieu of actually writing plot development, she settles for pages of exposition as a man shows up and tells Poirot all the details he needs to know about a specific character. And she later turns out to have no bearing on the mystery whatsoever, so the entire interlude was a colossal waste of time. Normally I'd decry this as a lazy author's way to get out of writing an additional chapter of action, but in Christie's case I'm charitable enough to substitute the word \\"lazy\\" with the word \\"elderly,\\" which makes the choice understandable if not forgivable.On the whole, I have to admit that I wouldn't even recommend this book to a die-hard Christie fan. But if you're dead set and determined to read everything she ever wrote, then go for it. I am too, so I can sympathize. Just be prepared to be bored and let down big time by this one. It's just not up to Christie's usual standards. Luckily, she wrote enough phenomenal, classic stories to be sure that her legacy would remain in tact regardless of what she published, and all Christie newbies can rest assured: it gets a heck of a lot better than this."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie, but this mystery was lacking. I figured out whodunnit about halfway through the novel, but thought to myself, &quot;No...it can't be so-and-so! That would be too obvious.&quot; Well, guess what. It was. It was still a good read because I enjoy Ms. Christie's writing style and interactions between characters. If the mystery itself is not the only important part, then it's a worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Inspite of a good character analysis and settings, this book falls much much below the usual standard of A.C. The plot especially is a BIG let-down and the climax falls flat. That even A.C should resort to such predictable wool-over-the-eye is amazing. The structure is very little different from Five Little Pigs - if Elephants Can Remember then Pigs can recall much better!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"It could have been solved in half the time. But it is not, and to appreciate or understand this novel, readers must place it in the proper context.The problem was at first vague; Ariadne Oliver was asked by a stranger if the mother of Ariadne's goddaughter killed the father, or was it vice-versa. The deaths were actually some twenty years or more before. As the stranger was the mother to a man who was contemplating marriage to Ariadne's goddaughter, she could be partially forgiven for her apparent concern. Of course one of the things Ariadne did was to call on Hercule Poirot, and together they embarked on elephant-chase to pry for secrets from the past.&quot;Elephants can remember&quot; was published in 1972, that is 52 years after the first Poirot novel &quot;The Mysterious Affairs at Styles&quot;. Many people did not even live that long. Agatha Christie aged her characters along with the years, and therefore there were cases that were different from bodies being found all over the place.Other similar novels before this whereby Christie's detectives investigate deaths long in the past included Dumb Witness, Five Little Pigs, Mrs McGinty's Dead, Ordeal By Innocence, and Nemesis. The common theme among them was that the investigator(s) had to depend on memories of various people who might not even be present; but from their recollections, clues were found to provide either the definitive picture of the culprits or the definitive picture of the crime. What a lot of impatient readers would find irritating was having to sift through the useful information from the useless. Elephants is such another tale.Mystery veterans would probably have been able to jump to the solution before Poirot's grand finale, but would they have been able to unravel the threads in the manner necessary? Proofs have to be gathered, and evidence, motivation, etc were all the necessary persuasions for Elephants before they would give up their secrets.The meat and drink of this novel is more than solving the mystery of who killed who, but to recapture the atmosphere, the mood, the aura of that time in the past, and to be able to put events in their proper perspectives. Also no less important was Poirot's being able to relate the past (in its correct perspective) and its impact on the present in order for persuade the elephants to give up their secrets."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This novel written in the twilight of Dame Agatha's long and illustrious career (1972) would have been better left on the cutting room floor. It was especially painful for me to read because I not long ago re-read her vibrant, lively and completely mystifying \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" which was written in 1927. The comparison was depressing.Hercule Poirot is teamed with Mrs. Oliver, a crime novelist, to find the truth of a 15-20 year old murder/suicide. Mrs. Oliver's goddaughter, Celia is the daughter of the couple who supposedly entered this pact. For the first one-half of the book, we are not advanced an inch in any direction. Many people are interviewed (the \\"elephants\\" of the title) and most have vague memories of the couple, as does Mrs. Oliver herself. Mrs. O's dithering is not artlessly charming, for we are as confused as she. Saddest cut of all, the red herrings are not \\"herrings\\" at all. They are giant signposts. Rather than Poirot gracefully unraveling the mystery on the last page, the reader has left him in the dust 50 pages ago. The prose has a distinctly purplish hue.According to the publisher, \\"Elephants Can Remember\\" was originally published as \\"Five Little Pigs.\\" I do not recommend this book, because it does not do Dame Agatha justice. There are 75 titles to choose that will far better reflect her abilities and why she earned the title \\"Queen of Crime.\\""},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Whose work are we actually reading at this point? There were major differences in punctuation, word choices, and scene breaks between the original Collins and Dodd Mead editions of this novel. There were further differences between the Dodd Mead editions republished by Random House/Avenel and the Dodd Mead editions republished by Simon & Shuster/Pocket. There are further additions still in the recent Signet, Berkley, and Leventhal and Black editions. For every publishing house putting out her works, there seem to be a new batch of editors altering Agatha Christie's words and the sound of her voice. Here the publishers at Collins, dissatisfied with their own earlier efforts, put still more distance between author and public with a \\"New Ed\\" edition. What's the matter with these publishers? Whose voice do they think we want to hear when we sit down to a novel by Agatha Christie? And what will she sound like twenty years from now? It's frightening that her estate has failed to see the importance of guarding her words as she wrote them. Please tell me I'm not the only one here who senses that a crime has been committed."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am fan of Christie's work but this one is a huge disappointment.

The plot line involves a murder mystery that happened in the past. Much of the novel is devoted to unraveling what happened through conversations with various people who knew the people involved. There is so much repetitiveness as the chatty Ms Oliver talks to all those people, hashes things out in her mind, then tells Poirot what she was told, then he hashes things in his own mind, then he tells others, ... Uh! The same \\"fact\\" or \\"theory\\" is repeated in many places, to the point of insulting the reader's intelligence. This is so unlike Christie where every word had its purpose. Perhaps one better think of this novel as a study of human memory. Overall I give it 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Elephants Can Remember is Dame Christie's last Poiret full-length story according to most sources and written when the author was clearly playing the back nine. This is one of the few detective novels that even I could figure out who had done it and most of the methods long before the Belgian detective assembled the remaining characters at the scene of the crime.Some will say this is Christie's weakest product. I have not read them all so I will not make that judgement but it clearly suffers from a worn out plot and formulaic proceedings. We all know that elephants are claimed in nursery rhymes to never forget but this seems to be a revelation to Poiret and the aging writer Miss Oliver. As Christie's alter-ego, Miss Oliver is suffering the foibles of age, including total inability to recall anything or anyone, and stress over shortcomings in one's career, such as writer's block, and fear of crowds and public speaking.In a clever construct, both Poiret and Miss Oliver set out simultaneously to determine the relevant facts in a decade-old case of murder, suicide, or accidental death. Poiret warns all at the on-set that nothing good will come from this painstaking re-enactment but it seems there are always some things that daughters and odious in-laws need to know. Unfortunately for Miss Christie's reputation, she relies on a tired method of including twins in the mix so we all can see where this is going, especially when it becomes clear that the late husband had been in love with both twins."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Hugh Fraser is the perfect narrator for Agatha Christie books. Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver banter back and forth and it is a delight to listen to this story. It kept me riveted from start to finish."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"It was with a certain sense of sadness that I read \\"Elephants Can Remember\\", knowing that it was the last book Agatha Christie ever wrote that featured the beloved characters of Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver. Of course, there isCurtain, which stars Poirot and takes us to the end of his career as a detective, but this had been written several years prior in order to give Poirot a proper send-off and published after Christie's death.So this, for all intents and purposes, is one of the last Poirot mysteries, and certainly the last appearance of Ariadne Oliver, the mystery novelist that Christie often used as a self-insert to convey her own experiences and frustrations as an author. These would range from Ariadne's irritation with her literary protagonist (as Christie similarly held toward Poirot), to her habit of eating apples while she worked, to her bemusement at certain readers who would write to her in order to point out her mistakes. Here, she expresses her awkwardness concerning fans that gush excessively over her work.At a literary lunch Ariadne is approached by a compete stranger and asked a question about a godchild she hasn't seen in years. The woman who introduces herself as Mrs Burton-Cox asked Ariadne an incredibly personal question concerning her god-daughter Celia Ravenscroft's deceased parents: was it Celia's mother who killed her father, or Celia's father who killed her mother? It takes a while for Ariadne to remember the circumstances that she's referring to, but finally recalls that Alistair and Margaret Ravenscroft were found shot dead near their house, in such a way that made it impossible for the police to tell whether it was a double suicide or a murder/suicide.Ariadne discovers that Mrs Burton-Cox's son is engaged to be married to Celia Ravenscroft, and suspects that his mother is trying to form a wedge between the two of them by insinuating that Celia may have inherited murderous impulses from one of her parents. But Ariadne seeks out her god-daughter's permission to investigate the deaths further, and wanting to know more about her parents' demise, Celia agrees. Naturally, it is to Hercule Poirot that Ariadne turns, and together the two of them go on the hunt for \\"elephants.\\"The witnesses are all elderly now, and it all happened so long ago, but Ariadne has faith in the \\"elephants\\" of the old saying; and Poirot agrees, believing that even little details and false assumptions may prove valuable. Together the two of them try to piece together the mystery of the past, in a book that relies heavily on oral testimony and the memories of those present.As a book written near the end of Christie's life, it's clear that she's slowing down. \\"Elephants Can Remember\\" has a few recycled concepts, several flat characters, and is one of only two of her books (thus far) in which I've been able to guess the conclusion far in advance. And trust me, if I can guess it, anyone can! There are lots of meandering speeches, some inconsistencies regarding the time-line, and many obvious details are held back simply because they would telegraph the ending too soon. Finally, solving the case has less to do with deduction than it does with finding the person who knew what happened all along.Yet there's a lingering presence of melancholy present that makes the story more important for its context than its content. Christie knew that she was nearing the end of her life when she wrote it, and so there's an emphasis on lost love, putting the past to rest, and young couples looking forward to the future with hope. Likewise, the fact that Christie may have been in the first stages of Alzheimer's disease brings certain bittersweetness to the fact that the novel relies so heavily on the importance of memory.It's rather sad to read, but impossible to dismiss if you are lasting fan of the author, especially since it's clear that Christie was getting ready to say goodbye."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"It is quite obvious, early on in this book, that the author was advanced in years. The math is off, so badly, and so often, whenever the subject of years comes up: how many years ago did it happen? How old is so-and-so now? etc. Also, the only character who remains essentially himself is Poirot, pretty much; Ariadne Oliver, though only supposedly middle-aged here, is more muddled than most eighty-year-olds I know. Even the victims' ages: 60 and 35? Pretty unusual, that. If the wife/victim were only 35, why was she so worried about her advancing age?So, if the reader can get past all the muddle, it is still an entertaining read, IF, as I say, the reader is a die-hard fan. I am, so it was worth it to me.PARTIAL SPOILER ALERT: Christie's denouement of the crime is about as unrealistic as it can get. She really hearkens back to very early Christie, in her inability to understand, much less handle, romantic love in any sort of realistic manner."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I re-read this one recently, as it was one of the first Christie novels I read as a teen. Something about it had always stuck in my mind. It is interesting re-reading all her novels now and especially interesting to see the reviews of this one.Funnily enough I agree that it has several weaknesses and the fact that this is a \\"later Christie\\" shows. There are some points (a couple of children mentioned that I thought would at least be interviewed are only mentioned, no present-day action etc) that make this book compare unfavourably to her better ones. Also, Poirot doesn't quite sound like himself in this one and if Ariadne Oliver irritates you, you may want to pass anyway!Having said that, there is something quite melancholy and haunting about the ultimate resolution. If you take this more as a romantic mystery/tragedy, I think you will appreciate it better."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am on an Agatha Christie run right now.

This grand dame informs Ariadne that her stepson Desmond is planning to wed Cecilia Ravenscroft. Desmond is the son of Kathleen Fee who was the mistress of Mrs. Burton-Cox's first husband. Fee was a wealthy actress who has died leaving a large fortune to DesmondBurton-Cox wants Ariadne to investigate Celia' background. It is believed that Miss Ravencroft's parents committed suicide. Another theory is that Celia's father Sir Alistair Ravenscroft killed his much younger wife Molly or she murdered him. The murderer was then believed to have killed him/herself The unsolved case occurred some fifteen years prior to the novel's action.Ariadne refers to persons who worked or were otherwise acquainted with the deceased Ravenscroft couple as old elephants. This is because Oliver hopes those she interviews have good memories like elephants! Ariadne and her friend Hercule Poirot visit these characters hoping to learn more details about the murder/suicide. We learn of the romantic triangle involving Sir Ravenscroft and the twin sisters Molly and Dolly. Dolly has spent time in a mental institution. She was living with her sister and Sir Alistair at the time of the tragic deaths. Dolly is thought to have murdered a child in India as well as her son. Four wigs and a dog bite will clarify the crime.Though a very late Hercule Poirot novel I thought this entry in the Christie canon provides a good read. It is not one of her greatest mysteries but is a good solid read. Well done Dame Agatha!"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I am a die hard fan of Agatha Christie, especially Poirot. Even to me this novel was boring and dragging. There is very little story. The plot doesn't have the juice enough to sustain a novel. It could have done well as a short story.With the dog biting the mistress, I was able to guess the ending. I have never correctly guessed ever before when it came to Christie novels.At some point, the book felt more like a psychology book, only the contents may not be correct psychologically. I wish I hadn't started this book in the first place. There are a lot of repetitive events in the books which is really tiresome. Anyway, I wish a better experience to anyone who wants to read this book."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This novel is very slow moving, repetitve and it is totally lacking in charm or suspense. There was not enough material for a novel in this story. Poor Poirot! Poor reader. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Detective novelist (and Christie alter ego) Ariadne Oliver has been coaxed into attending a literary party, something she, like Christie, did not enjoy and avoided whenever possible. Mrs. Oliver's experience at this one would ensure that it would be a long time before she attended another. An overbearing woman, Mrs. Burton-Cox manages to corner the author cross examine her about her goddaughter, one of many Mrs. Oliver has managed to acquire through the years. And now that the young woman, Celia, is quite grown up, one with which Mrs. Oliver has quite lost touch. It seems that Celia and Mrs. Burton-Cox's son are engaged, or will soon be, and Mrs. Burton-Cox wants to know if Celia's mother killed her father or did her father kill her mother. Mrs. Oliver was quite shocked by the rudeness of the encounter and troubled about what to do about it so she contacted her friend, Hercule Poirot, for guidance in the matter. Soon the pair, each in their own unique way, begin to tackle the problems, re-establishing contact with Celia, investigating the old tragedy and finding out just why Mrs. Burton-Cox is so insistance on knowing the answer.For fans of Ariadne Oliver this is a particular treat, giving the reader more information into her (and perhaps Christie's) personal life, than any previous stories. It is interesting to see Oliver's and Poirot's different approaches to investigation, even to the point of different interpretations of what the actual problem is.This is not the cleverest mystery that Christie ever wrote, nor even the best written but it is a very enjoyable one none the less and is a definite must read for any Poirot or Oliver fan."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Christie books never disappoint. I haven't read one of her books in years, but I am reminded again why she is the gold standard against which all others are measured.

I enjoyed reading this and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"This book was one of the worst Agatha Christie books I've ever read.

First, there is a marked lack of action of any kind. Elephants Can Remember is concerned with an investigation into deaths that happened entirely in the past. Therefore, the whole book consists of conversations. There is never any danger or threat to anyone living, so there is no element of \\"excitement\\" as in most of Christie's other books.The second weakness that I would point out is that the solution of the mystery, as it were, becomes fairly apparent to the reader about mid-way through; the rest of the time is spent waiting for Hercule Poirot's amazing gray cells to figure it out and catch up to what the reader/listener already knows. The third weakness is that the solution to the mystery involved actions that I found entirely unbelievable. I won't expand any further than that so as to not spoil the story for anyone who hasn't yet read it, but Christie had a couple of characters behave in ways that were quite reprehensible, but that is never called into question. Her explanation for it, as it were, doesn't hold water.The only really excellent thing about this book is the narration."},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"Not her best work but an enjoyable read-I'm not an Ariadne Oliver fan so maybe thats why I didn't love it"},{"Title":"Elephants Can Remember","review":"I enjoyed this book very much.

Somerset Maugham piece that tells of a servant who fears Death has come to meet him and so flees to Samarra, only to have Death say, \\"I was astonished to see him in Bagdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.\\" Written in the fall of 1933 and published in 1934, \\"Appointment in Samarra\\" is a brilliantly written novel. O'Hara tells the somewhat downhearted story so compellingly that it sweeps the reader into his prose and involves us thoroughly in lives that we don't even care for all that much.As the lead character, Julian English appears to be a spoiled child of affluence whose father perhaps substituted material comfort for a loving father-child relationship. In short, he was busy working. We become acquainted with English in a rapid downhill spiral. He has a wife Caroline who he loves and with whom he is greatly physically attracted. However, events pile themselves one on each other where Julian becomes increasingly unstable, hard to live with and eventually pulls the garage door shut and climbs into the car with the motor running.The supporting characters that swirl in & out of events are interesting. The disabled Froggy Ogden, his wife's cousin, becomes the final straw as Julian punches a disabled man at the country club. Al Grecco, the seedy slow-thinking pundit, makes the context of the Lantenengo Street environment and its surroundings show affluence and those who must hustle to make a dime. My guess is that in 1934 an anti-hero such as Julian was probably stunning. As I read 72 years later, the book seems more of a treatise on the tragedy of alcoholism. I suppose that when it's time for Death to come, it's better met head on. Although like the merchant in Bagdad, I might well try to take a vacation elsewhere if I could. Julian frustrated me because he didn't communicate honestly with his wife and probably needed a sympathetic ear more than a bottle. This is a book that I didn't overly enjoy, but one that I greatly appreciated. It's well worth reading."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Here is a story of social grace and disgrace in the tradition of Fitzgerald and Cheever. It takes place in a town called Gibbsville (actually O'Hara's hometown of Pottsville), located on the edge of the coal region of northeastern Pennsylvania, during the Christmas weekend of 1930.Julian English, president of the local Cadillac dealership, and his wife Caroline are among the town's leading young socialites, with a large circle of influential and prosperous friends. During a fateful forty-eight hours over this festive weekend of excessive drinking, Julian makes three foolish mistakes which send him spiraling to his destruction. At a Christmas Eve party, he becomes irritated by the longwinded Harry Reilly and throws a drink in his face. The assembled throng is shocked; Reilly is not only one of the town's wealthiest citizens, but also happens to own Julian's dealership. The next night, at another party with his wife in attendance, Julian again causes a stir by making a move on the girlfriend of a local mobster. He makes his third mistake at lunch the next day when he gets into a fight with Caroline's cousin over the previous night's transgression. Combined with the stress of meeting his financial responsibilities at the dealership, he can feel the walls quickly closing in, and there is only one way out.Julian is an overgrown frat boy. He has the best of everything in his life -- a beautiful wife, a good job, popularity, a good education -- but he is tragically compelled to do all the wrong things and burn his bridges, possibly due to an underlying sense of low self-esteem and shame. Reading this novel is like watching an impending car accident -- you can't resist observing the impact, even though you know it's going to be brutal."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"O'Hara's book paints a perfect portrait of life in the mid-20th Century. The plot is simple, but behind its simplicity that are complex characters dealing with complex social codes. This is not to be missed by anyone reading the best American novels of all-time."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"In John Updike's introduction to this edition of 'Samarra', he quotes O'Hara advising another Pennsylvania writer; \\"If you're going to get out of that God awful town, then for God's sake write something that will *make* you get out of it\\". With 'Samarra', Updike suggests that O'Hara took his own advice - severing his connection with his hometown and taking revenge on the patronizing protestant elite with a thinly veiled description of Pottsville, PA, renamed Gibbsville for the novel (in which there is a monument to O'Hara today). And in the beginning, that is how it seems - an indictment of the moneyed class in a small community. Whether it was because of this theme, or because they came from roughly the same time period, I had 'The Great Gatsby' in mind as I read the opening chapters of 'Samarra', but that changed quickly. For one thing, regardless of which man is technically the better writer (Fitzgerald is definitely more lyrical), O'Hara is more passionate, and even writing within the strict mores of publishing in the 1930's, his characters are as familiar in their desires and needs as is our present society.Another reason, though, is that, mid-way through, the focus shifts from revenge and exposure of the upper crust to the alcoholic destruction of the main character, Julien English. The novel pivots at the precise point when English's wife, Catherine, bargains with Julien over the number of drinks he'll have even before arriving at a party - a party they attend one night after Julien has thrown a drink in the face of a man he owes a great deal of money. At first he agrees to her terms, and makes some attempts to rectify his previous insulting behavior, but as the night wears on and things don't go as well as he had hoped, Julien abandons any pretense of limiting his intake and begins a spree that will echo for the rest of his life.The structure of the novel then parallels the habits of the alcoholic - the carefree drinker, excited over the prospect of indulging in his habit, turns sullen and resentful at the concerned misgivings of friends and family. The novel, focused on the happy idea of skewering the bloated self-importance of Gibbsville's plutocracy, turns left to follow the over-indulgence and self-pity hangover of its main character. I know it amounts to literary heresy, but I'm going to invoke the biographical fallacy in this case - O'Hara may very well have identified too well with his creation, and, familiar with the remorse inherent in a career of hard drinking, followed the storyline out to its logical conclusion.Or not - and it doesn't really matter, other than as an interesting possible correspondence. The true strength of the novel lies in its punchy realism, its no-nonsense prose. O'Hara may not have written the cake-frosting type of passages that Fitzgerald did, but neither does it ever sound as if he's striving to write literature. Maybe that's even reflected in his messy themes and loose ends, whereas some of his contemporaries' works can come across as too pat, too contrived. Regardless, I'd recommend 'Appointment in Samarra' - not because it's included in any list, but simply for its clear-eyed assessment of the people of its time. I know that it's clear-eyed because the same people are still out walking around."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"This is my first experience with an O'Hara book. It reminded me in some ways of The Rise of Silas Lapham, one of my favorites. Though it is set during the Depression, Appointment in Samarra is a fascinating look at the country club set of the Roaring Twenties. Just as the society of this imaginary Pennsylvania town had not yet realized the depth of the Depression, the characters have not yet realized their way of life is coming to an end. Part of its appeal to me included the details of club rules, sexual mores, lost love, and how the automobile represents, \\"you are what you drive.\\" It is also a cautionary tale of self-destruction and rebellion. I believe it could apply to a nation as well as an individual."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"John O'Hara's first novel detailing the lives of the wealthy and the sordid among the smart set of Gibbsville (a thinly disguised Pottsville, PA) made a sensation when it came out in the early years of the Depression, and, reading it now, it's very easy to see why. Although O'Hara writes about the same sorts of characters here that his contemporary Fitzgerald detailed, he avoids for the most part Fitzgerald's chivalric sentimentalism. As in his later BUTTERFIELD 8, one character among O'Hara's assortment of the well-to-do makes a terrible dramatic gesture that sets off a chain of events that ultimately results in that character's doom, thus demonstrating the tremendous power of this social world (held together by its nasty array of prejudices, snobberies, and cruelties). Few writers could capture the rhythms of early 20th-century conversation so well as O'Hara did, and the give-and-takes between husband and wife, master and servant, mother and daughter are a real pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"If Ernest Hemingway had written The Great Gatsby, it might have come out something like this. It's brilliantly done, to the point of making the reader uncomfortable to be \\"watching\\". The characters are virtually soul-less, but some of them almost grasp what's missing in their lives. For the most part, they haven't a clue what to do about it, other than to keep throwing parties and observing the strict social rules that structure their WASP existence. These are not the filthy rich of the Hamptons, but the middle-class well-off's of small town America. Full of ironies and very well-executed scenes --I've never read a better portrayal of a man slipping into inebriated blabbering anywhere. I don't know if O'Hara gets read very much anymore---but he still deserves an audience."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"A strangely engrossing novel of the downward spiral that is the protagonist's, Julian English, life. Set in the year right before the market crash, it's one of those novels that makes you want to scream out at the characters to mend their fences. The introduction by Updike indicated that this yarn was based in a great deal on the author's own life. Either way, although a morose tale, it was a quick, interesting read."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"On re-reading this novel after thirty years, I was struck by the parallels to The Great Gatsby.Whereas Fitzgerald's masterpiece is set in the prosperous '20's, here are its results less thana decade later: gangsters running the liquor business, former college frat boys and WWI\\"heroes\\" drinking themselves into oblivion [or suicide], rampant anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicviews of the dominant WASPs in town, and an ignorance of the coming economic disasters of adeepening Depression in 1930. Hoover is still assuring the business interests that a little\\"adjustment\\" is all that's needed. The main character, Julian English, is a cross between JayGatsby and Tom Buchanan in some of his longings, and like Gatsby he must keep his appointment in Samarra. O'Hara's use of realistic dialogue and occasional stream-of-cosciousness makes this anotable book for 1934. I'm glad I picked it up again."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"I can't stop thinking about this story -- it's New Year's Eve 1929-30 and the Cadillac dealer knows what everyone else in town is in denial about -- they're all about to be ruined. So resonant for this year... who knows what the fallout will be? How prepared are you to face it? Great book. Read it and weep."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Fitzgerald, Hemingway, C.S.Lewis, John Cheever. If any one of these authors was ever important to you, please pick up O'Hara. He's critical to understanding twentieth century American authors. At the very least, you can engage in the unending debate on whether he's worthy of joining this pantheon of writers. Worthy of an airport paperback rack? Smalltime trashy romance writer? Or do you think he paints a richly textured canvas of an America and its high society about to be turn the corner on the first half of the 20th century? An important Irish-Catholic writer?My tip: read this book. If nothing else you'll learn about bituminous and anthracitic coal, the United Mine Workers, how to mix a martini, (and throw one), why fraternities were ever important, and what a flivver was. It's certainly a period piece, and O'Hara does not hold back with the language of the jazz age...which may confuse modern readers (it was a gay party, his chains dropped a link, etc.) In fact, O'Hara was an early adopter of using slang and vernacular in writing the spoken word, and you can be the judge of whether or not he gets an Irish mobster's (or a \\"high hat's\\") tone correctly.He's really at his best with character development, because Julian English (our protaganist) is our bigoted confidante, our tiresome spouse, our wretched boss, our surly neighbor, our spoiled college-boy brat, our pretentious friend and our preening big man about town all in one. O'Hara waltzes us through Julian's demise and we root for him, for one more chance, all the way down."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"It would be easy to dismiss &quot;Appointment in Samarra&quot; as insignificant when compared to other, more well known literature. It's certainly a quick, entertaining read, very funny at times, with a loose, somewhat disjointed quality that gives the whole novel a strange tone. Separate events and characters are introduced that don't seem to have any obvious relation to one another, and at the book's end, they still don't. However, as a time capsule of a specific place and time in American cultural history, it's very well done and fascinating to read.At its basic level, &quot;Samarra&quot; inserts a stick of dynamite into the safe, complacent world of affluent, East coast snobbery by introducing into it an influx of immigrants and &quot;new&quot; money. The WASP environment of cocktail parties, Ivy League schools and country clubs couldn't be sheltered forever from European emigres, specifically Jews, with money of their own. I don't want to give anything of the plot away, but I will say that there is a tragedy in this book, and the ripples it sends through the rich community that serves as the focus of this novel's story are meant to signify the larger ripples affecting American culture on a much greater scale as the heady days of the Roaring 20's give way to the more sombre and politically aware days of the 30's and 40's.I'm not completely sure what to make of a side story involving some petty mobsters, but I assume their intrusion into the fabric of this East coast society is meant as yet one more example of the loss of security from which these people felt by rights they would be sheltered.There is no reason not to read &quot;Appointment in Samarra.&quot; It won't take up much of your time, and I promise you won't ever be bored by it. Whether you'll find it profound or especially memorable is another story. I didn't particularly find it either, but I would recommend it nonetheless."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"The title comes from a tale attributed to Somerset Maugham (reprinted just in front of the first page of my edition). As story goes, the servant of a merchant in Baghdad sees Death in the marketplace, is sure she's coming for him, and asks permission to go hide from her in the town of Samarra. The merchant agrees, but then goes to the marketplace himself to have some words with Death about how she treated his servant. (I wish I had a boss like that!) Death denies having threatened the man, \\"I was astonished to see him in Baghdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.\\"From the very beginning, then, we know that the novel concerns someone with an inevitable appointment with Death which he/she cannot escape. Within a few pages, we even know who. Only the particulars remain - or so it would seem.Julian English does make his appointment with Death, but the author deliberately destroys the impression of inevitability he spent most of the novel creating. Up to the very end, we believe that Julian's impulsive act of throwing a drink into the face of Harry Reilly, his most important creditor, sealed his fate. We, together with Julian, believe that his alienating Reilly leads inevitably to Julian's financial ruin, and, seeing no way out, Julian commits a series of ever more self-destructive acts culminating in his suicide.And then we learn that Harry Reilly attached no significance to the thrown drink and that he liked Julian all along. Julian's death was not inevitable after all. Also, far from trying to flee his fate, Julian rushes headlong into it, leading one to conclude that Julian isn't the one with the appointment in Samarra after all.At first that seems absurd - Julian is the central character of the novel, after all. But Julian isn't actually the center of the novel - the people of Gibbsville are. We learn all about the state of Gibbsville in 1930, meeting about fifty different characters from all walks of life - incredible in such a short (240 pages) novel. O'Hara's has no sympathy for the upper classes, and he depicts their society as decadent, corrupt and declining - people who try to pretend that nothing has happened despite the Crash of 1929 and the loss of the coal market, even as a new generation of entrepreneurs like Harry Reilly displaces them. They don't deserve the fine things they have, nor will they keep them much longerO'Hara shows his real sympathies in the short segments about Luther L. Fleigler and his wife at the beginning and ending of the book. Luther works for Julian's Cadillac dealership, and just as his hard work contrasts with the sloth of the upper classes, so too his happy relationship with his wife contrasts starkly with Julian and Caroline's poisoned marriage. The future belongs to them."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"&#65533;Appointment in Samarra&#65533; is a great novel. I was led to read it by an article in the Atlantic Monthly that lamented the pretentiousness of much of contemporary writing. Not only is the writing pretentious, but it doesn&#65533;t say anything intelligible. &#65533;Appointment in Sammara&#65533;, by contrast, tells a story in a direct manner while still revealing to us hidden truths about the human spirit. It&#65533;s not giving anything away to say that the story concerns the self-destruction of one Julian English. Julian is suave, Protestant, lives in the finest neighborhood, and hangs out with the in crowd. But Julian makes the mistake of throwing his drink into the face of a powerful, nouveau riche Irish Catholic. Suddenly, Julian&#65533;s support structures don&#65533;t seem so firm. Julian&#65533;s descent is heart breaking because, although he is not an especially likeable person, John O&#65533;Hara still manages to make us care for him. O&#65533;Hara&#65533;s book was prophetic in that it portrays the end of WASP domination in America. The book takes place in 1930 and was published in 1934 &#65533; just six years after the Catholic Al Smith was denied the presidency by a virulent anti-Catholic backlash led, in part, by the Klan. We're told that some of the locals in Pottsville are members of the the Klan. Twenty-six years later, in 1960, an Irish Catholic would be elected president. Appointment in Samarra is a must read for those who are serious about the American novel."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"O'Hara's distinctive literary voice is both unique and disarming. For the first hundred pages I was unsure that O'Hara was even a competent writer, nevermind author of one of the century's great novels. His narrative technique and dialogue both are steeped in the jargon of his heyday, Prohibition Era, small town America. But O'Hara deals with big themes and the idiom of his day becomes secondary. He seems to want to take on big questions: why is the moth so driven to the flame? Why do we so willingly capitulate to baser instincts? Why can't we be satisfied, even happy with what we have? Why are we so often driven for more? More of what? At what price? Why are human beings insatiable? Julian English is an affluent man in his early thirties with a going business, a beautiful wife, Caroline, and social status in Gibbsville, a small town north and west of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania Dutch Country. His alcoholic habits drive him to dismantle every important social relationship in his life until he becomes essentially a social misfit, incapable of decent behavior among his family, friends, peers and colleagues. He seems determined to keep an appointment with death and has a death wish entombed in his heart. O'Hara's brief experimental flights with stream of consciousness propel us into the inner depths of his characters where we can feel their agony. His treatment of big themes with such a natural voice sets O'Hara apart. Be sure to experience this one of a kind American literary voice."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"At the end of every year, Brian Lamb talks to three authors on a special Booknotes on C-SPAN. Last year one of the guests was Shelby Foote &amp; he said that he was reading some great American authors who folks had sort of forgotten. One of them was John O'Hara. Now I've seen dozens of his books at book sales, so I knew two things: one, he sold a ton of books; two, folks aren't reading them anymore. So I picked up From the Terrace, Appointment in Samarra &amp; a couple collections of the short stories &amp; loved them all. It was very heartening to see that he made this list (Modern Library Top 100).Appointment tells the story of Julian English, a WASP nervously perched atop the social heap in Gibbsville, PA. At a Christmas party in 1930, he throws a drink in the face of the town's leading Catholic businessman and thus begins his downward spiral.O'Hara etches very sharp portraits of characters from the varying strata of society &amp; presents a vivid tale of an America &amp; it's establishment shaken by the oncoming Depression and the rise of new Ethnic groups.GRADE: A"},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"An excellent look at a Christmas weekend in the life of Julian English, a Cadillac dealer in a small town in Pennyslvania, and his wife Caroline. Many scenes, especially those that take place at the local country club, are expertly sketched and in Dr English, Julian's father, O'Hara creates a model of concise characterization. I did find the flashbacks in the lives of Julian and Caroline somewhat tedious, however.The book also works as a slice of history, from a time when the full devastation to be wrought by the Great Depression was not forseen. The ending, reminiscent of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, has a beautiful irony which lingers in the mind."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"O'Hara pierces the character of the Protestant elite, which in some ways set off a stampede in literature that continued to deconstruct WASP culture throughout 20th century literature. Set in a pseudonymous town resembling O'Hara's own Pottsville, Pennsylvania of the 1920's, this tale of an insecure WASP who precipitates his own demise by tossing a drink in the face of the town's most prominent and moneyed Catholic, builds to a feverish yet melancholy end. A book that influenced many great modern writers, it is a timeless story of class resentment and the downward spiral of a tortured soul in a comfortable existence."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"To be fair, I am twenty-one years old. However, I hope the accolade still means something when I say that this is my absolute favorite book.O'Hara's magic is in his dialogue, which I've heard someone describe as \\"the way people would speak if everyone was completely honest all the time.\\" It's fascinating, and if you're a writer, I dare you not to write dialogue, or try to, like O'Hara when you finish one of his short stories.The magic of \\"Appointment in Samarra\\" is its the sharp eye it turns on small-town upper middle class, its willingness to be cruel and tragic, and the usual impressive O'Hara treatment of creating an entire fictional universe out of Gibbsville, PA, which is based on O'Hara's hometown, Pottsville, PA (best known for coal mining and the Yuengling brewery). The Gibbsbville world continues through several of O'Hara's other works; characters in his trilogy of novellas, \\"Sermons and Soda Water,\\" even make reference to Julian and Caroline English, the protagonists of \\"Samarra.\\"The tragedy of O'Hara, of course, is the tendency to tuck him away under Hemingway and Fitzgerald despite his equally brilliant and prolific career. This is due in part to his unpleasant personality, but what brilliant, important artist wasn't unpleasant? I for one will not let his name or this amazing work go unnoticed without a fight."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"I have to admit that if it wasn't for the Modern Library's famous Top 100 List, I may have never heard of O'Hara or this title.

What a book!In a nutshell, this book is about a reckless young man's weeklong fall from social grace, and his ultimate plunge into despair. All of this comes about from dissatisfaction with his life; his anger, resentment, and mistrust toward those around him; his drinking; and his penchant for burning bridges with the wrong people at the wrong time.Told in lean, smooth prose, this book reads almost like a noir crime novel. The dialog is spot-on, and the story is filled with full-fleshed, flawed characters that all seem to have a seedy side to them. O'Hara also has a terrific knack for portraying how people behave under immense strain.I've read that, in his day, many considered O'Hara to be a \\"trash novelist.\\" He was often criticized for injecting references to his characters' violent behavior and their unusual sexual tastes. But this is part of what makes his writing so effective. Even though Samarra came out in 1934, it still has shock value. Mind you, these references are not graphic. They appear abruptly and casually, with little or no elaboration. But they are jarring. The net effect is that they sneak under your skin in subtle ways, causing you to see the characters and their underlying psychologies far more vividly.The combination of dialog, uncluttered description, and deft characterization make O'Hara one of the truly forgotten greats of American letters. For what it's worth, I ordered four more O'Hara titles immediately after finishing this book. I think he is THAT good. Fans of Erskine Caldwell, Charles Bukowski, John Fante, Sinclair Lewis, Ernest Hemingway, and the like, take note. O'Hara is the real deal. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Facing the unspeakable horrors of World War I and the crushing effects of the Great Depression, it is fully understandable why Modern Fiction rarely has a happy ending. However, the Modernists had a keen way of breaking down the human condition, the precarious nature of the relationships we forge, private failings and public shame, the social dichotomy of the rich and poor, and the artificial constraints placed on emotion by a society bred to deny the impulses that humanize us all. Appointment in Samarra by John O'Hara is a classic example of how one seemingly small act, throwing a drink in someones face, can have outstanding consequences.The novel is set in Gibbsville, a fictional Pennsylvania town in the cradle of coal country in the thralls of the Great Depression. Julian English is the son of a successful doctor and a member of the upper crust of the Gibbsville social scene. The novel is about his struggle to retain the life he has painstakingly created from the societal consequences of throwing a drink in the face of one of the most influential Gibbsville inhabitants, Harry Reilly. The strength of the novel lies in the author's ability to contrast Julian's downfall to his commentary on the society Julian cared so desperately about. The undercurrent of the criminal underworld runs throughout the novel serving as a another reminder of the inherently duplicitous nature of the complex social webs that fill Julian's life. The tragedy of the novel isn't the downfall itself but rather how the looming \\"hammer\\" of society, perceived or otherwise, forces his cataclysmic descent.Ernest Hemingway said of the novel, \\"If you want to ready a book by a man who knows exactly what he is writing about and has written marvelously well, read Appointment in Samarra.\\" That quote sums up the novel beautifully. The text moves quickly, deftly following many players and dodging the metaphysical potholes that often riddle Modern Fiction. O'Hara wants to tell a story and he doesn't let the themes he wishes to convey get bogged down in meandering paragraphs or confusing metaphorical explanations. Like Hemingway, O'Hara spent significant time as a journalist, and the short, succinct style of writing is reflected in the novel. He doesn't waste the readers time by unnecessarily inflating the story, which not only leads to a tighter monologue, but also strengthens the plot by exhibiting how rapid his downfall actually was.Appointment in Samarra is a tremendous novel. Though many works of Modernism deal with the downfall of men, John O'Hara carves out his own niche in the pantheon of the great American authors of the early 20th century by creating a riveting story of the true value of the relationships we forge, and the ramifications of disrupting the delicate balance of the society we desperately cling to."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"This is the story of middle and upper class society in a Pennsylvania town in the early part of the Depression. It is also the time of Prohibition. The novel focuses on the rapid self-destruction of a single man and how this process affects those around him.I found this book mildly interesting if only for the depiction of this exclusive group of people, but I found the dialogue stilted and the events that occur unrealistic."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"John O'Hara is a novelist who has undeservedly faded from the top ranks of American writers. At one time he was, not without reason, compared most favorably with contemporaries like Dos Passos, Hemingway and Fitzgerald. Well, so much for literary fashions. Here, in his first novel, O'Hara explores the trials and tribulations of three eventful days in the lives of a conventionally rich young Philadephais Main Line(fictional Gibbsville, to be exact, a scene for more than one of his later novels) country club set couple, Julian and Caroline English, and the narrowness of their little world and the poverty of their horizons. O'Hara always had a good ear for describing the contradictions and the frustrations of the essential meaninglessness of life for these denizens of the small town \`smart set', a preview of the homogenization of business-oriented society that would burst out after World War II in the sagas of the men in the grey flannel suits and their families. Julian English is their father or older brother. And his fate is not pretty. Moreover, there is the catch. As expressed in an Arabian parable in the front of the book- you cannot escape your fate, even if you, as Julian desperately did, take action to move away the horror of it. Well, maybe. But read the book."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"This book ranked 22 in the best books of the 20th century. It's there because you haven't heard of O'Hara and he has been improperly ignored, just like Arthur Koestler at #8, so this is one of the efforts to make the list hipper, and quite frankly, it's a pretty hip list.Granted, this is a good book. Most of the characters behave like normal people behave, but books aren't like movies. You didn't have to wait until 1967 for a decent one to get made. There have always been accurate pictures of humanity in literature and O'Hara was writing at one of the peaks. No wonder he wasn't recognized as a leading light.While many of the characters are lovable for their recognizability, you have a lot of time taken up with gangsters that seem fairly ridiculous and have no real bearing on the plot, what little there is of that. And in terms of plot, there are two endings that are not allowable in an introductory writing class: 1. It was all a dream, 2. The ending that O'Hara chose.All that aside, this book does a good job of taking us away from kings & queens and the grandiose moment. Caroline's sexual development is fantastic and demonstrates the haphazard path that love takes place when the subject itself is taboo. It's good to get O'Hara on the list, but I can swing a dead cat in this room and hit 22 books better than this."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"This novel is about an actual place in Pennsylvania. It is especially interesting because many of the locations that O'Hara makes reference to are still around. It is common knowledge in the area that some of the people depicted were upset with the author. Gibbsville (Pottsville) and its history is still very much alive in O'Haras novels. It is a great read and its real life inspirations make it exceptionally interesting."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Any time you have one of those days when everything goes wrong, consider the case of the hero of this classic novel.Julian English seems to have it all: He is the son of one of the city's most prominent men, is president of the Cadillac dealership, is married to a beautiful and intelligent woman, and socializes with the young Country Club set. And then one night, with a bit too much bootleg liquor inside him, he throws a drink in the face of a \\"friend\\" (who happens to have loaned his business $20,000) who is irritatingly telling long-winded stories. Julian's wife is upset and embarrassed and they argue. And the next night he further humiliates her by again drinking too much and apparently seducing a mobster's mistress right in front of her and their friends. And things go downhill from there.This novel, set in 1930 in a fictional mid-size city, reads like a Greek tragedy, as fate and Julian's own fatal flaws combine to bring about his downfall. That the writing is very sparse and straight-forward, with a combination of slangy conversation and mundane details, makes the epic-like tragedy even more dramatic.Although not as well known, this novel of the early 20th century is worthy to stand alongside the works of Hemingway and Fitzgerald."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Appointment in Samarra is a concise, cogent portrait of country club culture and the price one man pays when he violates its codes."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"enjoyed the story but felt the male character made some stupid choices but not enough to warrent killing himself.His wife acted as if oh well then went on with her life. John O'Hara did not hold much respect for the upper social class and it shows in most of his writings. I live near the area he describs and he brings out the feelings of the middle working class and miners. This was a book for our Reading club at the library."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"It's been perhaps 45 years since I've even thought about John O'Hara's books let alone read him. I had never read this one, but in an act of pure spontaneity, I picked up a ratty old copy at the city library while browsing through the stacks. Oh, what joys we can find purely by accident!This one apparently became an instant best seller in 1934 but not necessarily a critical success. Hemingway praised it but other notables thought it so-so and it did not win any prizes. Mr. O'Hara thought it tied for second best of his novels but he gave no other details.I thought it an enjoyable read, with interesting characters, some of which were well developed; and there were clearly passions displayed, plausibly constructed. I loved some of the ideas and phrasings, worthy of expanded thought: In reference to Caroline, \\"...the Bryn Mawr manner; which means quick maturity and an everlasting tendency to enthusiasms.\\" I think I know women like that...and such qualities aren't exclusive to Bryn Mawr. Julian English pondering his problems: \\"But the trouble with making yourself feel better by thinking of bad things that other people have done is that you are the only one who is rounding up the stray bad things.\\" How true! Caroline again: \\"She knew she never would do that, but one part of her threatened another part of her with it.\\" Julian again, thinking: \\"When was the last time there had been a change in himself? He thought and thought, rejecting items that were not change but only removal or adornment.\\"Regarding the title, \\"Appointment in Samarra\\" refers to a little fable, thousands of years old, called \\"Death Speaks\\" that W. Somerset Maugham put to paper. O'Hara liked it. And it \\"fitted nicely into the inevitability of Julian English's death.\\""},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"After reading some v positive hype on this, it disappointed me. For an author only 28 years old, it has some impressive points; but I think the author's own fears and flaws are mirrored transparently. It's endless descriptions of the class system of a smallish coal mining town, the cars, the clothes, the bigotry, what each person drinks get tiresome in such a short novel. It's sort of like Sinclair Lewis' \\"Babbit\\" updated a decade, but lacks the cynical view of that work. It took me two tries to finish this. Years later, O'Hara wrote \\"From the Terrace;\\" and it's more of the same, just in a bloated form."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Trained in the low couture of daily print journalism, John O'Hara's minimalist style makes this novel about Pennsylvania's anthracite community seem most American, most blue collar, most \\"down to earth.\\"Reminiscent of a Fitzgerald protagonist, Julian English's engagements in destructive lifestyle habits make him lose reputation, prestige and his friends in the small city of Gibbsville - population approximately 30,000. And, like Fitzgerald - the cause of the demise is alcohol.Although not as eerily descriptive of the dipsomaniacal psyche as Lowry's protagonist (the Consul) in \\"Under the Volcano\\", this book resonates with the torturous conflict running through the depressed mind of the young man who - at least what others would proclaim - \\"has it all.\\" He has a good job, money, good family, and most importantly for those in the 1930's - a solid and beautiful \\"swell gal\\" for a wife.When I read this novel, it became more and more obvious to me that the John Updike introduction was more than a mere coincidence. Julian very much resembles Updike's Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom of \\"Rabbit Run.\\" Gibbsville is so similar to Updike's Brewer. Harry is 26, Julian is 29 going on 30. Updike was 29 when he wrote \\"Rabbit , Run.\\" O'Hara about the same. Julian and Harry are married to women from good families. Both are frustrated. Both are crushed by the demands placed upon their immature souls - the demands by both family and community.After having read a few older classics which drip prose through syrupy words reminiscent of 19th century style, this Hemingway-influenced writer whose light usage of English vocabulary and \\"minimalist fiction\\" makes reading whip at a much faster pace - something which this 21st century reader finds more appealing. I find his writing style more akin to the 20th century American mystery writer - Marlowe, Chandler and Cain.My one recommendation to anyone reading this or \\"Rabbit, Run\\" is to read the books back to back. The similarities are astounding, but how each twists and turns in opposite directions seems to be reflective of different sentimentalities and national spirits: \\"Rabbit, Run\\" (1960) involves a more optimistic America than the post-Depression America of \\"Appointment in Samarra\\" (1934)."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Right from the start, I could tell that this would be an enjoyable and insightful book. Written in a down to earth style, the reader is given an intimate view of the main charaters Caroline and Julian English and are allowed into their WASPish country club molded mindset. The charater sketches are well done, and the reader gets to feel that he is thouroughly familiar with each of the main characters. A little short considering the amount of time spent on sketching separate bibliographies, but generally well done"},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Then read this...pronto. Rated the #22 fiction book of the 20th Century, Appointment in Samarra did not disappoint. Being a huge Fitzgerald and Hemingway enthusiast and seeing how both recommended this book wholeheartedly, I concluded it to be a can't miss prospect. Something about the shameless decadence, the seemingly limitless ambition, &amp; the uproariously good times that were had during The Jazz Age made it such a riveting and inimitable setting for the likes of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, and John O'Hara. While I wouldn't quite include O'Hara in a class with his two contemporaries, Appointment in Samarra does, however, make a strong case for its serious inclusion not too far behind such works as The Great Gatsby, The Sun Also Rises, etc.What strikes me as a distinct divergence from such works as The Great Gatsby is that it, unlike Gatsby, it takes place at the onset of The Great Depression - just after Gatsby's epoch. So, in a sense, Appointment is not all fun and games and infinite debauchery without any foreseeable repercussions. Of Fitzgerald's works, I liken it most to The Beautiful and Damned - the perpetual dynamics of a moral vacuum, alcoholism, self-destructive proclivities, failed relationships, adultery, etc. are all readily present -- as is the constant and unflagging conviction of Julian as he steadfastly holds on to any vestige of his integrity through it all.In summation, the extraordinarily crass (although realistic and highly entertaining) dialogue, superb characterization of a veritable endless array of diverse individuals, &amp; a fluid and genuinely suspenseful plot are what make this a great, although somewhat morose, American novel not to be missed."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Appointment in Samarra is one of the most brilliant and underated novels in American Lit. This book is Heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time. O'Haras later work is spotty but this novel belongs with the classics of the era. I could not put it down and I kept thinking of Gatsby as I read this book. O'Haras short stories in his prime also bear an eerie kinship to Fitzgerald but without the idealized romantic voice."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"This is the story of two big fish in a tiny pond. The big fish are Julian English and his wife Caroline, leaders of the country-club set in Prohibition-era Gibbsville, Pennsylvania. Julian is a Cadillac dealer, making Appointment an odd prefiguration of Updike's Rabbit series. O'Hara shocks his 1934 readership with his frank treatment of sex. A modern reader is more likely to be impressed by how little has changed in relations among couples, in adults searching for meaning in their lives, and in the suffocating smallness of small towns."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"There are some \\"classics\\" you read because your English teacher told you it had literary value once - and then there are classics you read because they truly transport you deeply into another time and place, another world, to see what life was once like. Appointment in Samarra by John O'Hara falls squarely into the second category. Set in Pennsylvania in December 1930, you are immersed in the town of Gibbsville. The locals have dealt with prohibition for a decade and which has found a variety of ways to drink heavily all the same. You see this world from the viewpoint of rich and poor, male and female, religious and non-religious. Drinking is a core theme throughout the story, as is the inevitable path of one man's meeting with death.This review will contain spoilers, but this is not anything 'new' with this story - the back jacket of the book gives away the entire plot, and so does the introduction to the story. It is like going to see Hamlet and knowing it's a tragedy. It's fine to know the general storyline. What is special about this book is the characters - watching how they interact, learning about their personalities, seeing what this period of history was all about. The beauty is not in \\"who did what\\". It is in the myriad of small interactions and the hand-grenade series of repercussions.At the center of the maelstrom is Julian English, a married man, a car dealer, who is happy being the core of his well-to-do circle of friends. It's Christmas and, as usual, the group is drinking heavily - either rye, applejack, gin, or for a select few, scotch. One of the group, an Irishman named Reilly, is telling stories, and Julian gets more and more annoyed by it. In a burst of energy, Julian tosses his drink in Reilly's face to get him to shut up. And thus the snowball begins.While Julian figures this is no big deal, Julian's wife is convinced this is the beginning of the end and nags Julian into going to apologize. Reilly is in a huff - he has a black eye now from where an ice cube hit him - and refuses to come down to talk to Julian, thus cementing in Julian's mind that this IS a big deal. So Julian becomes desolate. Off the group goes to another club, where of course there is even more drinking. The drink of the day is rye, although they are hoping for scotch. Either the rye is drunk straight or with ginger ale. That's their world - no wine, no beer, not even vodkas or rums. The drunken group gets even more soused.When Julian reaches his depths of despair, he drowns his sorrows in a vase-sized highball made from his personal stash of Scotch, after feeding his rye to a visitor.It is fairly impressive that a story set deep in the grips of Prohibition is so fully saturated with alcohol. The story is told from a variety of viewpoints, from poor to rich, from straight laced to criminal, and being drunk is a common thread. Perhaps it is not a surprise that Prohibition would be repealed a mere three years later, counted as a failure of a policy.The title of the book, Appointment in Samarra, is in reference to a short story that prefaces the novel. A servant meets up with death and tries to escape, fleeing off to Samarra where he hopes he will not be found. However, it turns out that Death had been planning to do the deed *in* Samarra - so the servant fled right into the path of his own destiny. You could say similarly that Julian had a destiny to meet death, and while he tries to apologize, and to drive off, in the end he makes that appointment. I have to say, though, that in Julian's case, it seems more to me like he is saying \\"The hell with it, I'm going to march down this path and nobody can stop me.\\" He knows he's being self destructive. He's doing things he knows are damaging. He empties out that vase and mixes the world's largest highball, and drinks it all down. He just doesn't care at all. So it's a different feeling to me than the servant desperately fleeing.Part of the curiosity about this novel is that it was John O'Hara's very first novel. Readers were blown away that a brand new author could create such compelling characters who felt alive and unique. Nothing O'Hara wrote afterward came up to this same level.Well recommended."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Talk about a hard hitting classic that lives up to itsreputation. O'hara's APPOINTMENT IN SAMARRA is a slowdescent to and in hell for its protagonist, Julian English.English's plunge is triggered by his realization that 1930was not a year to be in heavy debt. But, the power of thenovel is seen in just how shallow and surface English andhis peers lives are. What they valued and the friendshipsthey kept were just empty in the boom days of the late 20sas in the first year of the Depression. First-rateto the end. Very powerful."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"This story examines the lives of the social elite in a small town in 1930. The characters are trapped in rigid spots, expected to mix with certain people and display certain behaviors. Within this social elite, childhoods and adolescences are woven into a snarled web of relationships.Julian English's life should be perfectly happy. He is successful financially as well as socially, has a crowd of friends, is invited to all of the best parties, and has the perfect wife. In reality, though, he is self-conscious about his relationships and filled with a simmering anger at many of those around him.Fueled with a bit too much alcohol at a holiday party, Julian finally snaps, throwing a drink into the face of a man who annoys him with long-winded stories and too much affection toward Julian's wife. In one moment of impulsivity, Julian makes an enemy of a powerful man, and Julian's life, as a result, rapidly begins to unravel.This story was full of very believable characters, whose actions and emotions jumped off of the pages. It was easy to understand how Julian's problems could have seemed so insurmountable to him, and it was painful to read the different ways in which he kept making his own situation worse. I liked being able to see what brought each of the separate characters to this place and time, and how things could have gone differently if they had made different choices in their youth.The only drawback for me was that I was sometimes lost in the relationships among characters as adults, especially those who were not a main focus of the book, and I found myself skimming over lengthy descriptions that didn't seem to feed into the main plot of the story."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"O'Hara is a forgotten writer, in part because of his singular ability to alienate his peers. I read this because I had never read anything by him and because my father recommended O'Hara as one of the great short story writers of the century. This work, of course, is a novel, albeit a short one, and was O'Hara's first full length work. He was only 28 when he wrote it and finished it during the depths of the Great Depression.The book is extraordinary for its stylistic excellence. O'Hara's writing is taut like Hemingway, but with a better eye for all the nuances of class, ethnicity, and small town society. He has the uncanny ability to tell a story and to create believable and even compelling characters with a few brush strokes. An example of O'Hara's brilliance in story-telling is how he relates the key incident of the book: where the hero, Julian English, starts his downward spiral by throwing a drink in the face of his financial benefactor for being too \\"Irish\\". English visualizes the gesture and decides he'll never go through with it. Later on, we find out from witnesses relating the incident that he went ahead with it anyway. Nothing better captures the mysteries and ambiguities of human behavior than this elliptical narrative technique -- who is to say why we act on some impulses and not on others?What O'Hara is able to demonstrate better than anyone since Dreiser is the precarious nature of social status and the precipitous fall that is closer than we'd like to think. English's fall is fast, but not so shocking when we consider how precarious his status was in the first place.On one level, O'Hara seems to admire English as a man's man and the reader too can't help but admire him. And what's quite creepy is the sense that O'Hara seems to share some of English's anti-semitism and other prejudices. But on another level, O'Hara portrays the upper class pretentions of English as corrupt, and O'Hara seems to convey the sense that American society would be improved by English's underling's ascension to English's management of the company. American society would be improved by more fluidity and by more merit-based methods to selecting society's leaders.O'Hara's portrayal of male-female relationships and sexuality is compelling and perhaps a bit racy for its time. His view of female sexuality tends to stress its submissive strains, which seems to rather too conveniently fit traditional male chauvinism. But on balance, his willingness to allow female characters strong sexual drives was an enlightened attitude for the time.What's missing from the novel is a convincing explanation of why English suffers from the self-destructive impulse. How that impulse destroys him is convincingly told, but the why tends to be missing. Also missing is a positive vision for an alternative to Julian English. The novel opens and closes with sketch of English's subordinate, Fiegler. One gets the sense that Fiegler is the good middle class foil for English, but the character is not sufficiently developed to make the point.All of which points to perhaps another reason why O'Hara is a forgotten writer: his most noted book is limited in scope and does not struggle with the great issues of human nature and society. He writes a masterpiece but a minor masterpiece."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Some books listed on the MLA 100 are boring, bloated, monstrosities. This one isn't.

There is no comparison at all; this story is boring beyond belief, rife with characters who are irrelevent to the story, and led by a protagonist who I couldn't have cared less about. This book has a definite 1950's tone throughout - the female characters were so unbelievably rendered that they almost seemed like stepford wives. It's rare that I cannot finish a book - but this one seemed a huge waste of time."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"One can't help but wondering whether Hemingway - with his egg-shell ego - was such an admirer of this book because he is mentioned in it, along with Fitzgerald at one point. One can't help but wonder why anyone who doesn't fancy this easy-read \\"Minimalist\\" style of reportage in which the \\"story\\" of Julian English's downfall is told would find to admire in this book at all. The characters are vapid, inane, without character or imagination---beyond what cars they might someday drive or social ladders they wish to climb. This dispensable lot includes our protagonist Julian English, who, with his underdog status, achieves only a tad more sympathy.To compare this work to Lowry's, as is done quite frequently, does Lowry a very severe injustice. Lowry's work - with its polysyllabic words, esoteric allusions and symphonic cadences - is everything this work is not. Yes, O'Hara's work it does have a self-destructive hero, but so do over half the works in modern literature!Really, Nobel-Prize winning (the first American in literature) author Sinclair Lewis's Main Street is the book to read about this era and milieu. It has, mirabile dictu, wonderful poetic descriptions and centres on a female character with a rich, complex inner life.I suppose the reaction in this book with which I sympathised the most was Caroline's, very near the end:\\"Why is it? Why the hell is it? Who said so? God damn all of you!

If you want to read about a small town, read Main Street."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"John O'Hara is like a cross between F.S. Fitzgerald and D.H. Lawrence, if you care to think of it in those terms. Not only do I recommend the book for its social insight into the club-set of the 1930's (like Fitzgerald,) but I also recommend it for its brutal honesty. O'Hara, like D.H. Lawrence, could take any character, a woman, a man, a priest, an alcoholic, and tell you what they would do, why they would do it, and what they would *think* while doing it. We know the lies that they tell themselves, simply because O'Hara knows them and would never let the character get away with lying to his readers. He knows the ins and outs of every kind of mind. In effect, we feel the jealousy, anxiety, anger, and hopelessness of a great range of people.This book is excellent for those readers who are a little weary of carefully non-offensive works. Prepare for some 200 pages of frank sexual discussion, *real* mental insight, and a story that ends the way it would in real-life."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"I grew up in the town at the center of this story. The next response would be, \\"there is no such place as Gibbsville, Pa\\". You would be right. The town's real name is Pottsville. Pottsville also appears on Yuengling Beer labels where the beverage was originally produced. Each character is a composite of real people that existed at the time of publication. The book was fist published in 1934, and was considered controversial for it's openly explicit language and it's references to sex. It's also a very realistic portrayal of life at that time.I don't know if I was so taken with the book because of it's significance to where I lived or because it fairly represents the mindset of community economically devastated by it's reliance on the coal industry (which ultimately failed everyone associated with it).I still think it's a great read."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Julian English is a synonym for self-destruct. Just as Scarlett O'Hara instantly brings to mind a well-defined personality, so does Julian. O'Hara (John, that is) is that good. His eye and ear for time and place are uncanny. I can see and hear the characters in their surroundings, like seeing a movie and reading a book at the same time.&quot;Appointment&quot; is inevitable from the time Julian throws a drink in the face of the town's leading businessman. Its tone is elegiac as in a Greek tragedy. I always think of Caroline English as the Chorus. She sees the path Julian is on, but there is nothing she can do or say to change a step he takes. I don't think there is a word wasted in the entire novel.O'Hara still has not been quite forgiven for being too successful in his own lifetime. His sin is that he is too readable, too good a storyteller and; therefore, his books sold like hotcakes. He had the temperament of a wounded grizzly bear which alienated almost every friend he had. I believe he will find his way back to his reader's affections; he writes too well to be ignored."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I began this book. John O'Hara--wasn't Paul Newman or Elizibeth Taylor in some flick I might not have seen, based on one of his books or short stories, sometime in the late 50s? I think he wrote some big bestsellers and the guy on the front cover looks like an interesting drunk . . .A first novel . . . hmmm . . . I suppose he is well worth remembering. I can think of few books I'd put in the same class with Appointment in Samarra, a stirring, absorbing tragedy of unrealistic aspiration and retreat into self-destruction. Being of the bitter and resentful sort I found definitions of behaviors I'd experienced and a frighteningly accurate explanation of actions I had considered and feelings I had suppressed. The dialogue is blunt and true, the sorts of slangy toss offs people said in the early 30s when they were through with being polite.As far as a limited perspective can see, this is a perminant picture of life in 1930s America going horribly, horribly wrong."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Rarely does a writer debut with such a grace and so close to the perfect as happened to John O'Hara and his \\"Appointment in Samarra\\". Many authors are dazzled with the possibilities and open many doors that they are not able to either enter or close. O'Hara is different. He is assured of what he wants of his characters and his prose, therefore his writing reads like an experienced writer who leaves readers breathless.\\"Appointment in Samarra\\" begins with an epigraph from Somerset Maugham. And the narrative follows Julian English, a WASP who is atop the social leader in Gibbsville, PA. At a Christmas party he throws a drink in the face of an important Catholic businessman and this is just the beginning of his downward spiral.While Mr English is going down, another characters are going up. It is very interesting the parallels the writer traces in his narrative showing how one's decadence is another's ascendance. Luther Fliegler's life is the counterpoint to English's.O'Hara's dialogue have an important part in his prose. His words are sharp and not a single one is useless. The use of colloquial language only enhances that. His characters' lines are complemented by detailed descriptions that favor to create the whole scene.Many compare O'Hara to other writers from the same period like Fitzgerald, it turns out that O'Hara is not that famous- what is a shame. Because, like Fran Leibowitz said, he is \\"the real F. Scott Fitzgerald.\\" O'Hara's prose has much more depth and less romantic characters that Fitzgerald. Moreover he reads more smoothly and he talks more candid about issues like decadence and sex. In Fitzgerald's world the prose is dreamy. Nothing seems to be very real. On the other hand, O'Hara is very down-to-earth.\\"Appointment in Samarra\\" is a book that is very likely to please readers who like complex narratives written with an assured hand. The Vintage edition brings a very helpful introduction written by John Updike, that in the end illuminate many points."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"The book starts with a great tale by Maugham which deliciously foreshadows the fate of the story. A small town in the early 20th Century where small social groups drank and danced as if nothing else mattered than their status in their party circles and enemies and friends mingled. Julian and Caroline English definitely had secure places in this little community until something so wicked happens! (but so refreshing and rather funny) After this incident, things all spiral down as far as the English's are concerned but in the end, even \\"the appointment in Samarra\\" is inconsequential to the rest of the town. Sometimes it is funny/sad and reads like \\"Old School\\" or \\"hangover\\" movie,--sadly stupid behaviors of (prematurely successful) immature men (no intention to insult the author). I think this is a little bit like Hemingway's writing--simple, straightforward, and reflection of the psychology of men of a certain period and place in American history. I definitely see the value and the point of 5 star reviews but I personally didn't really connect with the story or the characters as much."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"O'Hara introduces his main character and drives straight and hard to the story's conclusion. He writes peceptively about marital relations, and about how men and women think about sexual acts. I was really surprised at how directly and perceptively he writes about sex.He is in complete control of this work from beginning to end, and it never for a moment sounds false or romantisized."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"This is the first O'Hara novel I've read in decades. Back then, I read for sensationalism. In the ensuing years, like my body, my reading tastes have matured. This book in particular, with its wonderful take on a certain society at a certain point in history, should be read by anyone interested in the modern novel. Way ahead of its time -- astounding that it was published in 1934."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Trained in the low couture of daily print journalism, John O'Hara's minimalist style makes this novel about Pennsylvania's anthracite community seem most American, most blue collar, most \\"down to earth.\\"Reminiscent of a Fitzgerald protagonist, Julian English's engagements in destructive lifestyle habits make him lose reputation, prestige and his friends in the small city of Gibbsville - population approximately 30,000. And, like Fitzgerald - the cause of the demise is alcohol.Although not as eerily descriptive of the dipsomaniacal psyche as Lowry's protagonist (the Consul) in \\"Under the Volcano\\", this book resonates with the torturous conflict running through the depressed mind of the young man who - at least what others would proclaim - \\"has it all.\\" He has a good job, money, good family, and most importantly for those in the 1930's - a solid and beautiful \\"swell gal\\" for a wife.When I read this novel, it became more and more obvious to me that the John Updike introduction was more than a mere coincidence. Julian very much resembles Updike's Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom of \\"Rabbit Run.\\" Gibbsville is so similar to Updike's Brewer. Harry is 26, Julian is 29 going on 30. Updike was 29 when he wrote \\"Rabbit , Run.\\" O'Hara about the same. Julian and Harry are married to women from good families. Both are frustrated. Both are crushed by the demands placed upon their immature souls - the demands by both family and community.After having read a few older classics which drip prose through syrupy words reminiscent of 19th century style, this Hemingway-influenced writer whose light usage of English vocabulary and \\"minimalist fiction\\" makes reading whip at a much faster pace - something which this 21st century reader finds more appealing. I find his writing style more akin to the 20th century American mystery writer - Marlowe, Chandler and Cain.My one recommendation to anyone reading this or \\"Rabbit, Run\\" is to read the books back to back. The similarities are astounding, but how each twists and turns in opposite directions seems to be reflective of different sentimentalities and national spirits: \\"Rabbit, Run\\" (1960) involves a more optimistic America than the post-Depression America of \\"Appointment in Samarra\\" (1934)."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Right from the start, I could tell that this would be an enjoyable and insightful book. Written in a down to earth style, the reader is given an intimate view of the main charaters Caroline and Julian English and are allowed into their WASPish country club molded mindset. The charater sketches are well done, and the reader gets to feel that he is thouroughly familiar with each of the main characters. A little short considering the amount of time spent on sketching separate bibliographies, but generally well done"},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Excellent study of a man bent on self destruction. Although written almost ten years afer Hemmingway's The Sun Also Rises, it has simmilar themes and I found myself comparing the two. Appointment in Samarra is very much superior as O'Hara's characters contain a passion that Hemmingway could not or would not create. Although flawed, I found myself liking both Julian and Caroline English. By comparison I learned to intensely dislike the characters of 'The Sun Also Rises'. Like Hemmingway, O'Hara's prose is compact and precise but unlike Hemmingway, the dialogue is realistic and not clumsy.Suppessedly, the characters were modeled after real people from O'Hara's hometown of Pottsville, PA. But they seemed very familiar to people each of us have probably encountered sometime during our lifetime. This makes the novel very beleivable and very readable. The book is not nearly ponderous as are some classics and can be read rather quickly."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"This book is like American Beauty of the 1930s. A man, trapped into a rigid social order, bursts out uncontrollably. Amazingly, this novel focuses on modern themes that still exist today, despite being written seventy years ago.One man, going to dances and social clubs, trying to keep his community standing in tact, maintaining his marriage, just couldn't take it anymore. A simple thing like disliking a man's story later tears his life apart. Such a simple constrained life blew up like a high-pressure balloon.While not a story with action or a plot, it is a literary device that portrays the upper-middle class life at that time. It's a nice timepiece and gives the reader a sense of living that life. A typical small Depression era American town with a country club and speak easy.It's a suprisingly quick and easy read, with a good description of life, and an opening for social interests. Unfortunately, it doesn't captivate readers like many other literary masterpieces."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"O'Hara captures the defining moment in one man's life, as the title suggests, as he makes an appointment with death. A tale of the trajedy that lies not far below the surface of the otherwise perfect life. If you love good ol' American story telling, you won't find anything more smooth than Appointment in Samara. Like any master O'Hara makes story telling look so easy."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"I picked up Appointment in Samarra hoping to find some connection with the war in Iraq or with Somerset Maugham's very short story of the same name. Death comes to us all, I guess, is the common theme, but I was a bit disappointed that there was not much overt political or literary connection. The story was compelling even though it was mainly a ride down the spiral into Julian's (and his society's) oblivion. You knew what was coming by the end of the second or third chapter -- it was inevitable that this would end badly. I hated Julian English but I also felt sympathy for the spoiled, bratty \\"rebel.\\" I felt bad that he never got to explore his latent homosexuality, but given the sordid approach he took to life, I didn't regret the abasement that would have accompanied such exploration. Everything he touched turned to some sort of ordure, but I laughed at several drunken scenes and generally enjoyed his bad behavior. O'Hara's description of his wife Caroline in chapter 6 was the best part of the book. He knows the people of this era very well and encapsulates their tragedy as effectively as Fitzgerald ever did. The ending of the book was a bit puzzling, especially the \\"introduction\\" of a (not entirely) new character in the last chapter, but I enjoyed having to review the book to figure out who was who. The \\"triumph\\" of Lute in the end of the book gave me much less pleasure than I might have expected, perhaps because he seems less a good guy by the end.I'm amazed I only just discovered this book since it tells the kind of truth about the American tradition that professors and canonizers usually love. Perhaps O'Hara was too popular in his lifetime to earn lasting praise. Anyway, it's well worth reading now, even though the book is depressing and sort of sordid. We haven't grown much since the days of Julian and his ilk, and prose this exciting still roils the blood. The author does some \\"experimenting\\" with free association and dreams that might feel excessive, but you can feel his love of language. It's easy to respond to the passion beneath the purple prose."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"I was not disappointed with this novel, but I do not think it belongs on the best novels of the century list. While much of this book is excellent, its flaws are jarringly obvious. There are plot holes galore, characters who inexplicably appear and then are never heard from again, and so much detail that it just boggles the mind. I suspect that when O'Hara sat down to write this book, he just started typing whatever came to his mind, and without consideration for structure, grammar, or punctuation. After he was finished, he sent it off to his publisher and no one, including O'Hara, knew how to edit it. I've read several of his short stories and they suffered from these same flaws. He is, however, a matchless winner when it comes to writing dialogue; all of his characters are distinctly real in the way they talk. Alas, sometimes, I wonder what ever happened to John O'Hara; he was one of the literary lights of the first half of this century, but he is largely forgotten today."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"Classism and alcoholism before any 'disease model' or political correctness. Reading this book is like some sort of regression into a time when your name was your destiny and if you blemished it with too much hootch, it was a tumble from God's grace and your country club status. English, the hero's patronym, and certainly the central point of the American aristocratic mimicry- O'Hara was Irish, after all, though entranced perhaps even more over the WASP's he wrote of so often tragically. Julian's father was a 'first rate' social standard, although the son followed too far in the darker torments of his grandfather the thief and scandalous patriarch held in front of the child throughout his life. Here we see an author in touch with the psychoanalytic religion of his day. This book is an anachronism and an overly romantic and too obvious tale of the fallen soul. That's what makes it akin to a secretive enjoyable read!"},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"It all depends. If you class John O'Hara as an American writer of popular fiction, then he must be up there at the very top with detailed descriptions of his society, use of both colloquial and literary language, and character development. If, on the other hand, you put him in that category we often label \\"classic fiction\\", then he doesn't measure up to the other greats of his time. I can't place O'Hara alongside Faulkner, Hemingway, Lewis, Fitzgerald, or even Anderson. Still, APPOINTMENT IN SAMARRA reads very well; it is fast-paced and involves you with the various characters, it contains humor, and excellently drawn characters.Julian English, the main protagonist, inherits a place at the top of his society in Gibbsville, Pennsylvania---a pseudonym for Pottstown, where O'Hara grew up. He has married the most desirable girl of his set. What makes him throw a drink in the face of a gentleman who annoys or bores him ? Whatever it is, that starts a most precipitous decline, which only a few days later, leads to a (by then) non-surprise ending. Fate has written it thus, and Julian cannot escape. He doesn't struggle much, that's for sure. Much of the book explores the previous lives of several characters: wife, friends, a small-time gangster. Pottstown life comes across as narrowly provincial, sexually active, fairly alcoholic, at least in its upper reaches, and divided into rigid categories. It has been said before about O'Hara that he creates excellent atmosphere, builds up an intricate plot, and then crashes at the end. This novel is no exception; it just trickles across the finish line.O'Hara's America is one in which Anglo-Saxons still rule, but live under challenge from newer, perhaps more dynamic groups. The rulers dislike all their challengers intensely. Snobbism is writ large in O'Hara's work---though a Catholic of Irish descent, he obviously placed himself with the ruling class and he did come from a wealthy background. He constantly emphasizes the importance of \\"being with the right people\\", consuming the right items, living on the right street, and \\"being at the right social events\\". And it's no wonder that he reserves his nastiest cracks for Jews. Never a mention without a sneer, a condescending witticism, or outright nastiness. I often felt like throwing the book out the window. I thanked my good luck that I outlived that narrowminded America and can look back on Mr. O'Hara and his heyday with considerable relief that America has changed, at least in this way, for the better. Nothing can prove my point better than the experience of reading this outdated novel."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"I don't recall the last time or if I've ever read a novel before, At the Age of 32, I saw my spiraling life in the characterization of Julian.But the culture in the 30s. OMG I always thought of it to be so uptight and conservative. One thing is how the Jewish people were infered in this book, as a culture we have come a long way, I don't know where we've gone, but we've gone a long way. Another was the attitudes instilled with marriage... it seemed a sort of stick by your man, if he's a cheating sonofabitch there could be worse, so stick it out... The next was the stag line, so they go to a dance, and there is a line of men, married/single that wait for a girl to dance or to cut in on someone. Nowadays in my imagination if you going to a dance or a club with a woman, that is the woman your with the whole night. Oh my has birth control changed the way families are peiced together. I tend to see why in many cases they slept in a separate bed most nights. We have a freedom that is off the hook in comparison. Maybe I missed the point, but three simple days Oh yeah, I could be 'there' in three days."},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"This is a first-rate book, that Hemingway himself praised highly. Fran Lebowitz wrote the good introduction in this edition...but Fran, if you read this, the expression isn't &quot;brevity is the soul and wit&quot;--as you put it in the introduction--the expression is, &quot;brevity is the soul OF wit.&quot;"},{"Title":"Appointment in Samarra","review":"&quot;Esquire Magazine&quot; founder Arnold Gingrich said that the only reason Hemingway praised this is because it is such a copy-cat of Hemingway's style, calling &quot;Samarra&quot; weak. O'Hara famously called Hemingway the greatest writer since Shakespeare. But O'Hara once said he never read Tolstoy. How can you call a writer the greatest since Shakespeare when you've never read Tolstoy? O'Hara mainly read Fitzgerald and Hemingway over and over, and I think his work suffers for his not have read more broadly. &quot;Appointment in Samara&quot; is very good at contrasting status--something O'Hara was obsessed with--in an American town. But I find O'Hara's dialogue--that he gets so much praise for--dated. Whereas Hemingway's dialogue in &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;--written BEFORE &quot;Samarra&quot;--does not look dated at all now. O'Hara famously wrote his fiction quickly. It has that feel to it in spots. In the 90's there was an attempt at an O'Hara revival. Well, that revival fell flat. I can see why it did fall flat. He wasn't that terrific a writer. But, this book is pretty good. (I don't understand the last passage of this book, that conversation.

I had no desire to waste time sitting in a class room so I decided to try the CLEP exams. I took the US History exam yesterday. To be able to look at each test question and think \\" My gosh I know this\\" is a great feeling.This book was the basis of my preparation; used in conjunction with Barons EZ 101 American History to 1877 and America A Narrative History. The REA CLEP book covered some topics in more depth than others but when used with the other references , I was more than prepared. The best part of this book is the practice exams and the answer explanations. Some of the practice questions were on my actual CLEP exam word for word others were rephrased but still strongly resembled the practice questions . This book is worth every penny and I have already purchased the REA CLEP book for the Western Civilization test that I will take in 4 weeks. When time is of the essence, you will find this book to be an excellent investment in your success."},{"Title":"The CLEP History of the United States I w/CD (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the CLEP (Test Preps)","review":"I just took the clep exam and passed with a 68. HOWEVER!!! before you get excited and buy this book I felt grossly unprepared based on the material in this book. It was much harder then the practice test would lead you to think. If I had not researched on my own I don't believe I would have passed.My study plan. ..(over a period of about 4 weeks)I simply read the book completely then took the first test and got a 51. studied the \\"explanations\\" built into the test and then took test 2 and got a 60. Then I decided to make flash cards for all the questions within test one and two until I knew all of them cold. Then took test three and made a 80. I made more flash cards from test three. Then I checked out of the library a documentary on the civil war, and one on slavery. After that, I learned all the presidents, and what they did during their term in office (outside of this book of course).What was on the test...When I walked in I felt ready, yet when I saw the first question I thought \\"I'm in trouble.\\" There were at least 10 questions about the \\"antebellum\\" period which is not covered in the book. There were 5-8 questions about Indian chiefs and what tribe they lead, and where they were in the US, and \\"what was 'x' tribe leader famous for saying\\". NOT one word in this book or on the three test about Indian chiefs. Several questions on women's rights at different periods. There were also a lot of questions about books, authors and social life during the pre-civil war time and pre-revolution period then I would have ever expected.while I was studying I kept notes on where I got the information in case I wanted to go back. All and all I would say that if you know the book and practices test answers cold (as I did) and studied nothing else you will probably just barely make a 50 if you guess really well, as I felt I did (you may even fail).It was the outside sources I believe give me the best prep. I specially could answer more questions from outside sources then from my prep within this book which is disappointing.I give it three stars because I learned some interesting things about US History and for only about 100 pages of reading it covers a good bit of material. However, as a prep for the CLEP History, I don't think this book cuts it. You will have to study other material if you want to pass. One person said they had questions from this CD that were the same as on the actual clep exam. I just took it and there was only one question (out of 120) that I felt was similar to any of the 360 questions I had memorized. I may have just taken a different test.My final advice... \\"DON'T BET YOUR SCORE ON THIS BOOK ALONE! A text book is probably your best bet, or at a minimal study the test questions, be familiar with all the treaties, which states are slave and free, famous authors, and know every thing there is to know about the colonies before the revolution in 1775!"},{"Title":"The CLEP History of the United States I w/CD (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the CLEP (Test Preps)","review":"How do you cover American History from the late 1400's to 1877 in about 120 pages? It's not possible to cover it all, and this book doesn't do that. But it does cover the high points and many items that are important in passing the CLEP exam. Much of the material covered was on the version of the CLEP that I got, and the material was covered in concise form.The only complaint I have about this book is that the language is sometimes difficult and laborious to read. I guess I would classify it as \\"poor sentence structure.\\" However, the material is there, and if you take your time reading it, you should get out of it what you need.The tests on the accompanying CD were probably the best thing about this book. They are spot on as far as being similar to the material you should see on the real CLEP, and the format is similar enough that you will feel right at home when you take the real thing.This book and the CD were my best weapon in passing this exam."},{"Title":"The CLEP History of the United States I w/CD (REA) - The Best Test Prep for the CLEP (Test Preps)","review":"Some of the other REA CLEP studies are just ok.

It plays like a \\"Where's Waldo\\" of famous (and infamous) prisons throughout history. The Tower of London, Doge's Prison, the Bastille, Devil's Island, Alcatraz, and many more are intricately laid out across a two page spread with accompanying text briefly sharing notes of interest and tidbits of facts regarding the focused keep.Within each picture there is an incarcerated cast to be located. Every prison will have it's kind jailer, the cruel jailer, the Governor (or head jailer), the prisoner that has adapted and made himself comfortable, and the one that's trying to get away. One will also find a prisoner's pet in each lock-up, as well.I must admit, though, that my favorite part of the book is in locating the famous prisoner in each scene. Within the front and back covers is the Rogues' Gallery where you will find a listing of Who's Who among the illustrated fortresses for you to locate. Al Capone, Josef Stalin, and Sir Thomas More just to name a few.All in all, this is a very unique and surprisingly fun (for it's topic) book. It may be a little morbid for the very young, but I definitely recommend it as a child will actually learn something historic while enjoying its game-like structure at the same time."},{"Title":"Treehouse tales (The Muffin family picture Bible)","review":"This book was great.

The stories (or truth) start in the 18th century and include the stories behind the names of such places as \\"Calamity Pond\\", \\"Sabbath Day Point\\" or \\"Bloody Pond\\". Heller also mentions the history of the areas names and places throughout the centuries. Even the 46 High Peaks have their origins uncovered and how they have changed over the years. Dr. Heller would make an amazing leader of a \`fire-side' chat. This is a rare book and one that should be cherished for all the research, dedication and information that went into it.

At first look I was a bit disappointed because it's a beginning knitting book, but after further perusal I found I wanted to make more than half of the 30 projects in it. I've been knitting a long time and sometimes it's hard to find challenging and inspiring projects, especially with the abundance of beginner's knitting books currently available. This book was a pleasant surprise - it's full of fresh, fun, trendy, and colorful designs. It would be a wonderful book for a beginning knitter - the instructions are very clear, basic techniques are clearly presented, and the projects teach lots of fun embellishment techniques such as beading and duplicate stitch. At the same time, the designs are creative enough to inspire more advanced knitters, and patterns for items like gloves and hats can easily be adapted for circular or double point needles. All of the projects are both decorative and very functional, and most would be special enough for gifts.

Twenty patterns are included, the fingerless glove pattern has four variations. I will probably make fifteen of the twenty patterns, and that's a good ratio.High points: The driving gloves, legwarmers (like none you've seen before), chunky ruffle beanie, ribbed earflap hat, pompon hat, and floral relief scarf.These are gorgeous patterns you won't be bored of while knitting."},{"Title":"Easy Knitted Accessories: Funky And Fashionable Projects For The Novice Knitter","review":"I have to start out by saying I am about as novice a knitter as there could be, so the 'easy' in the title was enticing.

The projects are not your typical scarf, mittens, etc. that you usually find in 'easy' books; they are fun, stylish and creative. Quite a few projects are beaded and different/unique cabling is used to create many of the styles.

This book is meant to appeal to beginners or to be used by knitters who want gift ideas. It has beautiful photographs, etc, and a nice introduction, but almost every project is poorly constructed. When so many beautiful items can be knitted using circular needles, this author opted for straight.

For all the patterns that require a size: hats, gloves, mittens, slippers, and socks, everything is sized for \\"an average adult women.\\" It would have been nice to have had more of a size range included, and also things sized for children.

Thank you Amazon and Krause publishing)Apart from the designs in the book which are creative, beautiful and actually worth making (this is not another collection of garter stitch scarves in different colours), every time a new skill is introduced, there are clear instructions, graphics and pictures to help along a knitter trying for example, beading or intarsia for the first time. The author also offers ideas and tips for using each pattern in a slightly different way by varying colour/texture. And the yarn information is clearly presented to facilitate substitution... (did I mention that I love this book?)I'm what one might consider an advanced beginner and I adore this book and can't recommend it highly enough.

His &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; # 74. These are accurate rankings.Reading &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; after &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; or &quot;Ulysses&quot; is like warming one's bones in a hot tub after a 100-mile run. But the book does leave a corrugated groove on the reader's mind as how that small group of the Lost Generation in Paris lived their confused lives, which other readers have accurately recalled from the book.There is nothing &quot;deep&quot; in the book; just a straight reporting of events. Nothing explicit about art or music or philosophy or psychology or rhetorical devices of the language as one would find in Proust and Joyce, unless one condiders the description of the bullfights, which is nicely done, and the one remark on the narrator's lack sensibility or ability to know and use irony and pity, which is poorly done, as enough &quot;depth&quot; for a book of that size.Not that such &quot;deep&quot; things can not be found in the book; they can, to a modest level. The burden of finding them is on the reader. The &quot;deep&quot; things would have to be lifted by the reader's sustained contemplation of the characters' behavior, and then the reader would have to go elsewhere for a deeper understanding of those behaviors. Even at the modest level, the simplicity of the book's sentences forces the reader to rush, making the effort of discovery difficult for the reader.Did Hemingway, indeed, intend to talk about &quot;deep&quot; things in any of his books? And if so, can short declarative sentences prove a worthy vehicle to carry and convey the weight of &quot;deep&quot; thoughts?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is Hemingway's best novel and the best novel of all! (Writing a review of it almost seems to tarnish its greatness.) Hemingway's terse, impactful prose works in full force telling the tale of Jake Barnes and his (impossible) love, Brett Ashley. It tackles all the relevant themes of the Lost Generation and captures the spirit of expatriot Paris and Europe. In my opinion, it upstages &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; by orders of magnitude including its portriat of post-WWI decadence, its writing, its romance, its action, its story, and most importantly its realism. AND IT HAS THE BEST FINAL LINE IN HISTORY! (There is more emotion and power in that line than most 20th Century fiction rolled together.)

They bicker and whine about lost and purposeless relationships. What is the point???? The writing is slow, except for some parts, like when two men go fishing in Spain. Otherwise, it is tiresome, boring, almost painful, and quite frankly, of little redeemable value.

The scenes involving the fishing and the bullfighting are very evocative, and the dialogue interesting. The understatement or non-statement (Hemmingway's iceberg approach to writing) works very well in this, his first book that brought him to national attention. In that regard, the horrors of World War I constitute those parts of the iceberg that lie beneath the water, and influence the emptiness of the social life that is above. The &quot;what might have been&quot; conversation between Jake and Brett (who both love each other, but who both know the hopelessness of that love) at the end of the book is particularly touching.Notwithstanding the above, none of the characters have much for the reader to be attracted to. A constant never-ending stream of alcohol seems to flow through the book. It's incredible that people can drink as much as the principal characters in the book do. Then there's Brett, the 34 year old woman, who has Jake loving her (and she loves him), is engaged to Mike, has an affair with Robert Cohn (who also loves her), and in the end, seemingly out of the blue, takes off and seduces the 19 year old bullfighter, Pedro Romero. Try to figure that out.Also, I want to comment on what I consider to be an uncomfortable excess of anti-semitic sentiment in this book. Consider this exchange between Jake and Bill about Brett on p. 230 of the paperback Scribner edition (1954).--&quot;She hasn't any money with her?&quot; I asked --&quot;I shouldn't think so. She never has any money. She gets five hundred quid a year and pays three hundred and fifty of it in interest to Jews.&quot; --&quot;I supppose they get it at the source,&quot; said Bill. --&quot;Quite. They're not really Jews. We just call them Jews. They're Scotsmen, I believe.&quot;Of course, the heart of the anti-semitism in this book is the way the characters relate to Robert Cohn. Some of it can be chalked up to jealousy, particularly as Cohn had had an affair with Brett, and Jake, who loves Brett, is sexually crippled because of his war injuries. But almost all of the principal characters, not just Jake, take pleasure in continually deriding Cohn's Jewishness to his face, to each other, or just in their mental, often alcohol-induced lucubrations. The references occur all too often throughout the book, e.g., there's Jake, saying that Cohn had a &quot;hard, Jewish, stubborn streak,&quot; p. 10, Bill [on Cohn] at p. 162, &quot;[h]e's got this Jewish superiority so strong that he thinks the only emotion he'll get out of the fight will be being bored&quot; and Mike, &quot;Take that sad Jewish face away, p. 177 . . . etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. I realize that times change. I don't believe we should judge books from an earlier generation by today's standards of political correctness. Nonetheless, the characters in this book are often mean-spirited, and excessively anti-semetic without, in my view, an adequately compensating literary justification (which in the context of the holocaust to come a mere decade latter, should give pause). For whatever it's worth, in A Moveable Feast (a description of his life in Paris in the 1920s), the most generous portrait in that book is to the renowned poet (though fascist sympathizer) Ezra Pound.Perhaps, World War I had gutted the soul, and that explains the Gertrude Stein quote, that Hemmingway uses to preface the book, &quot;You are all a lost generation.&quot; But maybe the excuse is too easy."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I thought that this book was really boring. All that I kept thinking of was if I was near the end. I chose to read this book for my AP English 11 class during the summer and found that it was one of the worst novels that I have ever read.

It irritated me because all they did was drink liquor all day long. This book also should me the unhappy lives of the characters. Ugh! How boring!

They drink beer, they eat, they smoke, they sip coffee, they chat, they sleep, and then they wake up and start the whole process over. They really don't do a whole lot more than that and you've got to wonder why anyone would willfully chronicle this. They sound like early twenty-somethings on the party circuit (and we all know how profoundly interesting that time of our lives was right?). I'm sure there's a lot of symbolism and all of that other neat stuff lurking beneath the surface of this story, but it's so dull, you find yourself asking &quot;who cares&quot;?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises (TSAR) chronicles the drinking and traveling of a handful of privileged young Americans in Europe. Picture MTV's Real World in the 1920's with lots of wine. And it's an all-white cast with one Jewish dude: Robert Cohn, a boxer from Princeton University. The Ivy League uber-honkies in Hemingway's TSAR talk doodoo about Cohn behind his back, but quietly. Aside from being known for its sneaky anti-Semitism, TSAR is famous for broaching the issue of male impotence during a time when the inability to get hard was simply not discussed or admitted. There is no definite objective or purpose in these people wandering drunk around Western Europe, but the story culminates in a quasi-pilgrimage to a bullfight in Spain. &lt;new paragraph&gt; This book is short and comprised of terse sentences, and is therefore frequently recommended to younger readers and people who don't care for long, detailed, flowery prose. But that is a big mistake: even though the words of this novel are easy to read, the 'meaning' of TSAR is layered and tricky. It takes you a minimum of two reads to actually understand it. (For me, I am still discovering stuff I didn't notice after my third time reading it!) If you have the patience to read the text carefully and severally, you'll see why TSAR is regarded as an American classic."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"There is so much of Hemingway the man, the hunter, the drinker, etc., that may detract one from Hemigway the writer. That being said, this book, by any other author, would not be praised and talked about to the present day if there was not an image of the &quot;great&quot; Hemingway behind it. His distinct style is there and the chapters on fishing and bull-fighting are executed nicely. The characters, though, are boring, anti-Semitic drunks. Lady Brett Ashley, the eye candy in the book, is a trite, lying, promiscuous drunk who is anything but a lady. Mike is a pugnacious drunk. Bill is an indifferent drunk. Robert Cohn is a Jew and a non-drunk. Jake is the impotent drunk who narrates the story. In my insignificant opinion, I think the book would have benefited if we knew more about these people. Perhaps if I knew what happened to them, I could understand their behavior or the attraction of being drunk in Europe. Another thing, why is Robert Cohn in this book? It seems to me that he is there for others to let out their Jew comments on him. Every time he appears someone has to say they hate his Jew this or that. Perhaps, this was a prevalent attitude at the time, but again, I don't know. Without him there, the book would have amounted to the same thing. The New York Times, in their review of this book, wrote: &quot;An absorbing, beautifully and tenderly absurd, heart-breaking narrative . . .It is a truly gripping story, told in lean, hard athletic prose . . .magnificent.&quot; If you re-read that statement, you'll see just how specious it and the book really are. Do yourself a favor and let the Hemingway worshippers read this book. Fitzgearld, in a drunken stupor, was a better writer than Hemingway.

He is cast then in the role of supporting her through her foibles with other men, and we are able to suffer the tragedy with him as he fails to be able to attain the relationship he desires with the woman he loves.

Now let's have dinner and walk around. Let's go drink some more.

However, through a process of accretion, we discover the depths of their beings--whether they be the cynical, ironic Jake Barnes, the neurotic Robert Cohen, the sophisticated/horny Brett. There are passages in this book that are subtly breathtaking (if one can accept the oxymoron). You must, as Hemingway would say, penetrate the tip of the iceberg and see the emotional truth underneath the wry observation or the bits of dialogue. If one is willing, one will find more and more substance as one re-reads this book; there is no self-consciousness as there is in some more contemporary American \\"straightshooters\\" like Raymond Carver et al. The constant dialectic between the tough guy Jake narrator and his acute sensitivity to the smallest detail, making it of universal import is a wonderful thing to behold. It's not likely we can ever read literature so well-crafted again: one that combines the romantic, the tragic, the humorous, the complexities of human emotion and the simplicity of the enjoyment of simply being alive. The Sun also Rises makes you work, and if you are not willing to do the work, don't bother reading it. Hemingway is thought of as having lived a macho lifestyle, but this book challenges the reader to dig deep into his/her sensibility and simultaneously understand the smooth surface of the writing and the concentric circles of meaning it is suggesting. Hemingway gives you the facts; underneath, comingling with these facts are matters of profound substance or simply, matters that really matter: what's worth doing, what's worth living for, how to face tragedy, how to face disappointment. A gesture, a line of dialogue, a description in this book resonates with meaning if you open yourself up to the echoes. This is a book to read, then meditate on, then if you think it doesn't have substance, read it again and again until you get it: what do you get? It says so right there in the epigram. From the first page \\"Robert Cohen was middleweight boxing champion of Princeton University\\" to the last \\"I'd like to think so,\\" there's the power of writing as simple and complex as a stone thrown in the middle of a placid lake. If you want \\"story muzak\\" and roller coaster rides, try Tom Clancey, Scott Turow, or any number of best selling authors. But maybe when you've had your fill of them, maybe you will decide it's time to get off the elevator and face the world on your feet."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Gallons of ink have been spilled over what Gertrude Stein labeled \\"the lost generation.\\" The label was used primarily for American expatriates who flooded into Paris after World War I. Ernest Hemingway was a central figure, no doubt because he documented their lives in such books asA Moveable Feastas well as this one. The author was a literary icon of the \`60's. I've been re-reading his works; still found much excellence inTo Have and Have Not (Scribner Classics)but it took significant will-power to finish \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"The story is told through the eyes of Jake Barnes, who had the most feared of war wounds, which meant he could never consummate his relationship with Lady Brett Ashley, who had been his nurse during the recovery period. Obviously it was frustrating for her, which may have been the reason she managed to bed most of the other characters in the story. There are a half dozen other principal characters, including another woman. Jake is a reporter, but there is so little factual news that the reader cannot even tell if it is the early \`20's or the latter years of that decade. The novel is an account of their toing and froing; they are immensely puerile and self-absorbed. The inane conversations, ah, \\"the dialogue\\" so often resembles today's: \\"Eh, what's happening. Nothing, how \`bout you.\\" It was excruciatingly painful to read. And it was devoid of any sign of irony on Hemingway's part.The novel's settings are primarily in Paris, and towards the end the \\"action\\" moves to Pamplona, in Spain, to see the bull fights. But the backdrop for the character's passions and quarrels is so one-dimensional; I thought it might be like going to Las Vegas to see the Pyramids, or the canals of Venice--a totally ersatz experience. The French and Spaniards in the story are just so many props... there is no real insight into their character. And overall, there is pitifully little to learn about these societies during the inter-war period. The main thing Hemingway seems to get right is the street names in Paris. And certainly the restaurant, the Closerie des Lilas, remains a \\"destination\\" for American tourists because of him.Then there is the madness of bull fighting itself, which can be off-putting to more sensitive souls. I saw one, briefly, in Arles. At least in the one I saw, the horses had thick pads which protected them; in Hemingway's book, they did not, no doubt reflecting the reality of the event.Shallow characters, insipid, whining interactions, set against poorly described \\"exotic\\" settings. I rounded up to 2-stars, and wonder if I should retry \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls (Scribner Classics)"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Written as a commentary on the lives of Americans post World War, The Sun Also Rises is told through the narration of Jake Barnes, an American living in Paris. He admires Lady Brett Ashley, but has suffered a wound that leaves him sexually incapable. Some of his fellow Americans come to Paris and then Spain to visit. Jake tries to come to terms with the meaning of life, but he seemingly never finds this, and along the way hostility mounts between the friends. While there is a story to tell, it isn't much of a story, and I found myself liking this book less and less as time wore on.I hate to admit it, but I'm in the \\"I like Hemingway but I'm not a fan of this book\\" club. I remember having to read this in college and not liking it much, so I decided to give it another try. I like reading as much as any avid reader, but this book just didn't engage me like many of Hemingway's other works.For starters, this is a book devoid of sympathetic characters. The characters are, well, pathetic. I really found myself hating many of these snobs and just wanting to get to the next segment of the story. Jake, the protagonist, meets a prostitute early in the novel and rebuffs her, saying he is \\"sick.\\" This could be a description for many of the main characters, as they are all lacking something to make their existence seem complete. For instance, Brett's character is fairly shallow; she drinks a lot (like many other characters) and sleeps around. I get the idea that this work is representative of the \\"lost generation\\", a group who have no connections to the outside world and just wander from place to place, but, for the most part, I found the characters irksome and annoying. I don't know why so many Hemingway fans are sold on this book; I have loved Hemingway's style and novels, but this one was a burden to read and I found myself rolling my eyes at many of the characters. They appear to be a group of individuals with nothing to do, nowhere to go, and no life to live. They never do anything that has any significance, just mope around. There aren't many redeeming qualities for these characters, and I think that is what makes this lesser of a Hemingway novel. I loved some of his others books, such as A Farewell to Arms and For Whom The Bell Tolls, as well as some of his great short stories. But, for some reason, this book really never took off with me.The other problem is that there is seemingly no continuity in the book. Everything appears to be just a haphazard event, and there is nothing much ado about nothing as we go through page after page of them moving from bar to bar, restaurant to restaurant, hotel to hotel. How many times can we possible hear about how someone wants to have an exquisite dinner or a fine vintage wine or champagne, or some other kind of drink at every single place they visit? It got nauseating after awhile, truth be told.If you do read this story, read it for the Hemingway's style, the simple structure that is refreshing to read, and the one aspect that makes this novel worthwhile."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I was quite distraught at the fact that I didn't enjoy a Hemingway. Maybe my literary tastes aren't quite as sharp and mature as they should be to enjoy this classic. But regardless, my review will not be a strongly positive one.The pointless meandering of the characters and their idle conversation gave me little to grab at. Jake, Brett, Cohn, and friends wander around in Paris and Spain as part of the &quot;Lost Generation&quot;. It is irrefutable that this was the desired effect, but it was just too, well, boring. As expatriates, they spend their lives bouncing from cafes to bars in search of meaning (or inebriation) and from mate to mate (especially Brett). Various characters make various travels, but only when the group vacations in Pamplona, Spain, does the story go with it. The plot is empty, searching for something, indeed quite like the generation about whom it was written.Even though I didn't enjoy The Sun Also Rises, I do respect the fact that it is a classic book written by a classic author. For that alone, (and for the excellent reviews of most of the others,) this book deserves to be given a shot."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Let me just first compliment how perceptive some of the Amazon reviews of \\"the Sun Also Rises\\" are, whether pointing out how effectively Hemingway's terse style can describe a particularly intense scene, or the internal conflicts that each main character struggles with, or the parallelism that Hemingway does so well (for instance, the similarities between the relationship of the matador and bull, as compared with Brett's relationship with the various men who fall in love with her).The novel, of course, is told from the point of view Jake Barnes (an American expatriate now living and working as a reporter in Paris), a decent but understandably bitter sort of guy, rendered impotent due to an injury sustained while fighting in the first World War. Basically, he describes a week or two in his life with the gorgeous desirable Brett, Brett's \\"fiancee\\" Mike, an obnoxious Jewish semi-successful writer named Robert Cohn, and all around good-guy drinking buddy Bill. Jake and Bill intially set off on a pleasant fishing trip in a small rural Spanish village, and then join up with the other three in Pamplona for the big \\"Fiesta\\" - the principle event of which is bullfighting, of which Jake is an \\"aficionado\\" (passionate fan). All three men are in love with Brett who returns (or has returned) the favor when it suits her. Basically, all the characters stay drunk morning, noon, and night for the entire trip, but Brett ends up running off with a promising young bullfighter named Pedro Romero, causing another aficionado, who owns the hotel they're staying at, to grow hostile towards his former friend Jake, and his friends.A few observations:1. The book is rife with unflattering references to Jews and Blacks (with the most vile words for each repeatedly used). Though the characters may be anti-semitic and rascist, it would be unfair to draw the conclusion that Hemingway (or any other author for that matter), agrees with his characters, who are fairly odious and unsympathetic in any event.2. One disagreement I have with other reviewers is that Brett and Jake would have found true love and happiness if only Jake could have comsummated the relationship. First, Brett's modus operandi is to make men fall in love with her, sleep with them, and then dump them, leaving them in shambles. She likes her power over men even though she's pretty miserable herself. Second, it seemed to me that Brett kept running back to Jake as a confidante for the very reason that he couldn't sleep with her even though he wanted to. This was the way she tormented Jake who, despite his knowing better, kept asking for more (Jake would have been a heck of alot better off without any of these people).3. The drinking the characters imbibe in is nothing short of insane. We're talking about two bottles of wine per person in the middle of the day, and that's just getting started. I wish someone had met or caused some sort of tragic event because her or she was drunk -- then I could be assured that the author doesn't actually approve of it.4. The only character who had any sense or real moral conscience in the book was a waiter who pointed out to Jake how utterly foolish people were who \\"ran with the bulls,\\" another showcase event of the Fiesta. The waiter spoke of a young man who died leaving behind a widow and young children. Finally a consequence!5. My biggest criticism of the book was the author's emphasis on the \\"nobility\\" and \\"bravery\\" of bullfighting (at least certain aspects of it). Basically, this spectacle consists of a matador and his helpers tormenting, torturing and killing a bull for the enjoyment and bloodlust of the audience. In my opinion, this repulsive \\"sport\\" has absolutely no place in a modern society, and I've come to learn that alot of people, even in Spain, feel the same way. Yet Hemingway seems to relish it. (I understand he wrote the book in 1926, but still).All in all, \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" lost my interest because of the unappealing characters and subject matter. But then again, Hemingway certainly writes in a unique voice, so that I still found this book worthwhile to read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The only thing that saves this overrated plotless story is its description of the Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain towards the end of the book. Otherwise, it is racist, deeply anti-Semitic, and sexist. The words nig-er and ki-e are used, while the female protagonist sleeps with anyone she chooses. The male protagonist, Jake Barnes, is apparently impotent and thus, is left to taking care of Lady Brett Ashley without any of the pleasurable rewards. Don't look for a plot, there isn't one. The book is simply a recitation on what expatriates did in Paris and Spain after World War I. Hemingway's style is clear and succinct, but definitely overrated. Robert Cohn, the Jewish character in the book, is continually degraded and disdained. And what about the 30ish Brett, Lady Ashley, the female hero? She's so beautiful all the guys want to sleep with her, including a 19-year-old bullfighter. Although I admit some of the descriptions of the bullfighting are valuable, I really don't understand why this is considered a respected literary work. When I read a book, I want a story and memorable characters. This has neither. Needless to say, I find Hemingway one of the most overrated writers of the past century.

I recognized the story as being simple on the surface, but very complex with some very profound undercurrents, and the reader is free to read it either way and still come away with something of value. The thing that took some getting used to was Hemingway's style of very short and exact sentences. Unlike mine. At times the style worked beautifully, conveying emotion even with the medium of the sentence itself, but at other points, it seemed to drag. However, this is not going to sway me from reading any of his other novels, and in fact, this work has left in me a desire to read more of his work to discover why he is thought of as such a master."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I first read this book in high school and absolutely adored it. Twenty years later I returned to these pages and have fresh appreciation for Hemingway's art. As a wordsmith, he had a talent like few others and it's very motivational for beginning writers to study his work. Looking at his sentences and comparing them to your own is a solid way in which to improve. It was specifically for this reason that I chose to reread The Sun Also Rises. In particular, the last 100 pages are absolutely superb, although it isn't as tight as a masterpiece like The Great Gatsby. I also found the full extent of the drinking to be rather shocking. I got rather nauseous from just turning the pages (lol). Looking back on the era of the lost generation, it's hard to believe that so many of them could confuse alcoholism with manliness or zest. That they did is regrettable, but I think it killed Ernest Hemingway."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"My view would be how money played a big role in the novel"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"As with all wars, World War I ended with more than just a calamitous death toll of circa 40 million. Since most breadwinners were either killed or maimed in the war, many families were forced to face the devastation of loss on their own. Compounding this tragedy was the loss of irreplaceable manpower. Economic costs, caused by the destructive forces of the war, ran into trillions of dollars, bringing countries like France and England to their knees.A spirit of doom, despair and disillusionment pervaded the world. Old ideologies seemed to mock the reality of the times and the youth who had lived through the war had abandoned them in exchange for a more licentious lifestyle. This was a time when writers like Hemingway and Fitzgerald began to express a sense of lost direction in their writing, producing such timeless masterpieces as: &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, by F. Scott Fitzgerald and , by Ernest Hemingway. Published in 1926, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; established Hemingway as the \\"big man in American letters\\" as Allan Tate wrote. It is the story of American and British expatriates living in post World War I Paris, which gives a vivid description of hopeless love and unconstrained behavior. Battling against creative dry-spells and depression, Robert Cohn and his friend, Jake Barnes, mingle with large crowds of fellow expatriates. These single \\"thirtysomethings\\" represented the \\"lost generation\\", the youth that had emerged from the war disillusioned and directionless, living by the bottle and the temporary euphoria it provided.Drifting from the left bank of Paris and the colorful, lively clubs that dotted its landscape, to the savage excitement of the bullfighting in Spain, these young men and women desperately sought to find a connection. Whether through their friendships, or through their failed attempts at love, theirs was a struggle to beat back loneliness; to fill the void the war had gouged in their souls. But they did so with laughter, idle talk and a bottle of good wine. Days were spent walking up the Rue du Cardinal in Paris looking for a good place to eat, or fishing for trout up in Burguete, Spain, dreaming all the while of unrealized love.Hemingway's seven-year stay in Paris had no doubt contributed to the realistic, picturesque account of France in the 1920's. There, he hooked up with a group of writers and other artists in a circle known as \\"the lost generation\\", which he creatively and credibly reproduced in his novel. He also spent much of his time in Pamplona, Spain watching, and sometimes participating in, bullfighting competitions. However, it was Hemingway's own semi-tragic involvement in World War I, which nearly cost him his leg, that gave the novel its soul. Through his own experiences, Hemingway successfully fused the gap between reality and art, and offered his readers a timeless masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Short of calling it the best piece of American fiction of the 20th century, there is almost no superlative that can do justice to Hemingway's unrivaled accomplishment! What can be said of this book that has not already been said, by someone, somewhere? Still, having revisited this classic twenty or so years after my first read, I am, if anything, even more convinced of its merit. Hemingway's original voice, like nothing that has been heard before or since, simply sweeps one off one's feet! His description of a man who will never be &quot;all&quot; man, as he winds his way through the maze of relationships, both male and female, and through the maze of his own always impossible to meet standards for himself, is, at times, harrowing, at other times, uplifting. And who can resist the utterly human, utterly complete, portrait of a woman who is not herself &quot;all&quot; woman, the incomparable &quot;Lady Bret&quot; Ashley? I will forever admire the ingenious, subtle way in which Hemingway sneaks in this character, probably the first sympathetically drawn transsexual in all of literature, seeing &quot;her,&quot; as &quot;she&quot; would have wanted - but never could have hoped - to be seen, as, quite simply, a lady. Bless you, Papa Hemingway!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is a wonderful book. The laconic prose can be refreshing. It captures (I assume) the emptiness and indifference of the &quot;lost generation.&quot; This is evidenced on a textual level by Hemingway's fondness for short, sober sentences devoid of exuberance. There are moments of emotion, but they are confused, realizing the characters' impotence to express themselves or even know what they are feeling. The last lines of this book are chilling."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I agree with the remarks of the reviewer a few spaces down- this could have been a wonderful short story or novella. I also kept wondering where the story was. Now, if you've read my review of The Great Gatsby, you know that I do not demand a &quot;plot&quot; so to speak, but still... I was left wondering where the beginning and the end were, and what they signified.I did enjoy the descriptions of Spain and bullfighting (I read this on a couple of hot days on my hammock with a few Coronas:) The descriptions of the bullfights, in addition to being vivid, are accurate. If anyone has ever read the works of Prosper Merimee (colomba, carmen), specifically his Lettres d'Espagne-- Les Courses de Taureaux, you will enjoy the passages in Spain in Hemingway's book.After I had finished reading and had time to digest what had occurred, I felt better about The Sun Also Rises, but I still feel the need to read it again. One thing that has always bothered me about Hemingway, however, was his anti-Semitism...By the way, can anyone fully explain the meaning of the title?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This didn't particularly impress me while reading it, then surprisingly left me with a deep sense of tragedy afterwards. The core of the novel - Jake Barnes' love for the self-destructive Brett Ashley - was very strong and subtle. It provoked sympathy and sadness. One could imagine them carrying on the way they were for the rest of their days, and that was rather depressing.I would also read this for the era and atmosphere evoked - the frantic bullfighting fiesta in 1920s Spain - as well as the hedonistic yet jaded perspective through which it was experienced. As for faults, I found certain protracted descriptions difficult to plow through (a consistent problem with Hemingway). This book dipped into 'boring' territory now and then."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Clearly THE book on the Lost Generation. I read it when I was fourteen, and it's something I have to read every couple of years or so, like &quot;Catch-22,&quot; &quot;On the Road&quot; and &quot;One Hundred Years of Solitude.&quot; For me, the Hemingway works which come closest to this are some of his short stories and &quot;A Moveable Feast.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I truly enjoyed the clarity that Hemingway conveyed in a book where most people were drunk most of the time. However, the story does go deeper than a bottle of wine. Hemingway touches upon the attitudes and fears of English people living abroad in post-war Europe. The bull-fighting scenes are amazing in their vivid depictions of the sport. I don't even like or agree with bull-fighting and he managed to romanticize it enough for me. The characters are intriguing and very entertaining in their various relationships. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Hemingway or anyone who is about to visit Spain."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This book is a snippet of a person's ordinary life. Much like our own day to day lives, it is completely boring except for the people who are living it. Though...Hemingway's writing is so concise, REALISTIC and to-the-point that it seems more like we are LIVING this book than reading it, and then it ceases to be boring.And another thing: There's too much drinking? It's about the lost generation! Of course they drink a lot. Their lives are going straight to hell, and they're depressed out of their minds. THEY'RE PATHETIC! What do you expect?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"somehow, hemmingway managed to create a novel that I loved despite the lack of characters that could be described as remotely likeable. and despite a strong aversion to bullfights (due to a rather startling childhood experience) I was caught up in the bullfighting scences, even to the point where I thought of it as beautiful. it was an intriguing read, and I highly reccommend it. but as has been mentioned, with hemmingway it seems like you either love him or hate him, and if you hate him you'll probably find this one more disagreable than most."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Sure, this book is about nothing. Yes, it simply describes the aimless, purposeless existence of Jake and his amigos. Perfect example, &quot;I had a lovely dream,&quot; Bill said. &quot;I don't remember what it was about, but it was a lovely dream.&quot; Yet I have never read a book that so beautifully handles suppressed love, sexual unattainability, and raw infatuation. Although Brett may be a minor character, the way she weaves through every man makes this book brilliant."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The novel was great! I learned so much about Hemingway, history of the past generations, and geography information about the settings of Paris and Spain! I would reccomend this novel to anyone, but be sure you do some research so you know the meaning behind some of the remarks Hemingway makes. This novel had encouraged me to start reading more. I have a reading list and am ready to start!"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"First of all, let me say this. This is a good book. I like it. But, If you haven't read any Hemingway before, don't make this your first! I beg you! You will be prejudiced against all other Hemingway books. Read The Old Man and The Sea. Aside from that, get this book. It really conveys that &quot;lost generation&quot; feel like no other."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemmingway's novel &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; is not only a literary masterpiece but a window into the Lost Generation of the 1920's. His terse prose has gained accolades worldwide and did more to influence American writers this century than any other author (sorry, Fitz). But what this outstanding novel really achieves is the insight it gives into the attitudes, mores and values of the interwar generation. A vivid picture of despair and disallusionment is painted by the masterful Hemmingway. By far this is his best work, if not for his pioneering writing style, at least for his ability to capture the spirit of a generation."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"When reading the wonderfully enticing novel, The Sun Also Rises, you get a direct view into the expatriate life in Paris in the 1920's. Hemingway beautfully represents his characters and leaves the reader satisfied. Only Hemingway is able to make the reader fall in love with an impotent veteran, such as Jake Barnes, or wish to meet such an alcoholic slut as Lady Brett Ashley. In any other story these characters would repulse the reader, however, Hemingway makes them come alive the way no one else could. This book is filled with copious quantities of debauchery and imbibing, and that is what draws people to it. Definetly a five-star read."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I really enjoy Hemingway's writing style, and especially Old Man and the Sea, but this book, like The Green Hills of Africa really has no direction. Most of the book is spent eating and drinking in this cafe and that during a seven day fiesta in Spain, but at the conclusion, I thought &quot;what was the point?&quot; Good desriptive, easy to read prose, but if there was a significant plot, it was lost on me."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Book started of slow, like alot of books, but I found it quite interesting and an insite to Hemingway's thoughst of the world. As some parts were slow, others were quite humorous and enticing. I definately look forward to being mesmerized by Hemingway in the future."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The best work of fiction by an American author of this or any century. I've read it five times."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I had never read Heminway before though I always wanted to. I read this book in a little less than two days. It really hooked me. An excellent novel, but the characters are infuriatingly childish and irresponsible.If you are sick (like myself) of writers who take five pages to describe an armchair (mainly because they're in love with their own writing) I'd give Hemingway a go. His writing style is quite direct and unadorned. It's lovely, to be frank."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Loved papa's prose stylings. The characters were glamorous, well-drawn. So many good scenes, intriguing characters, situations. Probably helps that I'm in my thirties. Don't know if I'd have appreciated it as much 10 years ago. The unique prose style and the impotence factor involving the narrator helped this literary effort rise to classic status. Don't you love my prose stylings?"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Magnificent. Hemmingway has always been my number one author, but I had not read this book until recently. The descriptions are uncanny. Everything from the Cafes to the Spanish sunsets are permanently embedded in my mind. I have never been to Spain or Paris, but after reading this book I feel like I lived right there with Jacob Barnes, Brett Ashley, and Robert Cohn for several years. God bless the expatriate, World War I authors and their books."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun also Rises, a book that you either are going to love or hate, there is simply no middle ground. Like all other classic examples of a Hemingway novel, you have the unreliable narrator who is simply trying to go about his life living in the now, but realizing better than anyone what is the future. Hemingway, as in many of his stories, is exploiting the lives of the \\"lost generation\\". The story has no definite beginning or ending, and is almost just an excerpt from Jake's life (main character and narrator). Hemingway expresses just how \\"lost\\" this generation is by their lack of any true genuine feelings. In true actuallity the only time they ever truly express real feelings is usually at the end of a bottle, and most likely not the first one ither. I thoroughly enjoyed this story because of the relationships that are discribed throughout it. It shows that a group of people who share interests and act civil towards eachother, may not be friends. And just how thin their friendship can be when one falls from social grace. By far though the greatest aspect of this story is the relationship shared between Jake and Lady Bret. One of the only stories where I enjoyed finding symbolism, this relationship goes on more ups and downs than Mr. Toads wild ride. Although both express their love for eachother, they also state how a relationship could never work out between them. Mainly due to the lack of \\"manhood\\" left in Jakes life. Overall this is no story of a happy bunch of friends, there will be no Ya-Ya sisterhood found here. This novel is about real relationships formed by men, their boundries, and what it means to be a \\"lost generation\\"."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is first of Hemingway's most famous novels (i.e. A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls, The Old Man and the Sea), published when he was twenty-seven years old and marked by his plain, direct diction and an overshadowing cynicism.At the simplest level, this is a story of twenty- and thirty-something Brits and Americans existing in post-WWI Europe; it's told through the eyes of Jake Barnes, a newspaperman left impotent by a war wound. Barnes and his comrades, including the \\"damned good looking\\" Lady Brett Ashley, make their way from Paris to Pamplona and partake of the week-long bullfighting fiesta. Hemingway reveals his own passion for bullfighting in his smooth description of the matadors' artistry and in the distinguishing of those whose work is mere illusion from those who work with true grace and courage.Throughout the story, moments of violence burst through the affected nonchalance of Jake's circle. Emotions run high as the men strive for Brett's affections, win them . . . lose them just as quickly. One of the most enticing anti-heroines in literature, Brett is an alcoholic and (possible) nymphomaniac, as much at the mercy of her whims as those around her. She is described as \\"Circe\\" because she turns the men around her to pigs; a group of Spanish dancers form a circle around her but prevent her from dancing--she must be still, worshipped as an idol. She is a remarkable character, adored and yet worthy of our pity: only an impotent man is safe with her; only a healthy man can satisfy her cravings.A fascinating achievement in twentieth century writing, TSAR has aged in places, where much of the characters' slang is unfamiliar. Nonetheless, it reads quickly and often easily, providing a good introduction to Hemingway's work and a disturbingly vivid picture of the lost generation."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I loved A Farewell to Arms and enjoyed The Old Man and the Sea, but The Sun Also Rises augments itself to the top of the pile of Hemingway's great works. This is the novel that established Hemingway as a genius and as the voice of the Lost Generation subsequent to \\"The War To End All Wars.\\"What makes this my favorite Hemingway and one of my all-time favs is Hemingway's amazing use of dialogue - unparalleled in American literature. The many drunken conversations between the morally devoid, yet likable characters Brett, Jake, and the gang are entertaining and extremely well-written.The Sun Also Rises brilliantly captures the intense disillusionment, aloofness, nihilism, and detachment of Hemingway's Lost Generation from American mainstream society resulting from the horrors and emptiness of WWI."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"People told me that I would not like Hemingway's style. To be honest it took quite a few chapters to get into the story because in the beginning Hemingway wrote about a group of expatriates flitting around Paris continuously getting drunk (can anyone REALLY drink as much as these people did in the novel?) This seemed to go on and on. A reader of this book really needs to understand the context of the times before reading this because you would simply think that these people are stupid. Understanding that this book was written after the horror of the Great War one can really begin to see what this &quot;Lost Generation&quot; was all about.The book really picked up for me when the group goes to Pamplona for the fiesta. I think that bullfighting is disgusting but the way Hemingway wrote about the bullfights was amazing. The detail puts you right there next to Jake and Brett.I do like the writing style of Hemingway. No fluff, just lay it out how it is. Take it or leave it."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun also Rises is a wonderful novel which established Ernest Hemingway as the voice of the Lost generation. Writing in powerful, sporadic prose, Hemingway has the unique ability to bring exotic places to life. Who doesn't yern to see Paris and Spain after reading this book? Hemingway eloquently gives us round characters and tells the story with remarkable mood, and tone. The book as an interesting after-glow to it as well."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I first read this book about a year ago for a high school english assignment. Usually, I find reading very tiresome, boring, and uninteresting. This book changed my outlook on reading. It is a fast read, and does not leave the reader bored after the first 50 pages. It also gave me an opportunity to learn about this interesting generation of young people. A must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is a perfect example of Hemingway's unique prose style. The author etches a visually intense picture of the Fiesta, and he does it with remarkably few adjectives. His characters are made real by what he has not written, and by dialogue left unsaid.The story is reminiscent of Sartre's 'Age of Reason'. Both books portray angst-ridden young people in Europe between the wars, their desires, attitudes and relationships. There are many other parallels. Hemingway's book is more penetrating, and less pessimistic. It's definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"While I found the reviewer's comparison of this work to an iceberg (in that so much of the novel lies beneath the surface), to be generally accurate I might suggest that The Sun Also Rises is not exactly heavy literary lifting. Hemingway's prose is sparse, and his characters suffer their hidden scars- this is the stuff that made Papa famous, after all- but this is a work that is readily accessible, and while 90% of the book may be beneath the surface, the vast majority of his intent is apparent. This is not a criticism of Hemingway, as the man is one of my favorite authors, but I believe that makes this book great is that nearly anyone over the age of 15 can have a rich and rewarding reading experience with this novel. The sorrows that Hemingway's characters hide from view are common to all, and the story of unattainable, and unfulfilled, love is one of the century's best. As for the reviewer who trashed this book simply because it was &quot;early&quot; Hemingway, I don't know where to begin in stating how off that comment was. Hemingway was a literary prodigy, who reeled off a string of outstanding novels in his youth. They are all marked by tight plots, his terse prose, and a real connection with the spirit that defined the Lost Generation. In the years between his youthful height and the Old Man and the Sea, only For Whom the Bell Tolls could be described as great. The works of the &quot;mature&quot; Hemingway are short on ideas, and are long and wandering; it is as if the man simply ran out of talent. The Sun also Rises, on the other hand, is a brilliant work that works on so many levels, and, unlike some of his more epic works, can be readily enjoyed by all."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I didn't know what to expect from this book, having never read an Hemingway novel before but I was pleasantly surprised. It's the dialogue that brought me in and kept me wanting to read. Its pretty short, my copy was only 247 pages, and I finished it in no time. I definitely want to read more Hemingway after this and to all of you out there, read this book. The descriptions of the places in the book, France and Spain, are spectactular. The characters are intriguing, especially the narrator Jake Barnes and the lead female Lady Brett Ashley."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"All I want to say is that anyone who thinks this book is boring and immoral is totally overlooking both the symbolism of the story and the context in which the book was written. It is a commentary about the Lost Generation of the twenties. This was a time, especially for Americans, when all people wanted to do was have fun. Of course, it ended up taking a toll on them, which is why it is the &quot;lost generation&quot;. Did you like Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby? It is the same kind of thing. You have to put into perspective the kind of world these people were living in. The romanticism of life is what makes the story symbolic--Jake's impotence in conjunction with his love for Brett, the wild social scene (i.e., the perpetual drunkenness of most characters), and the great melodrama of the expatriatism and the bull fights. These aspects of the book are what intrigue the reader, contrasted with the extreme simplicity of the writing. So what if all the characters were drinking all the time? It's historically accurate, as far as the social scene of the pre-Depression west. Now, I'm not saying I particularly enjoyed the brashness of characters such as Mike, or the pity I felt for Cohn, or the irresponsibility of Brett. But, just because the characters weren't likable doesn't mean that the story doesn't say a hell of a lot about society as Hemingway perceived it, or at least how he chose to portray it. For those who didn't enjoy it, I recommend you read it again, and look for the symbolism Hemingway tries to get across."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Always being an avid reader, I had read and liked Hemingway's novels many years ago when I was still in school. After more years than I care to admit, I decided to read him again since I couldn't even remember most of his books.To tell the truth, the book seemed entirely different when read by older eyes. I really couldn't relate to the expatriates in them now. And even though I'm not a teetotaler, I was a little turned off by the characters constant drinking. It was an era I'm glad I didn't live in. Times change I guess.I'll be rereading more of his novels and hope I'll relate to them a little more than I did his first."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"In The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway describes aimless, jaded and wounded characters and their efforts to numb these feelings of emptiness by leading idle lives of excess. Hemingway's great talent is that he shows these complicated emotions with his classic clean and simple writing style.There are endless back and forth exchanges between the narrator Jake Barnes, Robert Cohn, Lady Brett Ashley, Mike Campbell and the people they meet in Paris and in Pamplona. Hemingway tells his story through these seemingly insignificant conversations and Jake's narration where we discover important things about each character. We learn how Jake is still struggling to accept his war injury and understand his relationship with Brett. We see how Robert Cohn becomes more and more shunned as he pursues Brett. And with every one of Brett's reckless relationships with the men who surround her, particularly Mike and the bullfighter Pedro Romero, we discover her own feelings of a lost life.I particularly liked how Hemingway took his description of Cohn on the very first page of the book and directly tied it to Cohn's exploding temper in Pamplona. I saw hope in Jake's bitter-sweet relationship with Brett despite the overwhelmingly hopeless theme of the story."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This is a great place to begin reading Hemingway's works. What an extraordinary author! I started reading Hemingway with 'For Whom the Bell Toles', which is also an exceptional piece of work."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Hemmingway's writings are vivid and picturesque. He makes Jake Barnes, the lead character, seem like he's right next to you. Indeed, more like your partacking in the adventure. I'm not much for bull fights but that did not deter from the enjoyment of reading about the running of the bulls in Pamplona or the bull fights themselves. He makes the restaurants and bars seem like a life in themselves. Hemmingway is a great writer. I'm on my way to reading his next book. Tommy"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"What a great book. Seriously. The prose is top-notch; the characters are full, interesting, even real. There's a plot that's good and that works. I can't not recommend this book.That said, there's a lot wrong at the center of the book, and that's ignoring all the blatant bigotism and antisemitism and sexism and so on. Simply put, there's an emptiness in the book, like Hemingway would rather have his narrator observe as a perfect outsider to any problem than show any flaws in himself. It then reads almost like the perfect man complaining about how much everybody else just sucks, and no matter how good the rest of the book is, in the center it's cold.(Also, other complaints about the general message of the book, but I think I've complained enough for a four-star review)"},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Enjoyable especially with Dark Chocolate - perfect with a cup of hot camomile - Ideal for a relaxing Friday night. It was Hemingway's first book. The characters are easy to like. Looking forward to discovering his other books and see his evolution."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises - Hemingway gave a glimpse into a lifestyle today's youth would doubtless disdain as silly and prosaic. What he actually provided generations to come was a lesson in how it was to be decadent, talented and hard-working. He proved, also, that the nature of the beast hasn't changed a bit. Worth a third time around for me. I am re-reading Fitzgerald and Pound again as well. Yes, I'm no spring chicken! Read this time around on my Kindle from Amazon."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I was almost unable to sleep before I got this book in the mail after reading the fictionalized account of Hemingway and his first wife in Paris during the time he wrote this acclaimed novel.This time when I read this entertaining book by one of my favorite authors, I looked for other things. What I took away was how very strong simple words, chosen carefully, can more strongly make the point.Because books have always been such a big part of my life, maybe I do believe everything I read but it is hard to read A Paris Wife and then read The Sun Also Rises and not hear Hemingway's voice and soul in both and believe that is the way it really happened. And you cannot help but have a lot of sympathy for Hedley and any woman with whom he was involved. Amazing that such a complicated person can write in such a clear way, never using adjectives to say what the noun portrays."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Jake Barnes,an ex pat journalist in Paris,is deeply in love with Brett,an English woman who nursed him through injury in the Great War.But it is a love that cannot be fulfilled. Her beauty infatuates Cohn, a Jewish writer and friend of Jakes,and he reads more into a brief flirtation than Brett herself.Taking a holiday to Spain to watch the week long fiesta and bullrunning with friends, Brett falls in love with Romero the bull fighter and tensions rise....An absolutely brilliant book. Initially it seems a bit scatter gun-characters come and go and enjoy the party life of ex pats in Paris and everything is described in Hemingway's simultaneously laconic and detailed prose, so that you wonder where your being taken,but the whole story simply builds and builds into an ever more vivid and powerful picture (you really do feel you are there!)and you have one of those rare books that gives you a real high.The theme of love and wartime is obviously one that haunted Hemingway-he was wounded and nursed in WW1. Its an irony to me now as I loathed 'Farewell to Arms' when I attempted to read it aged 12. I was encouraged to return to Hemingway years later and his whole style and power just hit home big time. 'To Whom the Bell Tolls' and 'Fiesta' both told of wartime love and I rate them as high as I possible can-easy with the other greats I've read- so I'm really looking forward to returning to 'Farewell' to catch all I missed first time. My message is, if you're at a stage where Hemingway sucks for you, please give him another go later. The absolute high his works give are more than worth it.A fantastic book."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"I have come across wide and varied responses to this novel. Some positive, some indecisive & some negative. Those who criticize this particular work, say things like: \\"But it's not about anything.\\" Or \\"Nothing actually happens in the story.\\" This is not cheap escapism for mindless hacks, this literature at its finest. This novel reveals Hemingway's sublime gift as writer. If you cannot recognize the beauty and skill in this work, then I suggest you do not attempt to read his other books either, you won't like them."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The seller stated the book was like new but there were footnotes written on the some of the pages and the pages were bunny eared (I hate that it ruins a good book) ... Other then that it was as described great price and quick shipping."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Although Hemingway does not follow a specific path or point, it is somewhat evident that he is trying to challenge classic characters' perfect lives, and to describe life as it is realistically; jumbled and disorderly.The Sun Also Rises is a representation of the post-World War I world of high-class scholars and women drinking and loving their way through Europe. Hemingway's description of Spain (unlike Paris), is praise-worthy. His contrasts between country and city, calm and fiesta, are concise and beautiful and certainly picturesque. His fiesta was somewhat dragged out, as is most of his book, but the depictions are fascinating to one's imagination and certainly leaves room for interpretation. The crowds of dancers and bulls and the massive amphitheater all leave the reader with a new impression of Pamplona's novelty.Frustrating as Hemingway can become, he does bring the most important point of the story to an unfinished halt, rather than giving a concise happy ending or great loss of love. This contradicts most books and gives him a mysterious edge, creating an intriguing continuous plot that lets the reader create their own preferred ending. Without such endings, books become disillusions of life as we know it. Ernest Hemingway is gifted and unique, but it is easy to get lost in the way his mind thinks."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises tells the story of fictional character Jake Barnes and his friends. The stories in this book tell of their experiences living in Europe, drinking together at different bars, and travelling, specifically to Spain. This book fits very well with Hemingway's Lost Generation due to the fact that I felt completely lost reading it. I had trouble discerning what the point of the book was until its conclusion. At one point I believed this book would be similar to Jack Kerouac's On the Road, and at other times I simply thought it was a look into the incredibly interesting world of Spanish bull fighting. The lack of a driving plot made this book difficult for me to get through, and I never found myself completely consumed with Hemingway's fictional world. On a better note though, Hemingway's style of writing is exceptional. His diction reveals a subtle sense of humor through random puns and joke's within the dialogue of his characters. The dialogue Hemingway creates between his characters is very real, and effectively draws the reader into the story.If The Sun Also Rises were to be placed into a literary genre, it would most likely be a story of forbidden love. This label however does not fully capture the theme of the novel. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is clearly in love with his friend Lady Brett Ashley, but unable to act on his feelings due to insecurities he has. Many of the other main characters in this book are males, and almost all are equally obsessed with Brett, but all also lack the confidence required to win her over. While forbidden love is a strong theme, the idea of human insecurity plays a strong role in this story. I also found the way Hemingway writes about Spain in this story to be quite interesting. His elaborate descriptions of bull fights and his instructions on how to properly drink from a wine skin give the reader an idea of Spanish life. I would recommend this book to someone interested specifically in the Lost Generation, but to no one else. It simply did not suck me in the way other books have."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"This was a Xmas present for a family member, who loves American literature. It's a beautiful book and will make a nice gift."},{"Title":"Fiesta [The Sun Also Rises].","review":"The Sun Also Rises is Hemingway's second novel but his first masterpiece. It centers around the relationship between Jake Barnes and Britt Ashley who fell in love during WWI when Jake was a wounded soldier and Britt a nurse who was assigned to him. Brii wants both good sex and deep emotional companionship. Jake wounded in his genitals is sexually impotent but is the only man who can give Britt what she wants emotionally so Britt is constantly infatuated with men has sex with them and then drops them once the sex no longer satisfies. There is a lot of empty behavior in the novel. The title comes form a passage from The Bible specifically Ecclesisates and one must realize the novel is not so much about a group of American and British expatriates as a commentary on the vanity of life.
