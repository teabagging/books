Why was the UN not allowed to enter the town immediately after the attack, if the IDF had nohing to hide? This book is a shocking, moving portrayal of a people (individuals! With NAMES!) who have negative rights, being trampled by a rogue nation in violation of numerous UN resolutions, much of it the result of Israeli apartheid policies which forbids the Jews becoming a minority in their own state. (Much like South Africa in the 80's.) It really is awful to say, but the Israelis learned well the lessons of WWII, and how to manipulate public opinion, especially here in the States, to be perceived as the victim. The last time I checked, the side fighting with the rocks was considered the victim/underdog, not the side with US supplied tanks, helicopters and bulldozers. Read the account of Red Crescent ambulance drivers shot at trying to pick up the wounded, young children, shot at for throwing stones at Israeli troops, the mothers and wives of men 16-40 taken away by the IDF becaue they were suspected of being terrorists. There was one depiction of IDF soldiers wrecking a mosque and a kindergarten, tearing up schoolbooks and urinating on the floors.

Of those 38 were armed militants!!! And over 30 Israelis died, caught up in booby trapped homes as they tried to protect civilians, or in one case refusing to shoot a child suicide bomber who was detonated killing many soldiers. If you want eye witness accounts speak to some of those who were there and watched their friends die because they adhered to the high moral standard of the Isreal Defence Forces. Or talk to the head of the hospital in Jenin who, when asked why he lied about Israelis shooting at the hospital, when in fact they protected it and helped save many lives, said \\"What do you expect me to say if I want to stay alive\\"!To suggest that there is still a controversy over the number of Palestinian dead is highly misleading as even those observers who are among Israel's severest critics have agreed with that final figure.And as far as the small area of the Jenin that the book focuses on, the reason why that refugee camp was flattened was that, under the noses of UNWRA, it was a hotbed of terrorism, with bomb-making factories, stores of ammunition and explosives, and booby trapped homes.Interestingly, a team of British engineers was forced out of Jenin last month when they were there building new quality homes to replace the refugee accommodation - the reason - the Palestinians did not want the residents to be allowed to give up their refugee status! Typical callousness and cynicism that has forced them to be refugees since 1948.Why nothing about the vast majority of Jenin that remained intact. Clearly that did not suit the authors' agenda.Joy WolfeManchester UK"},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"(...)Palestinian producer: False film funded by PADocumentary claims Israeli army committed war crimesJanuary 17, 2005A Palestinian filmmaker who produced a documentary alleging Israeli troops committed war crimes in a refugee camp admitted in a deposition last week to falsifying scenes, using inaccurate information and obtaining financing for the project from the Palestinian Authority, WorldNetDaily has learned.Muhammad Bakri, producer of \\"Jenin, Jenin,\\" a documentary that claims Israel committed genocide in the Jenin refugee camp in April 2002, admitted in a deposition to inaccuracies throughout his film. The filmmaker is being sued by five Israeli soldiers visible in still footage in the film, which alleges IDF troops killed a \\"large number\\" of civilians, mutilated Palestinian bodies, randomly executed and bombed women, children and the mentally and physically impaired, and leveled the entire refugee camp, including a wing of the local hospital.The documentary doesn't show footage of the alleged atrocities, but in some scenes, faces of the soldiers now suing Bakri were superimposed over \\"eyewitness testimony,\\" and it was indicated they had committed \\"war crimes.\\"But Bakri, in a deposition obtained by WND, admitted he \\"believed\\" selected witnesses but didn't check the information they provided.\\"I believed the things that I've been told. What I did not believe was not included in the film,\\" said Bakri.When asked about a scene in which it is implied Israeli troops ran over civilians, Bakri admitted to constructing the footage himself as an \\"artistic choice.\\" He also answered \\"no\\" when asked if he believed \\"that during the operation in Jenin, the Israeli soldiers killed people indiscriminately.\\"In perhaps the most explosive element of the deposition, Bakri admitted his documentary, which was screened in theaters around the world, was financed in part by the Palestinian Authority.

The truth is that 54 Arabs (mostly armed with machine guns and grenades) were killed along with 14 Israeli soldiers.The editor cannot back up his claims of a massacre with victims names or any other relevant information. This is something commonly seen in Palestinian society, the crying wolf syndrome, that caused the UN to scrap its investigation into the alleged massacre.The area of land that was destroyed was approximately 100 by 100 square meters and an aerial photo of it is still posted on the Israeli Foreign Affairs website. This area was less than 3% of the city which is The area that was destroyed was done so to root out terrorists, the majority of suicide bombers that murdered innocent Israeli women, men and children came from Jenin.Prior to the IDF operation Defensive Wall Jenin's leading terrorist organizations were mainly centered in it's refugee camp. The leading groups were:1. HamasHamas' Jenin network organized a number of lethal suicide attacks, most recently in Haifa on March 31, in which 15 Israelis were killed. The Jenin network operated jointly with diverse operational elements in the Hamas movement and its overseas leadership. This network was severely damaged by the IDF in Tubas on April 5. Six major Hamas terror leaders were killed, including Qis Adwan (head of the Jenin infrastructure and organizer of suicide attacks killing dozens of Israelis), and Sa'ed Awad (chief of the QASSAM-2 missile project. Awad's death was effective in slowing missile production in Samaria).Other senior activists - Nasser Jerar (involved in planning major attacks in Israel) and Jamal Abu Al Hija (Hamas' Jenin head, responsible for directing and financing terror activities) - are still at large.2. Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)Until the IDF operation, the PIJ infrastructure in Jenin was the strongest in the PA's territories, due mostly to massive financial injections from the PIJ leadership in Syria. Details of these financial transactions have been verified by captured documents. The PIJ suffered a severe setback with the death of its Jenin military leader, Mahmud Tu'albe (responsible for a string of terrorist attacks inside Israel), and the arrest of senior operational figures, including Ali Safuri and Thabet Mardawi (both responsible for a large number of suicide and murder attacks).3. Fatah / Al Aqsa Brigades / TanzimFatah's Jenin network served as a central focus for terror activities. According to captured documents, local Fatah members, in close contact with Marwan Barghouti, carried out scores of shooting and explosives attacks against the IDF and Israeli civilians. Among these assaults was the March 30 suicide attack in a Tel Aviv coffee shop, where an Israeli civilian was killed and 45 wounded. Prominent senior Fatah activists include Jamal Hawil (arrested by the IDF for directing lethal terrorist attacks) and Ita Abu Ramila (Fatah and Preventive Security Apparatus leader in Jenin)."},{"Title":"Searching Jenin: Eyewitness Accounts of the Israeli Invasion","review":"Contrary to what the book would have us believe preventing civilian casualties was of the utmost importance to the Israeli Defense Forces. For example, Israeli soldiers carefully guarded a Palestinian hospital's water and oxygen supply and blew up nothing that might endanger the hospital despite the fact that it served as a refuge for several wanted fugitives. The man who claimed that the IDF somehow endangered the hospital was in fact being treated in a hospital while the Jenin operation was occurring. The hospital was in Afulla and it is an Israeli hospital.One of them men interviwed for this book, Abu Riali, was also interviewed by al Jazeera television.

In the course of her research on this book she found that the housewives she had become so curious to learn more about had &quot;left no records at all.&quot; Contemporary Victorian literature, Draznin posits, could not be relied upon to provide the hard data she sought. She combined information culled from contemporary magazines, &quot;domestic manuals,&quot; and the history of commerce with her knowledge of Victoriana and her &quot;deep familiarity with housewifery&quot; to create her models.Draznin's readable, jargon-free, and to-the-point chapters are each able to stand alone. &quot;Greater London in 1875: A Resident's View,&quot; provides a portrait of London that is deep and thorough. You can smell it and hear it: prodigious amounts of manure on the streets, &quot;the deafening noise of traffic,&quot; and the astonishingly poor air quality that motivated urban dwellers to support the establishment of suburban towns. Many moved out of the city.Family health, contraception, the bearing, rearing and education of children, the managing of servants (protocols were carefully spelled out and, it was assumed, observed), choosing where to live, decorating the home, buying, using, and maintaining the considerable gadgetry (especially the sewing machine) of modern life &#65533; all were the housewife's concern. In addition there were spiritual and moral issues that she was expected to manage. Volunteering one's time for helping or nurturing activities was higly socially acceptable, and widely practiced. In addition there are budgets and ledger entries, menus for meals plus teas, and black-and-white illustrations.&quot;The Matron as Her Own Person: Satisfying Personal Needs within and Outside the Home,&quot; details the considerable industry that grew to serve the needs of the housewife in possession of more free time than ever. Magazines, lending libraries located in bookstores, (for there were few public libraries, and of them, few were &quot;free&quot; ), visiting, sewing, card-playing, and socializing filled what free time she had. Draznin's high praise, though, is reserved for an activity that was &quot;restful and pleasant,&quot; one that middle-class housewives &quot;engaged in with lady friends in quiet and elegant surroundings that offered many amenities.&quot; Draznin asks rhetorically, &quot;What did she do?&quot; and then answers, &quot;She went shopping.&quot; This reliance on stores combined with the troublesome (to the consumer) quirks of British shopping -- no prices marked on goods, no advertising, snobbishness, and little price competition -- eventually engendered considerable changes in consuming throughout Britain.This is a delightful, accessible, and well-researched book that will interest students of Victoriana, urban history, and women's history. Young readers will be pleased, too. There is a lengthy bibliography and a good index. Completely worthwhile."},{"Title":"Victorian London's Middle-Class Housewife: What She Did All Day (Contributions in Women's Studies)","review":"I've always been interested in the history of the home, and especially that of ordinary people. One period that has the most documentation available is that of the Victorian era -- the nineteenth century in Europe and America -- when a rising affluence and increased technology combined to create a booming middle class. And the person who decided just how that new middle class home looked and was used was not necessarily the man of the family, but rather his wife.Yaffa Claire Draznin explores this rather unusual world in her book, London's Middle-Class Housewife: What She Did All Day, and provides a good leaping off point for starting to research this topic. Divided up into three parts, the book looks into the background of the Middle Class Housewife, life in London and its suburbs and how the MCMW (Draznin's abbrieviation for the Housewife) interacted with it, and finally, the end of the Victorian period, and how the MCMW was an instrument in that change.Part I: The MCMW's Background, 1850-1875The MCMW (Middle Class Married Woman) -- just who was she? She was probably the child of a shopkeeper, or bureaucrat, poorly educated by modern standards, and expected to defer to her parents and her husband when decisions were made. She was most likely to be homeschooled, and learned what she could of housekeeping from her mother, but by the time she was married, was expected to know enough mathematics to keep household accounts, be able to read and write, and know enough about cooking and sewing to provide meals and be able to do some basic sewing and mending. While heavier work would be shifted onto the shoulders (and back) of the one servant she was likely to have, the maid-of-all-work, she was expected to know enough to supervise and make sure that all was kept in order. Draznin also touches on what sort of man her husband would be, how many children they might have together, and about what the income would be, and finally, what the MCMW would look like and her clothing.Part II: The Reality: Life in Greater London, 1875-1900From what I could gather from this book, what seperated the MCMW from the working classes was that she had a servant to help, but that did not mean that she was completely free of drudgery either -- especially laundry. This was a complicated, labour intensive chore that tired me out just from reading about it. There was also cleaning, from sweeping and scrubbing that had to be done, to purchasing food, making meals, seeing that her children were fed, clothed, washed and schooled. One of the more interesting aspects of life in London was the mail service -- mail would be delivered up to twelve times a day, and was regarded as very effiecient. There were servants to manage -- from the maid, to perhaps a cook and nurserymaid, and all of these people had to be hired, and sometimes fired, or replaced when they quit. Money had to be looked after. But there were matters outside of the home as well -- her children's schooling, family holidays, social and religious obligations and finally, discussing personal needs. One of the big surprises that I found in this was the rise of the Shopper -- where shopping moved to being not just taking care of basic needs, but where the MCMW moved into the world of the consumer, and where shopping could be entertainment and a social activity with her friends.Part III: The End of the Century: ConclusionIntermingled with all of this was the relentless change that was moving the Victorian world towards the modern one that we know today. Increased need for skilled labour in the workplace was putting a squeeze on that eternal problem for the MCMW -- factory and office work was very tempting to the maid-of-all-work, and certainly less burdensome and more profitable. While the number of available servants were dwindling, more labour saving devices were appearing, saving some time. Too, as families aged, the MCMW and her spouse were having to make changes and adapt to one another, as they had hopefully, advanced in income and status.Each chapter has extensive footnotes attached, and provide an excellent source for further research in each topic. There is also a very useful appendix that goes into understanding the British system of money at the time, explaining what the pound, shilling and pence were. Finishing up are a bibliography and Index.I found this to be a fascinating read, and I was learning quite a bit about a time and place that keeps getting skipped over. The writing is crisp, and while each chapter is rather sparse in the details, it's still a good read.My biggest disappointment in the book was the real lack of illustrations, I was hoping that there would be more to show the reader all of the various objects and perhaps even a floorplan of the typical home. Instead what I got was several photographs of buildings, and some drawings that were done by a modern artist. Pretty, but several of them are extremely clumsy, with skewed perspectives, and ultimately, not very useful.Draznin's writing style is very readable, and a touch tongue-in-cheek in spots. While this is a small book, under 200 pages, it is a good starter for anyone interested in this topic, and especially in women's studies. What this book gave me in particular was the backbreaking amount of labour that went into keeping a home, and managing her family's care and wellbeing that the MCMW went through -- all the while trying to fit in with what was expected of her in the world around her. The fact that all of this was happening just over a century ago is what makes this so intriguing -- and we're still having to cope with the same unrealistic demands and expectations today.For anyone who watched the PBS series _Manor House_ and _1900 House,_ this is a real eye-opener of a book. For further reading I would suggest Judith Flanders' Inside the Victorian Home and Kathryn Hughes' _The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs. Beeton_ -- which was also turned into a television programme, _The Secret Life of Mrs. Beeton._Four stars over all, and actually closer to five, but the lack of illustrations and some depth is what knocked this book down for me a bit.

As Mr. Moral illustrates, though it was dismissed by critics who didn't understand Hitchcock's expressionistic techniques and shunned by audiences who were disturbed by the film's themes, MARNIE is revealed to be one of the director' most personal works and one of his finest achievements. The author documents the film's history, from publication of the source novel through filming, release and current re-evaluation. The book reveals that Hitchcock's characteristic immersion into virtually every facet of the film's production reflected his intentions and aspirations concering this very personal - and partly autobiographical - project. Concerning the salacious rumors reported in the 1983 biography by Donald Spoto, Mr. Moral objectively presents the facts and allows readers to draw their own conclusions, the inescapable one being that Hitchcock may have been a frustrated Svengali but not a lecherous ogre. The author's interviews with numerous personnel associated with the film, on both sides of the camera, are all informative and create a balanced portrait of the director and his film. This book should supplant Spoto's book as the definitive reference work on the subject, particularly in conjuction with the recent biography of the director by Patrick McGilligan, an author who, like Mr. Moral, doesn't have a personal agenda. However, the book is primarily a documentation of all of the elements that Hitchcock utilized to create a film that has received so much belated but deserved attention in recent years and that continues to fascinate an increasing number of viewers four decades after its release. The commercial disappointment of MARNIE had a profound effect upon Hitchcock and his subsequent career but, as Mr. Moral illustrates, it has survived and emerged as one of the director's greatest works. This book is required reading for Hitchcock fans, film scholars and movie lovers."},{"Title":"Hitchcock and the Making of Marnie (Scarecrow Filmmakers)","review":"I bought this book expecting--based on \\"the making of\\" in the title--a book along the lines of two books I'd enjoyed reading, Stephen Rebello's \\"Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho\\" and Dan Auiler's \\"Vertigo: The Making of a Hitchcock Classic.\\" Tony Lee Moral takes a more academic approach. For me the book's strengths are its account of the screenplay's genesis and its refutation of Daniel Spoto's contention that Hitchcock adopted the movie's controversial technical \\"shortcuts\\" (the rear-projection scenes and the harbor matte painting) because he lost interest late in the production process. But the book's analytical passages seemed repetitious and, for me at least, less interesting. In addition, the book is marred by numerous typos and misspellings; Hitchcock's silent film \\"The Farmer's Wife\\" is listed as \\"The Fireman's Wife\\" (!).

And of more concern is a very frequent tendency to have seemingly unrelated topics or thoughts put together into a single paragraph, and to have sudden shifts in topic between paragraphs.

Tony Lee Moral provides us with an inside glimpse into the making of Marnie and shows that, at least as filmed, there were more scenes for Martin Gabel and especially for Diane Baker, who gives a gracious enough interview here but must still be fuming at the way her part was so truncated.We get the impression that Alma Reville, though not technically credited as an editor on the film, was always Hitch's backstage editor and that she was responsible for many of the odd gaps in the film. (The credited editor, George Tomasini, died of a heart attack the year MARNIE was finally released, worn out by the stress.) The Hitchcocks had wanted Grace Kelly--sort of--they don't seem overly upset when she quit the project--and thus Hitchcock went back to Tippi Hedren, whom he had discovered on a TV commercial and who had made her debut on THE BIRDS. The world knows the Tippi Hedren story and hos Hitch put her into the deep freeze early in the shooting of MARNIE, terribly sad, but he had made himself into a god and sometimes gods stumble and humans suffer. It was a little unnnerving hearing Louise Latham who played Marnie's mother, describe the way Hitch told her that he had Jessica Tandy in reserve if she, Latham, didn't shape up! As for Sean Connery, yes, perhaps MARNIE is better because Rod Taylor isn't in it, but it's a close call, too close for me to make.Does the book make sense? It is close as we will ever get to discovering the truth about what happened to Grace, and what happened between Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren. What a shame that, one of ths screen's strongest and most powerful and lovely actresses was, for whatever reason, kept off the screen due to her owner's whims for many years, and when she came back, it was for the sort of parts that were beneath her. Apparently the higher ups didn't want to offend Hitch by employing her, so she was on an unofficial graylist, broken only by Chaplin who could have cared less what young Hitchcock thought, in A COUNTESS FROM HONG KONG, itself a film of many mysteries and a controversial reputation. Mr. Moral has done his homework and has convinced me, at any rate, that that flattery of Truffaut, Godard etc had turned Hitchcock's head into believing that he was making some sort of nouvelle vague love slash art film in which the artificial was to attain a primacy hitherto reserved for suspense in his oeuvre.

It also asks review questions at the end of chapters that isn't explained until further in the book, if at all. Misprints are numerous and in some cases the material is just plain wrong, such as paragraph 1 on page 137 which claims that figure 23-1 can be locked off for safety reasons. Even if locked the start button would cause the motor to run if held in the on position. Hardly a 'safe' circuit.

Maps, figures, and illustrations are quite good, though it might have included a few more comprehensive maps of the city as a whole. As the only single comprehensive survey available, the book provides material sorely lacking for classroom instruction, whether on the subject of Tokyo, Japanese cities, or world cities (the name of its series).

There are some tales that are completely stupendous, and cannot be believed at all and then there are some great, anecdotes, a favorite of mine is one were Marco challenges the ability of Kublai Khan's empire to function using a paper monetary system, at which Polo is completely incredulous, a monetary system, everyone in the world uses today. There are some excellent recounts of native islands, unspoiled back lands and an excellent feeling for the travels of a trader that took that original silk route over 600 years ago.

Reading this book helped to teach me how life along the silk road was by connecting with because I could relate to the actual feelings of the author. This book was written by Marco Polo himself, which allowed him to contribute the real thoughts of the traveler, instead of having a hitory book format where the content in emotionless and simply rambles details. With text books, the information goes in one ear and right out the other for me, however by reading this book I was actually able to comprehend the information provided.The Travels of Marco Polo contained bits of info on things such as Africa and India and their culture, China in all its wealth, along with the Mongol empire. When reading this book, you may want to watch exactly what you believe because although it may be true, there are many facts Polo provides that may very well be untrue.

This person came up to you, started to talk about this incredible journey of theirs, but talking in this monotonous voice without changing pitch or showing excitement at any moment.That's essentially what \\"Travels of Marco Polo\\" is. It's an INCREDIBLY interesting book and a fascinating tale, but can it possible be said in a more dry and flat way? There is no energetic spark that makes this adventure jump off the page. Perhaps this is due to the times, but I suspect the translation is a bit literal and bland as well. The writing never changes tone, even in parts that are clearly exciting and amazing. All the facts are there, but the reader is forced to put too much energy just to make it interesting.Marco Polo had a most fascinating journey. Any history buff should snatch this book off the shelves (unless they decide to read the even longer, more annoying records that I'm sure can be found floating around), and anyone interesting in Marco Polo should as well.

He and his uncles were just savvy businessmen away from home on a 24-year business trip. In these memoirs, you get none of the self-conscious, self-justifying, self-aggrandizing introspection so common in the journals of the great 18th and 19th century wanderers. Even Polo's greatest feat--three years spent running a province for Kublai Khan--gets a mere one-line mention. As history and anthropology, this is a superb original source; as exploration, it reveals almost nothing about the minds of the explorers themselves.This edition requires a certain patience. It isn't cleaned up for modern readers. I actually went through it twice--once for the text itself, and then again for the copious footnotes added later. The good news is that Polo's story itself is a surprisingly easy read in this translation. Facts were never the strongest point in the original narrative, and much of the book amounts to a sales pitch for Polo's employer, the Grand Khan. But unusually, for books as old as this, the experience of reading it was far more pleasure than pain."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"I enjoy collecting the classics and antique books.

I'd like to know more about them,- It is worthwhile to read this. In addition, I found a great many references from modern life back to Marco Polo.

Whether it actually happened or not is up for debate. I went into this text with an open mindset and have accepted that Marco Polo did indeed go on this trip with his father and uncle, but not to the extent as surmised. Instead he travelled and added stories he collected from traders and others to fill in gaps or points of interest to him. The book is broken into four sections now. Part One is his trip to the Great Khan's courts in Cathay (China). Part Two is his travels throughout the provinces of Cathay. Part Three concerns going to Japan, Southern India, and the Islands of the Indian Sea (Java, etc). Part Four is travelling into the 'northern countries' (Russia, etc).In general, Polo gives very brief descriptions of most regions, accounting for their religious beliefs, money used, fealty to the Great Khan Kublai. There's some intriguing customs (visitors will be taken into a home and the man of the house leaves until they are gone but the visitor has full access to the household including the wives, daughters, sisters, nieces), talks of cannibalism, dress, unfamiliar animals they encountered, and contributes to the whole messy history of Prestor John. It does get repetitive and dry after a while. Polo's talk of Kublai Khan is almost obsessive and he was obviously completely enamoured of this new culture. Overall, it was fascinating to read although I had to push myself through some parts due to repetitive descriptions. Any history buff should read this story about one of the purported most well-travelled explorers ever, not to mention he was possibly the biggest best-selling authors before the printing press was invented."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"As a geography and history buff, I was fascinated by Marco Polo's journal of his travels. I followed his routes on my atlas and discovered that he did not always follow a west to east route, but rather zigzagged north to south to east as his interests changed. In India he narrates his fascination with the role of monkeys in society, the strange vestments and customs of the people there, so alien to anything he had ever seen or experienced. Then he spends years and years in the Orient, befriending the Chinese emperor, learns to speak Chinese to the point where he practically forgets his native Italian, even becomes governor of a Chinese state. From adolescence intoto adulthood, Marco travels with his father and uncle during 30 years, discovering the marvels of a world unknown to the west, by ship, elephant or camel, or on foot over some of the world's highest mountains, against all odds but driven forth by endless curiousity and optimism."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"I was very pleased with my purchase.

Nevertheless, simply as an historical Atlas of China, and with an incredible historical context, warts and all, it is a very illuminating book, showing Chinese cities using their ancient Mongol names (in what other context would someone serving the Mongol emperor record the city names?) and allowing the reader the opportunity to research and discover for themselves, just how fascinating and mysterious other ethnicities and other cultures were to a European of the middle ages.One of the most fascinating aspects of \\"The Travels\\" is not just some of the factual innaccuracies, but the apparent perceptions of Marco Polo, fully willing to believe he had found the final resting place of the first man, Adam, and the wizardry of other peoples, the ability to do magic, and a legend of giant \\"Rocs\\" near Madagascar, and how the Khan sent a small expedition to investigate the rumors of such.If you want a book that makes you ask searching questions about humanity, cultural bias, and the importance of lore and myth in cultures, this book is invaluable."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"You may have heard in school about Marco Polo and his journey to China and India.

So the brothers from Venice brought many dazzling jewels and set out from Constantinople by ship to Sudak and onward to Barku. A war broke out in Barka's Land forced the brothers to travel the opposite direction from which they had come. After they had crossed the desert, they came to Bukhara (in Persia) and by fortuity met a Tartar (Mongol) envoy on the way back to the Great Khan in Khan-balik (Beijing). On learning that they were merchants from Venice whom had never been seen in the country, the envoy invited the brothers to accompany him to Khan-balik to see the Great Khan.The Great Khan received the brothers honorably and welcomed them with such lavish hospitality after a year's journey. The curious Khan asked the brothers about their Emperors, about the government of their dominions, about the maintenance of justice, about the Pope and practices of the Roman Church, and about the Latin customs. He decided to send emissaries to the Pope, and asked the brothers to accompany on the mission with one of his barons. He entrusted them a letter written in the Turkish language for the Pope and asked him to send a hundred prominent men learned in the Christian religion to condemn idolaters' performances and shun devil. These well versed were to demonstrate for the idolaters their capability of doing diabolic arts but would not, because only evil spirits performed such enchantments.As the brothers approached Egypt, they got wind of the Pope's death and so they would go to Venice and visit their families pending the election of a new Pope. During the homeward voyage, Niccolo learned that his wife had passed away and left behind a 15-years-old son Marco Polo, who authored this book. After staying in Venice for about 2 years, they left for Jerusalem to get the oil from the lamp at Christ's sepulcher which the Great Khan had requested for his deceased mother, who was a Christian. The Travels chronicles the three years' journey back to Khan-balik from Venice, via the ancient trade corridor now known as the Silk Road, and details all the peculiar sights and peoples along the present Iran, Iraq, India, Tibet, Pamir, Mongolia, and China. It also records the many regions Marco Polo traveled during his numerous emissaries for the Great Khan during his 17 years in China.The Great Khan found favor with the then 21-years-old Marco Polo, who had acquired a remarkable knowledge of the letters and customs of the Tartars. Observing his wisdom and perspicacity, Khan sent him as his emissary to Kara-jang (Yunnan) in the far southwest, a mission Marco polo fulfilled brilliantly. When he went on his mission, being well aware of mistakes of previous emissaries, he paid close attention to all the novelties and curiosities that came his way, so that he may report them to the Great Khan. On his return Marco Polo would present himself before the Khan and first gave a full account of the business on which he had been sent. Then he went on to recount these remarkable things he sighted on the way. In The Travels, one will find detailed account of interesting, if not bizarre, customs and practices at which Marco Polo marveled, the very same stories that entertained the Khan who became well disposed to the young lad.For 17 years, Kubilai (the sixth khan in the Yuan dynasty) was so well satisfied with Marco Polo's conduct of affairs that he held him in high esteem and showed him such favor as keeping him so near his person. He observed more of the peculiarities of China than any of his contemporaries, because he traveled more extensively in these outlandish regions, and not to mention he gave his mind more intently to observing and recording them. The Travels reflects the stupendous extent of his travel, as Marco Polo often bypasses many places that were of no particular interest to him.Emissaries sent Marco Polo all over Manzi (southern China) and Cathay (northern China), rendering a vivid delineation of the native people, customs, cultures with amazing verisimilitude. For example, he marveled at the funeral customs in which the deads were provided with horses, slaves, camels, clothes in great abundance - all cut out of paper (a tradition that still prevails among Chinese) and burned alongside. For the Chinese believed the deads would have all the money in gold and all the necessities in the next world, alive in fresh and bone, and that all the honor they did while he was burning would be done to the deads correspondingly in the next world by their gods and idols.Marco Polo also wrote a detailed account of India and its practices of diabolic arts and similar funeral customs. From other historical resources, he probably acquired his knowledge partly when he was there on the Khan's business, partly on his return trip with the bride for Arghun, and that he derived some of it from first-hand observation, some from reliable testimony, and some from mariners' charts. He also wrote about the life of Sakyamuni Buekhan, who was revered founder of the Buddhist religion, for he refused to be the successor of his king father but continued to lead a life of great virtue, chastity, and austerity.In 1293, the Great Khan reposed such confidence in the brothers that he entrusted to their care not only the princess of Kokachin but also the daughter of the king of the Manzi, so that they might escort them to Arghun, Khan of all the Levant. The Polo brothers' adventure in the East thus completed on the note of a successful escort to Kaikhatu. The Travels, also known as The travels of Marco Polo, chronicled all wonders of Marco Polo's encounters in the East for 33 years.2004 (42) MY"},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"All the annotations make this unreadable for anyone other than a dedicated scholar.

As a teenager, Marco Polo, scion of a Venetian trading family, embarked on a two-decade adventure into the remotest corners of the known world through his family's connection with the Great Khan and his court. Year later, (after dictating his story in a prison back in civilized Europe), Polo published a dazzling account of sights he witnessed in lands little known to Europeans of the Middle Ages. So extraordinary and exotic were his reports, that Polo's tales both fired imaginations and inspired skepticism. For the modern reader, the book offers a fascinating picture of a lost world and a sense of ultimate adventure. One element that makes this an appealing edition of an opt-published classic is the use of 32 woodcut illustrations by Witold Gordon originally created for a 1930 edition of the book."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"The translator included in his translation many notes on variations between the 'original' texts he used as source material, but he also includes a lot of interpretations and theories developed later on which diverge from the narrative.

I was transfixed by these stories of travel and adventure when I was a child, and never questioned the veracity of the narrative. I know today that the narrative has been corrupted over the centuries, that \\"The Travels\\" can scarcely be used as an historical reference, and that a more tantalizing and complete manuscript has probably been lost to the ages. Still, there are glimpses and insights within the narrative that could only have come from first-hand experience, and these describe an enormous, exotic world that titillates even today, while readers in the 13th and 14th centuries must have been enthralled.I was most keen this time around to Polo's descriptions of the cultures and wildlife he encountered, of the whales and lions and leopards and bears--he even describes a white bear, and the people who hunted it were surely of the group often called Eskimos. He describes dog-sledding in the far north and the cannibalistic practices of the people of Java far to the south, both of which are extant in our current era. There are also the fascinating observations of the Mongol Empire, of that group of nomadic people who somehow rose up, like an event in an Isaac Asimov novel, to conquer much of the known world.Somewhat depressingly, though, are Polo's observations of the tensions that existed between the Islamic and Christian worlds, tensions rooted in the competition for hegemony over trade in the Far East. Seven hundred years later, these tensions are still acting themselves out.This translation by Ronald Latham from 1958 includes an introduction that puts Marco Polo's life in context with events and includes footnotes to help the reader make sense of the myriad manuscripts that make up the travels of Marco Polo. This is a somewhat dry read; even Latham comments on the paucity of skill employed by Polo's chronicler. Once I put my mind in context with the narrative, however, I was able to roll with the repetition and sycophancy and enjoy the text."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"There is so little a reviewer could say about a classic that has not already been said. But, whether your interest is in travel literature, ancient history, military history, or anthropology, this book will excite and inspire you. The writing is conversational, witty, and addicting. Though the author repeats some stories, each telling seems to bring out nuances and connections that would have been missed otherwise and each telling takes you deeper into the Asian frontiers and its people. A fascinating traveller's story that never grows old. Must have for any serious student of history especially with regard to the Asian steppes and the empire of the great Khan. Rediscover the wonder of the travels for yourself, not second-hand but from the traveller himself."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"A very low four stars here for this journal style book that has come down to us from Marco Polo.The book itself is not overly inspiring at first until the reader gradually is able to put himself into the shoes of a person of the time, as much as such a thing is possible, and the longer you ponder the technology of the time and the mindset of the people the more you come to appreciate just what an achievement this journey really was. While it is true that the somewhat staid style of the journal makes for a not particularly free flowing read there is one heck of a lot of stuff written between the lines. Tales that at first seem somewhat childish can often actually mean something. For example Marcos discussion of great serpents able to eat men and cattle comes across as something not really worth wasting your time on until you twig that the guy is actually describing crocodiles. Having seen specimens over the five metre mark in captivity in Australia I can quite assure you that they can eat a man or darn near anything else they set their mind to.The journey described herein by Polo starts innocuously enough in medieval Italy soon find its way into the heart of the Mongol empire, thence to travel about the place at the behest of the Great Khan himself and from that position Marco is able to deliver numerous descriptions of local people, their customs and news of sites and nations he wasn't lucky enough to visit himself such as Japan.While it is fair to say that the level of understanding Polo achieved of some of the things he saw was limited which in turn limits what we can glean from his account the fact is that with very few possible exceptions he is pretty numero uno when it comes to eye witness accounts that have come down to us means that we really should not ignore his contribution. I must also point out that my own enjoyment of this book was greatly increased and my understanding of what I was reading greatly enhanced by also reading \`From Venice to Xanadu' by Laurence Bergreen.Ultimately I would not buy this book if you are after a breezy Sunday afternoon read. Instead this is probably best tacked by someone with prior experiences of taking on \`classics' of bygone eras as you will be used to some of the idiom and the other main audience I can see for this book is probably travel addicts looking for inspiration.

I very rarely quit reading books, but this one wore me out. On the plus side, I did experience what life was like for early explorers. Distances were described in days of travel rather than miles. Hardships \\"on the road\\" were extreme. But the heart of the book, the descriptions of the places visited and the people of these places, left me truly wondering about the veracity of the experiences. Lush gardens with mellons piled high in the middle of a desert seemed highly improbable. But even more annoying was the feeling of being lost in an unknown world. Although Polo did not have any maps when he traveled, having maps would have helped the modern armchair traveller to know where Polo was so the reader could more easily determoine where in the world was Marco Polo. It all seemed too fanciful and disconnected for this reader."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"\\"The Travels\\" of Marco Polo is easily one of the most important books in Western literature. Written during the Late Middle Ages, this book has been widely read and appreciated for nearly 700 years. Yet modern readers should note that this is not a modern work meant for pure entertainment. Furthermore, \\"The Travels\\" is not a narrative work in any sense, but rather a collection of anecdotes, observations and impressions of places little understood by Europeans during Polo's time. Considerable attention is paid to the products, wild-life, climate and various customs of the places visited by Polo (if indeed he did visit them), yet from this book we know almost nothing about Polo himself or his life during the decades he spent abroad. Thus don't expect a rousing adventure story, but rather a loose collection of stories - some real, some plainly fantastic - similar to those found in the first half of \\"The Histories\\" by Herodotus. Yet this book still offers much to enjoy and is a great read if you can accept the literary conventions of Polo's time and take the information presented here with a grain of salt.Regarding the Penguin edition: this version provides a very useful historical introduction to pre-Renaissance Europe and interesting biographical information about Marco himself. Furthermore, the numerous footnotes throughout the book make clear the differences between the early manuscripts of this work (at times, the extant MSS differ considerably) and the editors do a decent job (for a non-scholarly reader at least) of providing an \\"accurate\\" version of the text."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"During the 13th Century the Mongols conquered most of the world from China to the Black Sea, providing a rare window of opportunity for people to travel from Europe to the Far East. A few adventurous Europeans actually did it. One actually wrote about it: Marco Polo. The record Marco Polo left stirred the imaginations of Europeans about the possibilities that existed beyond their own limited horizons. Little more than two hundred years later they had established a trade route around Africa to reach the Far East, and attempts to do the dame thing by sailing westward had revealed the existence of two hitherto entirely unknown American continents.The Travels of Marco Polo is one of a handful of books that can truly be said to have changed the world. This is not merely another adventure story, it is THE adventure story of all time! The Polos traveled thousands of miles through unknown and hostile territory in order to reach lands hitherto only vaguely rumored to exist. They accomplished it entirely on their own, and not at the head of a conquering army, but as simple commercial travelers.On the down side, this is not the most convenient of books to get through. A good map is an absolutely necessary accompaniment to the text. Even then, many of the names commonly applied today to many of the people and places mentioned in the text have been changed. In fact, some of the places mentioned in the text don't even exist any more. That is, of course, only to be expected after the lapse of more than 700 years. This edition is liberally provided with footnote, which are absolutely necessary. However, the editors might have made things a lot easier by altered the names of the people and places to their current spelling, and providing a map with locations plotted on it, without really altering the content of the text."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"I bought this book as a requirement for a class.

It to you"},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"I have read this book while traveling in China by train. It is a very interesting description of past times, and essential reading for those interested in historical geography. Several points need to be clarified, though. First Marco Polo is not what one would call today an aeunbiased observer. He traveled on the trips he wrote about while being employed as an emissary for the Mongols, and his admiration for the Mongol regime shows throughout. People and civilizations are judged by their proximity to the Mongol Khan. The point of view of the Chinese and other victims of Mongols is completely absent.Second, Marco Polo was obsessed with power, money, prostitution, and religion. Most of his descriptions center about these things, to the neglect of other aspects of human life. He divides the cities he encounters upon religious lines, even in places like China where the inhabitants themselves weren(tm)t aware or didn(tm)t care about such divisions. His admiration for Christianity and his contempt for Buddhism (whom he erroneously associates with idol worship) shows through. He often writes as if drunken with admiration for Mongol power, praising the Khan for massacring entire cities, while at the same time labeling peaceful people as aepusillanimous.Having said that, these travelogues are still interesting to read. The short-chapter format is very well-suited to reading in the bathroom. The translation by William Marsden is very well-done and easy to read. However, my edition (Wordsworth Editions, 1997) could be improved in several ways. A map for instance showing the route of his travels would go a long way assisting the reader to follow along. Otherwise one has to reconstruct the places from the crude narrative (aeand then we traveled 3 days by camel heading East, then turned to left and walked 1 day ). Frankly, quite often I had no clue about which location he was writing. So I ended up copying a map from a history book and pasting it inside the back cover. Still one desires a more detailed map, with marks designating locations chapter by chapter.Another desperately needed improvement is a translation table. Many of the place names he used had long been ignored and replaced with new place names. In my edition there is one page glossary of place names, but that is far from adequate. For example, the glossary only translates 5 place names in China, leaving dozens other names in oblivion, and leaving me wondering whether the city of Kin-Sai, the one Marco Polo praises the most and devotes the most pages to, is modern-day SuZhou or HangZhou. This is an important deficiency that needs to be corrected.

Many secrets were reviled when Marco returned. And may interesting explanations of things like the origin of cinnamon.Marco writes well enough of his travels and you feel that you are there.

And I think that it is \\"Messer Marco's\\" somewhat simpleminded, straightforward, naively \\"Western\\" and \\"Orientalist\\" approach towards what he saw that makes his book so entertaining. His breathless, hyperbolic descriptions of his travels seem calculated, whether consciously or unconsciously, to give the reader a vision of a world so strange, so wonderful to the Western mind, that they could only comprehend it if they saw it for themselves. And in many ways he (and his ghostwriter) succeeds in producing that effect. His accounts of the Great Khan's feasts and huge array of riches and servants, and well as his descriptions of \\"strange\\" (usually sexual) native customs definitely strive to highlight the differences between what he sees as Eastern and Western civilization. As such, he chooses only the most spectacular and different aspects of life under the Great Khan, aspects that are not coincidentally the most exciting and interesting to read about.Of course, Marco's evaluations and interpretations of what he sees are not to be taken too seriously, but this doesn't make them any less entertaining. Marco's outdated biases and ethnocentric, simplistic interpretations of Asian life give the book an underlying comedic effect.For pure (somewhat trashy) reading fun Marco Polo's account of his travels is a genuine success. Of course, from the standpoint of East/West relations it has more disturbing implications. However, to fully analyze Marco Polo's significance to later Western thought about China, it's implications in the general \\"Orientalist\\" framework as laid out by Said (if you believe in that sort of thing), and how his own prejudices (slavish respect of power, extreme interest in material wealth, dogmatic Christian religious ideas) colored his account is beyond my power."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"I am almost finished with the Four Voyages of Christopher Columbus and he was determined to follow Marco Pole's travels so naturally I had to see what this explorer had accomplished."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"I was highly impressed by this book.

Marco Polo was the original Indiana Jones and then some. Please do not waste time on Gary Jennings' The Journeyer. This is the real deal and needs no dramatic embellishments. The Travels takes you on a trip from 13th century Venice to &quot;Cathay&quot; and back again. You will learn how Europeans found out about fireworks, paper currency, printing and pasta. The harrowing journey across the Gobi desert is particularly well reported. Marco Polo was more than an explorer. He was one of the world's first anthropologists. This is an exciting read, an account of how medieval Europe initially perceived China and the far east, and of how the Mongol rulers and Chinese emperors perceived them. Highly recommended. As to the print quality of the Penguin edition, I have had my copy since the early eighties and it has yellowed only slightly. Viking is now printing on acid-free paper. One must remember that these editions were printed primarily to reach the widest audience for the least amount of expense at the time. For years, Penguins were accessible to students and to the collector who couldn't afford an elaborate, fully illustrated, fully mapped volume of a particular work. I couldn't have read as many of them as I did in my late teens and early twenties if that were not the case. I owe a lifelong debt to the editors for their efforts. I've also never read a bad translation of any Penguin Classic."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"This is a fascinating and timeless narrative for many reasons. On a somewhat superficial level, Polo's book is a must read for lovers of travel or adventure stories, as it reads like a great lost book of the Bible, rife with historic vengeance, heroic warriors, eccentric mystics, penultimate battles and rallying speeches that seem torn out of the best passages of Thucydides. Many of the practices and beliefs Polo witnessed -- specifically, polygamous peoples, perspectives on sexuality, methods of execution and the dazzling ways in which the people Polo came across attempted to please the gods and interpret the cosmos -- offer a memorable glimpse into a unique historical epoch. Particularly engrossing are the stories of violent tensions between Christian and Islamic sects in Polo's day and region. One gets a sense that not much has changed in the past 800 years as Polo details the struggles between the eastern and western world even then, many of which redound to financial issues (sound familiar?). Polo's insistence on portraying Moslems and Buddhists as savage rogues does make for a one-dimensional and distinctly Christian view of the world as it was in Polo's day, and his language is hardly the most attractive aspect of the book, which is written in a particularly conversational and redundant style. But the stories and characters contained within these pages are epic and unforgettable. I encourage lovers of Tolkein, C.S. Lewis and Rowling to read this book. Lovers of ancient history and philosophy are also bound to adore it. Most impressively, though, is the insight Polo offers into the birth of the now-infamous rift between the western and eastern worlds. This enduring relevance guarantees that we will be reading Polo's \\"Travels\\" for centuries to come."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"If your desire is purely technical, you can't do any better than this. However, if you plan to read this book strictly for enjoyment, then thumbtack your eyelids up. The translation is quite literal, bringing you the repetitive references, archaic descriptives, and provincial wherewithal of the time. It is brutal and requires every ounce of perserverence to read from cover to cover. I was in pain as I forced myself through countless redundancies in thickly worded prose that left me yearning to drop the book and set off on another. It was a battle to stay engaged. But, I finish the books I start and saw it through to the end. Knowledge was gleaned and that's a positive. However, the book is better employed as a reference. Godspeed, determined reader."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"The Travels by Marco Polo. Penguin Books. 1958.In any review, the reader has to be compelled to have an interest in the subject. What is it about this 800 year old story that would interest the reader? I had always believed that this book was an adventure story about the first European explorer into the mid east and China. I do not know where this notion came from but on both counts, it is wrong. I picked it up and read it because I continually see references from other modern, authors.What is compelling about the book is the writer's anthropological approach (however primitive) to viewing the societies that were racially and culturally different from the upper crust European society he was raised in. There is a generosity of spirit in this book that will be detailed more further down.It should be noted that like, Benvenuto Cellini's Autobiography, this book features hyperbole if not out right fantasy throughout. There is more than one version of The Travels as well. This book is not written in the first person as it actually is an \\"As told to\\" account that apparently was \\"told to\\" more than one transcriber. There has been much debate over the years about its veracity but that is for someone else to write about. I chose to read this book as if it were fact and not to fret over the overall truth or its details. That being said lets get into the story.Over a period of about 24 years, the young Marco Polo joined his merchant father and his uncle in pursuit of the expansion of their mercantile trade into new regions. This concept should be familiar to any reader who reads about venture capitalism and Red China today. The dynamics may differ but the logic is the same. While this effort led the Polos to discover spices, material and trade routes, it also provided Marco, the opportunity to explore and log his experience with new cultures.He is pretty magnanimous in his descriptions of the peoples he met as he traveled from Asia Minor through cities we hear about today such as Hormuz and Baghdad onto China (known then as Cathay) and into parts of Mongolia and Russia. I say that he is big hearted because he added very little value judgment in relating his experience with these cultures. Unfortunately, he limited what he could describe to a small variety of things.Religion was broken into three categories. There were Christians (he did break them into a few groups such as Nestorian and Greek Orthodox), followers of Mahomet (Islam) and Idolaters (the rest). In some cases though few, he describes the cultures as having no religion as unlikely as that is. It is my suspicion that they were not devout peoples or their customs were too unusual for Polo to understand their worship. He did not render serious value judgments to the religions that were not Christian though he sort of favored that belief system. Specifically, the heroes of battle between people of differing religions was biased toward the Christians just as the performance of any miracles was.Polo described the Great Kings, such as Kublai Khan and the lesser kings who gave allegiance to the former. This was important to him and was noted ad nauseum. He had great respect for Khan including the addition of a Genealogical Chart at the end of the book. He wrote of the Emperor's largesse-assisting the poor, providing examples of fair play and Solomon like wisdom. He also described the ruthless ability to hold power, destroy his enemies and land/nation plundering. He describes these latter events without a hint that anything was wrong with that. Perhaps at this juncture in history, Khan's methods were more civil and humane than the kings in Europe. Based on the North American conquests and slaughtering of Natives 200 years hence, this would seem possible. In my own opinion, the description of Khan reads something like Mario Puzo's Godfather.Another area of special interests lies in Polo's interest with the spices, foods, material for clothing and adornment as well as native wood and building styles. This makes sense because that was Marco's career. He was a merchant. He describes in detail, the reasons different techniques were used to build a ship for instance. The description shows that he had a rudimentary scientific method and imparted that to the reader by explaining why certain procedures were performed based on supplies, climate and water conditions among other things.Polo was a man of the world and that is obvious by his travels but he was clearly educated well. He brought to his journeys and writing, a skill and perception that would only be a result of solid education. His minimal judgmental phrasing also suggests to me that he saw the world as a big place and was not fettered by provincialism that might be expected from an upper crust 13th century European.It is important to note however that the book reveals some of the Magical Realism that undoubtedly prevailed largely in his time. He believed in miracles, reported them on a second hand basis and claimed to see a few himself. It seems again, that by imagining the times and place that this was written, it would be nearly impossible to write a book that denied miracles. He does however toss a tiny bit of skepticism when describing a faith healer (a non Christian one of course). \\"You must not suppose that because I speak of \`Diabolic Art' that that is their account of the matter: They attribute their knowledge to the power of the gods working through a medium of their art\\". He continues to describe these healers having ready made answers when their \\"cure\\" fails and of course it is Divine. Perhaps Benny Hine was acquainted with this book.Polo was fairly interested in the sexual practices of these cultures and he reported some of the more lurid ones. In several cultures that he visited he found that the practice of entertaining visitors (of which he was one) by providing them with the sexual favors of their wives, sisters, nieces etc. The men would make the introductions and then depart to some distant retreat while their dear ones essentially prostituted themselves for the visitors satisfaction. He ended one such description by indicating that a man of 16 to 24 would find such a visit much to their liking. This made me wonder how Polo himself liked it but he did not mention such. Another thing to wonder, based on frank discussion of this and details of a pregnancy test in one of his towns, whether sexuality and the Christian's 6th commandment was considered as taboo as it was in say the Victorian Era. I don't know, it is just a thought.The reader can enjoy this book for the fantastic descriptions of unicorns (probably rhinos), enormous and scary beasts (probably crocodiles) and men with tails. The reader might enjoy the descriptions of royalty which is one place that hyperbole abounds, for instance it is not uncommon for the story to pronounce that some king had thousands of concubines and thousands of servants and hundreds of thousands of soldiers for single battles.The reader might also notice miracles which are plentiful, stories about hens with no feathers, cannibalism and people who live for 150-200 years. They might also marvel at the science that did prevail at the time. There is a description of a messaging system that is easily comparable to America's own Pony Express. Likewise the details of a sewer system that essentially matches our more modern ones, the logic behind curfews and birthing customs all suggest something of interest to me. Specifically, while technology has grown at an extremely rapid pace, people and their logic and belief systems have not really changed dramatically. Nearly, if not all stories that Polo related, have easy counterparts to something or someone that is visible in the media today.There is a down side of this book. Previously it was mentioned that the veracity of The Travels was subject to question. Apparently in Asian historical chronicles there is no mention of this Italian visitor though there is mention of other European guests. He also describes many societies the same, almost verbatim. This may be due to very little difference between one culture and another or perhaps Polo simple cheated and threw in information that he did not have first hand (a little like the ever growing band of journalists, historians etc. that get revealed regularly in our current world).Perhaps the most significant negative comment that could be said about this book is that by our 21st century standards it is just very poorly written. At times it is simply torturous to wade through a meaningless and repetitive description. The book is also written much like we talk. By that I mean phrases like ...\\"I nearly failed to mention...\\" are used throughout. Of course in our day the forgotten piece would simply be edited into its correct location and there would be no need for the brief apologetic line.I assigned this book to myself for this book review. I enjoyed it despite its flaws and quite frankly, it may be all the fantasy of Polo or his transcriber, but I think the book gives us some insight into the 13th century mind of a learned traveler. For that it passes the litmus test of worthwhile reading."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"NO ACTIVE TABLE OF CONTENTS = NO NAVIGATION = READER'S NIGHTMARE.The first 6% of the book consists of three Prefaces in which the scholars who worked on the volume praise each other.

Bigotry had more to do with religion than race; Messr. Marco will describe the marvelous works of some &quot;Saracen&quot; or an &quot;idolater&quot; and then say something nasty like &quot;but he eats the unclean parts of animals, because he knows not the true God.&quot; But his employer, the Great Khan, ruled wisely over people of many diverse creeds, and Marco deeply respects the Khan's tolerance. A recent book by Frances Wood questions the details of the journey, but I prize these tales more for the images they evoke of the lost world where (for example) Iraq was widely known as a center of learning and culture, an exporter of high-quality rich, luxuriant cloths."},{"Title":"The Travels of Marco Polo, the Venetian","review":"I have read this book while traveling in China by train.

In Vol. 4, we get to 1942 when all the elements finally congeal into the stories that still stand head and shoulders above most of the work being done in comics today, 60 years later. This volume is still not a 5-star effort, but it is an excellent read that is full of stories that holds up nicely six decades laterWhile Will Eisner's The Spirit has been reprinted multiple times over the decades, these DC volumes are the first time the series will be printed in proper order and in its entirety. It is fascinating to read these stories and watch as Eisner and his assistants find the format and styles that would make comic book history.Although each 240-page volume sports a US$40 price tag, I think these are items that belong on the shelves of every aspiring comic book creator and any person who fancies themselves a serious fan of the artform. Will Eisner's 'Spirit' series is where much of what we consider the basics for good graphic story telling was first used."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 3: July 6 - December 28, 1941","review":"What's so astonishing about these stories is how variegated and simulatneously superb they were week after week after week--it's astonishing to think of Eisner generating not only such sophisticated and variegated material (almost no single story reads like any other--he changes the tone again and again and again, from sentimental to suspenseful to humorous to scary), but that he did so on a weekly basis. This collection shows him already at top form, and collects some of the most famous of all the SPIRIT stories, including \\"The Oldest Man in the World\\" (justly celebrated by Maggie Thompson in ALL IN COLOR FOR A DIME) and \\"The Jewel of Death\\" (previously reprinted in Jules Feiffer's book on superhero comics).Anyone interested in comics at all should buy these just to study Eisner's incredible storytelling technique: in just a few pages every week he could shorehorn in an amazing amount of material. His stories often show astonishing sophistication in narrative compression, and his use of sophiticated layouts and angles seems not just to be informed by film noir but actually to predate its greatest advances. Look, too, at how deftly he delineates character: the Spirit, Ellen, Commissioner Dolan, Satin, and Ebony (who is really the star of the strip at this point) are shown to have complex and multilayered personalities, far ahead of anything done before Eisner (or, some would even say, since)."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 3: July 6 - December 28, 1941","review":"This third volume in The Spirit Archives collects the comics from the second half of 1941.

There are only 5 stories with substantial Eisner input in volumes 6 and 7 combined, none in 8-10, and Eisner didn't resume work on the strip continuously until the Christmas Spirit of 1945 at the end of volume 11. But every story in volume 3 is written and drawn by Eisner."},{"Title":"The Spirit Archives, Vol. 3: July 6 - December 28, 1941","review":"Will Eisner is the only comic book artist to ever have his work shown in a museum of art. His most important work is the Spirit. The Spirit Archives series has brought together all of his work, that was printed in a weekly newspaper insert. However, after the work found in volumes 1 and 2, Eisner was called to active duty and served in the army during World War II. The Spirit carried on, but it was drawn by other artists. Eisner's work does not pick up again until the stories found in Volume 12 of the Archives series. The work in Volumes 3-11 is fine, but it is not the work of Will Eisner."},{"Title":"Bamboo and Butterflies: From Refugee to Citizen","review":"I teach English to immigrants and their stories of immigration always fascinate me. The extended family in this biography is from Cambodia, and they were desperate to leave, as families such as this one were especially at risk of persecution and death for having been part of the more 'privileged\\" middle class.It took a massive effort on the part of Ean Bun*s family to escape, but it also required great effort and commitment on the part of the American sponsors who persevered in not only getting them here, but in nurturing them once they arrived. Without the sponsors, these immigrants wouldn*t have adapted to the culture and reached their dreams, at least not as quickly or as well. The sponsors provided housing, furniture, clothes. They helped them sign up for classes and find jobs, and counseled them on taxes, education, jobs, and even in dealing with problems in relationships. The sponsors played a critical role in Americanizing these immigrants, and serve as a model for those who wonder how they can help.This is a fascinating account of 'east meets west\\", with humorous and poignant stories of how members of the family interpreted our western holidays such as Christmas, Easter, and Halloween, their misundersandings of our idioms, and encountering contraptions such as toilets and toilet paper so soft it should not be used for its intended purpose. When the American sponsors spent time instructing the family in Christianity, they assumed the family*s conversion was real, based on an understanding of the doctrine, but much later discovered that the Cambodians attended church to please their sponsors, and to mingle with people who spoke English. The Cambodians considered themselves both Christians and Buddhists at the same time, and after years of acquiring English and cultural understanding, they realized they didn*t understand either religion very well.This book also makes us see a little of what we take for granted in the U.S., our ability to speak freely, to live comfortably and without fear, and to be surrounded by a wealth of possessions. One Cambodian is shocked and outraged, when attending school, she sees the students talking loudly, throwing a football across the room, and the worst horror... sitting on a stack of books and treating them like trash. She had owned one book in Cambodia, and protected it as a special treasure. She saw how American students didn*t seem to want to learn as much as they wanted the school day to end, whereas she wanted to devour her education, learning as much as she could.Yet there are ways that our culture shines in the Cambodians* eyes, and if we take some time to look at our culture from their perspective, it can make us more thoughtful, more appreciative, and more productive citizens."},{"Title":"Bamboo and Butterflies: From Refugee to Citizen","review":"\\"Bamboo and Butterflies\\" is a biography and an oral history. In a series of vignettes written in \\"first person\\" format, it tells the story of the daughters and extended family of Ean Bun, and their fleeing from Cambodia to America. Part one of the story begins in 1979 with 11 year old Tevi. She tells of her memories about the flight out of Cambodia to California with her mother, Mearadey Ngak, her father, Keang (Ken) Ngak, and her two younger sisters, Sampwa Moni (Sam) and Chenda Peach.Tevi relates that \\"Everything seemed alien: unfamiliar surroundings, weird noises, peculiar smells.\\" The narrative frequently switches back and forth between these first family members to arrive in The States.The narrative also frequently changes the frame of reference back and forth from the present to the past. There is some repetition from story story, but the format works well. All of the family share their relief at finally being safe after several years of slave labor under the Khmer Rouge regime. Sampwa/Sam relates \\"...I learned fear. Being forced from our home and from the city was a shock...then the Khmer Rouge took my grandfather away.\\" They all tell of the problems involved in being forced to take refuge in a country without knowing the language. There are humorous tales of the misconceptions they have about American culture and society. When Chenda Poong first arrives in the States she can't figure out how to stand on an American toilet to \\"perform her duty.\\" After several days of doing the best she can, she mentions it to her cousin, who explains the \\"American way\\" to her. \\"My opinion of American bathrooms improvedmarkedly after that\\" she said! There are many stories of triumphs small and large. As new family members are brought over from Southeast Asia their stories are added.We eventually meet all of Ean Bun's daughters and Son-in-Laws and grandchildren. The courage and tenacity with which all the members of this exceptional extended family work is told with a humble \\"matter-of fact-ness.\\"! They are not bitter at the past, they are grateful to be alive and have a second chance! Forced to clean houses to make ends meet, A task they had servants for in Cambodia, the women confront the \\"fantasy versus the reality\\" of their new lives. \\"That cleaning business proved to be a valuable experience. It taught me that in America your worth is measured by the person you are, not the work you do.\\" \\"The gap you perceive between your experience and ours (refugees) is not a gap - it's the Grand Canyon,\\" Teeda Mam says at one point. But they are not hopelessly distressed about the gap they must cross to fit in in America, they are motivated! This families' experiences are extreme by our standards; and so is the courage and goodwill with which they chose to cope."},{"Title":"Poems, (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"This is an overall lovely compilation of Shakespeare's non-dramatic works. It's the perfect size to throw in a purse, or keep on a nightstand. The format and font are comfortable and inviting, although the sonnets are not identified by number in any way.I do want to point out one short-fall, however. I have committed many sonnets to memory before owning this particular book and was looking one up to double-check I line I couldn't quite remember when I realized this one was missing. After a thorough sonnet-by-sonnet checking I discovered that this edition has left out 19 of the 154 sonnets. To be exact, the missing sonnets are numbers 16, 24, 25, 31, 37, 42,45,59, 80, 108, 122, 125, 134, 136, 139, 143, 148, 150, and 154.I appreciate the inclusion of the narrative poems and some songs, but buyer beware that you will not have a complete collection of the sonnets."},{"Title":"Poems, (The Pelican Shakespeare)","review":"This book is fantastic! You get Venus and Adonis (erotic love poem), Rape of Lucrece (roman rape poem), Lover's Complaint (about the dangers of Love), Phoenix and the Turtle (symbolic of Love and Faith), and of course 154 lovely SONNETS.David Bevington's introductions are short and informative; the footnotes are there for guidance and do not interfere with the text.

It has been a very long time that I have not read any book in such a way.I would like to suggest the one, who does not know this story, to read this book."},{"Title":"The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat","review":"How I wish the term 'Handbook' had not been used... This is another one of those books that's as good for martial artists (to broaden their horizons) as it is for military science buffs (albeit in a very specific area: soldier training). This book starts by specifying the needs of a soldier in the field, where unarmed combat is concerned, and then goes into a quick (and somewhat inaccurate, to me) overview of traditional martial arts. I'd say that as someone who does a lot of solo training, the most valuable part of this book to me was the section on how SPECOPS trains their people in a short period of time. While techniques are explained, many are not illustrated, so this is definetly not a how-to book. This book coveres a little history, some training methods, vital targets, some escapes and combinations, and defense against various weapons, including bayonets, guns, knives, and clubs. I never really learned what particular special forces these techniques were derived from, though to be honest, I didn't see anything really &quot;special&quot; about most of it. I wish the author had given a references or bibliography section. I will say that the pencil illustrations are some of the best I've seen, very realistic. While this wouldn't be my first choice to go to for self-defense techniques, it does make a pretty good reference manual. Decent, for what it offers, but please understand that it is primarily a reference book."},{"Title":"The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat","review":"A nice book for the uninitiate, boring for anyone else. This is a very,very basic book on military hand to hand combat which reads more like a Readers Digest article than a true handbook. The martial arts heritage spiced with some photos of military units training in hand to hand combat and some big size drawings of basic strikes, throws and some disarming moves taken from military manuals and martial arts books makes up most of the content. If this would truly be the &quot;Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat&quot; than give God that our Green Berets never run out of Ammo. If you want something for real life buy the Krav Maga book."},{"Title":"The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat","review":"First off, there is absolutely no way to learn Martial Arts or Self-Defence from a book. That said, the previous review of this book has an unwarranted rating. (Remember the old adage \\"To know and not to do is not to know\\")Second, if you want a good reference manual on Conventional Unarmed Combat Systems throughout the world (and esp in the 3rd world and the former Warsaw Pact), then this might just be the thing for you.I myself have studied both Traditional Martial Arts and Conventional Combat Systems and the 2 are as different as night and day. This book clearly makes that distinction in a very nice way (i.e. what is traditionally taught in a Dojo is far different than what is taught in several months to a Special Forces Unit).If you get a chance, pick this book up with its \\"partner\\" - Deadly Fighting Skills of the World, which is also a good field manual. I think both books are surprisingly informative..."},{"Title":"The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat","review":"When I saw the cover of this book at Amazon.com I expected something like a step-by-step self-defense manual especially written for military personnel. Unfortunately the cover page is misleading.Overall, the book is mainly written for readers who are already engaged in martial arts or self-defense. Whether this was actually the author's initial intention I do not know. Beginners will probably run into difficulties when trying to apply the techniques described in the book.One of the main reasons for these difficulties is that the author presents the different types of techniques and situations verbally, using hardly any photos or drawings. After a short period of time it becomes rather difficult even for an experienced person to follow all the steps. If the author had added more step-by-step pictures the text would not seem so complicated.He incorporated many individual photos of different techniques in his book, but unfortunately they do not show the progression of the techniques.To be fair, some techniques are represented as drawings but unfortunately the relevant paragraphs are usually on different pages. References such as (see Fig. ...) are missing as well.I also noticed that the author does not give credit to all participants in his book. Russian, British and US forces are always individually named when shown but, for example, the soldiers of the German armed forces, who appear quite often in the book, are not mentioned. These guys would probably appreciate it too if they got some credit for their performance. But this is just a personal opinion!Overall I have to say the book is good for reference purposes but if a reader looks for a step-by-step manual to train in self-defense techniques he might be better off with a jiu-jitsu manual/ book. However, a book will never be able to replace a good instructor!!!"},{"Title":"The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat","review":"To give you a quick and concrete idea of what is contained in this book, here is an example.What is the best way to reply if you are forced to the ground by an opponent who is on top of you? A Brazilian Jiu Jitsu book would tell you to wrap your legs around him and maneuver for a choke or an armlock. This book tells you to wrap your legs around him and snap his neck.I see no reason to criticize this book. Sometimes, people criticize in order to show off. If you are dissatisfied with what an expert or author is doing, that must mean you know more than he does.But the fact is, this book does have a lot of good information in it. That's the bottom line. There are hundreds of self defense books. This book can't be all of them.If you want the ultimate self defense instruction, here's what you do. Stay home. Watch tv. You'll be fine. Just don't slip in the shower.When you really think about it, the best way to protect yourself is to avoid being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Don't fall asleep on the subway. Don't be out at night. So to those of you who are dissatisfied with the advice in this book, will your own personal favorite self defense book protect you as well as the advice I just gave you? I don't think so.So take the book for what it's worth, appreciate the gift the author has shared with us, and stop complaining and showing off.A good, informative review should show how this book differs from the others you can buy. Well, this one is from the point of view of a soldier who could care less whether he kills his opponent, and has no fear about being charged with murder.A lot of the techniques are along these lines. Avoid the blow, secure the attacker's arm, whack him til he sees stars, execute a judo throw, and strangle the s.o.b. to death.The martial art it reminds me of most is Krav Maga. It isn't like the more technical ground fighting of BJJ or Sambo. It's the art and science of what works, for those who aren't about to spend six years learning complicated moves.The pictures are easier to follow than the explanations. Seeing something, having it make a visual imprint in your brain, makes it a lot easier to absorb. You look at the series of drawings and think to yourself \\"yeah, I can do that\\".Anyway, like me, you probably have had a lot of martial arts training, so this stuff isn't really that new to you. It's a way of selecting from all the moves you have already learned and focusing on a few that you should think of first.Okay, bring em on, eight opponents at once, all armed with knives and clubs, I'm ready. I pity them. I'll be spraying their eyeballs all over the street, and they'll be gasping for one more breath.I wonder if anything good is on tv tonight."},{"Title":"The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat","review":"This book is excellent for training any soldier or even an Unarmed Combat Instructor. The book tells you everything you need to know. It tells you how to get started and how a general 6 week C.1/4.C. coarse is laid out. This stuff is easily applicable to \\"over the water\\" work in a bar fight with some mean buggers that want your beer money and maybe your anal virginity or to shake someone's brain in a good old street fight. This is how scraps are. When a group of hostiles crowd you, all you have is your instincts. Tecnique goes out the window. Your primal instincts are to smash, bash, bite, rip, poke, gouge,kick and stomp. This book was what I expected down and dirty. The only thing I would have liked to see was a little more ground work. If you buy this book don't go around throat punching people. For god sakes use the least amount of force needed to put the guy down. Sure you can smash him and bash him, but don't kill the man it's just a bar fight."},{"Title":"The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat","review":"I must admit I was rather disappointed with this book.

These basic concepts are taught to special forces of many of the world's militant forces, so it is an excellent starter book for someone wanting to train in REAL and EFFECTIVE self defense. By reading this book, a begginer will efficently expose him/herself to defense tactics which can be used in real life self defense, and it may also help the reader select a martial art that can be applied to real life. I'm not trying to say that many of the martial arts out there are ineffective in real life situations, but the concepts covered in this book are used by militant forces that must use these techniques in order to survive, so they MUST be effective.This book, however, will be relatively useless to an expirienced or advanced fighter/ martial artist."},{"Title":"The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat","review":"bought this book on all the reviews that i read about..a no nonsense book about fighting skills .very pleased with the book ."},{"Title":"The Elite Forces Handbook of Unarmed Combat","review":"In my opinion this is an excellent book.

Typically, American correspondents came and went every couple of years; Kinzer was there before the victory of the 1979 revolution and stayed to the end of a most bloody chapter in this country's history. I do not believe anyone has captured better the strange, almost surreal beauty of this land nor the full horror of the bloodbath it had suffered by the end of the 1980s. Those looking for finger-pointing and the moral of the story will be disappointed; but what Kinzer depicts is the truth, a harsh one for all involved."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"...the late 1970's-1980's period. I read this book after having spent time in Central America myself. I think Steven did a wonderful job of telling the truth about what happened in Nicaragua during the years he was there. He showed where the Sandinistas failed, and where the U.S. government failed the people of Nicaragua. Throughout the whole book he really made the reader aware of the stories that these people lived out; from a engineer from Portland, Oregon going down to help out, to the children in the hospitals suffering from war wounds. There is a large amount of history, personal experience, and cultural images to be gained from reading by book."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"Being a refugee who left the country as a child I never got an unbiased look at what really happened until I read this amazing book. It starts off before the takeover of the country by the communist Sandinistas to after the stunning election over a decade later. Stephen Kizer describes thrilling journeys where bombs go off at news conferences and clandestine stumblings into a contra camp. This book has humor (Rice for Peace?!), sadness (the 30,000 faceless people who died in the middle), to the mystical (a fair and poignant treatment of the Miskito Indians). Also the books details the visit of the Pope to Nicaragua which would headline news for various reasons as well as singer Kris Kristofferson (!) lending support to the Sandinista regime whose leaders soon afterwards head off to friendly nations of Libya and the Soviet Union. This book could almost be descibed as the definitive encylopedia of information but it's so much more: If my family hadn't lived through it it would almost read as a spy novel. There is also plenty of photos showing the major players of the conflict as well as personal photos of the author."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"I agree with much of the previous reviews-- a very thorough and rich account with nice flourishes of history and culture as well. I learned a lot. I did find, however, especially in the second half of the book, a pattern of blaming Sandinista policies without the caveat that these policies were driven by the Contra War. For example, Kinzer repeatedly says the economy is crashing due to the Sandinistas' failed economic policies, but hardly mentions the US trade embargo, which had a huge impact (arguably more than the war itself). The shortages caused by the embargo figure prominently in other first-hand accounts of life in Managua in the 1980s. In Kinzer's Afterword, he fails to mention on-going US confrontation wrt to Nicaragua, such as the Helms Amendment, requiring Nicaragua to essentially pay reparations to former Guardsmen (now \\"American citizens\\") who lost their property in the Revolution. Even Obama continues to enforce this requirement today."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"I was introduced to Stephen Kinzer's work by an Iranian (said he was really Persian) shopkeeper after we had some long conversations while buying a rug. I purchased a copy of All the Shah's Men by his recommendation and a rug. Later I bought Overthrow and then found an old copy of Bitter Fruit.I recently returned from a trip to Nicaragua and bought a copy of Susan Meiselas' Nicaragua photos and the subsequent film she made. That led me to purchasing Kinzer's Blood of Brothers which I thoroughly enjoyed. Blood of Brothers gave me a real feel for the country I was visiting and some insight into who the people are and what they have been through. I'm amazed, as a Norteamericano, that I was so well recieved in Nicaragua.Kinzer's books are informative and his journalistic writing style gives a security that he is doing his best to tell an accurate story without any particular position. It is sad that our government doesn't seem capable of learning from the past.I watched a CNN special on Cambodia and a couple of quotes from Francois Pouchand tell the truth as ugly as it is. \\"The governments did not react. You know, countries don't defend human rights. They are always subservient to politics\\". \\"Governments are cold beasts looking out for their own interests\\".I love my country but our foreign policies are no better than any other country. We may profess democracy and freedom but in the end we support, with might and force, the narrow interest of a few. Usually those narrow interests are not those of the American people nor the people being crushed in various countries.I'd recommend all of Kinzer's works."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"I am a fan of Steve Kinzer. This is my fourth read from him. I have previously read his books on Guatemala, Turkey, and Iran. I have yet to read his book Overthrow, but I own it. He has a good conversational writting style and I find his books interesting. I understand he is now stationed in Chicago.This is the second book Kinzer authored. I think he describes the conflict in Nicaragua well. Although Steve is a correspondent for the N.Y. Times, there was a slant to his writing. However he describes the fall of Somoza and the rise and fall of the Sandinistas well. Both groups were dictators. The conflict of the contras, FSLN, the Catholic Church, and the American government of Reagan was the last of the Cold War. Kinzer is critical of the FSLN as well. There many problems resulted in them being voted out of office in 1990. All of this is related in his biography of the conflict.This is a great read. Kinzer does a nice job with each of his books.

This book really helps put what occurred in perspective. The author makes an effort not to take sides, but also doesn't shy from opining on how different parties and individuals could have handled events better. Keep in mind that since the author was a New York Times writer and not a political official or other Nicaraguan, the book never feels like a \\"insider's\\" perspective. But given how emotionally charged people can get over the topic, perhaps that's a good thing."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"Stephen Kinzer was there for much of the important times in Nicaragua. The story he tells is huge, huge enough for many, many books, but here is a place to start whether you want to clear up your personal memories, or learn some significant history, or ponder the enormous questions of how could so much go right and so much go wrong at the same time.The role of the USA here in Nica became a world wide humiliation more than once, a bunch of times. The USA, William Walker, the CIA, Ronald Reagan, Oliver North all might had acted like demented idiots, but the people of Nicaragua payed the price in blood and poverty and more blood and more poverty.This is an absolutely compelling story, well written.

It offers a detailed insight into the modern history of Nicaragua. You will understand much more what the people went through there during the past hundred years of oppression. You will also learn how the communists - Sandinistas, who replaced the tyrant Somoza, failed terribly to bring their country prosperity. The book reads like a thriller, the fact that the author was a journalist reporting on the Sandinist era and civil war directly from Nicaragua adds to the credibility of this work. I really enjoyed the book. You can hardly find similar book on Nicaragua which is both highly informative and readable."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"It's always interesting to me how so many people want to understand Nicaragua but this is a country that is akin to having a body with a heart that beats but no pulse to show that it is alive. Nicaragua's social paradigms are too complex to understand from an outsider's perception but upon further examination they seem almost too simplistic to anyone who tried to figure it out before ( and is now beating themselves over the head because of it). Simply put: You either are or you aren't. Plain and simple. End of story. Black and White. Rich and Poor. Affluent or Powerless, Accepted or Shunned. Nicaragua's social identity is akin to the old plantation mentality that was prevalent in the Old South prior to the end of the Civil War when the North forced the South into submission and ended the Southerner's way of life and broke their pride, except that in Nicaragua the FSLN raised the ire of the Nicaraguan people to rise up against an admittingly corrupt, despotic, brutal and typically unfair Latin American regime based on old family dynasties, a ruling class mentality that Americans can never understand because it as a mindset that is not democratic in the least but rather oligharchic and exclusive, and only those who are have something are afforded something in Nicaragua, and it's always surprising to me how Americans in their feigned benevolent, well-meaning intentions look at Nicaragua and say to themselves \\" look at all those poor people we should help them, they're starving... look at all the children who are in hospitals who are dying... look at all the misery and suffering \\" and take a step back to think how they can help in and in a typical American response to the situation they give a little bit of money, a little bit of medicine, foreign aid, support and prop up whichever regime is convenient for them to support at the time and are still flabberghasted when everything they have tried to fix the problem doesn't seem to work. America is the bright, shining light in a world full of darkness, misery, pain and suffering and feels it has an obligation to help the world fix it's problems through democracy, diplomacy, military intervention, and just general brute force and bullying when it is convenient but the world cannot be changed by America, America can only be itself and not fix every little thing that goes wrong.It seems to me that the journalist who wrote this book is a bright, intelligent, educated and socially responsibly ethical individual who wants to make a difference and show the world through words the images of a country that is afflicted with very deep, very raw open wounds and scars because of the status Nicaragua achieved in the 1980's as a pet cause of the Conservative establishment and another tool in the Reagan Administration's Cold War not so Cold War on the Soviet Union and \\" Communism \\" around the world. Having immigrated with my parents and most of my family from Nicaragua in 1980, Nicaragua is what I am, and through all it's phases it has paralleled my existence and that of my family's as well.As a child I remember the dirty, dingy streets that my brother and I would play in outside of my Grandmother's house in a barrio that has since become the main hospitality sector of Managua, and I remember the starving dogs on the street, home-cooked chicken soup my grandmother would make ( made with a chicken she had slaughtered right before my very eyes ), the unpaved streets full of potholes and traps that caused accidents 24/7, the fragrant smell of flowers, plants and fruits that Americans and people around the world will never see unless they travel to Latin America, my immediate family consisting of my Father, Mother and brother, and then my extended family where all of us ( 2 Uncles, 3 Aunts, grandmother, great-grandmother ) lived in a 3 bedroom house and the bar my family ran adjacent to our property, the barfights between overly drunk men who harasssed women, the brutal treatment of women and children, kids on the street begging for food, people with broken limbs, broken spirits, broken souls. Then I would take a ride and go uptown to the OTHER Nicaragua, the tiny strip of affluence that the upper class could only afford. The children of rich parents who had all the creature comforts of any middle-class and upper-class Americans, lived in modest yet lavish mansions with servants everywhere who only did what they were told and NEVER, EVER complained or could complain ( for fear of losing their only source of employment, and therefore means of sustanance for their families ), the way the truly rich Nicaraguans acted out towards the poor and defenseless, the callous and harsh punishments meted out to a poor Nicaraguan if he had committed a crime against an important one. In Nicaragua race isn't as important as class, but it stands to reason that if you're White, descended of any European stock at all you're better than the darker peoples in the country and the same is true for the rest of Latin America, and throughout the world. In Latin America there is only one place you aspire to be in your life, and one place of going: up. Marrying up, trying to achieve any sort of upward mobility the situation you were born into affords you to. The wealth and power of the upper classes is concentrated and is vertically and horizontally integrated ( to use a business term ), you marry as best as you can and hopefully have means to do so, it's not uncommon for the rich to intermarry and almost be inbred, like the royal families of Europe are. And that is where Nicaragua's problem lies: It is a country that is stuck in the 21st century but has an 18th century mentality. The rest of the world is slowly creeping it's way forward, or backwards if you're a Conservative because of the forced egalitarianism that the world is fostering now, but Nicaragua is stuck in the past and has yet to move. Anywhere. AT ALL. If you do visit Nicaragua, be prepared to see dirty, unpaved streets, people poorer than you ever thought existed and in worse conditions than ANY U.S. city, even any city in MEXICO, animals on the verge of extinction being sold for less than you would buy a compact disc, women being forced into prostitution because of the dire situation, child labor, assaults, murder, robberies, and social unrest that is only held together by whichever current iron-fisted government is ruling at the time. The sitation never changes for the vast majority of Nicaraguans, the Somocistas where thrown out of power and accused of theft and corruption, the Sandinistas have done the same thing, and the cycle has continued unabated for decades and WILL NEVER CEASE. Right now their is a lot of foreign investment oppurtunities in Nicaragua where Americans, Europeans, and others are buying up land and establishing themselves in a country that is seen as a burgeoning tourist attraction and the Sandinista government is encouraging this foreign investment but the situation is precarious as ever. Nicaragua is never stable politically, geophysically, or socially, and to be Nicaraguan is to be a proud citizen of a country that has a fighting spirit equal to any nation in the world but cannot move forward because of it's lack of a discernable identity and therefore has an uncertain future. Enjoy Nicaragua for what it is, not for what you think it should be."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"A great political history of Nicaragua, focusing intently on the Sandinista revolution that toppled the Somoza regime, fought the counter-revolution Contras, lost power in the first real democratic and free elections, and now has taken control again.I like the Mr. Kinzer points out that the Sandinistas made three critical errors that lead to their losing the election of 1990: #1 \\"they believed they could build Nicaragua into a prosperous country without deferring to the principles of free enterprise\\"; #2 \\"they grossly underestimated the moral influence of Catholic bishops and, in particular, the esteem in which Nicaraguans held their spiritual leader, Cardinal Obando\\"; and #3 \\"they abused Miskito Indians and other ethnic minorities who had lived peaceably for centuries along the Atlantic coas, provoking a rebellion that attracted widespread sympathy both within Nicaragua and around the world.\\"After surprisingly losing the presidential election of 1990 to Violeta Chamorro, Daniel Ortega and the Sandinistas are back in control of Nicaragua. I can only hope that they will govern more successfully this time."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"This book was really hard to put down. As a person familiar with Nicaragua since I grew-up there in the 1960s, I have been watching the saga of this nation unfold since then. The ingrained caste and feudal system is difficult to shake. It doesn't seem to matter what political spectrum takes power, they do nothing to break the vicious cycles of poverty and oppression that plagues the people there. Each generation has no better promise than the previous to break out of the quagmire. Seems like the international aid over the years just makes it easier for the system to perpetuate. How can those that have suffered under a given regime make it to the top and then grind-on their people in the same fashion that they were initially subjected to? Perpetual pathological sickness prevails. There are many lessons to be aware of as to how easily it is to be stuck in this mud - and how relatively blessed the USA is that we are not."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"My husband was born in Granada NIcaragua in 1978. My in-laws have told me many stories about how difficult those times were. This book has filled in the rest of the story for me. I feel that the auther shares a balanced view of the events that took place. On a more personal level, it has given me a new respect for what my in-laws went through to raise their six children in such difficult situations."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"My wife and I were in Nicaragua in May 2010 visiting our daughter serving in the Peace Corp. I started reading \\"Blood of Brothers\\" while we were there and became totally immersed in Stephen Kinzer's writing. Our travels from the Costa Rican border up through the northern reaches of Nicaragua brought to life the names and places referenced in the book. We found the country of Nicaragua beautiful and the people wonderful but it was when we stopped to talk with people over 40 years of age we were able to relive through their eyes some of the horror and despair experienced during the 1980s that Kinzer captures through his first person experiences.32 years after the taking of power from the Somoza regime by the rebel Sandinistas and their leader Daniel Ortega ... the democratically elected Daniel Ortega will be seeking a second five year term through election at the end of 2011. During 2010 Ortega rewrote the constitution supported by his cronies in the supreme court allowing him to run indefinitely (similar to Hugo Chavez in Venezuela) setting up what will be a very confrontational election cycle in 2011.I think anyone serving in the US government who has a stake in developing or implementing foreign policy with Nicaragua should read this very informative history to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past 100 years and in particular the mistakes of the 1980s. I do expect 2011 in Nicaragua to be politically unstable and I do expect the US to assert itself as we have the last 100 years when Nicaraguan leadership change is in play ... maybe this time we can approach it from the perspective of what is best for the Nicaraguan people."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"I'm no longer a huge recreational reader, but I ripped through these 404 pages pretty quickly. Kinzer's tales alternately made me (1) wish I had considered foreign correspondent as a possible career choice, (2) despair that the lessons to be learned from misguided intervention will never fully register with successive generations of political leaders."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"Stephen Kinzer writes an engaging although sad and depressing narrative about Nicaragua during the U.S. backed Somoza dictatorship and the lengthy period of Sandinista rule. Drawing on interviews with government officials and local residents Kinzer paints a picture of a country in an unsettled state of war. Nicaraguans buried a whole generation of their young fighting to first remove the Somoza dictatorship from power and then a second civil war between the Sandinistas and the Contras. Kinzer also discusses the impact of the Sandinista and Samoza policies on the people of Nicaragua and why Nicaragua continues to be a place of intrigue."},{"Title":"Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua","review":"I never felt like I understood what really happened in Nicaragua in the 1980's until I read this book.

He spread the blame around to about all parties involved.There is minimal info on pre-Sandinista revolution history.Author sprinkles the book with a few pages patting himself on the back, regarding peripheral journalistic acomplishments, but these can be skimmed over or forgiven.I wish all history books would contain a couple of pages with the timeline of important events. Like most books, this one does not."},{"Title":"Little Foods of the Mediterranean: 500 Fabulous Recipes for Antipasti, Tapas, Hors D'Oeuvre, Meze, and More (Non)","review":"Clifford Wright is one of the leading writers, along with Elizabeth David, Paula Wolfert and Claudia Roden, on the cuisines of the Mediterranian. This volume complements his monumental, award winning \`A Mediterranean Feast' and is, I believe, as accessable, entertaining, and useable as food writing can get.I confess that this type of writing by a culinary scholar / journalist writing about regional cuisines of the past and present is just about my favorite kind of food writing. Aside from the fact that these people are typically better writers than chefs, I believe this content has a cachet about it similar to what people say of antiques. What has survived from the past is generally better than what is produced today because there is so much more historical product than there is of contemporary product. Things typically survive because they are good.Wright's book fits this expectation to a tee. For $22 list price, one gets over 500 recipes from all around the Mediterranean. This collection is so good, one could easily retire your Martha Stewart and Ina Garten books on appetizer menus and have this take their place.In spite of the superficial similarity in the various small dishes in the book, there is a significant difference between antipasti and hors d'oeuvres, which accompany a large meal, tapas, which often consist of a meal in themselves to accompany afternoon drinking and conversation, and meze, which, in several countries comprise a large meal in itself, based on a lot of little dishes. There are family resemblences between the various little dish cuisines of the Mediterranean but, except for the presence of olives and olive oil, there is probably no common heritage to which all can be traced. Meze dishes can be traced to Arab cuisine. The word appears to be originally from Turkey. Hors d'oeuvre and antipasti are much more recent, emerging in French and Italian cuisines over the last 150 years. Tapas may be traceable to the period of the Moorish occupation of Spain, even though both Wright and Diane Kochalis, an authority on Greek cuisine agree that tapas and (Greek) mezes are different things.All this very interesting historical stuff simply makes the excellent collection of recipes just that much more interesting. The books contents are divided into sixteen (16) types of dishes such as Bread Snacks, Dips, Cheese, Eggy stuff, Saucy Meats, Saucy Veges, Stuffed Vegetables, Salads, Pastries, Pizzas, Fried Turnovers, Fried Tidbits, Wraps, Seafood Salads, Grilled Food, and Pickles and Marinades. This is followed by two chapters of components recipes. One for Sauces and Spice Mixes and one for Doughs and Batters. The book concludes with an extensive list of Party Menus.As you may expect, there are some requirements for uncommon ingredients, mostly cheeses of Greece and North Africa plus spice mixes, including the ever elusive Aleppo pepper. Substitutions from the world of Italian cheeses are almost always possible, but part of the fun is to get the read deal. Internet sources are, of course, provided.In this very large book, I found only one questionable item, where the author specifies fresh plum tomatos or tomato puree to build tomato sauces. On the strength of the opinion of Mario Batali, I would change this to always using canned whole tomatoes.This book will stay in my library long after others have been carted off the the library's book sale."},{"Title":"Little Foods of the Mediterranean: 500 Fabulous Recipes for Antipasti, Tapas, Hors D'Oeuvre, Meze, and More (Non)","review":"This book is very extensive with a mind boggling amount of recipes. The author obviously spent many months, probably even years researching. It is better for the more advanced cook. Many of the recipes are complicated, or call for ingredients that a beginner like me just isn't familiar with. There are still many that are simpler and some that you can adapt to easier methods. If you are interested in this style of foods, it will help you to learn the flavor combinations, inspiring you to create your own (simpler, if need be) recipes. I also wish there were more pictures, there is only a small section at the front with a handful of recipes illustrated. This might help clarify some of the recipes that seem too complicated to the less experienced cook."},{"Title":"Little Foods of the Mediterranean: 500 Fabulous Recipes for Antipasti, Tapas, Hors D'Oeuvre, Meze, and More (Non)","review":"Little Foods of the Mediterranean:500 Fabulous Recipes for Antipasti, Tapas,Hors d'oeuvre, Meze and MoreBy Clifford A. WrightAuthor of A Mediterranean FeastThis is an important food book written by a distinguished research scholar, cook and food writer. Wright makes you feel as if you are on-location in the friendly sunny Med when he teaches you why the foods are available, then how the folks there make little snacks with the fresh foods. Wright gives intense scrutiny to all his projects, so much so he dedicated this 514-page book to his youngest son, \\"who wondered when we would again eat \`big' food.\\"Here are some of the foods, recipes and color the book is chock full of:One of Wright's many indexes, \\"Cheesy Mouthfuls,\\" contains such muchies as Spanish Baked Cheese Marbles, Gruyere Half-Moons, his favorite, Saganaki and an item he calls Provolone and Mortadella Bombs. He feels Saganaki with a squirt of lemon and a glass of oouzo aside the Ionian Sea is pretty close to what a heaven must be.Under \\"Frittatas and Other Eggy Delights,\\" he borrows dishes from Andalusia, Cordoba, Tunisia and Egypt, noting there are only four countries where Frittatas are eaten: Italy, Spain, Algeria and Tunisia. One eye-catcher is Poached Eggs in Garlicky Yogurt.The \\"Saucy Little Dishes\\" parts are meant to open the appetite and satisfy the soul. These little dishes, little foods, are ever-popular and Wright keeps changing his mind about his favorite, probably most. Try Pork and Pine Nut Meatballs in Romesco Sauce, Carp Croquettes in Walnut Sauce in the style of the Greek Jews. How about Fresh Anchovy in Orange Sauce.Another section is \\"Stuffed Vegetables\\" ranging from zucchini flowers, olives, potatoes to even onions. The Imam (word for a Muslim prayer leader) Fainted is a stuffed eggplant dish, one of Turkeys' most famous mezes, for it is said the prayer leader fainted when he realized how good the dish was. Few recipes gain such lofty titles.In his \\"Filled Pastries, Puffs, Pies and Baked Turnovers\\" section Wright offers the recipe for Spicy Octopus Pie in a Red Wine Crust from the Port of Sete. He offers a care-filled lesson on cleaning an octopus you have caught yourself.\\"Pizzas, Calzones and Empanadas\\" is a sizeable section. His San Vito's Pizza, comes with its own history and calls for pork shoulder, tomato, Italian sausage, salami, cinnamon, cheeses, fennel seeds and oregano. Calzones and Empanadas are carefully described, all being breadish conveyors of tasty ingredients, baked in very hot ovens.His section entitled \\"Fried Tidbits,\\" brings you Fried Kibbe, Mediterranean-Style Fried Small Fish, Fried Stuffed Cabbage Bundles from Catalonia, French Fried Pumpkin with Green Sauce from Naples, Fried Stuffed Olives from Venice and mjuch more.Wright's \\"Seafood Salads and Platters\\" is probably crowned by the Venetian Seafood Antipasto - shrimp, mussels, cockles, little necks, oysters, baby octopus, tuna steak and cod fillets, bearly cooked and served drizzles with olive oil and squirted with fresh lemon.In closing the book would be incomplete without his recipes for assorted sauces and spice mixes. Find Wright's Allioli, Romesco Sauce, Harissa, Ras al-Hanut, Tabil and more. Doughs and batters are there, suggested menus, too. Wright wisely groups the food for certain groups, i.e. A Summer Grill Party with Arab Meze for 12, Passed Appetizers for a Cocktail Party made for 20 - he pulls together many diverse groups and occasions. Interesting.On the purely informal, local, U.S. level, my daughter, JoAnn, has a delightful little habit of walking by you and pressing a little cr&egrave;me brulee ramekin in your hand, one containing a little treat she has made up just for you.

And it has been taking over by some mercenary group. They are dropped in the North Atlantic, and are to assist the Russian Spetsnaz group to get onboard the carrier and stop this ship from heading toward the Zero Red line, which is an imaginary boundary setup during the Cold War by the U.S., which states that any Russian nuclear vessel crossing this line will be fired upon and destroyed by the U.S.Our boys are promised to be home for Christmas, but things turn bloody pretty fast as the Spetsnaz get wiped out while infiltrating the ship.

She checked it out of the library as part of a Sephardic reading group. I started skimming through it and couldn't put it down, had to buy my own copy here on Amazon! Trudi Alexy and her family fled Czechoslovakia to escape the Germans and were chased through France and finally Spain before they felt safe. Spain, in spite of its history of ultra-conservative Catholicism, Inquisition, expulsion of the Jews, etc., was one of the few safe havens for Jews fleeing the Germans during WWII. I was surpised to find this out, since Franco was a part of the Axis powers, a rigid ultra-Catholic, a dictator, and a Fascist. But I guess he wasn't an anti-Semite, because he basically looked the other way when Jews began pouring into Spain illegally to escape being killed in the concentration camps of Occupied Europe, especially Vichy-controlled France, which practically did all they could to deliver the Jews over to the Germans, nasty anti-Semites that the French are. In contrast, Spain not only looked the other way when Jews came pouring over the border, in many cases Spanish diplomats would demand that arrested Jews in other countries be released to them as Spanish citizens, even in cases where the Jews were Ashkenaz, not even Sephardic! The Spanish Red Cross also made a great effort to get food, clothing and letters shipped to Jews in concentration camps in the rest of Europe, even as the International Red Cross did absolutely nothing to help. There are horrific stories from the survivors themselves, tales of fleeing the Nazis with only the clothes on their backs, of escaping concentration camps and struggling over the Pyrenees in mid-winter without even a proper coat. Tales of getting to Spain and turning themselves in to the police to find warm beds, food and even money provided for them by kind hearted Spaniards from all walks of life. Then there are stories from the people who smuggled them into Spain, the risks they took to save thousands upon thousands of people from certain death. And tales of the Secret Jews, or Marranos, or Crypto-Jews, who were forced to convert during the Inquisition, or who were expelled from Spain, and the constant threats that they faced. Many of them continued practicing their Jewish rituals in absolute secrecy, in most cases not even letting their children know that they were of Jewish blood until age 12, when they were less likely to slip and give the secret away to outsiders. Many Crypto-Jews live in Mexico and New Mexico today, their ancestors having arrived in the 1500's after the expulsion from Spain. The Inquisition follwed them to the New World, however, so they continued practicing the most minimal Jewish traditions, such as ritual prayer, in absolute secrecy. Trudi interviewed some people who only identified as Catholics, but had listened to an NPR show on the Crypto-Jews and identified ancient and distorted Jewish traditions that their own family practiced! These people were utterly shocked to find out that they were of Jewish ancestry. I don't personally see the big deal, but I guess if you're a major Christian, then you might think it's a bad thing. In most cases though, the families were not only aware of their Jewish ancestry, but fostered it in secret while living a public life of Catholicism. They would intermarry only amongst one another and kept to fairly tight-knit communities. I liked the stories of the people who escaped to Spain during WWII best, since they were so full of heroism and drama, but really the whole book was fascinating."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"The author, who was hidden by Spaniards for two years during WWII, uses her own experience as a jumping-off point for a discussion of centuries of Spanish assistance in hiding and protecting Jews during times of persecution, notably during the SPanish Inquisition.While I have a fair grasp on Jewish history, I was astounded by the stories of these &quot;secret Jews,&quot; known only to each other by things like the titular talisman (including a Jewish object like a mezuzah in a painting of a Madonna). The descendants of these secret Jews, the Marranos, are still with us today.This is a little-known aspect of Jewish history. As I kept turning the pages (and trust me, this is a page-turner), I kept saying &quot;I didn't know that.&quot;Even if Jewish history is not a particular interest, the book is interesting both as general history and a fascinating narrative of the author's experiences and those of centuries of Marranos."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"During World War II Spain gave safety to nearly one million Jews. Franco, the Fascist dictator, gave the order to the Spanish diplomatic corps, &quot;Bring our Jews home.&quot; As a result Jews, stateless for lack of papers, who could not speak a word of Ladino, were given transit visas to Spain until the Nazi's stopped honoring papers of any kind. Then the boarder guards simply looked the other way when Jews ran their border crossings.Today, there is still a Marano community in the Catholic church. These are the descendants of &quot;conversos,&quot; Jews forced into baptism by Ferdinand and Isabella's zeal to unite Spain, who have retained a jewish identity.This introspective on one young Jewish girl who survived the holocaust is well worth the reading. It is positive, even inspirational and always interesting."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"Alexy was a child in Prague, in 1939. When World War II broke out, her father suddenly announced that the family was leaving, and that they would be baptized as Catholics. Up to that point, the author had not even known that her family was Jewish. From Prague, they fled to France, and then to Spain.Years later, after she was living in America, she learned that many Jews had fled to Spain during the Holocaust, but that most had not converted or hidden their Jewishness.As she began to trace her roots, she discovered the irony of Jews seeking protection in a country that, centuries before, and persecuted and expelled them.There are a couple of books here, fighting for supremacy!The first book is about how and why Spain opened its borders to Jewish refugees from the Holocaust.\\"The irrefutable fact remains that, although the presence of Jews placed the whole country at risk of being drawn into another ar or occupied by Hitler's forces, Fascist Spain, both officially and unofficially, accepted thousands of foreign Ashkenazic Jews within its borders and allowed them to remain until they were able to secure residence elsewhere.\\"Why? The question is probably unanswerable, though Alexy tries her best. Guilt over the expulsions of 1492? Maybe, but this does not account for the welcome to Ashkenazic, as well as Sephardic, Jews. Maybe Franco had Jewish ancestors? There's no proof of that. A political decision in case the Allies won? Perhaps, but in a country devastated economically by the Civil War, Spain gave much. One interesting suggestion is that because of the expulsion, and the concomitant absence of a Jewish population, Spain did not develop the kind of anti-Semitic attitudes seen in other European countries.Whatever the reason, the fact remains that thousands owe their lives to an official blind eye, and open Spanish arms.Alexy begins by explaining her quest, her need to understand her own family history that sent her to Spain, and to the New York archives of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (\\"the Joint\\"), the organization that was responsible for helping stateless Jewish refugees in Spain. She interviews several people who found, or whose parents found, a haven across the Pyrenees, and in the section called \\"The Rescuers\\" she writes of those, Jews and non-Jews, who provided the means to safety. People such as Lisa Fittko, who acted as a guide, and Ren&eacute;e Reichmann, who from Tangier arranged material support, and Spanish diplomats who told the Gestapo, \\"these are our Jews\\" and taught the children a few words of Spanish in case they should be challenged.The next two parts seemed to me as though they should be in a different book. \\"The Reformers\\" writes of present-day liberalization of Spanish laws and attitudes about non-Catholics (not merely Jews). It's interesting but although it touches on some theories as to why Spain helped, it is really more focused on the present and seems out of place.The same is true of the final section, about contemporary Marranos and other \\"secret Jews\\". This is a huge topic about which a whole book could, and should (and probably has, I'll have to look) be written. In fact, the subtitle of this book suggests that that's what it's about. But it isn't.Either this book should have been much longer, and made into a history of Spain and the Jews (and that would be a seriously long book!), or it should have been shorter, and the last two parts saved to become another book or books.But those are quibbles. This is a fascinating, and very personal, discussion of an unexpected and little-known part of the Holocaust."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"Highly-readable account of Spain's indirect role during the Holocaust as many Jews sought escape to the West through Spain. There are interesting portraits of both the rescued and rescuers, with additional chapters on modern Spanish Jews and Marranos or Crypto-Jews of Spanish descent. Alexy did a great service bringing these stories to our attention as very few have thought of Jews in Spain beyond the Inquisition."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"Once you read this book,the title makes sense.

Lot's of interviews in this book regarding that perticular era. What a twist for Spain!Excellent Read!"},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"Strange title, but it makes sense once you read the book. The author describes her personal journey in search of her Jewish roots, cut off when she left Prague. As a refugee she remained in Barcelona for two years. Survivors of nazi persecution who were saved by the lenient attitude of Spanish authorities at the time of Franco's dictatorship give their testimony. Evidence from Jewish international organizations is also given. The author then narrates the plight for survival of the &quot;marranos&quot; after the expulsion edict. Interesting reading, the author aims at exalting the attitude of Spain and its people. Further study and investigation is required, you might ask whether there are no survivors to narrate the other side of the story."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"This is a good book, all the stories gathered and told really paint the picture of what people went through trying to escape the Holocust, and how Spain really did help them."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"This book shows readers how Spain and the Spanish people contributed to save the lives of thousand of jews, particularly during the Second World War.

Perhaps they didn't read the whole book. Of the book's 305 pages, the author gives us her own truly interesting story in only 59 pages. It contributes to the book in that she sets the stage, gives us some pertinent European history, and describes the psychological dynamics of the \\"hidden Jew.\\" We are then treated to fascinating and often startling stories of refugees who escaped into Spain, followed by snapshots of the amazing work of their rescuers in Spain and Tangier. Then we read about \\"the reformers\\" in Spain: Jews and Christians in Spain working to change attitudes. She winds up with a section on Crypto-Jews--on the Iberian Peninsula as well as in the American Southwest--and this is where we realize the value of her personal experience as a \\"hidden Jew.\\"Throughout this well-written and thoroughly readable book we are treated to first-person tales by the often elderly people that she has sought out. They tell us of events in Spain that could have been too easily forgotten by history, had not Alexy taken the trouble to find these people and publish their words. In these pages we find the full drama of escaping Nazi persecution exposed.We learn that, counter to all expectations, Spain was often the only safe refuge for Jews fleeing from the Nazis. Alexy explores the question of \\"Why Spain?\\" given that Spain was the instigator of the Inquisition 500 years before. The answers people give her are thought-provoking--and indeed it is likely that there was a combination of factors that induced Franco as well as the Spanish police and citizens to turn a blind eye or even to help, as so many did, Jews escape suffering and death.I do have one quibble: the Jews escaped over the southern Pyrenees, putting them in Catalonia, especially Barcelona. Thus their saviors were not simply \\"Spanish\\": they were Catalan. The Catalan people were no friends of Franco. Liberals, they were persecuted and oppressed by Franco's fascist regime. They would not have been inclined to persecute anyone running from fascists (the Nazis) or to obey Franco even if he had given in to Hitler's demands to hand over the Jews. Perhaps this important dynamic should have been mentioned."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"I read this book around the same time I read an article in Smithsonian magazine about a genetic study conducted in the Southwestern United States. It found Jewish roots in an amazingly high number of Hispanic people, many of whom were not only members of the Catholic church, but were priests and other titled dignitaries, throughout many generations. This gene pool naturally also had a great deal of native American blood. My fascination with the phenomenon was thus so heightened that I found this book to be a captivating read from the outset.I don't mind personal accounts in a book like this. The author chose to highlight the emotional components of these discoveries instead of writing a thorough historical account. Given the brevity of the book, one wouldn't necessarily expect a treatise. I was profoundly moved, and one should be able to find more academic texts on the topic should one want to explore further.What strikes me most is that the more specifically scientists are enabled to trace our genes,, the more proof comes to light of our interwoven and ever organic connections with one another regardless of where we are.As far as irony about sympathy from Spain toward the Jews during WWII in contrast to the Inquisition, there are enough centuries separating those generations to at least appreciate lives saved in the more recent goaround. Let's celebrate the incidences of noble behavior the all-to-few times it happens in this world.Finally, as far as the title, it grabbed my attention. It didn't need to be explicated; it's a lovely metaphor in itself."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"this was required for a book club.

So I bought the book.When I started reading it, I found myself astonished to be unable to put it down. I finished it in just a couple of days.After that, everytime I had a friend announce an upcoming trip to Spain I would give her or him a copy of this book. I could never bear to \\"loan\\" my copy for fear of never getting it back. I had never been interested in visiting Spain myself but after reading this book a trip to Spain became a high priority ambition.I won't say anything about the contents because other reviewers have done that so well and in such depth. But I will say that although I probably read two hundred books a year, I have never forgotten this book and many of its details. And now that many of people are getting their genetic histories \\"done\\" and discovering unknown Jewish histories for themselves, this book has gained new value on top of that already discussed.If you have a chance, a happy chance, to find a copy of this book, read it. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"This was recommended for our book club to read. The majority of members were disappointed as it is very narrow in scope and repetitive. The first portion appears to be the author's attempt to heal herself psychologically (less a discovery of spiritual heritage than of her \\"self\\"); the second is mostly biographies of people who had experiences similar to hers. So after the first few, our members pointed out, it was just the same story with different names.I had hoped for more history, since the subtitle is \\"Marranos and other Secret Jews,\\" but there was none of that. Really, it should have been \\"Crypto-Jews of the Holocaust in Spain,\\" if you want accuracy. She never really explained what \\"The Mezuzzah in the Madonna's Foot\\" means; we had to interpret. The book is well-written, but could have done better with some more aggressive editing, a different perspective, and a more accurate title (at least, one that relates more directly to the contents, instead of appearing to belong to a different book on the same topic). There are other books on the history of crypto-Jews or Conversos that people can read if they are really interested in the history, instead of just a bunch of Holocaust-era biographies."},{"Title":"The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot: Marranos and Other Secret Jews--A Woman Discovers Her Spiritual Heritage","review":"wonderful revelation of a subculture... and a new angle on the history of Spain and its Jews.

Right off the bat: beware of this very cheap, glued-together pulp-paperback. It is this sort of book that may very well make good books affordable; it also makes them unforgivably fragile. I can't believe my copy remains almost like new.I must say, I feel the verbose title of this book does not exactly describe its true subject. And I have no qualms about expressing my absolute hatred of the term MARRANO. To put it into one line: this book deals with the positive role Spain and the Spanish played in saving Jews from the Holocaust. To which you might exclaim, \\"WHAAAAAT?!!!\\"Trudi Alexy has anticipated you. Beginning with her autobiography (with its centerpiece being her family's escape from the Holocaust and her discovery that they were Jews), Alexy takes us through her depression, survivor's guilt and spiritual pain as she struggled to come to terms with being Jewish. While this section frankly drags a great deal, I suspect it was Alexy's therapy.I just can't understand why she has to inflict it upon the reader.She covers a great deal of ground, and quite well. Sketches of a few survivors, a few Gentile heroes, how her research trips to Spain and other places helped her, and the addressing of Crypto Jews and Conversos in America, Alexy skillfully spins out a sometimes dizzying array of stories, haunting memories and flashes of Spain. Not many writers can take you smoothly from Nachman's debate to the Expulsion to King Juan Carlos' pro-Jewish policies.Yet I find that is a bit of a problem with this book. It is top-heavy, laden with a few too many personal details that sometimes seem to be ploys of escape rather than non-fiction at its finest. If you are skilled at skimming past a writer's eccentricities, you'll do fine with this. The first time I tried to read it and flung it away in frustration. I am glad I gave it a second chance.Alexy was way ahead of her time, also, in her brief sketch of the Crypto-Jews and Conversos of America and Mexico. She teaches more of that history here than in a whole other book I own that is exclusively about the Expulsion. It is a shame Alexy does not write that way more often here. Some of the individuals' personal stories can drag. However, the book redeems itself with little anecdotes, Jewish gems as I like to call these true tales - some only a few lines long.This is an important book and not to be ignored on any account. Especially if you find yourself, as I once did long ago, \\"suddenly Jewish\\" and unsure what to do about it."},{"Title":"3-D Atlas of Stars and Galaxies","review":"The book uses the traditional red/green images with special glasses in order to produce the 3-D effects. Some poeple may have trouble getting used to this (if you are not good at looking at 3-D objects using red/green glasses, then this is not the book for you). The trick is to stare at it for a long while and to make sure you have the book far away enough so that the whole page can be viewed by either eye. If you do this, the images can be spectacular (though after a while, the novelty starts to wear off a little). It would have been nice if they also had 3-D shots of nebula as well as our solar system. Images of the galaxy can be confusing as they use a weird coding system of characters. I wish they would have used another technology to makes the images 3-D (assuming it is possible), so that the colors of the stars could be more accurately represented. Definately a try before you buy book as some people will like it, others may not. Perhaps it makes a good book to put in the library or a local book club (assuming you can make sure nobody steals the glasses). I would have given this book 3.5 stars if possible (unfortunately, I can only give 3 or 4 stars)."},{"Title":"Yellow","review":"1998 is the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Maine and the Spanish-American War, instigated, many still say, by William Randolph Hearst. &quot;Yellow&quot; (for yellow journalism) recounts the period leading to the Maine's sinking through the first-person fictional account of Ambrose Bierce, the legendary American artist and writer, as he traveled to Cuba on Hearst's payroll.

If you are interested in spirituality, particular in Scotland, you must get this book!"},{"Title":"Carmina Gadelica: Hymns & Incantations","review":"The number of books on Celtic spirituality in the past ten years is stultifying. The inane banalities poured out in most of these books is paralleled only by the repititiousness of most of their contents.This book, however, is the real thing. These poems were collected in the last century by Alexander Carmichael in his work in the Scottish highlands. They truly display the sense of closeness to the earth, and closeness to God, in daily life that is the hallmark of Celtic spirituality, and as expected in a collection of poems from the poor and humble, there is not a speck of pretension in any of it. The book has been a minor classic in its own field ever since it was first published, and now it is finally getting the widespread recognition it deserves.My only regret is that this version doesn't include the Gaelic versions that Carmichael collected alongside the English translation; I believe that the original edition included these. If you're burned out on the absurdities of Celtic spirituality which are served up by the truckload nowadays, this book will give you your faith back."},{"Title":"Carmina Gadelica: Hymns & Incantations","review":"This is NOT a another modern book about the ancient traditions of &quot;Celtic Spirituality&quot;. I, for one, am extremely grateful. This is a collection of traditional prayers and incantations used by the Gaelic speakers living in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. These &quot;poems&quot; are simple, sparse, superstitous and incredibly beautiful. When Carmichael documented these in the 1800's, the Gaelic culture and its belief systems were quickly dying out amidst a wave of modernisation, protestantism and urban flight. These poetic artifacts are a true window on the beliefs, hopes, fears and superstitions of the pre-modern world. Many of these were used to ritualize common daily tasks. These chants find the sublime in the pedestrian, in a way that is completely devoid of self-conciousness. The poems in this collection are unique and priceless. Carmichael did a wonderful thing in preserving these gems for future generations. If you are interested in understanding the unromanticized and complicated truth of the spiritual side to Gaelic culture, this is indispensible.

At that time, the threat was real from bookburners such as the CIA(remember the Penkovsky Papers?). Apparently, such groups have been successful in labeling this account as &quot;occult&quot;.

Can be viewed as a work of fiction, yet also as a work of fact. Fact of the kind that's stranger than fiction.

To illustrate, who could have suggested (before 1961, its publication year) that India and South Africa would acquire the A-bomb? Yet Pauwels &amp; Bergier make no claim to being prophets. If, at first reading, you fail to find the promised enchantment, come back to it a few years later ... after you've lived a little more ...

It was translated from the French though a number of French phrases have not been translated. As the authors state--p. 177: \\"Our book, we repeat, will doubtless contain a lot of nonsense, but that is of no importance if it inspires some reader with a sense of vocation and, to a certain extent, opens up new and wider paths for research.\\" This is indubitably true--just like other brainstorming sessions. Still it's a fun read even today and does suggest a number of interesting things such as some geniuses/psychics being well ahead of their time--though I wonder why da Vinci was left out. Much of the book describes weird bases for Hitler's activities--a set of illogical rationales IMHO (e.g. Horbiger's Eternal Ice and the Hollow Earth ideas). But, pp. 336-7: they think superstitions have psychic origins--perhaps in some cases, but they might also consider ceremonial & symbolic magic rites or small samples of personal experience that get reified over time. As they say themselves, pp. 368-9: \\"Most men prefer images to facts...the childish part of their intelligence which believe in images and legends.\\" [e.g. stopping the sun/walking on water]. They apparently are not the exception.SECRET SOCIETIESThey seem to have a major problem (perhaps due to a Catholic background?) with secret societies and other religions (esp. Eastern ones)--calling them pagan and neo-pagan. p. 220: They compare Hitler's hallucinogenic (insane?) experience with the Order of the Golden Dawn saying they're both pagan and therefore comparable--this is, of course, nonsense! [The Templar Tradition in the Age of Aquarius]. They even say that the Rosicrucian Order is neo-pagan which is utter nonsense and seem to believe that just because some people are members of two different groups the groups must be affiliated. Further they state that p. 221: \\"The modern Rosy Cross, Golden Dawn, the German Vril Society...were more or less closely associated with the powerful and well-organized Theosophical Society\\" and they equate the Nazi superman myth with the Eastern religious leaders/living masters. I doubt the stories of these masters are literally true, but they are certainly as believable as the stories the authors tell of planetary visitations (though they deny them later in the book--p. 359). Furthermore, p. 221: the Theosophical Society \\"provided a link between certain oriental Satanism and the West. They obviously don't know much about Easter religions if they think that they're Satanic--the modern idea of Satan is basically a Catholic invention--Eastern religions as far as I can determine (though older than Christianity) have no Satan at all. Buddhism doesn't even have an anthropomorphic creator God--except in an old myth that their religious leaders are embarrassed to mention--and Gautama Buddha refused to discuss metaphysics. Christianity is an extremely syncretic religion, yet the authors' seem to jump to extraordinary conclusions if a secret society borrows ideas from other secret societies or from Eastern religions.COMPUTERSTheir view of computers (admittedly 1/2 century ago) is appalling. They say computers pp. 330-1: can do all cases & possibilities as if they were infinitely fast, violating the non-allness principle and p. 335: say that the human brain is binary but computers are \\"analogical.\\" I submit that there are precious few binaries in the natural world; most of them are artificial--and computers are the prime example. Further p. 337: I'd say that human binary thinking is learned, not genetic as they claim. I'm not sure what they mean by analogical--there used to be analog computers, but I think they mean that computers do analogies. This is nonsense--they're programmed. The only cases possibly qualifying for this would be advanced types of Artificial Intelligence that didn't exist in their time. They want people to be more like computers whereas scientists are trying to make computers more like human brains!POLITICSThey claim that some Tibetan Buddhists were a part of Hitler's group of philosophers or whatever you might call this cadre. I don't know, but having studied Buddhism and met the Dalai Lama, no one could be farther from Hitler than he is. This seems like a rather fantastic claim though it's certainly possible that a few extremist Buddhists were in Germany. Even if this were so, it's hardly enough to make sweeping conclusions about Buddhism. Further, they say that p. 262: \\"There are no essential differences in the ultimate aim of two civilizations such as the USSR & the USA.\\" How nonsensical can you get? One was a conformity-oriented country imposing totalitarian Communism on its citizens, the other is a country pursuing (at least in the beginning and theoretically in the present) individual liberty as written in the Bill of Rights etc. Be serious.QUOTESNonetheless the book contains a number of valuable quotations from other people such as:p. 37: Berthelot attacked the philosophers--'fencing with their own ghosts in the solitary field of abstract logic.'p. 64: Wolfgang Pauli--I envisage a method whose aim would be to reconcile contraries in a synthesis incorporating a rational understanding and a mystical experience of their unity.p. 84: Jean-Henri Labourdette--Joubert was right when he remarked that nothing makes men so impudent and conceited as ignorance of the past and scorn for old books. [~George Santayana]In addition, they provide some pithy quotable sentences of their own:p. 82: many scientific discoveries were actually discovered long before but not widely disseminated [supporting the timing theory of history vs. great man theory]p. 92: History does not repeat itself. Or, rather, if it does pass the same point, it does so on a higher level of the spiral.p. 128: The modern alchemist is a man who reads treatises on nuclear physics.p. 394: The human mind is incessantly progressing towards higher and higher levels of abstraction.The Films of Charles & Ray Eames - The Powers of 10 (Vol. 1)]SUMMARYAs the authors describe p. 276: \\"A fairly powerful little machine for confounding fact and fiction,\\" andp. 296: \\"When reason sleeps, it brings forth monsters.\\" This book epitomizes these statements. So, overall, it does provide food for thought and some very interesting information. It's also a fun read full of unbridled speculation. Unfortunately, it includes quite a number of biased and foolish statements which greatly detract from its impact and what faith the reader might place on the book's contents."},{"Title":"The Morning of The Magicians","review":"This is much more than a book.

I am midway through the book, and I am enjoying it immensely as a mental exercise, although I don't take it as a document of history by any means. That's not really what it is; what it is is a book that presents various speculative ideas about various topics and, at least to this reader, performs this presentation with lively, earnest writing that is a delight to read. It's also engaging because of many of the questions it asks, even if they don't lead to verifiable conclusions. What I am taking away from this manuscript more than anything else is: why not? Overall, it challenges today's common knowledge with examples of yesterday's common knowledge that proved to be naive or ignorant and, in the end, wrong.

This book is old school because it assumes a high level of reader intelligence--for example, it gives quite a few foreign language quotes without providing a translation.The way this book is written reads like two folks sitting down together and speculating about far out topics.

S. HaldaneQuit thy childhood, my friend, and wake up! -Jean-Jacques RousseauAbsolutely mind-expanding! In this book, the authors expound a thesis of &quot;fantastic realism&quot; and explore the mind, not in the subconscious or conscious states but in what they believe to be ultraconsciousness. The book is able to cover virtually every topic from atomic energy, to secret societies of alchemists, to the influence of the occult upon Hitler, to parapsychology and consciousness, and finally to the upcoming superman - a mutant capable of astounding intellectual feats. The authors cite numerous previous explorers: Rene Guenon, Teilhard de Chardin, Carl Jung, Charles Fort, Gurdjieff, and the work of mathematicians, especially Cantor's theory of the transfinite. Bizarre theories are considered: Horbiger's theory of &quot;eternal ice&quot; (and it's influence on Hitler), Teed's theory that we live on the concave inner surface of a hollow earth, theories to explain the origins of civilization, the work of the alchemists and their possible knowledge of atomic physics, theories regarding mutation of the human species, and theories propounding alternative origins for life on this planet. The authors are able to consider all of this and put it together in a coherent whole, under the idea of &quot;fantastic realism&quot;. They dare to ask such questions as: Are we all in a collective conspiracy to hide the truth, is science such a conspiracy? Do secret societies exist and do they have an influence upon history? What special knowledge did the ancients possess that we may not possess now? What role did secret societies play in the origins of Nazism, and in the Nazi Black Order? How were the Nazis able to rise to power and what did such a phenomenon represent amidst our modern world? What is the historical meaning of the atomic bomb? What does the future promise for our civilization? And, Do supermen live amongst us men, and if so, have they always? Hypotheses are put forth in answer to all these questions. The authors reject a magical worldview and they also reject the narrow confines of scientific positivism. However, they consider it necessary to keep an open mind when examining these phenomena, and they refer to themselves as &quot;barbarians&quot; seeking to search out a scientific explanation to be imposed on the fantastic. The book is simply amazing, and truly life-affirming. You MUST read it! Not just to understand yourself and your world, but also to understand your future. You will never be able to perceive things in the exact same light again. Get this book and discover the mysteries of the world for yourself! :)"},{"Title":"The Morning of The Magicians","review":"The least i could say about this wondrous book is that it's the closest you'll come to a mind-altering experience without chemical substances. From that on, this is a jaw-dropping read, and it's kinda difficult to summarise what it professes except if i put it on terms such as: &quot;it examines all those sides of 'reality' for which we have solid evidence of the existence thereof but because of a variety of reasons we refuse to acknowledge&quot;.Now, I know this sounds vague, but when you come across a book that deals with such a spectrum of topics such as alchemy, politics, the paranormal, history, secret societies, origins of certain philosophies, magic, the roots of nazism, UFOs, conspiracies, etc, there is no simpler way to surmise it.This is easily one of those books that leave you a different person once you're done reading them, not in the way certain &quot;self-help&quot; books claim they do, but in the sense that it works like a massive curtain being pulled infront of you and a whole new picture being revealed behind it.There's no bibliography included at the end of it (allthough, through its pages, several books are mentioned as sources) but for those well-delved into the topics it discusses it's obvious that the scholarship involved here is impeccable.And apropos &quot;sources&quot;, this is exactly the biggest contribution of this book, the fact that it actually functions like a tremendous reference book, leading you eventually to other books of which you'd probably remain unaware had you not seen the sourcing here. It's more or less like a simply coded lexicon for those interested in diving well below the surface, for restless minds who suspect that &quot;this can't be all there is&quot;, a multi-key to unopened doors inside and outside ourminds.Being all that (and more), you'd expect a &quot;heavy read&quot;, a book written in wooden academic language, but this is far from being the case: &quot; The Morning of the Magicians&quot; is laid out in down-to-earth language and you won't be disturbed during your reading by trying to comprehend the sentences but instead you'll be left with the bare essence. You'll need only comprehend the concepts.Published originally in the 60s, and having accomplished a notorious reputation since then, it reads like what Charles Fort would sound as, if he were a scientist. And, even that description doesn't do it complete justice.Absolutely essential for those who search..."},{"Title":"The Morning of The Magicians","review":"This is a manifesto calling for a new conception of humanity's place in the universe. If that sounds pretty grand, well, this book appeared in the sixties... The French authors, columnist Louis Pauwels and physicist Jacques Bergier, feel that \\"Cartesian reason does not cover the whole of man or the whole of his knowledge\\" and are calling for an optimistic, mystical philosophy of modernism that they call Fantastic Realism.This is one of my favorite books, and is the progenitor for most of the \\"New Age\\" literature that was to appear decades later, from the 1970's through the '90's. The authors (Pauwels, really) assert that homo sapiens is not a mechanistic clock-work operating within the limits of Nature, but is instead on a journey of progressive evolution towards cosmic interconnectedness. A key assertion is that it is possible to understand the most complex aspects of reality through an expanded state of awareness, without plodding through the limited and sometimes inaccurate scientific method.The book presents a great deal of esoterica, which often obfuscates the authors' intention, which is to call for \\"Reason ... pushed to extreme limits ... operating on a higher level, linking up with the mysteries of the mind and spirit, the secrets of energy and universal harmony.\\"It's easy to confuse this book with compilations of the occult or unexplained, like \\"Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious World\\" or \\"Ripley's Believe It Or Not\\". Actually, like Colin Wilson's \\"The Occult\\", \\"Le Matin des Magiciens\\" is speculatively considering such ideas with the aim of inspiring the reader to question reductionist theories of reality. The book is non-clerical but spiritual call to embrace modernism, and all the possibilities it represents, rather than reject it."},{"Title":"The Morning of The Magicians","review":"I first read this book back in the late 70's, and it was a classic back then. As far as I know, it's been out of print for a very long time, but led an active \\"retirement\\" via book swaps and used book sales.The authors touch upon hundreds of different subjects and events, weaving an occult history of the world, liberally seasoned with speculations, asides and suggestions.Anyone who has ever had the feeling that there's more to the world than what's readily apparent needs to read this book. This book will be especially valuable to those who want to educate themselves in occult matters, as it provides several very good starting points to further research."},{"Title":"The Morning of The Magicians","review":"One of the most thought provoking and enlightened (if not unconventionally Gallic) examinations into the minds and motivations of post modern tyranny that you will ever read. This book literally abounds with new perspectives into the dark recesses of the Third Reich and it's principle architects and poses a number of uncomfortable questions about how such a sinister and repressive ideology could take hold so firmly in a modern, democratic state. A thoroughly compulsive read."},{"Title":"The Morning of The Magicians","review":"Co-authored by distinguished chemical engineer Bergier. Can be viewed as a work of fiction, yet also as a work of fact. Fact of the kind that's stranger than fiction. First impression was that authors were an interesting pair of cranks, as geniuses often appear to be. To illustrate, who could have suggested (before 1961, its publication year) that India and South Africa would acquire the A-bomb? Yet Pauwels &amp; Bergier make no claim to being prophets. If, at first reading, you fail to find the promised enchantment, come back to it a few years later ... after you've lived a little more ... I think Pauwels and Bergier will help you see reality in all its strangeness. *Note: this book is out of print ... can something not be done about getting fresh copies into circulation? I've not been able to understand why something so simple seems so hard to do."},{"Title":"The Morning of The Magicians","review":"This is arguably the book that almost single handedly initiated the 1960's Occult revival and all the various schools of thought for good & ill that came from it. It certainly contributed to the resurgence of interest in Gurdjieff from a insulated teacher of movement & the Work to global mega-star of the consciousness movement. It also served to inspire a variety of \\"ancient astronaut\\" theorists including von Daniken and his ilk.After the seminal works of Charles Fort, this was the second generation bible of speculative thought on a grand scale. Long out of print, it is welcomed to see it back and available to a new generation of readers. Some of it will seem dated no doubt and at times a bit histrionic, yet this is the work that set many psychonauts on the path for the \\"other\\" wherever that may lead."},{"Title":"The Morning of The Magicians","review":"Great book, read it years ago and still looking for someone who sells it. Someone stole it form the library.It is about alchemy, hidden knowledge, and the promise that people with real knowledge are keeping it from the people who would abuse it.I agree, partially fiction, partially fact.A very Very interesting read.

Morning of the Magicians reads like a thriller and encourages its readers with hints and directions to build suspense. Readers who liked Holy Blood/Holy Grail should check this out..I found lots of mateerial I hadnt seen elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Morning of The Magicians","review":"This book, once an underground &quot;in&quot; book in the sixties has not lost any of its value as an inspiring approach to what history and science have woven together in the past. The preface by the authors alone has insights on fantastic realism alone worth a new re-print of this book."},{"Title":"The everlasting righteousness","review":"Rarely does profound theology find such eloquent expression as in this little book. Bonar reflects on the substitutionary atonement of Christ in a way that puts to shame the many &quot;devotional&quot; writers found today. The theology is precise and life changing, and beautiful as well. There is no sophistry here though. Just a man who loved true doctrine and had a gift with expression.Check out the many hymns he has written as well. Some of them are found in his book &quot;Longing for Heaven&quot;"},{"Title":"The everlasting righteousness","review":"Here is a book that scripturally explains the saving work of God in Christ Jesus and cuts through the false gospel of &quot;ask Jesus in your heart.&quot; One gets excited by reading such dynamic thoughts on salvation. This book and &quot;Justification by Faith Alone&quot; by Charles Hodge break through the unbiblical teachings concerning saving grace being propagated today."},{"Title":"The everlasting righteousness","review":"An excellent treatment of our righteousness in Christ. Chapter 8 is worth the price all by itself.\\"For the cross saves completely, or not at all. Our faith does not divide the work of salvation between itself and the cross. It is the acknowledgement that the cross alone saves, and it saves alone. Faith adds nothing to the cross nor to its healing virtue. It owns the fullness and the sufficiency and the suitableness of the work done there and bids the toiling spirit cease from its labours and enter into rest. Faith does not come to Calvary to do anything. It comes to see the glorious spectacle of all things done and to accept this completion without misgiving as to its efficacy. It listens to the \\"It is finished\\" of the sin-bearer and says \\"Amen!\\" Where faith begins, there labour ends--labour, I mean, for life and for pardon. Faith is rest, not toil. It is the giving up of all the former weary efforts.\\"And from chapter 2: \\"With a weak faith and a fearful heart, many a sinner stands before the altar. But it is not the strength of his faith, but the perfection of the sacrifice, that saves; and no feebleness of faith, no dimness of eye, no trembling of hand, can change the efficacy of our burnt-offering. The vigor of our faith can add nothing to it, nor can the poverty of it take anything from it. Faith, in all its degrees, still reads the inscription, 'The blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin;' and if at times the eye is so dim that it cannot read these words, through blinding tears or bewildering mist, faith rests itself on the certain knowledge of the fact that the inscription is still there, or at least that the blood itself (of which these words remind us) remains, in all its power and suitableness, upon the altar unchanged and unaffected.\\""},{"Title":"The everlasting righteousness","review":"At the time of this particular review there have already been four previous reviews of this work. It is suggested that any reader of this review should also note the other four, all of which whose comments I fully agree. One of the primary reasons for my review is to give a five-star rating to the Kindle e-book version (since it appears all previous reviews were based on the paperback version of this great work). This review is to assure any prospective buyer of the e-book version will be well satisfied. In fact, I think it is a 'must-read'. Since there is no active table of contents provided, it is suggested that on the initial reading of the text, the reader establish a table of contents with locations in a computer spread-sheet so as to facilitate later readings of this material."},{"Title":"The everlasting righteousness","review":"This is easily the very best treatment of the doctrine of Justification By Faith that I have read. Bonar treats a controversial and complex subject beautifully. He makes his points with clarity, amply supported by scripture. I am in my third reading and sensing no loss of enthusiasm for the subject or The Everlasting Righteousness. After failing to find the book available at outlets specializing in Christian Theology books, I resorted to the always dependable Amazon.com and was pleased to find it there at a bargain price. I have since purchased several copies for my brother."},{"Title":"The everlasting righteousness","review":"The most important question a man can ask is 'How shall a sinful man be made just with a Holy God?'. The fact that the Lord God justifies the ungodly is clearly laid out in the fifth chapter 'Righteousness For The Unrighteous'. This is done without compromising,relaxing or setting aside His righteous standard.Bonar's style could be described as devotional but is theologically accurate just as many of his beloved hymns,such as 'Not What My Hands Have Done'. The Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is so powerfully and clearly captured in that hymn for the ages.In chapter seven 'Not Faith But Christ' Pastor Bonar makes the important distinction that it is not faith itself that saves(that would make it man's work and would give some reason to boast). What faith does is unite one to the saving work of Christ(the righteousness of Christ)which any sinner needs to be saved. The author highlights this \\"Faith connects us with the righteousness ,and is therefore totally distinct from it.To confound the one with the other is to subvert the whole Gospel of the grace of God.\\"In chapter nine 'The Pardon And Peace Made Sure' and chapter ten 'The Holy Life Of The Justified' he is careful to separate justification and sanctification. Our justification is Christ for us-the laying down His life as our substitute,dying the death that we deserve and incurring the wrath which our sins deserve.We are justified not by anything in us or from us but through our Savior being made sin for us.Our sanctification is Christ in us-our working is the result of our believing.We do good works,submit to God's rule,conform our life to His Word,seek to love God and love our neighbor,not to be justified but because we have already been justified(through faith in the Lord Jesus).There must be Biblical discernment(the ability to distinguish between things that differ) as it relates to justification and sanctification.They are both part of God's saving work but we are not saved by our sanctification(good works will be the necessary evidence of our justification).The Roman Catholic Church has historically taught that a person is justified by their sanctification.That is why in that system of teaching there can be no assurance of salvation because you never know when you've done enough works to be justified. That is not what the Word of God teaches.The Everlasting Righteousness puts justification and sanctification in their proper Biblical perspective.The Gospel is clearly and plainly presented.This book is an excellent evangelistic tool to place in the hands of those who are ignorant of the GOSPEL OF THE GRACE OF GOD."},{"Title":"Presidents","review":"The author, Stephen R. Graubard, now retired, has been assistant professor of history at Harvard and professor of history at Brown University. As a young scholar, he was invited by Eleanor Roosevelt to attend the last inauguration of FDR on the lawn of the White House in 1945.The book is readable, with a compact style; a tour de force of all the Presidents from Teddy Roosevelt to George W. Bush. It is a page-turner from the beginning. Excellent overview with all the major details is included, and, although there is no bibliography, don't forget the footnotes in the back, which are filled to overflowing with more information so detailed, so excellently researched, and not to be missed. Great overview for the beginning reader of presidential drama in the Oval Office and the bedroom. Of course, readers who do some fact-checking in the footnotes, can discern difficulties with some of his conclusions. Many other reviewers also accurately point out that he is very dismissive of most of the presidents, both Democratic and Republican. It is because he seemed to dwell so much on the negative aspects of each president, I rated it with only 4 stars."},{"Title":"Out of my later years","review":"I bought this book in my early twenties still unsure of what to do with my life but at least certain of the fundamentals and morals with which one should follow. Einsteins prose on life, morality, religion, science, personalities are words which echo the wisdom of many years and the experiences which have shaped them. Now, 7 years later, I pick up this book, and am reminded of a man who knew that the future is uncertain, but with the the search for truth and compassion, it could be a great place.This book is a great read - I admire how a man who's thoughts were so complicated, yet simple at the same time. He did not forget where he came from , nor forgot that which is truly significant. And that which drives humanity is not in the theories of relativity, but in our simple acts of humanity.This book encompasses an era of 1934 - 1950, yet its prose is timeless - even now! Occum's razor wuld be proud."},{"Title":"Out of my later years","review":"Einstein was not just a famous scientist. As this book reveals, he was also a profound and well-written author.

I was pleasantly surprised with this book. Many books just spend a lot of time repeating random words or tediously try to explain the very complicated Russian grammar BEFORE you even get to start speaking the language. What I liked about this book is that it teaches you these things but through a realistic, written dialogue. They use many cognants (words that sound the same in both langauges) to start you off and have a handy vocab key next to the dialogue in case you cannot figure something out. The grammar and reading comprehension activities following the dialogue are thorough. I also like how the chapters of the book are divided up by theme or topic rather than grammatical concepts. You will, however, get much more out of the book if you have the accompanying cds."},{"Title":"Colloquial Russian (Colloquial Series)","review":"I am currently using this set (book and CD set) for a class, and it has been pretty good, so far. It's set in a way where one is not jumping from place to place in the learning of Russian grammar, like textbooks I have used in the past. The book gives a little bit of help in learning Russian, step-by-step, showing grammar, dialogues one may encounter, and exercises that aid in learning.The only (and minor) gripes I have with the book are merely aesthetic. It is written for an English (UK) reader. In other words, the English translations are more British than American. It's not a terrible problem, but translations for an American (like myself) do sometimes sound odd. There are many examples. The other is that it is Moscow-centric. I know many people will probably be going to Moscow or through Moscow on trips, and Moscow is a major tourist destination, but my personal urge is to go to St Petersburg, a place I have learned about immensely. I wish the English-to-Russian dictionary was larger. These are only based on opinion, which doesn't detract from how much Russian I have learned by using it.Get the DVD/Book set, which comes in a plastic case. Listening to a foreign language is important to the learning of a foreign language.A good teaching set, too.4 1/2 of 5 for the book, and, with the CD, 5 stars."},{"Title":"Colloquial Russian (Colloquial Series)","review":"This book does a very good job of condensing the Russian Language into practical, usable dialogue.

It's a great deal!"},{"Title":"Colloquial Russian (Colloquial Series)","review":"The book would have been great, but for one very annoying fact. Often the text is stuck together. You will get two, possibly three Russian words stuck together with no space between them. This is the case with the kindle version. I don't know how Amazon can sell a product with such an elementary error."},{"Title":"Colloquial Russian (Colloquial Series)","review":"Learning a foreign language is always interesting, but when you get to the country in question there's a considerable period of adjustment during which you have to acquire all the vernacular phrases that aren't in the text books. In general, educated people use less slang and colloquial phrases than uneducated people but there's always a learning curve. This book helps a bit, at least as far as conversations with people in their 30s to 60s is concerned. For the younger set, the pace of change is such that no book will be a reliable guide for very long. Most interesting, at leaet from my perspective, is the added insight you get into a culture when you try to acquire some vernacular. In such cases language really does reflect attitude and experience. Just don't be surprised if some of the phrases you learn turn out to sound quite antiquated to today's resident of Sankt-Peterburg or Moscow.

I do not spoil.This was a very interesting and at times a very difficult read, in terms of the look of a deranged mind. Too many drugs, something I myself dipped into awhile ago.Poor Horselover Fat,(gotta love those names he comes up with) who is our narrator. In March of 1974, Horselover was shot and blinded by a great beam of pink light; which can only be god, for whatever the mind does not understand, then it must be god. Or maybe hes just crazy as a bat. He believes the beam of light was from god, and he received incredible amounts of information, and now believes he knows all about life and the universe. Thus the exodus begins. Horselover is grief stricken by the loss of the two most important woman in his life, Gloria, his ex-wife, Sherri, a woman with terminal cancer who wishes nothing but to die and his wife Beth who left him and took their son Christopher away. Everyone he ever loved has abandoned him, and now with the information from the beam of light, he has written his own exegesis, trying to find out if our creator exists or maybe we just live in a irrational world with no time or space.Horselover and his friends, Kevin, David, and a guy named Phil, (huh), try to find out the true meaning of life through a film called VALIS.Obviously, this novel deals with PKD's own experience with drugs and it shows. The way he explains the human mind is fascinating by this mad genius(Dick.)Perhaps if your a Theology major, you'll get much more out of this story than I did, but if not, its still a mesmerizing and macabre piece of writing that with every page brings such depth and life to these charachters who live in the prison of their psychotic minds.In this, the second book of the VALIS trilogy, we are treated with four fantastic and unusual characters in;Herb Asher, Rybys Rommey, Elias Tate and a mysterious and important child, Emmanuel.PKD writes these characters in a way so that you feel for them, plus he delves into their personas in two separate realities(upper and lower realms). But which one is real? In one reality, the world is governed by two parties, the CIC: The Christian Islamic Church and the Scientific Legate. Asher is an audio expert who sends music throughout the Sol System. When he comes in contact with Rybys Rommey, they learn that she has child and yet is still a virgin. Rybys, carrying the rebirth of Christ must be smuggled to Earth for medical attention and Herb has signed on as the father.An unfortunate rocket-ship crash has put Herb in Cryonic suspension waiting for a spleen and has killed Rybys, although, Emmanuel, miraculously survived. Manny is taken under supervision by Elias Tate, who takes Manny to a special school, where we meet Zina, a small girl who knows many things and has been many people. Manny and Zina learn a lot from each other as she coaches Manny back into remembering who he really is, or was?And the question of course of, What is 'VALIS'?Yet we meet these people again later in the book in another reality. Which I thought to be executed brilliantly by Dick, even shaking up the reader a little which he is so well known for.Written with great character development, fantastic dialogue, morbid fantasy and his thoughts on theology and philosophy, alternate realities, and even Armageddon itself. An Experience more then just a read, and hard to put down. Equally as good as \\"VALIS\\".The conclusion to the \\"VALIS\\" trilogy was not what I expected it to be, as far as the events ending with \\"The Divine Invasion\\"(the second book)is concerned. Though still highly entertaining, and thought out with interesting characters that are out of there minds, literally.Coming from my perspective, the book delved into some heavy material that got to me pretty good, I would have to put it down sometimes before I could digest what I had just read pertaining to myself. Perhaps there are sections of this book that everyone can relate to or maybe not.PKD's commentary and thoughts on philosophy, theology, the drug fried brain and the schizophrenic are all here, making for mind boggling humor and at times, a tough read, in terms of 'Mental Illness\\"The book is told from the perspective of Angel Archer, the Bishop Timothy Archers daughter in law. A graduate of Cal, she spends her life as a student in San Francisco. Now Angel is a widow, her husband, Jeff, the son of the bishop has committed suicide.This book is basically a very dark, sad and lonely read. And as the bishop and his new fling, Kirsten(psycho)search for the proof that Jesus did was taught the ways of God 200 years before the birth of Christ. All the while taking Angel down the deep dark hole of insanity from the only people she ever cared about.This is a 5 star journey into three books that will open and boggle your mind, and may make you go insane with doubt and questions about not only the characters but \\"Yourself\\"."},{"Title":"The Valis Trilogy","review":"So far I've finished Valis and am halfway through The Divine Invasion. Valis is excellent and makes this buy well worth it, regardless of the quality of the other two. On its own I give it 5 stars.

I am a graphic artist studying for my Master's degree in the field and one of my professors kept making constant references to a book called \\"Enciclopedia de S&iacute;mbolos\\". I bought this one from Amazon.com by mistake, thinking it was the one he kept talking about, however my surprise was great when I found out that this one is better!Organized like a true dictionary, and meant to be used like one, you simply look up whatever symbol you're interested in and you get an explanation of what it means from the shape, its historical context, some cultural information; it's just an amazing resource for someone who simply needs to find out a meaning of something or if you're designing a logo or some other graphic and would like to know if your concept is a good match for what you're doing as per the unconscious meaning it transmits.I seriously recommend this book to anyone in my field who needs a resource for symbols, or for anyone with any interest in them. You'll find basic things such as circles, triangles, hexagrams (with a very interesting take on them that is totally new to me and that makes perfect sense), all the way to more concrete and ellaborate things such as specific animals or climate related things.

It gives a sense of the breadth of environmentalism today, while uniting all eight of the book's subjects in their resolve to fight against the overwhelming forces of anti-environmentalism found in our political and academic institutions today. Why is it so hard to fight to protect our planet? Because most of us see everything through the filter of economics which treats the environment as a commodity. Until leaders (political, educational, and spiritual) understand the importance of defending our environment, until they spread the word of living within the context of our environment, we are doomed to destroy ourselves.

When she tried to get a job as a reporter in New York, many newspapers turned her down because she was a woman. She convinced Joseph Pulitzer, the owner of a leading newspaper, to let her write a story about the poor care that the mentally ill received in New York. To do this, she pretended to have a mental illness and was locked away. Her story was a success. Not only was she hired as a reporter, but she was able to improve care for the mentally ill.Like other books in the ValueTales series, this book uses a real-life person to exemplify an important value. It is suitable for reading by children in the later elementary school grades. A \\"Historical Facts\\" section at the book's end summarizes Bly's life in a single-page bio form suitable for adults.Closing quote: \\"Nellie was very happy, and not only because she had won her race against time. She was happy because she knew that many people would now be treated more fairly because of what she had accomplished as a newspaper reporter. Think about it. Then ask yourself how fair you are in the way you treat others. Do you believe that fairness is important? Do you think it could make your life happier, too?\\" (p. 62)"},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"I'm half way through this book, but felt the need to write about how excellent it is.

But he writes in the New Yorker style (where he is a contributing editor), which means he remains relatively unemotional and unexciting. It's as if he works hard to remove any of the romance involved with the \\"unconventional\\" carriers which are his subject. The notion of riding many miles in a freight train is one that has always fascinated me, but somehow, McPhee makes it boring. Ditto for riding along on a riverboat, or a UPS flight, or an 18-wheeler. These tales should be exciting and gripping, but they're not. They're devoid of drama. They're devoid of the story-tellers ability to make something interesting. Does good writing have to be that dispassionate? McPhee relentlessly gives you fact after fact -- as another reviewer says he tells you a lot about things you didn't know you cared about. Unfortunately, he writes it in a monotone. Interesting, but you won't be staying awake reading this book."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"I was a little reluctant at first to start this book, thinking to myself \\"how interesting can a book about train engineers, truck drives, and barge pilots be?\\" But that is precisely McPhee's talent--being able to write interesting, insightful stories about ordinary things we see, and virtually ignore, every day.The book is a compilation of essays McPhee wrote about his experience riding in an eighteen wheeler, a train, a river barge, and his own canoe (and his experience at the UPS sorting facility). In each essay, McPhee shares very interesting insights from those who perform the jobs that our economy so heavily depends upon. He does an excellent job of sharing the knowledge he learned from each experience while intertwining interesting stories from the people he encounters. The net result is an excellent book that will be both educational and very entertaining.Upon finishing this book, I realized how insulated we are from the mechanisms that deliver us the things we depend on to live. We use tons of products each day, yet have very little idea of how they got to us. In a very interesting way, this book offers a glimpse into the lives of those who carry the products that keep our economy churning.I agree with some previous criticism that the chapter about his canoe trip on the Merrimack River, while interesting, is a little out of place. That chapter is more of a book review of Thoreau's work, but it does tie into the theme of \\"carriers\\" by discussing how these Eastern rivers were such important trade routes in the 1800s."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"Uncommon Carriers -- a book by John McPhee. Like all of McPhee's books, this one provides fascinating insights into a world we all take for granted. The author brings the subject to life and puts a human face on processes we tend to think of as mechanical. You will never look at a truck on the highway, a freighter coming into port, a UPS plane, or a freight train in the same way after you've read this book."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"The eclectic and readable McPhee strikes again in this engaging study of people engaged in unconventional forms of transportation. But the coverage of trucks, ships, and trains brings out what is truly great about McPhee - his ability to ruminate on other tangential matters, including little-known facts about the world's transportation systems and the real non-stereotypical people who operate them. This rambling and eclectic style is actually one of McPhee's most underappreciated strengths, as the reader barely notices how one chapter morphs from a down-home look at a Nova Scotia lobster farm to a scientific examination of the enormous UPS complex in Louisville. In one chapter McPhee also replicates a canoe trip once taken by Thoreau, and in the process also replicates Thoreau's penchant for literary flights of fancy while ruminating on transportation systems of long-gone eras. This book isn't quite as substantial or socially observant as some of McPhee's classics, but as usual he has delivered a very readable look at parts of the world that you know are there but haven't much thought about - and all with his dependable humor, literacy, and insight.

In addition to the tanker trade, the book reports McPhee's experiences and meditations on rail, freighter, barge, and air freight.At the center of the volume is McPhee's affectionate re-creation of Thoreau's \\"Five Days on the Merrimack and Concord Rivers\\" - a journey into the headwaters of McPhee's literary style."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"McPhee turns his reportorial talent to the complex U.S. transportation system and renders a dazzling display of detail and nuance about the elements of our lives we so often ignore -- the barges, tractor-trailers, planes and trains that deliver the stuff our society needs to keep churniing."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"I bought this book because I had read an excerpt about UPS and how they handle the massive amounts of packages and how they get them to the customer in a timely manner.

UPS stocks all Rolls Royce and Bentley parts including engines at a large warehouse, and can ship you what's needed overnight.Have you ever noticed those switch engines shuttling about in a railroad yard? Chances are there is no human aboard, and they are being operated by remote control. Find out how liquids are loaded into and out of large tanker trunks. Learn that reverse osmosis treated water leaves no marks when your eighteen wheeler goes through the truck wash. Is your attention beginning to wane with that last fact? Well, that's a bit of the problem with this book. You might find yourself beginning to fall asleep at the wheel of that tank truck, or the controls of your mile-and-a-half long coal train. The fun facts begin to get smaller and smaller as you go along. Or you can easily get sensory overload when you visit the pond in Switzerland where sea captains float around in scale model tankers. Close to a zillion facts about the complexity of ship handling are thrown at you. And they are the kind of facts that fly out of your head within 2 minutes of finishing the chapter. Then there is the chapter where he paddles a canoe up a river. This one provides you with a good chance to practice your speed reading skills.I have other books by Mr. McPhee, and he is generally an excellent writer.

We sat at the counter and the waiter came up to us with a fish in his hand. \\"You have to have the fish. Look at this. The boss picked it out at the market this morning. You have to have this.\\" After he walked away my boss told me that in our business I was going to be entrusted with other people's cargo. He said that as long as I treated that cargo, and my job, like that waiter treated that fish, I'd eventually learn how to do my job the right way. I could have quit then and there because I've probably never had a better lesson about how to do a job right than I got at that lunch. \\"Uncommon Carriers\\" is about a group of people who transport other people's cargo as if it were \\"their fish\\". It is a fascinating look at the people and methods by which we get food on our tables, heat in our furnaces and clothes on our back.I've admired McPhee since I read his wonderful overview of life in the liner shipping industry, \\"Looking for a Ship\\". He has a way of taking complicated processes or procedures that are little known to the general public and writing about them in a way that the general public, and even I, can understand. When it comes to describing the people who operate these machines, McPhee doesn't get in the way of the voice of his protagonists. He lets their natural eloquence come through.Uncommon Carriers begins and ends with a look at Don Ainsworth and his sixty-five foot, five-axle chemical tanker truck that carries all sorts of hazardous chemicals throughout the United States. Ainsworth treats his rig with the pride and concern a parent treats his or her first child. He makes sure it is immaculate and only uses filtered water to clean it. He prides himself on being able to navigate the steepest descents without resort to his brakes. Rather, like a chess player he plans his downshifting (over 18 gears) in such a way as to keep the rig at an appropriately safe speed. Next we travel to Grenoble, France where masters of huge containerships or tankers spend a week in an advanced simulation exercise using large models of their vessels that sharpen their skills as they navigate the world's oceans. As with Ainsworth, McPhee provides us with the voices of these international seamen as they dissect their performance. McPhee goes on to include chapters on a tug and barge-master moving a tremendous amount of tonnage on the narrow confines of the Illinois River; a walk through the enormous air cargo sorting facility at UPS's facility at the airport in Louisville, Kentucky. It is here that McPhee quotes one of the operators of these horribly complicated sorting processes thusly: \\"We become a partner with the companies. We run these businesses like they're our own.\\" Once again, here are living examples of the lesson my first boss tried to teach me in that little diner. Finally, we get a look at the country's coal trains, moving millions of tons of coal a year on mile long freight trains from coal mines in Wyoming to energy facilities around the country.The only chapter that didn't quite work for me was McPhee's discussion of his 5-days canoeing up the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, following the footsteps of John and Henry Thoreau. Although well-written and evocative of a time long past this chapter just didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the book. Nevertheless, the clarity of McPhee's writing is well worth the minor diversion.Fans of McPhee won't need me to convince them to read \\"Uncommon Carriers\\". For those new to McPhee all of his books are worthy of reading (and in many cases re-reading). After reading Uncommon Carriers you won't look at a truck, train, or tank vessel without thinking about those people who treat these huge vessels and the cargo they carry as if they were their own.

It is much better to take Idaho fuel than phony-assed Oregon fuel. The Idaho fuel includes all the taxes. The Oregon fuel did not. Oregon feints with an attractive price at the pump, but then shoots an uppercut into the ton-mileage.\\" In \\"Uncommon Carriers\\" we come to know Don Ainsworth, the intelligent, fastidious owner-driver of a meticulously kept 18-wheeler. And, we are privy to all of his first hand knowledge about trucking and life in general.John McPhee rides from Atlanta to Washington state with Don Ainsworth, owner and operator of a sixty-five-foot, five-axle, and eighteen wheel chemical tanker carrying hazmets. John McPhee's writing carries us along in the seat with Don and John, and I have a new hero now, Don Ainsworth. A trucker worth his weight in gold, and like Reader's Digest's old series, \\"a most unforgettable character\\". This book is \\"a grown-up version of every young boy's and girl's, I might add, fantasy life,\\"This is John McPhee's 28th novel. What John McPhee's books all have in common is that they are about real people in real places. Over the past eight years, John McPhee has spent time in the company of people who work in freight transportation. He attends ship-handling school on a pond in the foothills of the French Alps, where, for tuition of $15,000 a week, skippers of the largest ocean ships refine their capabilities in twenty-foot scale models. He goes up the \\"tight-assed\\" Illinois River on a \\"towboat\\" pushing a triple string of barges, the overall vessel being \\"a good deal longer than the \\"Titanic.\\"\\" And he travels by canoe up the canal-and-lock commercial waterways traveled by Henry David Thoreau and his brother, John, in a homemade skiff in 1839. We learn that some tank wash facilities, where the containers of food-transporting trucks are flushed out between hauls, have a rabbi standing by to assure they are kosher. It is bad luck to utter the word lapin (rabbit) on a French ship. There is a subculture of more than 100,000 \\"train watchers\\" in this country, and there are more transients hopping illegal rides on freight trains today than there were during the 1930s.In the most fascinating piece, McPhee visits the UPS hub at the Louisville, Kentucky, airport, where 5,000 workers sort a million packages every night. The building, with four million square feet of floor space and five miles of exterior walls, houses an almost entirely automated skein of conveyors where \\"packages containing everything from Jockey shorts to live lobsters find their rightful destination in minutes--a sort of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory for the world of mail-order commerce.\\"John McPhee and his son-in-law spend five days in a canoe, retracing the route Henry David Thoreau wrote about in his first book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. Though there is no freight involved, the canoeists encounter a terrain much changed since the 19th century. This piece was a disappointment. It is well written, but not up to his par, in my opinion.John McPhee ends his book by revisiting with Don Ainsworth thirty-six months after he had first left him. As he says, \\"If you have crossed the American continent in the world's most beautiful truck, you prefer not to leave it forever\\". Yes, suh, sweetie, this is the best of McPhee's books about people and this is the best there is. Highly recommended.prisrob 6-11-06"},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"John McPhee is a national treasure. Through 28 books, he has brought participatory journalism to high art, bringing us stories of interesting people doing interesting things. This time, he takes a series of essays first published in New Yorker magazine, all addressing aspects of transportation of cargo, and presents them in \\"Uncommon Carriers.\\"McPhee includes stories on trucking hazardous material, barging on the Illinois River, a school for oil tanker captains and the coals trains carrying coal from Wyoming the southeastern coal-fired power plants. As always, McPhee makes it fascinating. Partly, it's because he finds such fascinating characters. Trucker Don Ainsworth, for example. Partly, it's because he finds such fascinating tidbits. Rabbis who assure kosher truck transport, for example. But mostly it's because he finds and tells of fascinating subjects. Ranging from 1.3 mile long coal trains to 1,100 foot long strings of barges pushed up the narrow Illinois River, you have to ask how he finds out about this stuff.Would-be writers could do worse then study a McPhee paragraph, or analyze the organization of subjects across an essay. McPhee's skills include the ability to make it all seem effortless. When you consider the welter of detail he brings to each subject, without ever overwhelming the reader, your respect for his skills will grow. And I admit to a certain envy about how much fun McPhee gets to have.The book includes a tangentially related essay; McPhee and his son-in-law retrace the path of Henry David Thoreau and his brother in 1839 up an abandoned commercial waterway. The abandoned locks and channels of the canal system on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers speak to another time and another definition of commerce. The contrast between McPhee's writing and Thoreau's couldn't be stronger. \\"A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers\\" is nearly unreadable; McPhee's writing is impeccable.Another outstanding collection of essays from America's greatest living expository writer. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"John McPhee is arguably the greatest practitioner of literary non-fiction in America since Joseph Mitchell. Some of his works are more accessible than others, but his knack for making complex and obscure subjects interesting and approachable is perhaps the greatest of his gifts (although his flawless control of language is right up there).McPhee has enjoyed a long career - nearly 30 books now - so it's logical that some would be better than others. I confess that upon reading his last work - The Founding Fish - I was starting to wonder if he was starting to lose it. I found the book overlong and, frankly, not all that interesting - and when McPhee fails to hold your interest, somethin' just ain't right.But with Uncommon Carriers, McPhee returns (mostly) to full form. Want to know how goods move around the United States? Here are your answers - in fascinating, occasionally humorous, occasionally obsessive detail. As with all his best writing, McPhee uses the personalities and voices of people neck-deep in his topics to tell the stories, and the result is almost invariably fascinating.I say ALMOST because one piece of the book - 'Five Days on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers' - just doesn't hold up for me. As another reviewer noted, it's thematically out of place with the other pieces, all of which are about modern life, behind the scenes. But more importantly, learning about the author's canoe trip just wasn't that interesting. It suffered, I thought, from essentially the same problem as Founding Fish - too much detail and, curiously, too much introspection on McPhee's part. Forgive me, but I really don't care what an author has for lunch.Fortunately, most of the book focuses on other people and topics. McPhee is at his very best in this setting, and the bulk of Uncommon Carriers stands proudly with much of his other works.McPhee is getting up there, but Uncommon Carriers shows that he's still got game.... and, I hope, at least a few more books in him."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"Mr. McPhee has written an extremely interesting book about various methods of commercial transportation. You can learn about hazmat trucking in the wrld's shiniest truck, a school for tanker captains, maneuvering huge strings of barges along the very tight Illinois River, the mechanics of how the brown trucks at UPS show up at your house with a package, coal trains that are two miles long, and a canoe trip following Thoreau's path on the Concord and Merrimack rivers. With the exception of the last one. I found all the subjects to be fascinating. You feel as if you are there with the drivers trying to safely move enormous loads. The canoe trip just seemed to me to be a recitation of the towns they passd through. However, all in all, the book gives the reader a great amount of information, and I expect that you will learn a number of things that you not only didn't know but probably had never thought about."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"McPhee relates his experiences in a number of situations - attending ship-handling school, riding in an 18-wheeler, going up the Illinois River on a barge, following lobsters to UPS' Louisville air-hub, and taking a coal train from Wyoming to Georgia. Each instance (except riding the 18-wheeler - I drive a 22-wheeler) built my understanding and respect for those involved.1)Ship-handling is much more complex than I had imagined - wind, waves reflected from other ships and/or the shoreline, water depth, and the inertial lags involved all make it an exercise in Newtonian mechanics best left to others.2)I am already familiar with truck-driving, and can attest that McPhee reports accurately. However, limiting his experience to one owner-operator misses the frustration associated with many other driving jobs - eg. difficulty getting time off when wanted, driving odd hours that mess up one's circadian rhythms, wasting untold hours waiting to load/unload or get an assignment - all of which combine to create 100%+ annual driver turnover. On the other hand, it also affords a great way to see the U.S.3)After earlier reading about ship-handling I was prepared for the skill required to pilot barges up/down U.S. rivers. The barge \\"train\\" that McPhee rode was 1,145 feet long - passing other barges, avoiding bridge support columns - at night and in sometimes strong currents and winding rivers! Clearly easier said than done. And the deckhands are only paid $80-119/12-hour day while being out 2-4 weeks at a time!4)McPhee follows Nova Scotia lobsters (trucked every 5-6 days) to the UPS air hub in Louisville, KY. (30 hour trip), and from there sorted and sent on their way on one of 100 planes - even to Paris. We also learn that there are 120 miles of belts and monorails within the sorting facility (stacked 10-15 levels high in some locations), that UPS has established its own university to help attract workers, and warehouses/repairs goods for a number of manufacturers in nearby facilities.5)Western winds can sometimes lift an empty coal car, says McPhee. Unit coal trains (about 65 cars - 1.5 miles) almost always go entirely to a single plant. They are filled at .4 mph (115 tons/car), and emptied at 3 mph. The trains rarely go up/down a grade exceeding 1.2%, and their length sometimes requires braking with the front engines going downhill as the rear engines continue to push the last cars up the other side of the same hill. Supplying the Macon, Georgia plant (burns about 1,300 tons/hour) entails 35 unit coal trains - either coming or going."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"John McPhee is the ultimate observer. He has an uncanny ability to reveal interesting details in the most mundane surroundings. Much of what he discloses are things we often overlook. Better yet, he imparts what he sees with impressive clarity and delightful wit. He draws on extensive experience, from purposely stalling aircraft [Table of Contents] to great ships roaming the seas [Looking For A Ship]. The underlying theme of this volume is a bit more ground-based, as he joins truckers, bargemen, train engineers and his son-in-law. With these companions, he exposes a bit more of our world to us. McPhee may not be able to engage in \\"talking shop\\" with the men he deals with in this book, but he's a master at \\"listening shop\\". What he hears from them is conveyed to us in a way that puts us right next to him, attending closely.Most of this book is about massive conveyors and who operates them. McPhee opens with an account of Don Ainsworth's huge truck, 20 metres long carrying 36 tonnes of various \\"hazmat\\" over US roads. McPhee rides Illinois River barges, watching 15 of them stretch over 300 metres before his perch in the pilot house. A driving snowstorm doesn't intrude as he sits in the cab of a diesel locomotive pulling over two kilometres of coal-filled cars. One conveyer doesn't even move on its own. Instead, a network of ramps and moving belts shifts cargo from one carrier to another in the great UPS transhipment centre between two runways in Kentucky's major airport. Lest you don't consider the distance between aircraft runways sufficiently impressive, to walk around the building entails a hike of 8 kilometres. It is fifteen times the size of the Great Mosque of Cordoba, Spain. The manager has to ask directions if he strolls through the facility.Not everything in this collection is about great size or great speed. The coal train, for example, must move at less than 2 metres per second at one point. McPhee is even allowed to do his own driving, although under direction. He \\"drives\\" a 12 metre long model ship in a lake near the French Alps. Ship captains from around the world gather in Port Revel to learn the finer points of maneuvering. Docking and close navigation require precise knowledge of water and wind conditions and how these act on the ship. The ship itself will exhibit its own characteristics, which must also be mastered. In one exercise McPhee relates, not one captain passed the test. Scaling down yet further, McPhee performs a modern update of Henry David Thoreau's journey on New England rivers. The essay may seem a non-sequitor to the theme of the book, but it truly fits as a comparison to how the pace of travel has changed.McPhee's observational powers reach well beyond the given moment. His description of eastern Washington State declares it could be like Umbria in Italy - \\"just add water\\". The Illinois River's bizarre history is recalled - having flowed north for millions of years, it was reversed to provide a drainage route. Efficient delivery techniques can allow Nova Scotia lobster to underprice their Swedish cousins - for a Nobel dinner! After riding the coal train to a power-generating station, he totals up what has been achieved. Twenty-three thousand coal trains emerge from the Powder River Basin each year. This is the equivalent of thirty-four thousand miles of rolling coal \\"going off as units to become carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide\\" and other pollutants to air-condition a population so needful of comfort that it consumes more coal in the summer than in the winter.McPhee's mastery of language and observational skills make him the leading essayist in the US. He's kept that title for a long time, and this book demonstrates why. Always clear and interesting, this collection exhibits fully his enduring skills. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]"},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"Mr. McPhee produces another non-fiction masterpiece. As a staff writer for the \\"New Yorker\\" Magazine and the author of 26 (twenty-six) previous books he is no stranger to the literary production of non-fiction material.In this book, McPhee focuses on Commercial Transportation. Specifically, McPhee talks about Long Haul Truckers, Coal Train Operators, River Barge Operators, UPS Package Sortation and Delivery and a special story about two men taking a canoe up the Merrimack River in New England to duplicate the ride of Henry David Thoreau and his brother James which Thoreau documented in a book.The book is truly an insightful look at transportation, especially in the 21st Century. Many of these forms of transportation seem almost to be forgotten about, yet presently have economic utility, especially with the rising price of gasoline and diesel fuel. Mr. McPhee explains the economics. But more interesting than the economics are the pictures that McPhee creates of actually being in these transportation businesses and actually working the freight that is unique about his latest creation.The book is recommended to all readers of non-fiction who have an interest in understanding how things move from place to place in the United States of America. It is a unique combination of fine writing and informational content."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"When you start to read a John McPhee book you start to say to yourself that this is really not very interesting. Then after a few pages you realize that you are beginning to get hooked and you don't want to put the book down. And when you finish you say, 'That was fascinating.' Furthermore, you remember what he wrote. You remember a hell of a lot more than you remember from a textbook.I remember the ship breaking in LOOKING FOR A SHIP (1993).I was so struck by THE CONTROL OF NATURE (1989) that I had to go visit the Old River Control Project in Louisiana, it was only a thousand mile or so trip. Hint, no matter how they rebuild it, New Orleans is still doomed.I also had to go visit the geographic formation at Carlin, NV described in BASIN AND RANGE (1981) - REPRINTED IN ANNALS OF THE FORMER WORLD.UNCOMMON CARRIERS gives the McPhee treatment to transportation: big trucks, river barges, UPS, and coal trains. But that's a minor detail, what's important is that here's a new McPhee book, don't miss it.And if you are a budding author (especially a textbook author), you might want to study this book (or any of his others) pretty carefully. His style/skill/format makes for easy leisure reading, and you remember the technical details 25 years later."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"Uncommon Carriers is an uncommon book, but then that is what one should expect from John McPhee. This is the third of his books that I have read, and all have been rather quirky. In Uncommon Carriers, McPhee investigates the behind-the-scenes world of transportation. He does this, not by doing research, but by actually participating in the transportation activities. The up side to this is that the reader gets an inside view of the often hidden world and an appreciation of the complexity that surrounds ways of life that may seem rather blas&eacute; to those not in the industry. The down side is that McPhee sometimes gets so deep into the vocabulary of the industry that he loses the reader. Because of this, some of the segments are more accessible than others. But all are fascinating and eye-opening."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"I have read three of Mr. McPhee's books (well, listened to one of those on audio) and all three were great. This volume continues his \\"travels experience\\" style but leaves the geology of the other two (Assembling California and Basin and Range) for more the human interest area of transport. Nicely done."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"At the start of his book Oranges -- which contains everything you could want to know about oranges and, more importantly, nothing that you don't want to know -- John McPhee explains how legendary New Yorker editor William Shawn (known universally as \\"Mr. Shawn\\" and father of Wallace \\"Inconceivable!\\" Shawn) meted out article topics to his flock:While mentioning a number of story possibilities to Mr. Shawn, I uttered the single word \\"oranges?\\"He answered right back. He always answered quickly. It seemed impossible to propose any subject to him that he had not thought about before you had. He kept his writers at the far ends of something like bicycle spokes -- all separate, all somehow spinning together and apart, with him at the center -- and when he turned down an idea he was usually protecting the interests of some writer whose name would never be mentioned. \`No. I'm very sorry. No,' he would say typically, his voice so light it fell like mist. \`That subject is reserved in a general way for another writer.' To my question about oranges, though, he said, \`Yes. Oh, my, yes.'I like to imagine that's how McPhee comes up with book ideas generally, and I like to picture Mr. Shawn responding to the winners with the same Episcopalian giddiness. Here, in Uncommon Carriers, the Quirky Idea That Few Would Think Of is: let's interview those people who carry freight across the United States. It's brilliant, but it wouldn't be brilliant in just anyone's hands. It is brilliant because John McPhee is fascinated by his fellow-humans. He must be one of the greatest interviewers of all time.I can say this, at the very least, because he sits in trucks and on trains and ships for days at a time; if it weren't an absolute joy to travel with the man, he would have long since been shot and dumped overboard into the Illinois River.Yes, there is an Illinois river. There are four of them, in fact. Who knows why McPhee chose to ride a towboat on the Illinois River instead of on, say, the Mississippi. Each river has ships sized appropriately to it; maybe the Illinois is interesting because it carries interestingly large ships, while still being small enough that they periodically run aground. The Illinois is also a \\"tight-assed river\\" (the title of the essay in Uncommon Carriers): ships need to make complicated turns all along it. McPhee's interest is as much in the shipmen doing challenging work as it is in the ships, so he must love watching the pilots handle the turns.In another essay, \\"Five Days on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers,\\" McPhee and a friend follow the path that Henry David Thoreau and his brother explored in the late 1800s. Thoreau, of course, was one of the great back-to-nature men, railing against the coming industrial revolution. That revolution filled the banks of the Merrimack with countless textile factories, which have since been shuttered and have left those towns -- like Lowell and Haverhill -- desolate and hollow. It's clever, then, and more than a little sad, to follow the path of that revolution's enemy a few decades after the mills stopped spinning.There's so much else in Uncommon Carriers; I've never been happier to have been stuck on a bus for four hours with nothing to do but read. There's \\"Out In The Sort,\\" where McPhee arrives at the main UPS hub in Louisville along with thousands of frozen lobsters on their way to the ends of the earth. Here we learn that \\"Lobsters are to Christmas dinners in France what turkeys are in America.\\" We learn that most of the million packages sorted here every day are sorted \\"between 11 P.M. and 4 A.M.\\" (McPhee doesn't say so -- he leaves a lot of these questions unanswered if he has the slightest hope that his readers can figure them out on their own -- but one presumes that the timing is chosen so as not to conflict with Louisville's passenger air traffic.) We learn that when you mail a Toshiba laptop off for repairs, it arrives in the hands of a technician \\"who is a full-time UPS employee,\\" because the shipping company realized \\"a few years ago ... that it had \`maxed out in the package-delivery trade and now needed to expand.'\\"Or we hop, in \\"Coal Train,\\" onto a mile-long train poetically labeled \\"CTSBT\\": \\"C\\" because it carries coal, \\"TS\\" because it's destined for the Tennessee Valley, \\"BT\\" because it originates at the Black Thunder mine. A mile-long train heading straight from a mine to a turbine, each car filled as fully as operations research allows, fuels one Atlanta power plant for about eight hours. \\"The heat [from the coal], of course, boils water -- eighty-one million gallons of Ocmulgee River water a day -- in boilers twenty-five stories tall.\\" CTSBT is thus not only an amusing way to pass the time with train men; it is a snapshot of American capitalism at its most primal. In this way, \\"Coal Train\\" bears a strong resemblance to McPhee's haunting \\"Search for Marvin Gardens,\\" in which he wanders through bombed-out Atlantic City, New Jersey hunting for all the properties on the Monopoly board.McPhee bookends the whole collection on the road with Don Ainsworth. Ainsworth owns and operates a gleaming, almost vainly clean chemical tanker truck. Tankers, we learn, either carry chemicals or they carry food; \\"your brother better be F. Lee Bailey\\" if you're going to carry both.Please go read Uncommon Carriers. I literally can't imagine a better way to spend four hours while wearing clothes."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"The author describes different forms of transportation from the experiences of the driver of an 18-wheeler, a river boat pilot going up and down narrow rivers, a ship captain training on a pond in the Swiss Alps, and an engineer of a coal train. He goes into great detail which makes it feel like you are there.He does kind of go off the track, though, when he attempts to re-create the canoe trip of John and Henry Thoreau by making his own trip. That chapter was 38 pages long (about 15% of the book) and was like watching home movies of a friend's last vacation trip. Unless you are interested in Thoreau's journey up a river, or are an avid canoeist, I'd skip that chapter. The rest of the book makes up for it, though."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"I was unaware this author existed, and am so glad a friend told me about him! His research into his subjects is phenomenal, so one learns so much with each book, but even better are his portraits of people.This book's topics about transportation are somewhat interesting, but right now I'm stalled in Switzerland- I know, from reading his other books, to power through and the landscape and topic will shift, so will likely revise up this review when I do, as it's only fair."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"See above.What I wrote above should be sufficient, now is the time for all good men to come together"},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"John McPhee has a great knack for making the over-looked interesting, and draws character sketches as well here as he does in any of his books. However, each essay in this book is at least 10 pages too long, and the book would have benefited greatly from some maps and illustrations. The essay about Thoreau's journey along the Merrimack river seemed non-sequitur."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"Uncommon carriers is a great dive into some of the more esoteric elements of, well, cargo. From 15,000 gallon liquid tankers that have to be sprayed out to be made chemically inert, to trips up the Mississippi on a string of barges with only a few feet to spare on each side, to cargo trains over a mile long, John brings a truly in depth first-person perspective on the people, passion, and practices behind moving things around the world.Overall, a really interesting read on what some might consider a dry topic, McPhee's &#34;embedded&#34; approach reveals personalities that keep you reading and dives in to the salient technical details that are fun to learn if you're the least bit engineering-inclined.If you've ever wondered what train crews do when they've reached their legal maximum time on the job, or what life is like on a barge in the Mississippi, or what truckers call shredded tire treads, Uncommon Carriers is a great read for you."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"18 wheelers, ocean vessels, lake freighters, river barges, third party logistics, air freight, lobster farms and canoes.

I enjoyed all of the sections of the book that I read. I felt like it was something of an inside view of the transportation world. I kind of got the same feeling out of reading this that I get out of listening to This American Life, though without a real story behind it. I enjoyed how the author made what may even be mundane into something interesting. Obviously, I have no way to confirm, but I felt he not only captured the essence of the characters, but also the environment.I did skip the whole section on kayaking (or was it canoeing?). I just had no interest. I would have liked it if he could have included more of the background detail on the train segment. I want to know more about how the system works and how things fit together. Furthermore, it would have been nice to have additional modes of transportation discussed. There was no glaring reason for only giving 4 stars other than an overall opinion and feeling."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"John McPhee rides with a cross-country trucker who hauls chemicals; takes a course in piloting ocean going vessels; navigates the Illinois River with a thousand foot string of barges; describes how a million packages a night are sorted and shipped from a UPS facility and rides in the cab of a mile long train hauling coal. His descriptions are full, informative and never, ever boring (except once when he describes a canoe trip, but that chapter is easily skipped).There is a very slight hint of condescension in McPhee's narrative; he is always at pains to remind the reader how little formal education his subjects have. Perhaps this is something ingrained from his New Yorker writing. Fortunately this habit is neither overly intrusive nor obnoxious.His descriptions of each of his adventures (other than the canoe trip) are wonderfully informative. His sense of awe at UPS's massive and incredibly complex sorting facility comes through to the reader along with a marvelously detailed description of how the of miles and miles of conveyors and automated tools acting with very little human intervention move more than a million packages a night.McPhee made me wish I could join a tow boat captain as he maneuvers a thousand foot line of barges up and down a narrow river. Or sit in the cab of a locomotive as it loads up more than a hundred cars with tons of call, a train more than a mile long that can be ascending one side of a grade while descending the other.Overall it's quite a set of adventures and one well worth reading.Jerry"},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"The editorial reviews and some of the reader reviews do a good job of presenting the aspects of this book that are typical of John McPhee and which raise his book well above the typical empty series of words that is so common for todays literature.However when I have read other McPhee books I came away feeling like I have been exposed to good journalism providing a very comprehensive set of perspectives on a topic. Uncommon Carriers is uncommon in this respect it is a bit of a soft ball. This book unfortunately idolizes the industries as it also idolizes the individuals he chronicles. As an example, when Don Ainsworth dodges a \\"road alligator\\" John discusses the damage that can be caused but glosses over the fact that that tire came off a big truck that knew it was going to leave a deadly hazard. The driver of the truck who dropped that \\"alligator\\" could have easily prevented it but didn't want to take the time to change that tire before it deteriorated. John never once discusses the extreme danger and damage trucking presents to our transportation industry.This is just one example of the plethora of journalistic incompleteness that John presents to keep his protagonists squeaky clean. I am sorry and it sounds extreme but this book reminded me of Larry King, shudder.I would suggest you skip it if your a big fan. It leaves a bad taste."},{"Title":"Uncommon Carriers","review":"Many of the tranportation related chapters are very good, especially the 2 chapters on the 18 wheeler and the lobsters.

A Fast, Clear, and Fun Explanation of the Economics You Need For Success in Your Career, Business, and Investments (An Uncle Eric Book)","review":"I just received this book today and just finished it. I purchased this book to help my son (8 years old) to begin to understand the value of money and economic systems. As an amateur economist and also a financial professional, this is an excellent, simple, and easy to understand book about the basics of money and the laws of supply and demand, which - regardless if we like it or not - drive our economic engine. It has, does, and always will, even if our politicians (and in many cases with the best of intentions) wish to control through price fixing, interest rates, and money supply to help avoid the bursts and bubbles. Unfortunately the over-meddling by our government/s only exacerbates the problem. There is a fine line between regulating and legislation vs. intervention, I would argue (and I believe this book articulates) that the line has blurred and that our government/s have moved into the dangerous realm of intervention that has plagued many civilizations over history.Socialism gives rise under economic stress and also with the best of intentions to help the people and businesses that are struggling. We have breed an entitlement generation, in which people have grown up to believe that everyone is a winner, failure is NOT an option, and that we are entitled to jobs, healthcare, homes, and the American Dream. We are not entitled to anything, but rather have the RIGHT to pursue our dreams.A fun, but excellent quote, by Spock (from Star Trek) right before he gives his life to save the crew is so important and valid as to the problems that plague our government. \\"Logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.\\" Yet our own government has ignored this very important point and we have sacrificed the many (through higher taxes and the lapse of many of our personal freedoms) to save the few (unions, special interest, and corporations). If we continue on the path to serve the few and the expense of the many, we will continue not only see our currency devalue (inflate), but also our liberties to erode.This is an excellent and simple book of common sense, but sometimes even knowledgeable and wise adults forget the simple and over complicate issues.This should be recommended reading for every school kid.\\"All paper money returns to its intrinsic value....zero!\\" - Voltaire"},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Penny Candy?

Or Confused?\\" I immediately ordered the entire series and have not regretted it for an instant.I began with number one and moved through them all in the correct order, or at least the recommended order by the author.\\"Let's talk about Personal, Career and Financial Security\\" was the first and just wet the curiosity. It left you wanting to know more.This book began the meat and potatoes of a series that is easy to read, written on an understandable level for everyone and enlightening to all concerning the many mysteries of historical, economic and governmental issues and interminglings that have to do with social, moral, political and so many other issues.I would recommend this series as a Middle School Required reading text with in depth discussions and working groups for the youth of America to be better informed than they now are about the world and how it all works and fits together.Mr. Maybury's elaboration of the various \\"Models\\" that people create for the world they try to live in was a very thought provoking exercise and explained a great deal about the great divide that currently separates the American consciousness.Two down and still batting a thousand. Great job Mr. Maybury."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? A Fast, Clear, and Fun Explanation of the Economics You Need For Success in Your Career, Business, and Investments (An Uncle Eric Book)","review":"After having suffered through four college econ courses (Principles and Intermediate) I have come to the conclusion that most professional economists are nearly worthless ivory-tower eggheads whose theories are almost completely disconnected from the real world, and that &quot;Ph.d&quot; truly does mean &quot;Piles high and deep.&quot; It is truly a shame that a reader can learn more from this marvelous little book than from getting a degree in economics. This book should be taught starting in junior high. It's clearly and simply written and very few of the concepts require a great deal of thought. After understanding it, you'll trust your own judgement over the babblers on tv and in the universities."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? A Fast, Clear, and Fun Explanation of the Economics You Need For Success in Your Career, Business, and Investments (An Uncle Eric Book)","review":"The great thing about this book is that it's a great explanation of inflation. The bad thing about this book is it's a great explanation of inflation. Yes, I said the same thing twice.When it was first written-1978-inflation was the major thing in American economics. Today it is still a major threat-but the social urgency over it has declined as the rate of inflation has waned over the years. Yet, I still give this book a 5 star rating because understanding inflation requires explaining money. This book explains money better than any other book I've read.Understanding money is VERY important. It is not only the key to explaining inflation, but it is the context in which almost all business activity plays out. A good understanding business requires understanding this context. This book does a great job a laying out that context.The writing style is down to earth and simple. The book is short, very entertaining (for an economics book), and has clearly defined chapters. The author has some good illustrations. I don't really mean the expected graphical illustrations-although it has some of them too. I mean historical illustrations: stories of how societies have used (and abused) money in the past. These stories not only buttress the author's arguments, but also anchor the lessons in tangible human drama.I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in learning economics and/or business."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? A Fast, Clear, and Fun Explanation of the Economics You Need For Success in Your Career, Business, and Investments (An Uncle Eric Book)","review":"I think this is the best book out there to help quickly spread a basic understanding of economics and therefore how the world works. The knowledge and importance per page ratio is the highest I have ever read. Even better than Harry Browne's intro to economics from his famous first 80 pages of \\"How you can profit from the coming devaluation\\" .Pages 13 - 90 are the heart of the book. That is 77 pages that in less than 2 hours can take your average person from unfortunate ignorance to economic genius compared to your average economics college graduate.Somehow someone needs to reach Bill Gates and Warren Buffet and get them to read this book and put a copy in every american household.

A Fast, Clear, and Fun Explanation of the Economics You Need For Success in Your Career, Business, and Investments (An Uncle Eric Book)","review":"Using LinkedIn I've recently connected with a friend from twenty years ago. We've exchanged some emails and will try to get together when he is back in town. When my friend learned that I had three daughters he recommended several books by Richard J. Maybury. I requested a couple from my library. The first one I got was What Happened To Penny Candy?What Happened To Penny Candy? is a short book of 80 pages. It is a quick read. The book is structured as a set of letters from \\"Uncle Eric\\" to his nephew \\"Chris.\\" In these letters the book explains the basics of economics. It does a good job. Over the last thirty years I've read dozens, maybe even hundreds, of books on economics. This book does a good job of covering the basics. I even learned a few things. For example I didn't realize that the reason quarters and dimes were lined with the little ridges on the side was to show if little pieces were clipped off the coin.Richard Maybury, the author, writes from a strong Libertarian viewpoint. He explains why government manipulation causes problems. Someone who feels government is the solution to economic problems will not enjoy this book.I'll return the book to the library and buy my own copy. I plan to have each of my daughters read this book. It is short enough that they won't fuss too much about having to ready a dry topic. Economics is an important subject, one that I want my daughters to master."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Penny Candy? A Fast, Clear, and Fun Explanation of the Economics You Need For Success in Your Career, Business, and Investments (An Uncle Eric Book)","review":"After hearing this book widely recommended in the homeschooling world, I decided to give it a try and am glad I did. This book is aimed at ages 13 to adult and is written in the form of a series of letters from an uncle to a nephew. Each letter is 8 pages or less of relatively large text, so breaks the information into easily digestible chunks. Basic economic terms and concepts are well-explained, and a lot of relevant historical context is shared.Topics covered include money: coins and paper, no such thing as a free lunch, inflation, legal tender, wages, price controls, recessions, boom & bust cycle, getting rich quick (a caution against this mindset), federal debt, government's influence on the economy and more. These are all explained quite clearly. In the back, there are further appendices with some more advanced information, further graphs, etc. There's also a list of recommended resources. Finally, an index makes it easy to locate a particular topic.My husband, who is quite knowledgeable on economic matters, found this to be a very good basic primer. I'm less knowledgeable than he and learned quite a bit. My 9-year-old son (advanced reader) enjoyed reading this and learned a lot as well.I would definitely recommend this as a fast and clear basic introduction to economics for middle school students up through adults."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Penny Candy?

A Fast, Clear, and Fun Explanation of the Economics You Need For Success in Your Career, Business, and Investments (An Uncle Eric Book)","review":"The book is okay, and it's very quick and easy to read. But it does oversimplify matters and it is a bit out of date.As an example of oversimplification, according to this book, there is exactly one cause of inflation, and it is \\"politicians\\". As an example of being out of date, this book (which was written while Ronald Reagan was wrapping up his presidency) names Alan Greenspan as a major proponent of the Austrian economic theory it presents. This was even true back then (more than 20 years ago). It's not any more. Among many public statements, Greenspan testified to Congress in 2008 that significant aspects of that economic theory, and especially how they applied it, were wrong. But you wouldn't know that from this book, because the third edition was printed 15 years before that happened. (It also presents the Chicago school of monetary policy, a la Milton Friedman.)But what bothers me about the \\"inflation is the evil product of big government\\" theme is that he gives short shrift to the serious dangers of deflation and none to the idea that productivity produces actual wealth. He favors a fixed money supply of the sort that you get from having a fixed gold or silver supply. Here's the problem with that:Imagine a village of two families. One family is led by a farmer. The other family is led by a baker. After harvest each year, the farmer takes all his grain to the baker to sell it. The baker says, \\"This is jut what I need. This is enough grain to feed my whole family and keep us busy baking bread all year. I'll give you all my money for all your grain. If you want, you can use the money to buy bread from me later.\\" The baker has 12 silver coins. The farmer agrees, and now the farmer has 12 silver coins and the baker has none.Every month, the farmer buys bread from the baker. Every month, the farmer pays one silver coin for the bread he bought. At the end of the year, the farmer has no money. The baker has 12 silver coins and has used up all the grain. But it is harvest time again, so the farmer has more grain and he sells the new grain to the baker for the same 12 silver coins.This cycle repeats for years. There is no inflation, so the same 12 silver coins trade hands over and over.One day the farmer and the baker die. Their children divide the family businesses. Now there are two farmers and two bakers and four families in the village. But there are still only 12 silver coins.The first farmer goes to the first baker at harvest time to sell it. The baker says, \\"This is jut what I need. This is enough grain to feed my whole family and keep us busy baking bread all year. I'll give you all my money for all your grain. If you want, you can use the money to buy bread from me later.\\"But the baker has only six silver coins, because his sister has the other half of their father's money. \\"What?!\\" says the farmer. \\"I worked hard all year for this grain. It is as much grain as my father ever brought to your father. Why are you only paying me half as much money for it? How will I bring you one silver piece every month to pay for bread, if you only pay me six silver pieces for the whole year?\\"\\"I don't know,\\" says the baker. \\"But I only have six silver pieces. I can't pay you twelve because I only have six.\\"The second farmer likewise goes the second baker and has the same conversation. Eventually, the farmers decide that they have no choice but to sell the grain despite the deep price reduction.Then the two farmers go to buy bread. \\"A month's worth of bread for one family is just one silver piece,\\" say each of the bakers. \\"That's what our father charged your father, and we are doing the same. You should be glad there is no inflation.\\" But the farmers refuse: they cannot afford to spend an entire year's worth of income on only half a year's worth of bread.Eventually, the bakers decide that they have no choice but to sell the bread at a deep price reduction.Thus we have two hard-working farmers growing enough grain for twice as many families, and two hard-working bakers making bread for twice as many families, but they are each paid half as much as their parents were paid to feed only half as many families.What you see in this little story is a doubling of economic productivity -- twice as much grain and twice as much bread -- in the village (and therefore of real income in the village) without a matching doubling of the monetary supply. The net result in this simplified story is only hurt feelings. But in more complex situations, such as when your home mortgage for \\"three years' income\\" turns into an unaffordable \\"six years' income\\" millstone, or when our two farmers take their grain to the next town, where it sells for the customary 12 silver coins, and leave the bakers' families to starve, it's a nightmare.That kind of realistic thinking about true income and true productivity is why we abandoned the silver and gold standards decades ago, although you wouldn't know from this book that there were sound reasons for that change. Money needs to reflect the actual amount of productive work happening in the society, not the amount of shiny metal found at one fixed point in history.(Also, silver and gold have significant industrial uses now, which means that they need to be treated as proper commodities, just like iron. Back when silver and gold were just money, iron was not useful for money because it was useful for making plows and swords and steam engines, not merely because plain iron (but not forms of iron like stainless steel) tended to corrode more quickly than silver or gold. Now, gold and silver are used for computer components. That wasn't such a major use back in the late 1980s when this book was originally written. The technology has changed; it's not surprising that the ideal medium for exchanging value has also changed.So my advice is a healthy dose of skepticism. This might make a good first book for someone to read about economic issues. It is, however, filled with what's known as \\"lies to children\\" (oversimplifications and omissions to make the material comprehensible to a beginner), so don't let it be your last."},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Penny Candy?

The evidence is there in black &amp; white, on the paper for all to see. When that artist is Robert Crumb, normally accustomed to putting his soul into his work, the result is painful to observe. Crumb demands that we witness his anxieties, refusing to quit working even in the face of physical &amp; mental exhaustion (1972 &amp; 73 were pretty heavy years for R.C.!). The results, though damn good, are still not up to the snuff of his previous period. In this volume you'll find Crumb's work on 'XYZ Comics', 'ZAP #6', 'BLACK AND WHITE' (featuring the classic male fantasy response to feminist criticisms: 'R. Crumb Versus The Sisterhood'), 'EAT IT!' (a cookbook by Dana Crumb that Robert illustrated) and 'FUNNY AMINALS' (containing 'What A World!': one of the sickest pieces Crumb has ever undertaken!). So, after all the naysaying, why the four star rating? Because lesser Crumb is still a helluva lot better than most underground artists at their peak!

Angered by feminist attacks on his work, the intent of these stories and drawings seems to be to bait his critics, embodying every object of their scorn.

Would highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Rapist (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Earl Summerfield, 26, feckless junior clerk at the State Unemployment Bureau, miserably married to the loveless Bianca, 33, keeps a diary for one year. It becomes a record of marital hatred, the paranoia and pathetic rivalries of office life, and, increasingly, a record of violent crime - the rapes, robberies, senseless murders and gas chamber executions reported in the daily news. Earl's apparent disgust and dismay at the crime wave alternates with violent sexual fantasies of his own. Fleeing Bianca and his apartment some nights, he begins sneaking into other people's houses. When he becomes fixated with the local beauty queen, Mara St Johns, it's only a matter of time before Earl's fantasies become reality. Or do they?... I imagine many readers flee from this novel - even from the title - assuming it's some kind of exploitative or voyeuristic pornography. Far from it. It is relentlessly voyeuristic, but the object of that gaze is Earl's mind. This is a tremendously engaging novel of psychological realism, and what gives it that vivid quality is that Earl is as inconsistent as any real person. He loves himself, he's filled with self-loathing. He deserves to be promoted, he's an idiot for dreaming of it. One day he despises work, the next he can't wait to go in. One night he revels in personal insights and dreams of self-transformation, making life-changing decisions which are instantly reversed or forgotten by the next. He's a man unravelling; caught in the trap of middle-class existence which fuels his dreams without giving him any real hope of achieving them; caught, too, between desire and the Puritan legacy for which the circuit breaker is a violent rejection and punishment of sex. What's most compelling about Earl's diary is that the more deranged, anti-social and evangelical he becomes, the more consistent are his writing and behaviour. In the end, he lives up to his rhetoric."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Rapist (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"\\"The Diary of a Rapist\\" is a middle-class \\"Taxi Driver.\\" It is a modern \\"Crime and Punishment.\\"Connell has written one of the best novels I've ever read about fear, frustration and isolation. The main character, Earl Summerfield, is stuck in a loveless marriage, unhappy with his job, afraid of almost everything, and completely frustrated with how his life has played out. Earl alternates between self-love and self-loathing as he faces the ultimate fear: the possibility of a life wasted.As the days go on, Earl obsesses about the violence surrounding him, the drudgery and squabbling at his office, the hate he feels from his wife, the constant abuses he feels he suffers. Typically, Earl thinks he could have been so much more. If it wasn't for his wife, his supervisor, his whoever, he'd be a great man, a wealthy man.The frustration cracks him, and he latches onto a beauty queen he thinks represents what he considers the modern trampy female (Earl's incompetence with women leads to a deep misogyny). After the act the title of the book suggests takes place, Earl can't help but romanticize the woman. Thinking that he loves her, that he needs to marry her, that she enjoyed what happened.I don't think I've ever read a novel that better understood loneliness. How internalizing the rage of your inadequacies can lead to delusions and acts of impulsive violence. Connell gives you a front-row seat to Earl's pitiful life -- his lack of will, his fantasies, his inability to function, his almost bipolar shifting attitudes, and how he eventually takes this out on someone else and hurts her -- and it is scary and it is sad.The only other character study that so accurately reveals the dark conscience of the Broken American Male is Martin Scorsese's \\"Taxi Driver.\\" But Connell's book is even better, because he puts you right in Earl's mind, and it is a place both fascinating and disturbing."},{"Title":"The Diary of a Rapist (New York Review Books Classics)","review":"Evan S. Connell's The Diary Of A Rapist fails as a novel for two large reasons. First, is the technical reason that its usage of small diary entries limits the point of view of his narrator, the rapist Earl Summerfield, which necessitates his not portraying fully his own predicament because the character simply cannot. By contrast, in Connell's two masterpieces of prose, Mrs. Bridge and Mr. Bridge, the short sections, written in an omniscient mode, allowed a brushstroke technique that slowly built indelible portraits in poetic touches. But, even were the tale to have been told in a more conventional manner, or in the same style that Connell sketched the Bridges, the work would still fail because Connell is unable to fundamentally grasp the mind of a criminal, or the concept of evil, instead relying on the worst narrative clich&eacute;s imaginable....In short, The Diary Of A Rapist is merely a poor imitation of a true exploration of human evil, and, coming from a writer as talented as Connell, a profound disappointment, yet, oddly emblemic of his up and down, hit and miss, career. The basic conceit of the book fails because the references to himself as Earl Summerfield, as well as the many incidents offstage, are too self-consciously detailed and unlike any real diary. The whole novel reeks of artifice, lacking even the accidental poesy a real diary might have, in its relentless and focused drive toward violent hermeticism. There is a fatal schism between evil as it really is and how Connell projects it in the book, especially toward the end, when Connell begins his inevitable and trite \`descent' to madness and death, that ultimately dooms the book as a viable work of art, much less a genuine and believable portrait of evil. Thus, when on September 6th, Summerfield writes, \`The more I'm stripped the more I feel pain,' it reads not like Summerfield's own clich&eacute;-ridden diary entry, but Connell's novel's clich&eacute;-ridden prose. That's his, and the book's, greatest crime."},{"Title":"Dressage;: A study of the finer points of riding","review":"I discovered this book (1956) edition on the shelf of a client (I am an ARIA Dressage Instructor) and asked to borrow it.

There is no Bat charcater in THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE, but Roland West's first filmed version of the play (the silent one) depicted the Bat character in a bat-man type outfit that inspired Bob Kane to create his Batman for Detective Comics."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"The plot of The Circular Staircase is, like the staircase of the title, rather roundabout. There are a lot of elements in this novel--murder, embezzlement, robbery, and arson, just t name a few of the crimes perpetrated by the characters in this book. Rachel Innes is a rather prickly middle-aged spinster and the aunt of Gertrude and Halsey. After renting a house in the countryside one summer, in which ghosts are said to live, a man is shot dead at the foot of the house's circular staircase. The dead man is the son of the owner of the house, and he and Jack Bailey (a friend of Halsey's who also happens to be engaged to Getrude) may or may not have been involved in a bank scandal.Rachel, who claims that the detecting gene is in her blood, spends the course of the novel pursuing clues, most of which are red herrings. It turns out that every person involved in this story has a piece of the puzzle; and Rachel spends most of the story saying \\"if only I had known...\\" The \\"Had I But Known\\" plot is apparently pretty characteristic of Rinehart's novels, but in this book I kept feeling that Rachel as just moving in circles, never really solving any part of the mystery until the very last minute. Also, I didn't particularly care for the narrator of the story: Rachel is so sharp-tongued that she's actually rude to pretty much everybody at one point or another. Mr. Jamieson, the detective, is much more likeable, but he sometimes allows Rachel to walk all over him.Mary Roberts Rinehart has been credited with coining the phrase \\"the butler did it\\"--though the phrase never appeared in any of her mystery novels. Her books were bestsellers in the United States for a long while in the early 20th century, probably because they were so readable; certainly not \\"high literature\\" in an sense of the word. The Circular Staircase is a prime example of this; but nonetheless it works well as a suspense novel."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Readers loved this \\"modern\\" Gothic thriller when it came out a century ago. Even the critics were charmed. Like so many bestsellers, however, The Circular Staircase fell into obscurity for decades. I was lucky to stumble upon a new edition in a bookstore. I'm also happy to see it's available on Amazon.How could anyone ask for a more delightful heroine? Rachael Innes, middle-aged spinster, is witty, feisty, wealthy, afraid of mice, yet ready for almost anything else - from hunting down ghosts to warding off attackers in the night. Stimulated by crime, she's like \\"a dog on a scent.\\"In her role as Aunt Rachael, she has successfully raised her dead brother\`s children to young adulthood. All they ask in return is that she take a house in the country for the summer. She foolishly agrees.Summer at Sunnyside turns out to be a series of bizarre and terrifying happenings. In the first few nights of residence there are ghost-like thumpings and appearances, culminating in a man shot dead at the foot of the circular stairs.This is only the beginning of the thrills and chills to come. The reader can look forward to bank robbery, grave robbery, abduction, mysterious characters with false names, ghostly intruders, veiled ladies, smooth-mannered villains, star-crossed lovers, and a very agreeable detective who lets Aunt Rachael do much of the work of detecting.It seems that Rinehart herself twice rented houses haunted by a poltergeist - and scoffed at the otherworldly phenonema just like Aunt Rachael!I highly recommend this book, especially to fans of vintage and classic mystery."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Nice mystery.

I have trouble reading a book where the older character, the Aunt, is written as having learned nothing in all her many years. She is so gullible she believes every word of her Niece & Nephew & takes the servants words at face value. I found all the characters boring. The book is confusing in that one minute the house they are at is isolated the next everyone has run off to town just blocks from the house!"},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Published in 1908, The Circular Staircase won't be what you expect: a hyperventilated Edwardian piece, loaded with implausible plot and purple prose. Our heroine, the middle-aged Rachel Innes, proves caustic, intelligent and quite humorous from the very start. Her well-meaning quarrels with her foolish maid Liddy provide great comic relief, and you won't find Miss Innes making the sort of stupid exercises in derring-do that get modern-day heroines nearly killed in today's mystery novels. Nor will you find Miss Innes melting into Victorian hysterics or melodrama. She's not afraid to hide evidence and thwart the police in her quest for the truth about the murder at her rented summer home. Despite being more than a century old, the novel doesn't feel dated at all, except for the attitudes to other races.Is the novel perfect? No. As other writers have pointed out, there are some plot slip-ups. And Miss Innes' attitude toward Thomas the butler, an African-American, while better than average for the day, will strike modern readers as appalling. That said, you'll thoroughly enjoy The Circular Staircase."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"It was kind of annoying how Gertrude, Halsey and the narrator weren't just open and honest with each other, but I really enjoyed the banter between the narrator and the other characters and it was an interesting read. I also enjoyed how it was set in a Victorian-sort of time period. It is more suspense and mystery than romance, which I would have liked to see more of, but a good read nonetheless."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"The Circular Staircase is a proper name for this storybecause it does go in circles.

The lady along with her family have decided tostay in the house regardless of strange happenings. There is a side story also involving a large bank fraud incident.

Actually I could not even finish it. There is a comma after every other word which makes it hard to follow. You eventually do not even care anymore who did it. I cannot believe it was published."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Mary Roberts Rinehart (1876-1957) was never a critic's darling and both her short stories and novels were repeatedly dismissed as \\"low brow junk\\"--but the reading public of the early 1900s adored her, and she had a very long and commercially profitable career. And although most of her work could be best described as \\"romance,\\" it is for her occasional mystery that she is best recalled today.Written in 1907 and published in 1908, THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE was among Rinehart's most popular works. Wealthy spinster Miss Innes is persuaded by her two wards--niece and nephew Gertrude and Halsey--to take a house in the country for the summer. But no sooner is Miss Innes and her fearful maid Liddy installed at Sunnyside then things begin to go bump in night, and murder is not far behind.THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE is very much of its era: like many novels of the time it has a Victorian hang-over that shows in both its highly improbable plot and its determination to spell out every possible detail. Not a great stylist, Rinehart was never really able to shed these issues in any of her works--but if you are prepared to suspend disbelief and enter into the spirit of the thing THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE is actually quite a bit of fun. There are sounds in the night, mysterious faces at the window, screaming maids, unexpected visitors, and all the rest. And the book would become extremely influential in an unexpected way.In 1917 Rinehart joined forces with playwright Avery Hopwood to adapt THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE to the stage, and when it opened on Broadway in 1920 as THE BAT it proved one of the decade's most durable shows, a mixture of mystery and comic cliche. The result was a wave of similar novels, plays, and films that not only cast a long shadow but which are still very much with us today. So wait until a dark and stormy night, pour yourself a cup of warm milk, and read THE CIRCULAR STAIRCASE by flickering candlelight... and if you hear a noise in the furthermost part of the house, just tell yourself it's only Miss Innes making one of her ill-advised nocturnal investigations!GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"For decades Mary Roberts Rinehart was the queen of mystery thrillers -- the American Agatha Christie. The Circular Staircase was Rinehart's first published novel (The Swimming Pool was her last), but it is a well-constructed work in ever way. Rinehart's special gift was in the evocation of an overlying and unremitting atmosphere of unease and potential danger and it is under such an atmosphere of apprehension that she spins her stories. For some time it has been fashionable to dismiss the novels of Mary Roberts Rinehart as old fashioned. This may apply to superficial details -- such as gas lighting -- but it definitely is not true of the novels themselves which are timeless in their ability to hold the reader in a grip of mystery and suspense. The Circular Stasircase is one of the finest mystery novels ever written."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"This is an enjoyable mystery in the classic mode with some deft turns. But it is completely unedited and riddled throughout with type-os and silly mistakes. Surely no person at the publishing house read this book before it was released; I'd go so far as to say no one bothered to use spell-check to detect ludicrous errors. In most cases, the correct spelling or usage is fairly easy to figure. In one, a &quot;Mrs.&quot; should have been a &quot;Mr.&quot; and that caused a bit of confusion. Readers appreciate these budget-priced editions, but couldn't someone at the publishing house give them a look after they've been scanned into the computer? Surely a summer intern in the editorial department might even have a good time reading this pleasant little mystery."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Two hallmarks of the typical Mary Roberts Rinehart (The American Agatha Christie) mystery include both a rich, aristocratic lady (usually single), and a large, spooky house -- this one features both. \\"The Circular Staircase\\" is one of Rinehart's better works, rating just slightly below \\"The Yellow Room\\" and \\"The Red Lamp,\\" in my opinion (I've read all her works). Here's THE STORY:A noble and older lady, Miss Innes, rents a remote and huge New England home for the summer from a local banker who has gone to California for his health. Miss Innes brings along her niece and her nephew (both of whom she has raised from childhood), and both of whom are in their early 20s. It's not long before the banker's son, a local rapscallion and ne'er-do-well, is mysteriously murdered at the base of The Circular Staircase. What was he doing slinking around in the house late at night? No one seems to know.However, the nephew and his good friend (a clerk at the homeowner's bank) both soon come under suspicion of having murdered the young man. In fact, the nephew suddenly and mysteriously disappears after he is involved in a significant late-night auto crash.If this all this were not enough trouble for Miss Innes, she soon discovers that her nephew's friend (the bank clerk) may have been responsible for an embezzlement which caused the bank to go belly-up, and this additionally manifests the total loss of the two siblings' huge trust fund... and her niece has fallen madly in love with this apparent thief and scoundrel!The house itself continues to generate a notable source of terror for Miss Innes along with her aged maid who is also her skittish companion. There are lots of bumps, screams, phantom-like apparitions, and nefarious other strange happenings as the long and eventful nights pass by. All this chaos causes the domestic help to leave as fast as Miss Innes can hire them. The local police detective seems befuddled by the overwhelming mess but Miss Innes resolves to stay in the house and to solve the mystery(s).There are plenty more spooky and strange happenings including a big fire, a furtive-acting doctor, the necessity to exhume a grave in the middle of the night, a pock-marked \\"veiled lady\\"... the list is almost endless. In other words, the plot is complex and the sub-plots are several.The chronological setting for \\"The Circular Staircase\\" is the Turn of the Century (from the 19th to the 20th). The book was first published in 1908, sold over a million copies, and was the premiere literary work that launched Rinehart into national fame as an author.\\"The Circular Staircase\\" has pretty much all that any mystery could offer to a reader, including the kitchen sink. Rinehart worked in just about every possible nefarious archetype and furtive activity that we ever see in the typical cozy murder. This one is like \\"The Hardy Boys\\" for adults and it gets my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"A few years ago, in my quest to meet all the mystery writers that have influenced the genre, I discovered Mary Roberts Rinehart. Her books may fall into the gothic romance category, but I love them for another reason. She spins a good mystery story, a \\"cozy\\" that lets us have a relaxing read without getting too graphic. But what I really enjoy is experiencing the modes/attitudes of the times she wrote about. Reading her books is like stepping into history, the day-to-day life of the wealthy and poor, and their concerns, big and small. Some of this lifestyle seems crazy to us now. At the same time, some of it is the same, merely in another form. If you follow her books, she tells a tale of how things did change for the elitist class, with characters and style along the lines of Mary Higgins Clark. The Circular Staircase was written in 1907. In many ways, it shows that people haven't changed that much at all in 99 years. It's not a serious read, but it's one that will engage you in the past and keep you up late, with a bowl of popcorn, to see what happens. If you're a Clark fan, you'll love this book, and be checking out the other Rinehart novels."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"A wonderful classic mystry, involving bloodless murders without murderer's intention. In detail nicely described complicated situations with a pinch of humor. Very well connected story dots. After reading it over 20 times, I still enjoy it. I wish they had or (will) make a movie on it."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Although her name may not resonate with the public today as much as it did a century ago, Mary Roberts Rinehart has most certainly left her mark on modern-day fiction. The originator of the so-called \\"Had I But Known\\" school of detective writing, Rinehart was, for many years, the most highly paid and popular female novelist in America. Her second novel (but first to be published), \\"The Circular Staircase,\\" which was released in 1908, when Mary was 32, featured a relatively new kind of crime solver, a no-nonsense spinster in long skirts and with an abiding curiosity; though certainly not the first lady detective, the character, Rachel Innes, certainly helped pave the way for many others (the website Wikipedia currently has a list of almost 400 fictional female sleuths!). \\"The Circular Staircase\\" has been turned into a film on three occasions, and in 1920 was transformed into a play, written by Rinehart and Avery Hopwood, called \\"The Bat\\"; Batman creator Bob Kane has admitted that the Bat character was an inspiration for him. Want more? Roberts' 1930 novel \\"The Door\\" is thought to be the source for \\"the butler doing it.\\" (Perhaps I should add here that the classic 1946 film \\"The Spiral Staircase\\" is in no way related to Rinehart's book, but was rather based on Ethel Lina White's 1933 novel \\"Some Must Watch.\\") Despite these influences and past fame, however, Rinehart was an unknown quantity to this reader, until I happened to read a very laudatory article on \\"The Circular Staircase\\" in the overview volume \\"Crime & Mystery: The 100 Best Books,\\" in which author H.R.F. Keating sings its praises. Fortunately, Rinehart's classic (in addition to the author's first novel, 1906's \\"The Man In Lower Ten\\") is in print today to entertain still another generation of readers.In the book, we make the acquaintance of Ms. Innes, who rents a summer mansion in the country with her grown niece and nephew. Strange things immediately start to transpire in the house: noises in the night, eerie faces at the window, a murdered man found at the foot of the titular staircase, the nephew's disappearance, holes bored in the walls, a conflagration in the stables, a man scared to death by a possible ghost, and on and on. Throughout these increasingly bizarre happenings, Rachel manages to keep her cool, only \\"losing it\\" when her nephew is abducted, she must witness a disinterment at the local cemetery, and when she is locked in a secret room in the house with the culprit responsible for MUCH of the mishegas...though not all; Rinehart's plot is way too complex to allow for a single, simple solution like that! In retrospect, to the author's credit, this labyrinthine story line, with its large number of characters, culprits and motivations, does indeed hang together and make perfect sense, although trying to recall who knew what and when may induce a major-league migraine. As one of the professional detectives in the book, Jamieson, puts it at one point, \\"It's a hash, that's what it is.\\" But Rinehart manages to keep control of her story fairly well...though not perfectly. At one point in the book, 48 hours are said to have elapsed between the staircase murder and Rachel's nephew's return to the house, whereas a careful reading reveals that only 24 hours have elapsed. Too, in one section of the book, the house's laundress, Mary Ann, packs up her bags and leaves in fright, yet is somehow listed as still working in the house five chapters later! Still, these are quibbles. \\"The Circular Staircase\\" is a wonderful story, well told by Rachel, our narrator. It is suspenseful, at times exciting, and builds to a tremendous windup in that secret room. And Rachel's acerbic relationship with her constantly flustered housekeeper, Liddy, by the way, is consistently amusing. Oh...as far as guessing the answers to the book's many riddles, my suggestion would be to not even try. This is not the type of mystery that sets out all the clues needed for a reader to solve the puzzle. Just sit back and enjoy the vintage ride, much like Rachel does in her 1908 Dragon Fly...."},{"Title":"The Circular Staircase","review":"Wealthy family goes to the country for a rest and gets more than it bargained for - and it doesn't include much rest!

Each book follows a similar format: brief, standard biographies of the sports career of 6 or 7 athletes with an added touch ala Commentator Paul Harvey's &quot;The Rest of the Story.&quot;The added touch is how each individual athlete found that his/her faith in God made him/her a more complete human being, if not a more perfect competitor.Sadly, many of the books are out of print, but may be available in libraries or through special services of Amazon or other booksellers.I recommend these books for both parents and their preteens and teens to read. The torn social framework created by over-competitive parents living vicariously through their athlete-children cries out for repair with a strong dose of the faith found by each of Mr. Littleton's subjects.The moral is &quot;You can be a pretty good athlete or even a star WITHOUT being a jerk!&quot;"},{"Title":"Guevara Also Known As Che","review":"This book is undoubtedly an interesting read.

The overall picture I saw painted in Taibo's book was not that Che accomplished little in his short (compared to others like Mao) revolutionary life (asked shorty before his death what he was thinking, &quot;I'm thinking of the immortality of the revolution, so feared by those you serve.&quot;), but that what Che aspired to was too difficult, too complicated, to impossible for a mere mortal.

For this reason with certain apprehension I started reading this biography. In fact it was the first complete and serious Che's bio I have ever read. Later I grabbed Jon Lee Anderson's one... Of all Che's bios Paco's is the most enchanting one. It may lack the huge documention of Anderson's book, but it compensates it with an amazing style. Paco cannot divorce his own admiration of Che from his subject, but, hey, that is exactly why this book becomes so much enjoyable. I still recall grabbing the book (700 hundred pages!) one morning and going that same night to bed with the book in my hands! I couldn't stop reading it! Che's story is reflected under the light of an amazing storyteller. The episodes of Che's story are exquisitely threaded together in a masterful way. His life becomes flesh and blood in Paco's hands. The icon, the symbol of rebellion and struggle for social justice turns a man, an incredible, passionate and admirable human being throughout the book. The end cannot be better: it is ghostly but hopeful with a lot of energy and sadness and beauty: a song to Latin American history of struggle."},{"Title":"Guevara Also Known As Che","review":"As other reviewers have said, this is the best of the Che biographies. Paco Taibo does the research and tells the story in a way that brings life to a myth as few other biographers in any era have been able to do. This is Ernesto Guevara as he lived and died, and you can understand how he became \\"El Che\\" the icon of the \\"Unredeemed America\\", and what drove him inexorably towards the bullet that ended his life in the dilapidated schoolhouse at La Higuera. For anyone who has seen \\"The Motorcycle Diaries\\", this book is necessary reading. I bought it five years ago and read pretty much the whole thing in a couple days. Since then, I will often grab this book and start reading at some random point, and not put it down for an hour or so. As mentioned by someone before, once you start turning the pages it is difficult to stop. The reason for this is twofold. First, the life portrayed here was an epic journey and second, Taibo is a not only a storyteller par excellence, but has a keen sense of the history of the times and is able to inject his own commentary to illuminate many of the seminal events during the course of Che's life. He is also relating to Che from a Latin American perspective, distinctly different from what North American readers may be used to. For instance, his Mexican roots are in evidence by his comparison of the legendary Mexican comedic actor Cantinflas to Che's own occasional sense of the absurdity of life. It is these touches that also help set this biography apart from the others on Che. We see another side of the legend.The biography starts with Che's family in Argentina, and their somewhat bohemian background. We learn how the young Ernesto suffered greatly from asthma, an affliction that would shape his stoic character all his life. We also learn that at an early age he followed the Spanish Civil War and the battles of the Second World War, and not only how the motorcycle trip with Alberto Granado helped form his outlook, but how he was forced to flee for his life from Guatemala as the elected government of Arbenz was violently toppled by Uncle Sam. This was the event that caused Che to pick up a rifle and give up on democracy as a means to effect change in Latin America, as well as made him willing to be incinerated in an atomic holocaust rather than surrender to a U.S. invasion of Cuba.The history of the Cuban Revolution and Che's work for Fidel's government is fascinating reading, but perhaps the most impressive parts of the book were the last few chapters detailing the ill-fated Congo and Bolivian expeditions. The Bolivian campaign reads like a funeral dirge, but even here we see the determination and self-effacing humor of the protaganist shining through til the end. The last chapter is an inspiring summation of a life lived in the most uncompromising manner, and is probably the best eulogy written for that life. One senses the author's personal attachment to the subject, which by this time has firmly become the reader's as well.The comment by another reviewer about the poor editing was true, as there are many typos and grammatical errors in the English edition I have. I am hoping this was or could be cleaned up in later printings so as not to detract from what is a classic text. Anyone interested in the life of Guevara will find this not only required reading, but a truly superlative biography by any standard."},{"Title":"Guevara Also Known As Che","review":"I was walking around wearing one of those 'Che' T-shirts and a guy asked me some questions about him. I felt pretty stupid not knowing more than I did. So I started reading about Che. That was 3 years ago.I have read his diaries, speeches, FBI files, everything I could find....THIS was the BEST.The author is truly a Che fan, but he still points out mistakes Che made, but the best thing is he provides everything in its context. He builds the background of where Che came from, what his life was. The reader FEELS 50's 60's Latin America so you can really emphasize with the actions and emotions of the integral characters.Sum it up, even though it was a factual biography I still was totally engrossed reading 500 some pages in about 3 days, and still re-reading it.A pleasure."},{"Title":"Guevara Also Known As Che","review":"Of two most recent books on the life and death of Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara, this is the most personal and personable. Paco Taibo's translated writing touches the reader with the untouchable moments of Che's life, leaving behind the hype, the political interventions and propositions, and the devious subterfuge of reading into or out of events the vision of Che as a misguided revolutionary. Taibo tells us about a naive man who only near the end came to the beginnings of understanding how revolutions cannot be institutionalized. However, this excellent book is one star shy of perfect because of numerous typos and misspellings as well as horrible mix-ups of words and phrases in the middle of what would have been otherwise a seamless joy to read. Buy the book and read it, but have a blue pencil in hand so that, once you find the butchery of the text, you can excise it in true revolutionary fashion, so that others who come to read later will not have to suffer the confusion of trying to understand a very understandable man. Para que el Che viva, lo podremos creer."},{"Title":"Guevara Also Known As Che","review":"I read this more because I am a fan of Taibo than because of Che, but I have read other biographies of Che and this is clearly the best I've seen - one of the best biographies I have read, in fact. He makes you feel as though you knew him yourself.This edition, at least, misses getting a five-star rating from me, however, due to the perfectly atrocious editing! There are literally hundreds of typos, misspellings, poorly phrased sentences, etc. It is very distracting."},{"Title":"Guevara Also Known As Che","review":"This book is a recount or recollection of data based on events related to the life of Ernesto Guevara known as \\"El Che\\". In some sense, the book contains a lack of analysis and interpretation of the information, an aspect Jorge Castaneda (another Che's biographer) does better. In my opinion, the best chapters are the last ones where the author, using a more sensitive (and closer) approach towards his subject, narrates the events sorrounding his death at the jungles of Bolivia. I have to confess that I felt very moved.Guevara is actually the last in a long list of tragic figures of the Latin-American tradition: Atahualpa, Tupac Amaru, Sandino, Jose Marti...If you may find him anachronistic, just think about General Patton crossing the harsh European winter with the Third Army.This book should be read at a counterpoint with Castaneda's and Anderson's ones and a close observation of the chapters which serve as a kind of epilogue that converts the book in a kind of John Le Carre novel should be noticed. Because maybe the information that is not there becomes more important; the question that remains unanswered is who to blame for the terrible death Che suffered in Bolivia? He, himself as it have been said because he was a romantic? Fidel Castro alone as the easy legend turned into gossip says? or a whole chain of political intrigue related to the last years of the Cold War? So researchers, historians, writers and scholars are invited: the story of Che's life (and death) is not a closed chapter.A book I strongly recommend as a last advice and new beginning is Jorge Ricardo Masetti's \\"El furor y el delirio\\", Barcelona, Tusquets (an English version is available) by the son of Argentine journalist of the same name and a friend of Che."},{"Title":"Guevara Also Known As Che","review":"I would recomend this book to anyone,however, I thought Anderson went into much greater detail regarding Che's travels throughout Latin america and especially, his discriptions of the once dominating United Fruit Company. I really enjoyed this authors discriptions of the autrocites commited by Batista and his sectet police, he was a brutal american, puppet dictator. How can any american actually belive that america has allways stook for freadom around the world."},{"Title":"Guevara Also Known As Che","review":"I took the 1997 first edition of this book on a recent trip to Cuba, and have just now finished it. I hope the current paperback edition is better. The edition I read contained more typos and translation errors than any book I've ever read -- my estimate is at least 300 in number. A further deficiency in this book is the lack of maps, which makes following Che's Cuban campaign extremely confusing, and I never fully understood the campaign until I saw a map of it in Havana's Museum of the Revolution.The book is basically a chronological review of Che's life and at 600 pages it's an exhaustive review. Its unique feature is that all words attributed to Che are in bold print. There are a number of photographs, but the qualtiy of reproduction is poor.Despite these deficiencies, the book was a real page-turner and I recommend it for anyone who wants to understand one of the most remarkable men of the 20th Century. Possibly, you will find as I did, that in this case the man is actually bigger than the myth."},{"Title":"Guevara Also Known As Che","review":"This book is a very in-depth biography of Che Guevara. It's well researched and very informative. While it is easy to tell in places that Taibo is a fan of Che Guevara, he doesn't let bias cloud his account of Che's life completely. Some negative things are included in the story,too. The book covers Che's whole life, starting with his childhood and spanning all the way until his death. All of the author's source materials are listed and meticulously noted. The book, though obviously written from a very loving perspective, still maintains a fairly scholarly feel throughout. There's lots of detailed history. You can tell that the author set out to write a reasonably comprehensive and very factual telling of Che's life.All of the detail,though, makes for a fairly slow read and a bit of text book feel. If you're looking for light reading, this is not the book for you. If you're seriously studying Guevara, the book is a great book to add to your research list. In fact, it's a great detailed but sweeping overview to start with. If it weren't for the obviously pro-Che slant, it wouldn't be a bad choice if you were only planning on reading one book on Guevara. But since it's not a completely unbiased account, I recommend if you want to fully understand Guevara, that you read some other accounts as well."},{"Title":"Guevara Also Known As Che","review":"Taibo II has a beautiful writing style and is extremely knowledgeable on Che's life. His book reads with more credence, he interviewed many people who had various encounters with Che from a regular soldier, to a campensino, and his family. He gives a very interesting look at Che, and shows the different sides of him from a commander who shot a soldier to a man who gave a splint to a bird with a hurt leg.It also comes with a treasure trove of pictures of Che, which is always exciting in a serious book."},{"Title":"Afghan Book 2 - Leaflet 102","review":"I really wish this leaflet was still in publication. It's one of my favorites. I've made so many of the patterns. Personally I think most of them are timeless. I was fortunate to find this from a third-party Amazon vendor as my original copy is worn out."},{"Title":"Sinitic Grammar: Synchronic and Diachronic Perspectives (Oxford Linguistics)","review":"This is an excellent book on a subject that is not well covered in the literature.Several of the articles included are very specialized and on rather narrow subjects. This means that many aspects of the Sinitic grammar are not covered here at all, while others are treated in detail. To a degree this is a situation that cannot be avoided, and the use of the word \\"perspectives\\" in the title probably shows that the editor was quite aware of that fact.Over all, \\"Sinitic Grammar: Synchronic and Diachronic Perspectives\\" is a very commendable work.Leo John Moser"},{"Title":"Emily L.","review":"There are few authors as capable as Marguerite Duras. This book really, really excited me. Its a ridiculously short read, so please do yourself a favor and check it out. If you can't find it on amazon[.com] or in your local library or bookstore (I'm told it is out-of-print), try Powell's or Strand - they at least should have copies.In \\"Emily L\\" our narrator sits (and sots) in a French port cafe with her lover and closely studies a particular English couple. Before long our narrator is narrating, to her lover and to us her readers, a story about this couple's history, particularly the complex and tragic story of the English woman. What remains unclear throughout the novel is how much of this story is based on real information gathered by our narrator and how much is pure fiction, a story within the story. All indications seem to point to a near total fiction. Moreover, just how much of what we are told can we as readers use in our own parallel study of the narrator and her relationship? That question is arguably the most important one in this novel.\\"It began with fear,\\" the novel begins (3). The narrator begins by, naturally, describing the setting and introducing herself and her lover as characters. But she really doesn't tell us much (or anything actually) about either herself or her companion, except that they are both writers. Very early in the novel she tells her lover that she has plans to write about their relationship. \\"I said I'd decided to write our story.... I was going to write the story of the affair we'd had together, the one that was still there and taking forever to die\\" (12). He's not thrilled by this suggestion, but then neither is she. Here is the very heart of that fear mentioned in the novels first words, and this fear reveals itself fully by the very next page. \\"No. What I'm writing now is something else that will somehow include it - something much broader perhaps. But to write about it directly - no, that's all over, I couldn't do it\\" (13). And there it is. Nowhere in this novel do we read her own actual story in terms we can read as literally *her story*. The story we do read from that page on to the end, the story of the English couple, comes in as something of a surrogate story. Our narrator explains: \\"The book will tell the truth. Whether we said it ourselves or heard it said through a wall, someone other than you to someone other than me, it will be all the same as far as the book is concerned, so long as you heard it at the same time I did and in the same place. In the same fear\\" (16).The driving force of \\"Emily L\\" is the subjective nature of the story we're told. As our narrator is herself a novelist, \\"Emily L\\" is ultimately a novel about writing. Reading this novel we must constantly question the reliability and transparency of our narrator/author. How much of this is fiction? How much is truth? Whose truth? Why the fear? Can we learn anything about that fear in this novel? If not, is a knowledge that there is a fear enough of a story in itself? And are we satisfied, as readers, by not getting the whole story? How much more interesting is the 'barrier' story we get than the actual story? These matters, these questions, are the life and blood of the novel. The story of the English couple is compelling all by itself, but frankly its just the mechanics of Duras's infinitely clever and utterly profound novel."},{"Title":"Emily L.","review":"Emily L. is one of the required books for my current English Elective course, Post-Modern Fiction.There are two main characters in the book, a person called &quot;I&quot; and another &quot;You&quot;, both French. This couple is observing another couple in a bar, and based on what snippets of conversation they hear, they construct a story around the latter couple.This book is fiction, no doubt, but soon you begin to question which parts of the story that &quot;I&quot; constructed are based on true observation, and which parts are pure fiction.A fiction within a fiction, Emily L. draws you in completely. This is a translation, but it does not interfere with the gist, tone, or mood of the story. Some nuances might have been lost due to translation, but that does not prevent you from enjoying the book.After all, it does take a lot for a &quot;general fiction&quot;-category book to hook an avid sci-fi/fantasy reader like Yours Truly."},{"Title":"History of Philip's war: Commonly called the great Indian war, of 1675 and 1676 : also, of the French and Indian wars at the eastward, in 1689, 1690, 1692, 1696, and 1704","review":"Church's 'History of Philip's War' is one of the earliest and most popular of all the accounts of this nearly forgotten conflict that virtually decimated New England in 1675. Though it saw the deaths of a huge portion of the English and Indian populations living in New England at the time, this war and its tragic protagonist have nearly been lost down the long dark memory hole of American History. This is a shame because the story of King Philip and his war to protect his people's land and culture is one well worth remembering.First published in 1716, this book was written by the son of Colonel Benjamin Church, one of the leading participants of the war. It tells the story of the Wamponoag sachem Metacom, or King Philip as he was known to the English, the youngest son of the famous chief Massasoit. Philip attempted to maintain a peaceful co-existence with the English colonists in New England, but soon found that this was nearly impossible as more and more settlers coveted valuable Indian land. Though Indians and whites had lived peacefully side by side for several generations, it was not to last, and the simmering suspicions as well as racial and religious tensions would eventally burst forth into the bloody conflagration that would become known to history as Philip's War. The war would last for over a year and in the end, the native population of New England would be devastated, many towns and settlements burned to the ground, and the face of Indian/white relations changed forever.Philip's War set the terrible precedent for all future Indian wars in North America, and the horrible face of war of this kind would be experienced again and again over the course of the next 300 years. Church's 'History' is recommended to anyone interested in this fascinating yet tragic period in American history."},{"Title":"On becoming a woman","review":"i did not expect alot from this book but,when i finished it i was quite pleased. I,YES,I...felt liked i hadlearned a little. i expected a preachy,antiquated,religion based book lecturing girls about growing intowomanhood (\\"and do not PLAAAAAY with yourselves ladies\\"...) and what i read was a rather refreshing,unbiased,fair,truth/fact filled book to learn from. it had various chapters explaining:menstruation,sex(explained in ascientific way-not vague),emotions,what is happening to the boys bodies at this time,crushes,how to meetboys(nice ones of course),how to take care of yourself(beauty,hair,skin...),clothes,shyness,popularity,dating,about love,and the dream of marriage.the two authors are women and sometimes the writing is very personal(like actually talking to this person).there is no religious theme to this book and i am glad. the authors repect that EVERYONE had their ownbelief system and understanding others,will broaden a person's point of view in adulthood. although thetopics discussed are broad(sort of),it was STILL written in 1958 and there IS an emphasis on \\"being agood girl\\" and staying away from doing things that might be seen as racy,like dressing too sexy at 16 ormaking out(\\"petting\\"they called it then)in the back of a car,but i think we get the drift.the two chapters i liked the most were,chapter 9,\\"shy-today-popular tomorrow\\" and chapter 11,\\"all about love\\".i liked chapter 9 because it talks about being accepted as a human being,not for how beautiful,not howstylishly dressed someone is, or not how much money is in the bank,but for WHO a person is as a wholeand how they treat others-with respect and kindness. the other chapter,\\"all about love\\",really is an eyeopener,even young adults can learn from this. it does discuss sex and chastity in a good way,not preaching,no lectures that, this is right or this is wrong but,does say,IF any person whatever age,is not ready forsomething-do not do it. another discussion about love:what is it,where do we find it?,how do we know whenit is real?,what are these emotions? some of the best paragraphs in this book are in,\\" all about love\\" andalthough,it is hard to find love,it is worth the effort and don't settle for anything less.on the not so good side of things,a few parts of the book are outdated like,teens wearing girdles(!)-nomatter what! i thought this was odd. also an emphasis on women knowing how to sew and it does talk offemales having jobs,it seems the most important thing in a woman's life is marrying and having children.there is not a talk about choosing NOT to have kids or staying single for a long time...but the world wasdifferent in 1958. other than those few things,a great book."},{"Title":"FORTRAN 90","review":"I got an advice from a senior compiler designer.

Based on facts gleaned through letters and Dickinson's poetry, the story elaborates on Dickinson's 10-month school career, on her passions for women and for men, and on her final, ailing years. Like Cunningham's &quot;The Hours&quot; and Zackheim's &quot;Violette's Embrace&quot;, it's a wonderful tribute to a woman whose true life is obscured by history. Farr's rendering of Dickinson's school year brought to mind Rosemary Manning's &quot;The Chinese Garden&quot; and Dorothy Strachey Bussy's &quot;Olivia&quot;."},{"Title":"I Never Came to You in White","review":"This is a novel - a piece of fiction. I want to stress that fact because some people seem offended (or confused) that a noted scholarly authority on the subject of the poet Emily Dickinson would have fictionalized her life. Yet I doubt if many readers object to fictionalized renditions of the lives of Shakespeare or Byron or Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Sometimes the dry facts of scholarship and perfectly edited scholarly editions of letters don't bring the subject to life as a novel can. And bringing Emily to life, to say nothing of her era (which is becoming more and more remote by the day to modern young people), is just what Prof. Farr has done.First, let me say that the epistolary form is perfect for this story; it allows the same events to be viewed from differing perspectives and keeps the author's POV invisible.The symbolism of wearing white pervades the story. At Mary Lyon's repressive seminary for young girls in puritan-dominated New England of the 1840s, emphasis is placed on \\"declaring for Christ\\" and ensuring one's place in heaven as part of the Chosen. (Ironically, cramming love-starved young girls together in one place encourages lesbian tendencies to flower, and it is even more ironic that the Headmistress herself is revealed to have \\"sinned\\" in this way herself as a young woman.) Mention is made of the white robes donned in Revelations after they have been washed in the blood of the Lamb. Emily chooses to wear white even though she has not \\"declared for Christ\\"; it's a symbol of her faith, but her god is not Christ the Lamb but the \\"Master\\" - Poetry, Inspiration, Imagination, the Muse. The nature of the \\"Master\\" seems perfectly clear to me, especially at the very end of the book.One of her letters to Sue (for whom she has a lesbian passion as a 17-year-old) contains one of the most important passages in the book: \\"I would declare for Christ if I could feel his presence in my heart as you do, and Abiah does. What I feel in my heart is a speaking Silence that is holy enough. But hush! tell no one of it. I have heeded beautiful tempters. The Angel of my Annunciation the Testament does not speak of. I never came to you in white. Therefore, you really do not know me yet, Sue.\\" When Emily goes to the entity that is her personal god, she does go in white - her poetic gifts automatically make her one of the Chosen. Sue is not yet fully Emily's object of worship and unfortunately turns out to be unworthy of Emily's love. And ultimately who can say which god is more real - Christ or the Muse? Perhaps one could view the two as one thing.It is the inner life of Emily Dickinson that we glimpse here, and that is what really matters with a poet of her stature. Recommended for anyone who loves good poetry and has an interest in poets and what makes them the special creatures that they are."},{"Title":"I Never Came to You in White","review":"This is a very entertaining book, especially for fans of Emily's poetry. The prose is delicate and gripping, and many times I found myself actually believing that Emily had written these letters.I wouldn't use it is a source for an essay or research project, but if you enjoy Emily's poetry, I recommend giving this one a look."},{"Title":"I Never Came to You in White","review":"A Biography with Factual ErrorsI had been warned that this book was poorly written and edited, that it had no documentation, and thatit did not succeed in proving the author's arguments. Nothing, however, could ever have prepared me for the inaccuracies and unwarranted assumptions of the book itself.Ms. Farr's thesis itself contains a serious error in fact. She states, without qualification, that Emily Dickinson wore a nuns habit because she did not know who the master was.The book goes downhill from here. Ms. Farr's evidence that no one is Master includes several loosely-crafted - one might rather say, accidental - stories about liaisons between Emily Dickinson and her women acquaintances.Farr builds several arguments on speculation. Perhaps the most egregious example is the questionof Susan's house next door. After establishing the existence of the ivory gown, Farr asserts, in a short but vacuous epilogue that she really doesn't know who master was. Or maybe there wasn't a master. Or if there was, any body's guess is as good as hers.For several pages Farr proceeds as if this connection were fact, making a few tenuous connections between Dickinson's poetry and women, and kisses behind closed doors. Then she admits it is all fiction. In addition, Farr tells us that when Emily died, the master was known but then she does not feel that s/he is known, as it might be a woman.I have saved just enough space for the epilogue and the bulk of the book. The epilogue is not worth the meager price of this empty paperback.English teacher in Texas"},{"Title":"The Visualization Toolkit: An Object Oriented Approach to 3D Graphics 3rd Edition","review":"This is the right book if you are begining with Scientific Visualization.

Even for beginners, this book is a smash hit! It features images by people from intustrial light and magic (Made Star Wars) and it has great details on rotoscoping quicktime movies! If all else fails, there is a CD included that contains over 50 actions, filter demos, and images, A definite MUST BUY!"},{"Title":"The Photoshop 4 Wow! Book: Tips, Tricks, & Techniques for Adobe Photoshop 4 : Macintosh Edition (Wow Books)","review":"I bought this book on it's graphics alone, and I was rewarded by my choice. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is that the tutorials could be a little less confusing. As well as a couple of mistakes that I had to write in the book to remind myself of. Other than that, the price of the book is almost worth it just to get the cd. The actions included are unstoppable. Plus the tutorials, which as I previously stated could be a little clearer, compliment the actions on the disk. Giving you the step-by-step to mimic them(actions). Plus you can amaze and astound your friends with the techniques learned from this book. I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"The Photoshop 4 Wow!

Book: Tips, Tricks, & Techniques for Adobe Photoshop 4 : Macintosh Edition (Wow Books)","review":"This book provides examples of how to do certain special effects.It was definitely more of a &quot;tips and tricks&quot; book than it was a learning resource. Just follow the steps, and go &quot;WOW&quot; just like the title.It doesn't really explain in detail how the trick was done and why you're doing a certain step. Most photoshop gurus will just scoff at this book, and most newbies will walk away amazed, but no smarter about photoshop than before they read it.The latter portions of the book was nothing more than a summary of the different photoshop filters found in commercial filter packages.

I have read it over and over and in some cases dissected each section by writing out each step of the process before actually trying it on my own projects. It helped me immensely to &quot;ace&quot; my Photoshop class this semester. I would only recommend it however, for the &quot;tenacious&quot; beginner.

In this tale of spellbinding suspense, we see how each attempts to deal with his or her own inner struggles. In doing so, the four college students immerse themselves in the fantasy role-playing game, Mazes and Monsters. One of them will never return to reality. We are invited to feel their triumphs and heartaches, their joys and their pain, which will stay with readers long after the last page is turned. A must read!!!"},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"I'm surprised to see an accumulation of negative reviews. This book hits a continuing American theme...concern over youthful obsession. You could replace Dungeons & Dragons with Pokemon or the latest craze. Even as I write this I'm listening to a news story about a kid who committed suicide after becoming engrossed in online video games.While the book is not at the very top of my list for chapter flow and solid writing, it is quite enjoyable. If you read it in the context that it is a glimpse into parental concerns from a couple decades ago, it will be much more enjoyable. It certainly outshines most of the current glut of novels on the bestseller lists."},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"The setting is Grant University in Pequod, Pennsylvania. When four students embark on the role-playing game Mazes and Monsters, they encounter more than they bargin for when things get out of hand. With shear terror and convincing description, Rona Jaffe presents a compelling tale which lies on a fine line between fantasy and reality. As Robbie, Jay Jay, Daniel and Kate become more involved in &quot;the game&quot;, they must bring themselves out of the darkness they have fallen into, and find their way back to reality. The adventures they embark upon lure the reader to the depths beyond; entising him to play along with them, and venture into their world..."},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"Oh, please! The book was fantastic. I read it last year, and I still thought the plot was fresh. The romance was out of an earlier time, of course, but I still found it endearing to the characters. It was the bonding between them that made them accept/need each other. (If you are not a gamer, I would recommend The Other Woman by Rona Jaffe and An American Love Story, too. If you are a gamer, you should read A Confederacy of Dunces. There's a character in it, Miss Trixie, that reminds me of your &quot;enlightened&quot; approach to chomping on people with their false teeth.)"},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"I haven't thought about this book in years. I was in elementary school when a made-for-TV version of it came out (if memory serves, Tom Hanks was in that, poor bastard...). I was about ten years old, I guess. Whatever the case, for some reason I became very interested in reading it. And I did. I have a vague memory of being proud of myself for reading a 'grown-up book' in a very short time, but the fact that a ten-year old could mow through this loser should tell you something, and in retrospect, I had nothing to be proud of. At the time, I was pretty much mystified by the whole thing. A guy who goes insane from playing the title game? D&D; as the ultimate decadence for idle rich kids? It just left me a little confused back then, but reading these reviews brought a smile to my face, as I rethought what was obviously a cheap way to cash in on a headline-grabbing topic of years gone by.So in retrospect (some 20 years later?), what you've got is indeed a WASPY, suburban, once-semi-pertinent, novel about some college kids who play a game, with (cue the scary music) dire consequences. Which is just as goofy as it sounds. Yep, it's pretty much a pointless warning to alarmist suburban moms, and it belongs firmly in the 'time capsule' department, right next to all the other sensitive treatments of problems that never quite seemed to materialize....On the other hand, I learned the word 'coprolite' from this book, and for some reason remember something called the \\"Graven Eye of Timor(?),\\" that caused Tom Hanks some real problems. I think. And there's an expensive watch that plays an important role. I think. So obviously something stuck with me, even if it was just petrified dinosaur doo-doo. Rona Jaffe, you stink. In fact, you're nothing but a coprolite. And I swear it by the Vengeful Poobahs of Forgotten Mediocritus...Whew. But seriously, it's easy to laugh now that the long national nightmare of D&D-induced; insanity has finally come to an end. It cost an extraordinary number of lives, and we'll never forget the tragedy. Let's just be thankful that there continue to be authors brave enough to deal with genuine threats to the nation such as this. Run-- don't walk-- to your nearest Salvation Army outlet, and pick up a copy of the book that might have saved your child's life, had it actually had anything to do with actual threats to America's youth twenty-plus years ago!"},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"I read this book a few years after it came it out. Granted, I haven't re-read it recently, but I disagree with some of the other, more-negative reviews.I actually liked the character sketches that Jaffe used. Finding out about the characters' backgrounds, and those of their parents, did a good job of showing how they became the people they are in the present. And where some of their individual problems came from.With regards to the social events that were going on at the time that this book was written, I have a few thoughts. What many \\"protect the child\\" groups miss--whether they're attacking heavy metal music, Dungeons and Dragons, or Harry Potter--is that people don't do bad things because of a book or a song. They do so because they make a conscious choice to act badly. And they arrive at this decision more as a result of their poor upbringing (not being taught right from wrong, plus concern for others) and their current environment (being bullied, being pressured to be an \\"A\\" student) than anything else.\\"Mazes and Monsters\\" points out that the character of Robbie had problems before he played the game. And if it wasn't the game that acted as the catalyst for his break from reality, it would've been something else.That's something I think that everybody missed."},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"I think somebody should write a novel about a bunch of college students who get obsessed with the game \\"Monopoly\\" and one student ends up buying up real estate and charging his friends to stay in his newly acquired addresses. Or how about \\"Operation\\" where little kids start to operate on one another - for real! That would sure give a twist to the old ad where the mother walks in with grocery bags, looks at the camera and asks, \\"Operate?\\"Considering that Rona Jaffe wrote this novel, it's clear that the target audience was not the young college students who were involved in role-playing games. This books follows the Jaffe formula established in \\"The Best of Everything\\": take multiple characters, throw them together and watch what happens; that sad thing is that it almost works. \\"Mazes and Monsters\\" is at its most incisive when Jaffe gives us background on the mothers of the main characters; these are women not far removed from those in \\"Everything\\", only this time Jaffe shows what happens after the girls get married and live \\"happily ever after.\\" If Jaffe had focused more on that, perhaps an interesting novel could have come of it. But no, we get a novel shrewdly capitalizing on the \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" paranoia of the early 80s. None of the four main characters - Robbie, Daniel, Kate or Jay Jay - come to life and their \\"Oh gosh, let's never play this cursed game again!\\" epiphany is forced and the stuff of Afterschool Specials, although the book was made into an infamous primetime TV movie in 1982.As far as Jaffe's career goes, this book has become a footnote but at the same time, is the book that perhaps stirred the most controversy. Quite the paradox."},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"Google \\"Dallas Egbert\\" if you want the inspiration for this unfortunate piece of fiction.The problem with this book is not that it tries to turn a tragedy into a novel (... after all, that's how Shakespeare got \\"Romeo And Juliet\\" ...), but that it does so poorly. In this, I blame the editor, not the author; for an author may become so entranced with what to her may be a novel concept that she needs an editor to insist that the book also include plot, character and/or memorable language. This book has the mark of being rushed to print to suit the news; for example, about half the chapters are simply the character sketches that would have been helpful in planning the book but that should not have been included in it.But do google \\"Dallas Egbert\\". Now THAT's an interesting story!"},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"&quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; reminds me somewhat of Frederic Wertham's &quot;Seduction of the Innocent.&quot; At the time it was written, roleplaying games, especially Dungeons &amp; Dragons, were, depending on who you listened to, being used to brainwash our children into becoming homicidal maniacs, junkies, Satanists, or homosexuals. &quot;60 Minutes&quot; even did a piece where they tried to prove that D&amp;D was making kids commit suicide. &quot;Mazes and Monsters&quot; was Ms. Jaffe's attempt to cash in on this hysteria with a fictionalized accounting of a real incident and it shows. The characters are cardboard cutouts and the plot boring and predictable. She apparently couldn't even be bothered to do enough research to get the basic facts of the case straight or else chose to ignore them in order to make the story more sensationalistic. Do yourself a favor and pass on this book. If you really want to read something along this vein, John Coyne's &quot;Hobgoblin&quot; is far superior. He didn't get the game details right either but at least his characters aren't as cliched as Jaffe's and his storyline is much more interesting and involving."},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"I read this book, plus Jaffe's \\"Reunion\\" books, years ago, as a high school student devouring any book I could get my hands on. Taste and discrimination (a word that used to have positive connotations) would come later.Jaffe specializes in the sort of mass-market novels that, unfortunately, are thought of as \\"women's fiction,\\" just as \\"Cosmopolitan\\" and similar magazines are thought of as \\"women's magazines.\\" These categories work if you believe that all American women like to read long, drawn-out novels that are all about relationships and feelings.Myself, I'd rather read S/F and fantasy, plus non-fiction (and I don't mean \\"self-help\\" books). But since my sub-demographic is smaller, and I don't buy all that hairspray and makeup, I don't think my opinion counts for much with the marketers.Anyway, as the other negative reviews have said, this book was a cheap attempt to cash in on the hysteria surrounding \\"Dungeons & Dragons.\\" The target audience is the \\"Cosmo gal,\\" or the subscriber to \\"Good Housekeeping\\" ... a stereotypically feminine woman who doesn't get into all that icky geek stuff and finds it somewhat threatening, so is relieved to have her suspicions confirmed that there's something inherently unhealthy about it. Many such women are \\"soccer moms\\" and other mothers who seem to want the world purged of all dangers for The Sake of Da Chyldrun!. Once upon a time, there was a word for this: \\"overprotective.\\" Notice how you never hear it used much anymore?The parallels between D&D; 20 years ago and the Internet today are hard to miss. Then, as now, it was mostly those who were ignorant of the new phenonmenon who screamed the loudest about its \\"dangers.\\" And, just like video games and billiards before it, D&D; now seems almost quaint. Lots of D&D; players are upwards of 40 and hold down very steady and respectable jobs; many have kids themselves.Even more ironic, all those soccer moms who are so terrified of \\"the Internet\\" leaping into their living rooms and molesting their chyyyyllldruuun are now online! Except they mainly keep to their own little forums in which they can exchange their inane sentiments, complete with endless rows of exclamation points, sappy MIDIs, and saccharine animated GIFs.Stay there, please, and leave the rest of us alone."},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"This book qualifies as one of the most inaccurate portrayals of gamers and Role-Playing Games ever. Quite simply, gamers are quite able to distinguish between reality and fantasy, unlike as portrayed in this book (even in the portions which are supposed to be realistic)."},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"Rona Jaffe seems to know very little about roleplaying games and roleplayers and this translates over to her story. It is really sad that she stooped so low in joining an assault on a game, what a shame."},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"Wow, yet another attempt to scapegoat yet another subject. When will people stop attempting to blame their problems on outside sources, when the blame for their personal problems rests squarely upon their shoulders, and nowhere else.When people go out and commit murder and blame it on the deity of their world famous relgion, do we hear any calls to ban that religion? No. That would be *ridiculous*. So is everything written in this book from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Mazes and Monsters","review":"I read this book while I was in college, when I did dabble a bit in Dungeons &amp; Dragons in my fraternity, which was coed. I never thought of this book as trying to cash in on the D&amp;D hysteria that might have been hyped in the mid 80s. This book transcends all of that. The D&amp;D simplification is too sophomoric. The insanity, or as the Spanish have a word for it, &quot;ensimismamiento,&quot; although it seems irreversible for one of the characters at the end, parallels &quot;Catcher in the Rye.&quot; Both stories convey despair and hope simultaneously, as life becomes a parallax. I was entranced with this book 18 years ago, and I'm on line at amazon.com buying the used copy. Don't buy the oversimplifications of some of the tweaked-out D&amp;D naysayers. Read this book and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog","review":"Shannon did a fantastic job of &quot;introducing&quot; Swissies. The book is a great primer -- if you're interested in learning about this beautiful breed, this is the best place to start. There are other books out there with more beautiful photos, but the text is fluff. This book, however, is less concerned about portraying Swissies as the &quot;perfect family dog&quot; than portraying them honestly with simple, truthful information that is easily assimilated by any reader."},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog","review":"I found this book a good resource for breed-specific information. It contains several mentions of specific problems (in some cases, non-problems) to keep an eye out for in this breed."},{"Title":"An Introduction to the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog","review":"A great book for those interested in the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog (Swissy's). After reading Ms Hennigan's book, you'll no doubt fall in love with this fine breed.

The bad thing is Kuga, as the writer, never grasped the personality or appeal of each character. The subtlety of the anime and the balance of the various personalities aboard the Bobop is lost. The most infuriating is Spike has taken on a whole new personality of stupidity. Instead of a cleverness hidden behind his nonchalant attitude, he has become Bebop's grunt, driven by hunger and little else. There's a reason the manga is being canceled after issue 2."},{"Title":"Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, Book 1","review":"This manga is the first of a two part series by Cain Kuga. Cain Kuga was approached to do a manga version of Cowboy Bebop. This was before bebop even became a phenomenon.The stories in the manga offer a different take on how Spike, Jet, Faye, Ein, and Ed get together. The bounty hunters get involved with a mysterious syndicate with a 13 year old commander named Scorpion.The character's personalities are more or less the same. Spike is a little more irritable than in the series. He protests hugely when the new members come aboard, even more so than he did in the cartoon. Edward is still a little off. Faye doesn't show up until the end but no notible difference was seen in her either.The manga is well-written and on par for the bebop personalities. It reads very fast and there is alot of action. Although it is good, it isn't great. Nothing really stands out. It just offers a different story for the origin of the crew, and a different villian. Of course, bebop fans just have to check it out, out of principle."},{"Title":"Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, Book 1","review":"Fans of the more mature plot and scant sight gags of Cowboy Bebop may be disappointed to learn that this manga has less of the first and more of the second. I for one love it. Its a fresh new take on the franchise and I like how the characters are drawn a lot. The plot seems a little generic a this time but hopefully it'll pick up in the next book."},{"Title":"Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, Book 1","review":"I absolutely loved the anime of Cowboy Bebop. This book is set in the same universe with the same characters. Their stories, however, have changed. The way we meet Ed, Faye, Ein, and the history of Spike and Jet are different based on the author's take on the characters. Some might not like this, but I like the new twist on their relationships. Plus the author has added a whole new badguy! Since the TV series is over, it is also like getting all new Bebop stories. I haven't read the rest in this manga series so I don't know how they continue, but if you are dying for more Spike and don't mind the alternate reality, I highly recommend the book!If you don't want the stories to change, consider picking up the Cowboy Bebop series by Hajime Yadate and Yutaka Nanten, ISBN#1931514917, simply called Cowboy Bebop Book 1 etc. These are more like continuing adventures that take place in between what would have been a TV episode."},{"Title":"Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, Book 1","review":"It was a refreshing twist to the Bebop universe. Spike's style was made a little, um, too pushy. He cared too much for his ship. Ed is still Ed, but has a more animeish (is that a word?)look to her (him? not sure about it this time around.)Jet hasn't changed with the new artist, but Faye has turned into a snobby brat. The art is hectic in the fight scenes, but is okay as is. Is worth a look for hardcore Bebop fans, but not for newcomers. See you space cowboy."},{"Title":"Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, Book 1","review":"This series is a retelling of Cowboy Bebop supposedly, except for some reason Cain Kuga destroyed the characterization of everyone. Spike is now much lazier than the original, and lacks the laid back yet serious stature he has in the anime, Ed is now a whiny little brat, and Faye is nothing but a brainless (...) The artwork is ugly to look at... no, the character designs are okay, but the action is drawn so odd that it is impossible to tell what is going on. And the stories themselves are very lacking, they do not have the Bebop feeling that the anime does, and devoid of any characterization. Listen to this review: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID! I've goofed up so none of you will make the same mistake like me!"},{"Title":"Cowboy Bebop: Shooting Star, Book 1","review":"The 2 volume Shooting Star storyline by manga writer and artist Cain Kuga uses most of the same characters as the Cowboy Bebop anime series but places them in alternative situations and gives them slightly different origins.This first volume introduces the entire Cowboy Bebop crew as if the previous anime and manga never existed in 5 stand-alone stories, or \\"shoots\\". In the first, Spike and and Jet are hired to find a renegade body double of an organized crime boss. In the second we are introduced to Edward. The third story brings Ein into the picture. In the fourth story the crew are sent to catch The Scorpion, a dangerous Dragon Head general who escaped from the prison planet of Pluto. The last story introduces the always ravishing Faye Valentine as she attempts to steal the Bebop.I liked these stories. I think the idea of the series was to start afresh without being bogged down by backstory. It worked because none of the characters were scrapped really. It was the same old bebop with subtle differences. They didn't have any of the dark tragedy that to me seemed to plague some of the later Bebop sessions. If you're a fan you'll enjoy these, and if you've never read Bebop before you could start here. I have no idea why the second volume of Shooting Star is not availible here at Amazon. I would highly recommend the Sessions and movie on DVD and the previous manga trilogy that came before Shooting Star."},{"Title":"Creative Cognition: Theory, Research, and Applications","review":"Not many authors dare look into creative cognition approaches to creativity.

The 4x4 Performance Portfolio is a compilation of articles and advertisements from various automotive publications. Most were written during the production of the '66-'77 Bronco and are a window into the past. My only complaints are few. First, some of the articles are incomplete; they have been cut off literaly in mid-sentence, leaving you wondering what happened. The book's page numbers continue without interruption, so it must have been a publishing oversight. Secondly, the book is entirely in black and white, save for the cover art.

As a woman wanting to lose weight and get in shape, I was eager to read this book.She begins by talking about stress and personality type. Stress is a HUGE issue for women today, and I always find personality type discussions fascinating. However, I much prefer looking at personality the Myers-Briggs way. The Myers-Briggs test comes up with 16 different personality types, as opposed to only 4 personality types discussed by Florence and Marita Littauer. Obviously, everyone is unique and no two people have identical personality types, but with the Myers-Briggs, at least you have more possibilities to work with.Dr. Carter does an excellent job dealing with so many important topics in one book! I especially enjoyed her chapters nutrition. I liked her chapter on exercise too, but wish she had gone into a little more detail. Overall, this is an excellent book to add to your library!You can read more about Carrie Carter on her website. I do wish she would write a book telling about her own personal health struggles. She has Meniere's disease and has been homebound for several years, despite treatment. She has had to stop her private medical practice, but God has used this situation in her life to give her time to write books! As someone who lives with a chronic health problem, I'd like to hear more from Carrie about this subject!Please check out my other reviews! God bless you all, and I hope this book spurs you onto pursuing a healthier lifestyle."},{"Title":"The Never Came Back","review":"GREAT non-fiction!

From popular music from West Side Story to jazz to &quot;serious art music&quot; like Chichester Psalms and his Mass, Bernstein was never constrained by any seeming limitations. This book is a compilation Bernstein's writings. The first section consists of dialogues between Bernstein and several imaginary characters regarding society's philosophy of music. These discussions are quite intellectual and thought-provoking. The second section contains seven television transcripts about subjects ranging from Musical Theater to J.S. Bach. This half is much more accessible and a breeze to read. If you can't read music, you would enjoy getting CDs of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, Brahms' First Symphony, and Bach's St. Matthew Passion before curling up with this book.

His description of how perfect the Fifth was defies description; you had to have seen him use musicians as notes and move them around to show what happened if one note had changed. Or how a little discussion around a table with a man and a woman becomes something else again when sung (La Boheme) or explaining about a piece concerning a little nightengale when introducing Stravinsky.The man was pure genious and millions of Americans became interested in classical music through this man.

The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming. These men are novices and not prophecy \\"experts\\" or \\"scholars\\" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians. Why continue to be deceived? Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, \\"The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea,\\" provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW. Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: \\"The REAL Rapture\\". If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's \\"The REAL Rapture\\" (based on a volume in his forthcoming \\"Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period\\" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items)."},{"Title":"The Popular Encyclopedia of Bible Prophecy: Over 150 Topics from the World's Foremost Prophecy Experts (Tim LaHaye Prophecy Library(TM))","review":"As the name implies, this is an encyclopedic reference for Scriptural prophesy.

It is key to know this in purchasing this book. He defines and critiques other views, such as Post-Tribulation Rapture and Amillenialism.This is a superb book for reference regarding literal-exegetical prophetic teachings and a basic discussion of allegorical alternative views.

Adopted from the orphanage that Eliot Ness managed to get him placed into after the murder of his father, Michael grew up trying to put the past behind him. He went off to serve his county in the Second World War, only to find that the skills he learned while on the road with his father, such as his ability to kill when it has to be done, have been awakened and built upon. He fights valiantly, losing an eye but gaining a Medal of Honor (he's the first to win one in the war) and a ticket off Bataan. He still wants to serve --- he can fire a gun, even with one eye missing --- but Uncle Sam seems to have other ideas.At first he obediently goes along with the plans, but his insistence about speaking out against the government pulling out of Bataan, leaving his fellow fighters behind, loses him his active status. Ness, calling him in, offers to get it back, if he goes undercover. The Capone organization has changed since Al went to jail. They've made mistakes, and Frank Nitti, the boss in Al's place who is still supposedly taking orders from the man who now lives in Florida, might be ripe for the fall. Michael is eager to join. His own father went to Capone for help in his vendetta against the men responsible for the death of his wife and Michael's little brother, but instead Capone ordered his death. When he gets next to Nitti, he finds that he might be the lesser of two evils; the man set to take over is a much harder, greedier person. Soon he's trying to figure out where his loyalties lie and how he can stay true to himself while being drawn deeper and deeper into a life that you only leave feet first.We do have a break in the story to revisit Michael, Sr. This would be an interesting short story in itself, but it has some parallels to the main story that serve to underline what his son is going through. Like Michael, Jr., Michael, Sr. works for a man who treats him like a son. Unlike his own son, he joined because he was desperate to make a good life, and the deeper he gets into the organization, the better the life he has. In both stories, Collins makes a point of saying that individuals such as Capone and John Looney seemed like good people, just giving the working man a chance to have a drink. They also gave immigrants --- Irish, in Looney's case --- an opportunity to succeed in the new world, a place that can be very unforgiving. Both Nitti and Looney treat the O'Sullivans very well and are rewarded --- though tempered, in Michael, Jr.'s case --- with loyalty. As in the main story, we also see that there are people involved who do not dance in the gray area; they undoubtedly are bad people who use their position to gratify their worst desires.THE ROAD TO PURGATORY mixes the excitement of 1940s mafia life with realism. There are stretches where Michael doesn't have to do anything, and his life is fairly normal. Though we don't experience these moments much, they do act as a lull for Michael, making it easy for him to ignore the reality of where he is. But when the time comes for him to fight, he doesn't hesitate. He is, genuinely, a good man. He avoids the woman he loves, his high school sweetheart, because he doesn't want to involve her in his world, but he does treat well the lady who he takes up with. He is, for the most part, honorable; he's not perfect --- far from it --- but like his father, he has decency at his core. And this book illustrates how a good person can find himself on a road that he simply cannot pull off of.Fascinating and well-researched, THE ROAD TO PURGATORY gives a true feel for the time while making readers wonder what they would do in the two situations presented here. The answers are not easy.--- Reviewed by Cindy Lynn Speer"},{"Title":"Road to Purgatory","review":"Michael Satariano, formerly Michael O'Sullivan, Jr., son of John Looney's \\"Angel of Death,\\" has become the one-eyed war hero who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for his service in Bataan. He is looking to avenge his father's murder by the famous Chicago gangster Al Capone, now released from prison but sequestering himself from all but his most intimate fellows (including acting Outfit boss, Frank Nitti) due to the advanced debilitating effects of syphilis.To succeed in doing that, Michael will have to infiltrate the highest echelons of the Outfit, using his apparent Sicilian heritage to his benefit (Papa Satariano, his adoptive father, ran a restaurant that was a favorite hangout of Outfit personnel), and with the full knowledge of FBI agent Eliot Ness, who has kept Michael's true identity a secret (and even assisted with his eventual adoption).Part sequel (Collins considers this a sequel primarily to his Road to Perdition novelization -- the events begin ten years later) and part prequel (four chapters focus on Michael O'Sullivan, Sr.'s, role in a political riot in 1922, his antagonistic relationship with Connor Looney, and the birth of Mike's brother, Peter), Road to Purgatory is, above all, a novel of betrayal. Mike can't seem to keep his word to anyone but himself, not even the too-good-to-be-true hometown girl he left behind when he went to war, and a good deal of the novel's suspense comes from wondering when Frank Nitti, who all but adopts Mike as a surrogate son, will find out the truth. Mike digs himself deeper with each new relationship and things really start to fall apart when someone from his pre-war past resurfaces in the present.The Chicago gangland of the 1920s, '30s, and '40s is author Max Allan Collins' specialty. Eliot Ness, in particular, has appeared in so many of his novels (specifically this and his Nathan Heller series, as well as his own starring series of novels and other media) that it is almost a surprise when he is absent (like in Collins' Disaster series, like The War of the Worlds Murder, featuring mystery writers as amateur detectives). Luckily, Ness plays a major role in Road to Purgatory (though, with Prohibition over, he's pretty much stuck fighting that other social pariah, venereal disease, giving him yet another connection to Capone).Collins' characteristic exhaustive research (he even lets us in on the Outfit's \\"made man\\" ceremony) adds considerable depth and atmosphere to this not-so-simple revenge tale, the middle story in a saga named after the three parts of Dante's Divine Comedy. He takes the bold step of making Capone and Nitti sympathetic characters and manages to add Nitti's death into the narrative in a way that does not contradict his earlier dramatization of it in his Nathan Heller novel, The Million-Dollar Wound. And the best part is the saga of Michael Satariano is not over yet, and I can't wait to sink my teeth into the final entry of the saga, taking place primarily in the 1970s, Road to Paradise. Fans of the graphic novel of Road to Perdition will also want to seek out the graphic sequel of sorts (really an expansion of the middle), Road to Perdition 2: On the Road."},{"Title":"Road to Purgatory","review":"A decade may have passed since Capone killed his family, but Michael Satariano nee O'Sullivan never forgot even when he though he was lovingly adopted. Now twenty, Michael is on Bataan where he wipes out a Japanese division, loses an eye, but is a survivor of the death march. Michael receives the Congressional Medal of Honor and an honorable discharge.Back in the States, Michael believes it is time to become the avenging angel of death. Through Papa Satariano, Michael meets Capone's Lieutenant Frank Nitti, who hires him as a welcome addition to the Outfit. Eliot Ness thinks he is exploiting Michael as an insider breaking up Capone's Outfit. As Michael causes destruction, mayhem and death from the inside, back in 1922 in Rhode Island, Michael Sr., the chief enforcer for Irish Godfather John Looney, is about to become a father for the first time, not realizing that the newborn was to become a killing chip off the old block..This sequel to the ROAD TO PERDITION is an exciting but very bloody suspense crime thriller starring an intriguing protagonist whose soul was sucked out of him a decade earlier. Ironically, Michael's amoral murdering spree as an American soldier and a mob soldier will fascinate readers yet because he is so frozen without even a hint of remorse he is unlikable and the tale fails to show heart. Still this is a solid O'Sullivan next generation entry that contains parallel stories of unaffected 1940s Michael, Jr. vs. the elation of 1920s Michael, Sr. when he becomes a daddy (albeit still a killing machine - must be in the DNA).Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Road to Purgatory","review":"This was a gift for someone who has been looking for this particular book for a long time. Was delighted in finding it for him."},{"Title":"Road to Purgatory","review":"Let me get the blemishes out of the way, first (my nitpicking self just can't help it): Though the author obviously knows more than I about mob/mafia history, he blundered the facts a little in the Bataan segment...AND pushed the limits of believability maybe a wee bit too far.Michael Satariano (AKA Michael Sullivan) is a troubled soul who, superficially, seems to be the perfect all-American hero. But his dark, troubled past makes it impossible for him to accept the pedestal. He is what Bruce Wayne would be like in real life (without the money). Like the Batman's alter-ego, he lost his family at a young age in a violent, traumatic fashion, to murderous criminals--and he thirsts for vengeance.The story opens on the Phillippenes prior to MacArthur's evacuation. Michael's heroism and combat prowess (dwarfing that of the Transporter and the most outlandish John Woo protagonists) win him the 1st Medal of Honor in WWII, and a golden ticket back stateside where the world is his for the taking.Haunted by his father's legacy and a lethal impulse triggered by his experiences fighting the Japanese, he dumps his perfect all-American girlfriend (who kept faithful to him while he was away), pisses away a wide-open world full of opportunities available to him, and follows a path of self-destruction. Elliot Ness is making a comeback in Chicago, and needs somebody to infiltrate the Capone mob. Without batting an eyelash, Michael signs on, and uses his Sicilian adopted father's Chicago connections to ensnare himself in the corrupt gangland leviathan.Ness' impossible guidelines are to avoid breaking the law while winning the trust of the top mob bosses. But Michael gets trigger-happy on his first assignment, becomes a \\"made man\\" inside his first year, and quickly works his way closer to the men who ordered his father's death.So intimately is the main character entangled with real historical figures like Ness, Al Capone, Frank Nitti and Sam Giancana, that you'll probably be tempted to do some historical research afterwards, to see just how much liberty the author took with facts. I am.Or you can just hang on for an engrossing, blood-splattered ride with a fascinating backdrop, while Michael's allegiances shift faster than a free agency era star-caliber NFL player's.Henry Brown is the author of Virtual Pulp, as well as the military thriller Hell and Gone. He is the columns editor at New Pulp Fiction, and does some blogging of his own at the Two-Fisted Blogger."},{"Title":"Road to Purgatory","review":"Now here's a curious book -- it's a novel written as a sequel to a graphic novel, Max Allan Collins and Richard Piers Rayner's 1998 work Road to Perdition (which was made into the movie starring Tom Hanks and Paul Newman). Ten years after the events of the first book Michael O'Sullivan Jr. comes home from World War II with the fame of being a war hero -- fame that Eliot Ness hopes to channel into a last-ditch effort to bring down the Capone mob in Chicago once and for all.Having read both the original graphic novel and Collins' own novelization of the film, I feel like I know these characters quite well at this point. Collins has a real talent for blending real historical figures like Frank Nitti and John Looney into a fictional tapestry that seems like it very well could be real. People who read the original graphic novel will feel for Mike, feel even for Mike Sr., as his son spirals down the same terrible road that consumed his own life.The writing is crisp and the characters are strong, but even at a brief 288 pages, Collins tends to wander about a bit. There's an extended flashback sequence to an adventure of Mike Sr. that really doesn't serve any purpose in advancing the plot. Apparently the point is to accentuate how much Mike Jr. is becoming like his father, but you don't really need it. It's a good story in its own right, but it doesn't have any impact on the events of the novel as a whole except to accentuate that Mike Sr. never wanted his son to follow in his path, which is something anyone who read the original (or saw the movie) already knew.Still, it's a strong novel and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Now to find the last book in the trilogy, Road to Paradise."},{"Title":"Road to Purgatory","review":"Collins at the top of his form with this terrific sequel to \\"Perdition.\\" A real page-turner, the author has broken the book into three parts which work seamlessly while leaving the reader dangling in suspense. Using historical figures in the novel make the book just all that more more engrossing. Top notch characterization, ambience, and dialogue, the book is cleverly comprised and not over-long...just right to keep the pulse pounding and the pages flying!"},{"Title":"Road to Purgatory","review":"Reader review for:Road to PurgatoryBy Max Allan CollinsIn our history lessons, we have learned about World War II, but never in the connection between that infamous war and gangster activities. Al Capone, Frank Nitti, and their underlings, had deep-rooted control of so many factors during that war and after. These gangsters wanted, and generally did, control many factors in our nation. Their control led to much killing, most of it very secretive.Max Allan Collins gives us a perspective of all of the above. He takes us deep into the mob and the many, along with their underlings, that controlled the mob. A hero of Bataan from the early years of the war, Corporal Michael Satariano became involved in the mobs when he had returned home because of an accident while he was active on Bataan. He actually started working for Elliot Ness, another well-known name on the FBI side of the law.The activities of Michael, once he became entangled with the mob while working as an insider for the FBI, and attempting to right a wrong done to his father, will turn your minds upside down and get a terrific feel of what times were like during this period of our nations history. You will not want to put this book down.Review written by Cy HiltermanJanuary 17, 2006cyhilterman@digitalrazor.net"},{"Title":"Road to Purgatory","review":"Item never showed up. I was told another was sent and I have not received it either. Buyer Beware!!"},{"Title":"Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method","review":"Very valuable discussion of science; science, technology, &amp; society (STS)I consider this short book by Professor Bauer a must read for any person, scientist or non-scientist, who wants a concise but thorough discussion of the way science works, and of the myth, really ideal, of the scientific method, and most importantly, of what the author calls STS: science, technology, and society. I found the book remarkable because Professor Bauer is a practicing scientist, yet he delineates a philosophy of science from a very objective, dispassionate point of view. While he rightly praises science much in the last chapter, most of the rest of the book focuses not only on the limitations of science and scientific knowledge, but which sciences really are and are not scientific as he defines it. Clearly the fact that Professor Bauer has been the dean of arts and sciences at Virginia Tech has given him a balance between science and the arts, and has allowed him to see science both as an insider and an outsider.Thus the main thrust of the book is to show that what is most vital for the layperson is not to attempt to become &quot;scientifically literate,&quot; which the author claims would be a very time-consuming task, even for a college student, but rather to see that science is a human activity whose theories and models are limited not only because scientists are human, but because almost without exception scientific &quot;truths&quot; are at some point superseded by better &quot;truths,&quot; a process which repeats itself ad infinitum. It is therefore far better for the layperson to try to understand science's relationship to technology and society. The book does cover the relationship between science and technology well, but the author seems to be content to let the reader explore science's relationship to society through other sources, which I did not see in the references. Still, this is a very minor shortcoming in my view because of the many great insights and sources which he does provide.A key point stressed by Prof. Bauer in different contexts is that the power of science is that it is agreed on by consensus, but that does not always mean that the consensus is right, again because humans are fallible, and because data is *always* interpreted according to a theory or some other bias. The author, as have many other philosophers of science, refutes the common belief that in science knowledge isgained exclusively by strict Baconian impartial induction. Examples are cited where scientists could not accept data obtained wholly by scientific methods because it didn't fit their prejudices.The chapter called &quot;The So-Called Scientific Method&quot; is the best I've read on why the empirical scientific method, while a wonderful ideal to strive for, is nevertheless a myth. Prof. Bauer makes many important points, such as that some sciences (physics) are theory-driven, while other sciences are observation-driven (geology); some sciences can make precise theories through specific experiments (physics and chemistry), while other sciences (cosmology and paleoanthropology) cannot run experiments and are thus very &quot;data deficient.&quot; As well chemistry, Prof. Bauer's specialty, is itself sub-divided into disciplines that work according to different methodolgies.Another chapter that is also outstanding is the following chapter, &quot;How Science Really Works.&quot; Prof. Bauer uses as the main theme the excellent analogy devised by Michael Polyani of scientific problem solving as a puzzle of different teams communicating with each other, getting at the truth, piece by piece, separately but in tandem nevertheless. Another theme that is very helpful in this chapter is the author's cogent distinction between textbook science and frontier science. Textbook science is almost always reliable because it has passed the test of time through repeated verification. On the other hand, frontier science, which is unfortunately what is usually reported in the news precisely because it is &quot;new&quot; and exciting, often turns out to be dead wrong. The chapter also discusses those levels of science between these two &quot;extremes.&quot; After reading this chapter I feel that I now have a much clearer way to assess the truth of whatever science I might be reading about.There is much more to this book than I can go into here. Again, I recommend it very highly to those who want a clear and insightful perspective on science and STS."},{"Title":"Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method","review":"I took a class from Professor Bauer at Virginia Tech (the title eludes me) about pseudoscience - Loch Ness monster hunts, cryptozoology, UFO's, Cold Fusion, Kirlian Photography, Psychic/Palm Readings, etc. - and this was a supplemental text for the class. The book really explores how the Scientific Establishment/Hierarchy operates and how it isn't all that &quot;objective&quot; after all. Scientists are people, after all, and with that comes all the animosities, territoriality, envy, back-stabbing, and greed that all people exhibit. Radical discoveries by groups of people may get ignored, dismissed offhand, or viciously attacked by the establishment so as to preserve the integrity and perceived authority that the establishment weilds. Science is not an immaculate, dust and static free process - there are struggles and paradigm shifts all the time - and the general public tends to think it is just the opposite. I recommend this book for anyone who likes to challenge conventional modes of thinking and re-examine some of the longest-standing illusions about science ever created."},{"Title":"Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method","review":"I am trained in a scientific discipline and have always been fascinated personally with the \\"ways of science\\". I have learned over the past 30 years that science is not one way of doing things. Science's goal is to seek the \\"truth\\" but the truth can be derived via numerous paths depending on the body of knowledge and discipline one is dealing with.Science is also practiced by flawed human beings whose actions may diverge from the strict mental discipline required to practice good science--science that can ultimately be trusted by the layperson who pays the scientist's bills.This book, although written well before the global warmist myths, predicts such a myth because they have been seen before; and because the nature of scientific endeavor and its claim to truth through reason is so powerful it is also intoxicating to those seeking power over others.Science can be ultimately used for the wrong reasons--an hypothesis, so attractive to the user, may be proven wrong--or contrary facts never even sought or in fact suppressed--that the hypothesis begins to be seen as fact. This is the nature of the global warmist myth.This book is an inner look at science in action by a person engaged in a hard science and fascinated with it, but also fully aware of its good and bad players. It is as relevant today as when it was written. I believe it should be required reading and discussion at the college level for those who seek a scientific career."},{"Title":"Scientific Literacy and the Myth of the Scientific Method","review":"Bauer argues that the notion of a single, logical Scientific Method is contradicted by the ongoing process of science and by its history (i.e., the history of science).The facts strongly suggest that something similar to a Douglas McGregor \\"Theory Y\\" mindset and the set of relationships it implies are necessary to produce useful scientific results, while \\"Theory X\\" minds and relationships, though possibly useful in simplifying communications or in taking credit for \\"Theory Y\\" activities, are not ideas that can by themselves legitimately create paradiam shifts. (Read the Human Side of Enterprise by Douglas McGregor to understand what I'm getting at.)\\"Theory Y\\" does not deny that Love is a commodity. Nor that competitive forces are not part and partial of this entity.

Yet clearly, his book is supposed to be against that type of discrimination. What a whopper of a mistake.

This book does not have any applications such as ground water flow or oil production. If you are interested in a more general book on porous media, the classic books by Jacob Bear or Sheidegger or Dullien will be your best bet.Generally the volume averaging method is quite involved and not easy to follow. Though the book is supposed to be for undergraduates, it is actually a graduate-level text. (I use it for my graduate level course on porous media.) This is classic Whitaker prose--very clear, easy to follow, and rigorous. It is a pleasure to read this book, especially if you don't like the various formulas thrown at you as in monographs, and would like to derive all the equations yourself. A very nice description of the closure problem (i.e., how the macroscopic variables are linked to the microscopic variables within an REV) in porous media. This is really the first step--a good preparation for more advanced work by Whitaker and Quintard on the flow of multicomponent liquids in a porous medium. In my opinion, this book also has one of the best theoretical derivations of the Darcy's law."},{"Title":"The Method of Volume Averaging (Theory and Applications of Transport in Porous Media)","review":"Soy investigador en el tema de inyecci&oacute;n en medios Porosos.

This book is written with the undergraduate in mind, so contains a lot of problems, exercises, and tons of details needed to explain all the calculations done. It is a highly pedagogical book, especially remarkable, given that most of the books written on effective medium theory are mostly monographs, and not really accessible to the undergraduate students. This one is well written, and fairly easy to follow. One complaint I have is that the calculations are so long that it takes a very long time to get through chapters. My other complaint is that I would like to see more in the way of computational methods and their role/contribution to the field, as we know the computation of effective properties cannot be done analytically, so computational methods are really important for a good understanding. This books contains zero information on this topic, and as a result, is mostly a huge collection of formulas, and can be hard to read after you've ploughed through the first 100 pages.

I taught this series in China for 3 years, and am currently an M.Ed student. This series not only allows an inexperienced teacher to be able to jump into any class and feel confident teaching, but offers a strong order to the subject matter that is taught. The vocabulary and grammatical forms that are introduced are very useful in daily life.If I were to offer criticism about this series is that these books are very sterile. Without supplemental activities, students will find the repetitive 'conversations' quite droll. Secondly, although it can be used at all ages, it's better to be used as a young adult/elementary book to be used as a SUPPLEMENT to other regular English classes.

When the (fourth) Doctor hears about it, he is so alarmed that he immediate heads down there, but he is too late. The pods are seed pods for a malignant, killer plant, called a Krynoid. He succeeds in destroying one of them, but a psychopathic millionaire plant-fancier sent men down to retrieve the other pod for his collection. Little does this mad man realize what danger he has unleashed on the world, and worse, little does he care!This book is a novelization of the Doctor Who episode (which originally aired from 1/31/1976 to 3/6/1976) of the same name. The work was undertaken by Philip Hinchcliffe, the producer of the episode. He did a very good job of staying faithful to the show, and yet giving the story the feeling of being a genuine novel. I must say that I did enjoy seeing the Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith in action again, even if it is in an adventure that I already remember seeing. I found this to be a very entertaining book, and really enjoyed my time spent reading it."},{"Title":"Doctor Who and the Seeds of Doom","review":"_This is a novelization of the \\"Seeds of Doom\\" episode with Tom Baker (the fourth incarnation of the Doctor.)

The wit, and madness, of the good Doctor truly came across._As for the story itself, it is a cross between \\"The Thing from another World\\" and something out of H.P. Lovecraft. The action starts out at a science outpost in the Antarctic and moves to a great stately mansion in the English countryside. The action doesn't slacken for an instant._The introduction by Harlan Ellison is especially good. He really \\"got\\" the true character of the Doctor. After all, this is a Time Lord who refused to stand by as a passive, objective observer like the rest of his kind. Instead, he commandeered an old Mk.40 TARDIS and set out on a crusade to protect the weak and innocent from the monstrous and evil. In short, this is The Doctor."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"The book No Heroes suffers from a severe dislocation, when Chris Offutt tries to tell the story of Arthur and Irene, his in-laws, and their shattering Holocaust experiences, but basically giving them short shrift and only a few paragraphs compared to his lengthy tales about encountering old chums, teachers and girlfriends when he returns to teach in the hills of Kentucky.His little hostage to fortune, Sam, doesn't like school there, so Chris doesn't stay long. In a way it's a shame he wrote this book because it makes nearly every person in the Kentucky hills sound like a moron. He is unforgiving in his characterization. can people really be this small-minded and idiotic? Maybe so, but he isn't doing the Kentucky visitors bureau any favors.At the same time, he's great at describing things, and the colorful dialect of many of his old Morehead buds will provoke a round of belly laughs, some of their sayings are both priceless and profane. He sounds like a funny and likable guy, except he's a little bit on the preachy side.Not really a success, but maybe he's written other and better things, I'd read more of him."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"It seems to be important to state your connection with Kentucky, so I want to say that I'm at least a fourth generation Kentuckian who grew up in Central Kentucky, which is populated with immigrants from the hills. However, this work is not just about Kentucky but about the limitations that can imprison and destroy any and all of us.A mind that has no curiosity about the world, that is content with ignorance because it requires no change, is dangerous. People who do not question because they do not think become putty in the hands of clever, self-serving &quot;leaders.&quot; Moreover, when economic stress, some physical and social isolation, either a disdain for education or a feeling of inferiority about being able to benefit from it, are added to the mix, it can become deadly. To me, the most memorable scene in the book is the one in the restaurant when Offutt and his wife have dinner with his and her parents. Offutt's father mimes killing a baby who annoys them with its crying.Offutt is a wonderful writer who has written a book with multiple meanings. He also loves Morehead and Kentucky, as all of us do who were formed by the commonwealth and its quirky people."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"As a student of Morehead State University and a long time resident of Appalachia, I can only hope that Mr. Offutt intended his book to be PURE FICTION. In addition, I even took the one creative writing course he offered (and at the time I was very satisfied with the class). Because of this, I can honestly and confidently say that the author made up almost all of his situations to make himself out to be a superior to Appalachian natives he claims to 'know' so well. His repeated insults and sly innuendos do nothing but make him look like a fool to those who know the truth. 'Back home,' you can bet we all know the real reason he left was not his disappointment in Appalachia, but Appalachia's disappointment in him."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"A recent reviewer labeled \\"No Heroes\\" a \\"fabrication\\". Hmmm. Well, I guess it depends on whether the reviewer was expecting Fact or Truth from this memoir. Arthur and Irene's stories of the Nazi camps ring too true to be made up, and from my first-hand knowledge, neither are the portraits of the Rowan County residents Chris mentions by name. In fact there were lots of items in \\"No Heroes\\" that seem right on target to me. (Just one example was his mention of those frequent weekend runs from jobs in Dayton back to our homeplaces in Kentucky, a routine that myself, my brothers and several cousins lived for many years). But the most important thing to me about this book is that in identifying so strongly with Chris's Kentucky stories I was able to contrast my life and memories against the interwoven experiences of Arthur and Irene in a fairly intimate way, and was reminded of the Fact and the Truth about just how fortunate most of us are, whether we now live in Morehead - or not.I highly recommend you read the book and form your own opinions. If you've read any of Chris's previous books, you know already that he is a gifted story teller. In \\"No Heroes\\" you certainly will feel the ache and disappointment that Chris experiences after going home to Morehead, but you will also sense his obvious love of a place and a people through his sketches of treasures like Frankie Calvert and Mrs. Jayne and through his recollections of growing up on Haldeman hill. Even if you are not from the region, you will probably identify with many, if not all of the folks Chris writes about in the book.And if you are from the region and begin to get your feelings hurt a little, please take a moment to think about WHY something he wrote irritates you. If you are like me, you may learn just as much about yourself as about Chris Offutt's view of Rowan County.Final note: Unlike Chris, even after more than 20 years, I have never attempted to return to live in Morehead. Not because Morehead is a bad place. It is not. It is because my life now has roots in eastern Missouri and in central Texas that are just as deep as the ones I have in Kentucky.

I'm sure that when I read it again in a few weeks I'll find more meaning.Don't be fooled -- this book is not about Chris Offutt's attempt to return home, or about the horror of the holocaust. It is certainly more universal, and may be about home in general or what it means to be human.

I would recommend this great work of FICTION to anyone out there who enjoys a good Kentucky redneck or imbreed joke because you are just as imaginative as Mr. Chris Awful (oops, eye lowst meye diktonary!!!)"},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"Beautifully written, honest to the bone, No Heroes is a story of several intertwined personal journeys. Individual chapters are little pockets of insight into his past (his in-laws as well as his own) and into the present time of writing this story. Anyone who is brave enough to delve honestly into their own past will understand (and appreciate) the clarity, struggle and emotion of this memoir. In order to grow, we must reconcile with our past, face it head on with a fierce determination to see it for what it is and move forward. That takes guts.As someone else has mentioned, this memoir has layers and layers of meaning. It is sad, honest, funny and complex - just like life itself. When we &quot;go home&quot;, it is never to the home we yearned for, it is a home that we see with different eyes."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"I'm from the county Offutt writes about coming home to, and if we were really as backward and hickish as he describes us I would be leaving too. No, there's not a lot of opportunity here for our kids (most of whom do graduate from high school, and a good many from college). And yes, it's pretty provincial. But if what he tells here is what he really saw then he sure wasn't paying much attention. And if he really came here to save us from what he imagines is our way of life, all discount shopping and video stores and driving around in rusted-out trucks, it's no surprise he came away disappointed.He treats the story of his in-laws better, but the rest of this book doesn't deserve to be called \\"nonfiction.\\" Too bad a lot of people who don't know better will believe it."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"Offutt's strength is his prose and characterization, but his narrative is a little off here. A shame really, because his first memoir was solid all around. He himself admits to not knowing what the Holocaust story has to do with his own return to Kentucky and, quite frankly, neither do I. It seemed thrown in as maudlin filler and was blatantly incongruous.The ending seemed rushed too. \\"I am saying good-bye\\" and \\"I want to stay. I am ready to leave.\\" I know he can do better and the rest of the book proves that he can do better.Still though, there are some stylistic gems here. Offutt uses words and characters wonderfully. You'll love them and understand them. He's a very solid writer and students learning to write creatively can learn a lot from his craft--overtly and subtly.Worth a read."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"Perhaps I've done this book a disservice by reading it right after Homer Hickam'sRocket Boys, another memoir of life in the hills (West Virginia vs. Kentucky). Mr. Hickam's prose was so vivid and his story so compelling that I think just about any memoir would suffer in comparison.I just couldn't get through this book. The book alternates between chapters of Mr. Offutt's return to teach college within 10 miles of where he was born and grew up and the story of his in-laws' survival of the Holocaust. I'm a buy-and-hold reader and I resist being jerked around between stories and narrators. Even if there's a reason for it -- building his \\"you can't go home again\\" theme, I would guess -- it's too jarring. And, anyway, the horrors his in-laws suffered just make the author and his tale of woe sound whiny.Beyond that, I just found a huge difference between Mr. Hickam writing about his childhood as he lived it and Mr. Offutt's looking back at his childhood. In both cases, you sense a great affection for their place of birth, but in Mr. Offutt's case, it's from a great remove. I missed being immersed in the moment.I do enjoy Mr. Offutt's writing, but I think I ought to begin with the memoir other reviewers have mentioned,The Same River Twice."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"Anyone who has written not one but two memoirs by the time he reaches his early 40s is bound to have a healthy streak of solipsism, but Offutt outdoes himself.At the heart of the book is a basic failure to address anything beyond the author's own perceptions of his experience. He recounts very few conversations that aren't centered on himself. With the exception of a facile swipe at big-box retailing there is no placement of his experience in a context any broader that what he sees in front of him.There are surprisingly gaps even in the author's extensive self-reflection. It's obvious that most of his disappointment and disillusionment is caused by problems he was already aware of before he returned. He has no respect for the university but accepts a job there, and then complains about it. He despises the conventions and limitations of small-town life but decides to return, and then complains about it. He knows that the community has virtually no Jewish residents but brings his wife there to live, and then complains about it. He is resentful of his own experience in the local educational system but enrolls his son there, and then complains about it (and dismissively rolls his eyes at the high-school teachers who enroll in his class).His idea of saving the region is apparently limited to a part-time professorship and some halfhearted campaigning for an M.F.A. program at the university. And complaining, of course. It would have been interesting to hear how, or whether, he came to terms with his apparent denial of those issues, or his puzzling belief that he could fix them just by being there.The same approach colors his recounting of his wife's parent's Holocaust recollections. Like his experience in Appalachia, it becomes subsumed by self. Aside from a bit of a qualm over his right to tell the story because he is a Gentile, he seems entirely unconcerned with his appropriation of this material to strengthen his own story.Even the numerous and well-recounted misstatements of fact(many of which can be set straight in about three seconds on a good search engine) suggest that the author is moving beyond subjective recollection by altering even the most basic facts to suit his version of the story. (Do publishers no longer consider it necessary to fact-check anything that's published in a memoir?)The overall effect is an overwhelming self-centeredness that might have been interesting if it hadn't been so shallow."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"I heard Mr. Offutt on the Radio, National Public Radio, talking about this book about \\"going back home\\". \\"Returning home\\" has been a dimension in my own life, so, I connected with the author's observations.The radio interview with Mr. Offutt piqued my curiosity and this is the first book I have read of his. So, that being said, unlike other reviewers, I have read no other works of his to compare this one to (which other reviewers have).I knew the book was about returning home to Eastern Kentucky. I read the jacket cover of the book where it revealed that Mr. Offut now lives in Iowa City, Iowa. So, before I read the first page, I surmised that he went back home to Kentucky but for some reason didn't stay there. This was confusing? Maybe confusing is the wrong word. Disappointing - dismaying. It was obvious before even starting the book that going back \\"home\\" didn't work out.I went to college also in the Appalachian mountains and Offutt's descriptions of the Kentucky Mountains, ridges and hollows (hollers), was evocative and brought me back to those days of my own. His interactions with his former teachers and friends were good I thought. He runs into a former girlfriend and briefly thinks about what could have been with her for about two paragraphs. He talks about his adolescence.I too have been involved in college teaching and I found his descriptions of reaching out to one or two of his special students quite poignant and very real. I found his descriptions of interacting with town folk with special language and gestures quite accurate. He painted a good picture in my mind and I only wish there was more of it! His anecdote about going into the bank for a mortgage loan was a great piece of writing as he paints the picture of getting the loan without even having his college teaching job signed, sealed and delivered yet.I agree with the other reviewers who have mentioned the Chapters about the Holocaust. Offutt's in laws are survivors of the Holocaust and he intersperses chapters about them and their war time experiences throughout his own memoir. It is like two books in one but it did not work for me. I like the Kentucky part that are Offutt's own, not his transcription of his in laws talking about themselves into a microcassette recorder. Right now, I do not want to read a book about the Holocaust, and I felt deceived a little to find that material interspersed in his own personal memoir. Maybe this is some creative device that went over my head? If so, someone please explain it to me.I rated the book lower than 5 stars for the reason of the Holocaust chapters. I greatly enjoyed the Kentucky chapters. If I want to read books about the Holocaust, I will get those when I choose to.ajdjr73@aol.com"},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"Again,in an attempt to sell his work, Chris Offut has managed to fool those who view Appalachia as a vast wasteland of ignorance and despair into praising him for his &quot;couragic portrayal&quot; of the home he once knew. Having visited the area he manages to exaggerate, i felt as if a crime had been committed on the people of Rowan County, Ky.

For those who haven't been there, eastern Kentucky is a land of strange ironies. It has breath-taking physical beauty, yet scenes of third-world squalor just around the corner. Its people can be generous, hospitable, and neighborly; but then in an instant can reveal themselves to be insular and narrow-minded. What Chris Offutt writes about in this book is his own reaction to these dichotomies. The good aspects of Kentucky -- and there are many -- lured him back \\"home,\\" while the worst aspects -- and there are unfortunately many more of these -- eventually drove him away.I think the book does an excellent job dissecting the harsh truths about the small town he grew up in, returned to, and then evenutally fled. The rural language nuances are right-on, and the people are stright out of the local newspaper. Interwoven into Offutt's own story is the tale of his in-laws, survivors of the holocaust. At first, this parallel tale is distracting and seems jarringly out of place. As one reads more of the book, however, the holocaust tale begins subtly to integrate its themes into Chris's own story. Eventually, this parallel story gives the book its crystalized truth: home is in the heart and mind -- it is not a physical place. Chris Offutt's father-in-law knew that the pre-war Poland he grew up in no longer existed. For him, home was where he made it, and there was no yearning to return to a non-existant \\"home\\" of his childhood. To Chris Offutt, home never seemed to be where he was. It took a painful trip to the physical \\"home\\" of his boyhood to realize what his father in law already knew: the home of childhood is never returned-to in a spiritual sense; it can only be re-visited in a physical sense. What Chris Offut found -- and what many ex-patriot Kentuckians already knew -- was that eastern Kentucky provides a better memory of home than it does a place to make one. \\"No Heroes\\" brings this painful truth home in an elegant, unsparing way. If you like your truth unvarnished, this is where to get it.In reading some of the other reviews, it seems apparent that the present-day Kentuckians are upset at their portrayal in \\"No Heroes\\". This is not surprising. Their reaction is exactly what one would expect of the the people Offutt describes in his book. No mea culpas; no admissions that the education system is a joke; no recognition of the serious economic problems in the region. Their un-reflective defensiveness is exactly why I and people like me have no plans to return."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"Hmm... obviously Mr. Offutt missed a great deal while living in East KY -- something I find rather sad.

His disappointment that time has not stood still for 30 years, his naivete about the current realities of the region, his sulkiness over the absence of ethnic restaurants and other staples of city life, the arrogance of his intent to save Appalachia--all come through loud and clear. Not mentioned at all, of course, is the fact that he returns home only after having built a pretty good literary career out of pandering to the basest regional stereotypes imaginable.Offutt does a fine job of connecting with the local landscape, for which he seems to hold a genuine affection--curling up into a fetal position in the woods, tenderly burying dead owls, and whatnot. But he is utterly incapable of connecting with the people who surround him, the people he says he wishes to save. The only exceptions are those who can reaffirm his romantic ideas about the past (his first-grade teacher, an old almost-girlfriend with whom he spends a wistful moment in the video-store parking lot, his childhood buddies all agog at his success) and those who feed his messianic fantasies (the student who makes the astonishing claim that there is no place where she can buy a dictionary, prompting him to give her his own rather than remind her that even drugstores sell dictionaries, never mind the university's bookstore). For the most part, he describes those around him with either belittling humor or such outright contempt that it's hard to imagine why he ever wanted to return.Offutt places chapters describing his in-laws' experiences during the Holocaust throughout the book. These chapters, which seem to be transcriptions of their recollections--although the author's carelessness with matters of fact makes it difficult to know for sure--are the best of the book. Offutt himself admits that he's not really sure what they're doing in there, aside from the loose \\"can't go home again\\" theme. He claims no direct connection, but the presence of these voices raises a disturbing suspicion that the author perceives a parallel between their experiences and his own.\\"No Heroes\\" brings to mind a quote from T. S. Eliot: \\"Half the harm that is done in this world is due to people who want to feel important. They don't mean to do harm--but the harm does not interest them. Or they do not see it, or they justify it--absorbed in the endless struggle to think well of themselves.\\"Offutt may not have intended it, but \\"No Heroes\\" does harm. It's a shame that so many people will mistake this story of his neurotic misperceptions for a description of contemporary Appalachia. Anyone who reads \\"No Heroes\\" should follow it up immediately with John O'Brien's excellent \\"At Home in the Heart of Appalachia\\" as an antidote. Better yet, they should skip this one and go straight to the O'Brien."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"I made it through one chapter of NO HEROES which Offutt should think quite an accomplishment since I am from Eastern Kentucky and a graduate of Morehead State University. Not finishing the book has less to do with literacy or intelligence and more to do with an appreciation for accurate information (an appreciation clearly not shared by the author since he tosses around more fiction than fact). It seems quite tragic to me that someone with such a passion for \\"saving the uneducated\\" would now be so blatantly perpetuating the stereotypes he CLEARLY worked so diligently to overcome. I have found heroes all over Eastern Kentucky... my family, local educators, civic leaders, etc. However, I'm sure Mr. Offutt found NO HEROES here. He wasn't examining anyone but himself."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"Offutt continues to convince critics and more than a few readers he knows something about Appalachian Kentucky. Anyone familiar with the area who reads this book will find out how little familiarity with the area he really has.There are ludicrous factual errors (Morehead State University is _not_ the only four year college in the mountains), mistruths about people (one man he presents as being jealous that Offutt \\"escaped\\" Rowan County is as well-traveled an individual as I've ever met), and reported conversations that didn't happen (what \\"crossbow\\" in the film \\"Deliverance?\\"). He reports his local nickname is \\"Awful\\" Offutt, when in reality he's far more often referred to locally as \\"Outhouse\\" Offutt, for his weird tendency to insert outhouses in so many of his stories.Offutt is warmed over Breese Pancake (and if you don't know who that is you owe it yourself to find out), a poseur, a complete and utter fraud."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"Offutt not only has a way with words, he has a wonderful way of shoving truth right up into your face, like it or not. I grew up in Rowan County, went to the same grade school, high school, and even college that he did. This book skips some of the beautiful parts of living there -- the countryside, the safety, and the freedom from crowds, traffic, and excessive rules. But it uses humor, coincidence, and perhaps a bit of hyperbole to dramatically demonstrate some of the major problems.One of the biggest problems with Appalachia is the deep cultural bias against education. When I was in fourth grade and bored, I took a book to school to read during study hall. The teacher told me that \\"reading was a waste of time\\" and I \\"wasn't able to read chapter books anyway\\". When I got to high school, again in college, and especially in graduate school, each time I found I was more than a year behind my classmates. It's clear that one of the major tickets to success in America is education -- our immigrants from China and India know that, why is it that so many Americans have trouble accepting it? And why do residents of one of the most educationally depressed areas in the country get insulted enough to rant and rave against an author who points that out? As any member of AA will tell you, denial of the problem will make that problem worse, not better.Yes, there is a bookstore in Morehead (two counting the university), but it's pretty small and sparsely supplied. The biggest section is for the religious right's reading pleasure. Yes, students at the university do have dictionaries. Some of them. But most of them have trouble affording textbooks and a reference book is a luxury. In college, my dorm roomate once stole a dictionary (from a professor :) and it was the only one on the floor.If you don't think this book tells truth, you don't know it or you're afraid to admit it. Offutt's blessing to us (and probably curse to himself) is that he sees the truth dead on and can't help but pointing it out.To a crazy person, a hero is not the one who says \\"you're fine, just a bit eccentrtic\\", but the one who forces him to recognize the truth, and pushes him to get help. No wonder so many Eastern Kentuckians are upset at Offutt. Instead of talking about the beauty (which is there in abundance!), he grinds their noses in problems that desperately need to be fixed."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"The author writes about his returning to his home to his eastern Ketucky roots to teach at the local college, and \\"give back\\" to his hometown. That part of the book was informative for me since I did not know a whole lot about that part of the world and its people. But, the really intersting part of the book is the parallel story he tells about his mother and father inlaw, who are Holocaust Survivors.That part of the book, which documents his inlaws' survival stories, is especially memorable. Now the fascinating aspect of all of this to me was that the two stories, ie his memoir, and the inlaws' history, have virtually nothing to do with each other.The two stories remain separate throughout the book.Offutt's style of short concise sentences, and chapters makes for easy reading. His insights into the Appalachian cultureare eye opening for us outsiders.I recommend the book, especially for those who might be considering \\"going home\\" to give back. According to Offutt, it isn't easy."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"I'm not from Kentucky and have never visited the state, so I can't speak to any factual errors that might be in this book. I CAN say that I found it an excellent read and it brought to life scenes I can have no personal experience of, whether they transpire in the hills of KY or in the prison camps of WWII. The juxtaposition of the Holocaust tales and the homecoming to Kentucky stories is unusual, but it worked for me; I've never felt so vividly what Jews went through under the Nazis.Looking at Chris Offutt's pictures and reading his words, I don't think I'd get along with him too well. He does seem to have a chip on his shoulder and seems haunted by some ghosts that elude his attempts to put them to rest. But he uses words well and gave me a couple of interesting hours inside his head...a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't--well, you know."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"According to Mr. Offut, I shouldn't have been able to spell &quot;egocentric.&quot; I grew up in the same region as the author, but still managed to learn how to read. Unfortunately, that ability led me to read his book.Given the opportunity to begin again, I wouldn't waste the time and effort it took to pick up this book, never mind reading it. The only thing that kept me turning pages was the curiosity of how he would make the next topic all about himself.Too bad he missed all the lovely things about eastern Kentucky while he was obsessing over what everyone thought of him. Mr. Offutt -- take a lesson from Rick Bragg about how to write a memoir with compassion and insight into the culture he is describing."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"As with each of his works of fiction, \\"No Heroes\\" is a testimony more to Mr. Offutt's ability to exploit easy targets and stereotypes generally associated with the Appalachian Mountain region, rather than explore the people and attitudes that compose its hillsides and valleys.For someone who claims he comes home to save his people how can he so consistently get his people wrong? The isolation he speaks of fails to recognize that in the last twenty years, television, computers, digital cable, satellite dishes, and the Internet have greatly affected the landscape of the United States and created a broad-sweeping homogenization that has affected, yes, even eastern Kentucky.Sadly many find it easy to believe that the region is full of uneducated persons with no dreams of traveling past the county line or bettering themselves in our ever-competitive capitalist society. It's easy to fall for the words of a man who believes he is the only person to make it out of those mountains and do something with his life. For a man who only sees a past that no longer exists, and which he has done nothing to change."},{"Title":"No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home","review":"In many ways, this work is more complex than you would first think. Note the various reviews here. This work seems to bring out all sorts of emotions. This work is not easy to review. I suppose the best place to start is to state my humble opinion in reference to a couple of points. First, I don't think that the author was actually \\"putting down\\" the good folks in his old home town. I think he was just calling it the way he saw it. I have traveled through this area of the country extensively, spent quite a lot of time there. To be honest, the author nailed a certain segment of the population quite well. Now let me state that I am from and live in the Ozarks is S.W. Missouri. Some of the folks here, myself included, make the people of the author's home down seem down right sophisticated. I have traveled and lived all over this country for more years than I care to admit to. To be quite frank, the people the author described here can be found in just about ever town in the U.S., from coast to coast. Kentucky does not have lock on \\"town characters.\\" Secondly, the author indeed has some rather harsh things to say about Morehead State University. This was silly on the author's part. Schools are schools. I work with a lot of Harvard and Yale graduates that have far less \\"education\\" than a lot of Jr. College drop outs I work with. School is what you make of it after you get out. Those attending this college should not feel bad. After all, the author himself graduated from this \\"inferior school,\\" made the most of it and seems to have done alright for himself.Now, as to the book: It is actually rather well written. I do like the author's style. The story was good, easy to follow and simply interesting. This is actually two books in one. The first is about the author and his family returning to the hills of Kentucky to teach and possibly make a difference. The second story is that of his in-laws, both of whom were Holocaust Survivors. At this point I will state that I think it a shame that the author choose to use this method to tell these two stories. Both really should have been extended and made into two separate works.The author is very, very good ad descriptions, the country, the people the background. The author is quite good a capturing emotions. Chris Offutt is obviously quite a talented writer. I should also note that a few other reviewers have stated that the author made most of the stories here up. I doubt that very much. The stories just ring too true. He may have done a bit of embellishment here and there, but is that not what most authors do?I am giving this one only four stars rather than five for two reasons. First, there is an element of \\"sour grapes\\" that runs through the story which I found unbecoming and secondly, I feel the author should have devoted an entire book to his in-laws and their stories.I do recommend this one highly. It is a very good read.D.

The dialog was very believable and realistic. The period in which J. Steinbeck wrote as did Hemingway was the realism movement, which never really strayed too long into what the characters were thinking or feeling. The characters words on the surface is what portrayed who they were and Steinbeck expertly reveals all of them, even down to his tertiary characters, Ruthie and Winfield. Ma Joad and Tom are beautifully realized as was Casey the former preacher.If I have any quibble with the story, it's some of the chapters, which were a little too polemical and didactic. I felt Steinbeck trying too hard to drive his personal beliefs down my throat about \\"The Man versus the corporation and big business.\\" Overall however, I still came away with great admiration for what he tried to accomplish with this story, considering we had just come out of the Depression only about five or six years later followed by the destructive Dust Bowls, created by man.I now understand why this novel is considered in such high esteem by so many experts and admirers of fiction. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is truly one of the great American novels!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I only actually have to read this book as a Summer Reading assignment for my AP English class.

I did not fully realize the plight of the migrant workers in the 1920's and this book made me grow to respect and empathize with the Joad family and others like them.This book stayed with me for a while after I read it; I kept thinking about it and analyzing it. I couldn't wait for my husband to finish reading it so we could talk about it.

It was a good novel about the struggles of life in the 1930's."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book has stood the test of time and remains an American classic. Throughout the book, Steinbeck gives us an intimate insider's view of the Joad family by providing a narration and dialogue with an incredibly fine level of detail. The description of the poverty and difficulties of the Joads is so vivid that I couldn't help but feel for the human condition back then. To be poor is one thing, but to live without knowing where your next meal is coming from is quite another.The most vivid passage for me is in Ch. 28, when the Joads have been working on the cotton farm for a while and Ma Joad has accumulated enough money to finally go on a &quot;spending spree&quot; at the market. She probably didn't have more than a few dollars, yet when she buys enough food for the whole family, I actually felt a sense of relief, for it seemed they were as rich as kings.To me there are two resounding themes present in this novel. First of course is the strength of the family in the face of adversity. &quot;Family&quot; means more than blood ties; it means people who have shared your suffering and will lend a recipricol hand when needed. This relationship also means that walls will be built to keep some out: note how Tom quickly brushes off the one-eyed mechanic who hopes to come along on the trip. The second theme for me is the yearning for labour, &quot;muscles aching to work, minds aching to create beyond the single need -- this is man.&quot; We still see this today in America: a need to work for something beyond just money, it is a need to be productive and busy, to surpass our parents, and to produce successful offspring.A final note about this Penguin edition: It evidently reproduces the original typesetting from 1939, so it quite long at 619 pages. However, don't be put off by the length. The font is large, and the interline space is relatively wide. This book could easily be around 100 pages less with a more modern typesetting."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"I figgered the devil was the enemy. But they's somepin worse'n the devil got hold a country, an it ain't gonna let go till it's chopped loose.\\"Grapes Of Wrath is the story of the desperate battle of migrant labourers with the rich, greedy, malevolent and the mean. When the Joads arrive in California from their native Oklahoma, their troubles and tribulations are rewarded not by bounty, but by even more hardship. What ensues is a timeless battle. It is waged by the spirit of the downtrodden on the one side, and by the mercenary mean muscle of the other. The story is primordial and resonates with any reader with a sense for perception.The classic work of fiction describes a world where the rich, with their glitzy cars, ride alone and never mind hitting a man or a noble dog should one come in their way. Then there is the poor and oppressed who, despite their condition, extend a hand time and time again and never forget what is important on the great round dustbowl. The wheel in the sky seems to work against those who toil and possess a heart, but cruelty and oppression are exposed as mere facades that once removed reveal nothing more than a faceless corporate entity bereft of the right to exist.It is in this setting that John Steinbeck writes in amazingly authentic and sanguine dialogue the flight of the strong-at-heart from, and again into, the belly of a system bent on browbeating compassion, kindness and veracity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is an American classic which, though showing its age, says much to the America of today.A masterful story teller, Steinbeck unfolds the story of the Joads, a family of dispossessed Okies, set adrift in a sea which they do not know, by forces which they do not understand. As we watch them lose their farm, travel with them in the truck to California, then search with them for work in their new world, we begin to appreciate the life of a penniless migrant of the Dust Bowl Era.As enthralling as this story is, it is periodically interrupted by chapters of social commentary. Nobody seized the land, it was the bank. No one set the wages, the growers association did. There is no personal responsibility. The little people are crushed by impersonal organizations.The theme of class struggle runs deeply, but is seems a bit dated. When Steinbeck wrote, the Joads probably seems to be part of a struggle driven by deliberate decisions made by people who were willing to ruin the lives of little people for profit, all the while hiding behind the claim that their actions were compelled by impersonal forces.It seems that, to Steinbeck, the struggle over land was one in which \\"The People\\" could determine the outcome. Knowing what we now know, the mechanization of agriculture set in motion forces which inexorably reduced demand for agricultural labor. The prosperity which the world enjoys today is incompatible with world the Joads knew in Oklahoma. The Tom Joads reaped the Grapes of Wrath, but many of their grandchildren eat from the Horn of Plenty. The tragedy is not, as Steinbeck seems to posit, that the Joads lost their land, but that they were unable to successfully adapt to the changing times. They could not adapt but, in their own ways, they did cope.Although the specific struggle of the Okies is passed and many of their grandchildren have achieved prosperity in the mainstream economy, their problem remains. There are still economically marginal people unable to adapt to the changing times, people who have to cope in their own ways. They too, have a spokesman in John Steinbeck.This book is powerful. It is moving. Come, ride into yesteryear."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Grapes of Wrath is a very different book I have read from many others. I'm a high schooler, and I usually read cheesy romantics and books for teens, so it took me a long time to get into this book. It starts out slow, (actually very slow) and it kind of gets repetitve in the sense of that they're in the great depression, they're tired, hungry, and they want to get a job. Then you get into two thirds of the book, where they live in a nice camp with actual toliets that flush, hot showers, etc. and it all starts to come from there. The hardships the Joads family has to make, and how Ma is more like the dad of the house, and keeps everyone going and under control.The ending was very... different. It just sort of ended, just like to Kill a Mockingbird.This is probably one of my top ten books, and just like other classics, it takes a while to get into."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read Grapes of Wrath just out of interest when I saw it sitting on a bookstore shelf, it wasn't part of my school ciriculum or anything of the sort. I found it was not really entertaining and at times it's not really a page turner, but you will want to read till the end to see what happens.The problem I have with GoW is that it repeats the same monotonous message over and over again. The same lesson, the same insight, the same issue. While this may be effective in driving home to the reader the fact that the migrant situation during the depression had a far reaching and catastrophic impact on certain americans and the segregation there was in the community, I just wish I didn't need to know the same details constantly.Steinbeck did do a great job of creating a wonderfully written (sometimes poetic, especially inbetween chapters) story with wonderful characters but I do see areas where there could have been improvement. There is little description in a characters actions or movements. While you may feel what the character is going through, it can be a little more difficult to 'see' whats going on as Steinbeck was sparse with descriptions. If that's his writing style then so be it, I didn't really like that about the novel.GoW throws the reader through problem after problem, with only the strength of will of Tom and his mother keeping the family glued together, you do feel the injustice and hardships that they experienced, and the vain hope that they can obtain a piece of land.The ending is a bit of a mystery to me, I can't quite catch the metaphor in the last scene but I do see how it works overall. Anyway, if you are interested in tasting a bit of classic work, read GoW. You'll come away satisfied."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck is a wonderful writer and extremely thoughtful in writing this book. he incorporates several different aspects and allusions including biblical ones, marx, emerson into the book without making the story heavy or boring. there are many different symbols, ideas, and themes of steinbeck in this book and one cannot help but appreciate how much work steinbeck has put into it, and how he intertwines it all in a perfect ending. steinbeck uses interchapters between plot chapters to explain symbolism and key ideas. he also has a great style and is quite a literary genius."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Grapes of Wrath may look daunting at first but it, like most Steinbeck, is very easy reading and well worth the read. The book is one of the major landmarks of American Literature and has permeated our entire culture and served as the voice of those striving to move west during the Dust Bowl and, even more so, the American spirit. Preacher Casey and Tom Joad have become classic characters and have even been the subject of many songs by the likes of Woody Guthrie and Bruce Springsteen.When you're reading this you're a piece of American history at its finest and most tragic. Steinbeck paints a wonderful picture of the human condition against the back drop of one of the most interesting, exciting, yet tragic times of American history. If you're looking for a long, easy read pick Grapes of Wrath over Harry Potter and you'll certainly get your reward at the end."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I write this review from the perspective of a union-side labor attorney. Prior to reading this novel, I only knew that the subject of the novel was a group of &quot;Okies&quot; (dust-bowl farmers from Oklahoma) and their struggle to survive the Great Depression. However, that is just the protagonists' starting point. From these origins, the Joad family is evicted from their nearly worthless farmland and are forced to travel westward to California. California to the Joad family--and thousands of families like them--is a promised land of milk and honey. As they continue to travel and ultimately arrive in California, they discover it is anything but a promised land.And here is where Steinbeck's utter rage shines through. The Joad family (and thousands of families like theirs) travels to California because they have seen flyers proclaiming the need for grape pickers, peach pickers, cotton pickers, etc. The flyer states that 500 pickers are needed. In reality, only 250 pickers are needed. Additionally, the printers of these flyers (the greedy farm corporations, replacing the individual farmers) distribute these flyers to far more than 500 people. Thousands and thousands of people receive the flyers, creating the farm corporations' dream come true--a glut of starving workers fighting for any job they can get.Therefore, the starving workers undercut each other. While one worker says he will work for $.25 per day, the other worker who is hungrier says that if he gets the job, he will only require $.20 per day. The vicious cycle continues. The rich get richer, and the workers starve. And the outbidding is really the best time of the year--in the winter, there is no work and hence no bidding or money. Whenever anyone talks about organizing the workforce, he is labeled a &quot;red&quot; and either put on a blacklist or killed on the spot.This book is really a rallying cry for the necessity of unions. There are people who now say that unions have served their purpose and are no longer necessary. To that, I must respond that those people do not really understand the watchdog effect of unions.It seems that people remember &quot;The Jungle&quot; as more of a tribute to unions than &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; I have read &quot;The Jungle&quot; also, and while I think it is a great book and a very important one, it lacks the literary finesse of Steinbeck. Both books are stories of rage, but Steinbeck's prose is beautiful, haunting, both mournful and intensely angry. As he writes an indictment of the farming corporations, he also writes a love song to America, highlighting the beauty of its land and the bravery and kindness of its people. The Joad family is overwhelmingly good even in the face of one of the cruelest chapters of American history. The last paragraph of the novel both breaks your heart and renews your faith in humanity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, and it certainly is the most American. John Steinbeck shows us the same place every time, but it's a place worth going to, where the hills roll dustily to infinity and the horses run free; where there are men who will never stop &quot;westering&quot;; where men are MEN--something that seems more than a little obvious, but when you compare Steinbeck with other authors you realize it just isn't so. The book centers on one of the most unjust, trying, disgusting (call it what you will) times in America, and by the end you ARE one of the heroes, one of the simple men, one of the hardy westerers who only have each other and know it, but also know that that's all they need. The book is, if anything, far more necessary now, for Steinbeck's breed of men have faded from our America, and only a book like the Grapes of Wrath could ever bring them back. Read it; it's not only worth your while, it's worth America's."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"When I read the last page of this book I was stunned in a way that is hard to describe. I have never had such a deep emotional reaction to any book before or since. Just read it. It's an incredible experience."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"What amazes me about this book is the writing. Steinbeck was a wizard of desription and characterization. His book challenges you to see the world with new eyes- the unfairness of things as well as the beauty of small gestures. I am shocked by some of the negative Amazon reviews. It appears that some of those writing have no concept about the ideas presented in this novel or are in denial about American history. But getting back to this book: read it slowly, linger over Tom and Ma and Rose of Sharon and their sorrows, their daily sacrifices. There is nothing boring here but you will be challenged as to your religious and political stances. The Joads are America itself. Powerful stuff."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Most people read this book for the first time in an english class. Thus they have to read it fast and they don't get as much out of it. I did not. I chose to read this book, partly because I had heard more good than bad about it, partly because though it was in the 50's, my dad took route 66 from Missouri to California, but the main reaso I read The Grapes of Wrath is because after I got out of High School I wanted to read Literature finally at my own pace, and mainly read the books I never did in school.I dont think I would have liked this book had I had to read it in school because it is 600+ pages but I tell you this. The Grapes of Wrath is the best book I've ever read, and Steinbeck is far up if not the best American author of all time. This book can be compared to Huck Finn. Poor folk, some in trouble with the law make an odessy to a new place, far away. The thing that separates the Steinbeck from Twain is that in this book there were chapters, almost every other one, that didn't pertain to the Joads. They were more an generalized vignette of expiriences that happened to many families who made this journey. May it be lack of food and water on the road or the dustbowl storms destroying a corn crop.Steinbeck weaves characters like a master and Tom Joad's final speech will live on in my mind forever: &quot;Wherever they's a fight so hungry people can eat, I'll be there. Wherever they's a cop beatin' up some guy, I'll be there.... An when our folks eat the stuff they raise an' live in the houses they build-why, I'll be there.&quot;In short, this book is fantastic, one of the best and a must read for anyone. It is a great story of a family's strife against the elments, struggle for enough money to live, and their belief in the good things getting them by."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Before I read this book, I was told that it is a slow and boring read due to not having much action. Well, the action part may be true (depends on what you consider to be &quot;action&quot;), but the boring part is definitely not the case. I literally couldn't put this book down. In a nutshell, it tells the story of a depression era family that is driven from their family farm and describes the hopefullnes and heartache that entails their journey across the country to California in search for work. I realized the degree of struggle of which we today do not, and could not, understand, yet it was so real to those living just a couple of generations earlier. If you stick with this book and give it a chance it will definitely prove to make you think. If you're pondering whether or not to buy it...I say what are you waiting for?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Whatever you political principles and ideas about economics, you would have to be inhuman to fail to grasp the utter injustices committed against poor peasants during the Great Depression, reflected in the desperation and dehumanization brought about on the Joad family, who lost all they had and were forced to wander the American West in search of pure survival.Tom Joad gets out of jail (where he had landed after he killed another guy in a fight)just to find his family destituted and forced to leave their land. So begins what has to be the saddest road-novel of all times. The Joads jump up into a waste of a car and start traveling to California, looking for the chance to get jobs in the prosperous citrics-growing trade. In the road they will suffer all kinds of setbacks and humiliations, until the terribly beautiful, meaningful and symbolic end. Several characters will leave you indelible impressions: Tom Joad himself, a simple but brave man; JC (get your conclusions about his symbolism), the appearing and disappearing ex-preacher; and, above all at least for me, the mother of the Joads, a lovable, courageuos, indestructible human being, one that makes you want to weep for her while feeling a towering admiration for her dignity.Inserted between chapters are short reflections and background about those times, as well as small asides full of symbolism and literary beauties. Some say that Steinbeck's explanations have been proved distorted: don't let that interfere with what is a work of fiction. Such things have happened throughout human history, and what this book does is remind us all that we have a debt to our fellow men (and women, of course).An epic of the eternal fight against indignity and misery, it deserves its fame and prestige."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"With over 300 other reviews listed here, I don't have much to add, except to echo what others have already said: 'The Grapes of Wrath' is one of the most powerful novels you will ever read, American or otherwise. As you journey from Oklahoma to California with the Joad Family, you'll experience the same obstacles and emotions they experienced: hunger, pain, separation of family, deplorable living and working conditions, tears, laughter, life, death. But this book is so much more. Whether or not you agree with his political views, no one can deny that Steinbeck was a brilliant writer. That brilliance is evident in every page of this novel. I don't think I will ever forget the book's final scene. It will stay with me for a long, long time. A great novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"So often I find myself chasing the best sellers when looking for a book to read but more recently I have moved back to the classics and after The Grapes of Wrath I am thankful I made the move.

Take the time to read some of the classics and start with the Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"If any novel could sum up the tragedy the Great Depression was for the working classes, this is it. I liked almost everything about this book--the characters, the story, the history, the dialogue. One of the only complaints was the abrupt and pointless ending, although I do commiserate with the author because how do you end a novel such as this? This novel is a masterpiece in itself as well as in what it accomplished by bringing to light the impact of the Great Depression on the working poor. It's hard to know if this story is the worst of the worst or just the story of an average family during this time. Either way, it's a tragedy and very moving. As a sidenote, Steinbeck definitely exhibits a hope in communism and socialism to bring equality and end the kind of poverty illustrated in this book. When this book was written, history hadn't yet judged the communist/socialist experiment which has now been shown to be responsible for more injustice and poverty than what it replaced. Along those lines, the novel's villains are the \\"big bankers\\" and \\"big farm owners.\\" Ironically, FDR's New Deal policies dictated price controls for farm goods and wages which led to mandated government destruction of food during the Depression. So, the New Deal was just as big a \\"villain\\" as the bankers and farm owners even though the book leaves that part out."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book If to go out and buy a copy - any old copy and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time?

Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier.

From all of these the people are in flight, and they come into 66 from the tributary side roads, from the wagon tracks and the rutted country roads. 66 is the mother road, the road of flight.\\" -- John Steinbeck, The Grapes of WrathI live near Route 66, or what is left of it, in San Bernardino County, the largest county in the continental United States. The great highway which used to connect Needles on the Colorado River with San Bernardino is mostly gone now, replaced by strip malls and freeways. But a few reminders remain. The Tee-Pee Motel on Foothill Boulevard .... Little concrete tee-pee rooms with barred windows against the meth-heads and gangbangers. There are still hamburger stands and greasy spoon diners, and signs memorializing Route 66's place in the history of the West. Etched into the mountains behind the old road is The Arrowhead: a geological anomaly which was revered by the Indians and now is the symbol of the region.Once a year, San Bernardino... where 50% of the population is on public assistance of some kind, and which has the highest proportion of parolees in California... holds a \\"Route 66\\" festival to commemorate the muscle cars that made the region famous in the 50's and 60's.

And there is irony in that California...the Land of Gold and dreams ... is now mired in unemployment and debt. Its budget is $ 42 billion in the red, its once awesome aerospace industry virtually nonexistent, its highways impassable, and its once world-class educational system a disaster. The Okies have been replaced by illegal migrants who still work for less than legal minimum wage, lack health care, and face deportation or worse.

It is a marvelous story of the Joad's struggle across the country to California to make a living for themselves after their farm was reposed by the bank. You follow them every step of the way through different problems; death, starvation, jobs, and cops. You gain a kind of bond with and empathy for the characters. You care about what happens to every member of the Joad family. You would be sad if they never made it, but at least you would know what happened to them. You never find out. In the middle of a crisis Steinbeck decides to drop you like yesterday's sour milk. It drove me nuts.If Steinbeck had had some sort of ending to the story, it would have been the best story I have ever read. It has no ending. The book is like one of those really annoying sequels that draws you in, gets you addicted, and then says to be continued. Well it is just your luck that you don't get a sequel; there is no to be continued.Other than the minor detail with the terrible ending, it is well written with a style that is easily comprehended. Anyone could read this book. It has what I like to call &quot;story relief chapters&quot;; that is a chapter between each chapter on the main story. These specific chapters give you a view at the world around the Joads smoothly. These chapters don't even mess up the flow of the story.So in conclusion, this book is well written with no ending. I give it three stars because a book can't only have a good story, but it must have a good ending (or any ending for that fact). You can judge it for yourself if you do read it, but that is my review."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I find it highly irritating when others start acting condescending towards people just for not liking their choice in books. I am eighteen years old, and I read THE GRAPES OF WRATH &quot;for fun&quot; (in other words, it was not a school assignment) in high school. I did not like it. Does that make me an &quot;immature&quot; reader? I don't think so! Contrary to what you seem to think about those who hate TGoW, I do enjoy &quot;serious&quot; books (The Good Earth; The Butcher Boy; Animal Farm; 1984; those not serious enough for you?) You would do better to stop making such outrageous presumptuous remarks based on a teenager's taste in books. Obviously, you cannot be much more mature than the readers you criticize, if you cannot handle a difference in taste.

The fact that it is considered such explains many of my problems with American literature and American culture in general. In order to show what a poor contender this novel is, I'm going to contrast it to something that's actually great literature, Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky.Where to begin? First and most importantly, the narrative is uninspiring. The prose is dry, dispassionate and bland. Not dessicated and spare and powerful like Camus, but just dull. The interchapters, in particular, are tedious and pretensious exercises in literary superfluity. All of your middle-school english teachers no doubt told you that when you write something you should 'show not tell,' and that's good advice, but Steinbeck just tells you the story and keeps telling it for 600 miserable pages. So thus the manner of the novel's writing adds nothing to the book, and indeed detracts from it. Contrast this to a novel by Dostoevsky like Crime and Punishment or Notes from Underfround where the narrative itself is feverish, illucid and grating, reflecting the protagonist's wretchedness.Next, all the characters are delightfully black and white, on the whole. Casey is messianic, the men killing him are devils, and there's no in between. Contrast this to the moral ambiguities of Crime and Punishment and you'll see why Steinbeck comes off the worse.On a related note, the novel seems to have no means of conveying a spiritual message of its own, since the prose is so soulless, but Steinbeck tries to make it spiritual by inserting Casey's tedious neotranscendentalist sermonizing. Contrast this to Crime and Punishment, where the moral is so integral to novel that any expounding of it is entirely natural.So if you enjoy complex, multilayered characters, an interesting writing style and stimulating philosophical questions in a novel, stop yourself before you pick up this inexplicably 'classic' novel and read something by a Russian instead."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is one of those intimidating \\"great books\\" that everyone knows about and no one reads. The irony is that it is a book about ordinary people, and the language and plot are hardly difficult at all. The Joads, driven off their Oklahoma farm by the encroachment of industrialization, seek a better life in California - with thousands of others in the same position. The migrants are forced to compete for survival, but only by leveraging their power as a group can they ever truly triumph. The theme of individual vs. group is further emphasized by the form of the novel. Steinbeck uses alternating chapters about the Joads and \\"interchapters\\" about the migrants as a whole. Thus the book, besides being the great American epic about the Joads, is also a social and political novel that caused an enormous uproar upon its publication. This is a book that is part of the collective American conscious and should be read by everyone who wants to feel thoroughly educated."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These are the values upon which our country was founded. Yet history has shown that this has not been the case for many people living in the United States. Americans have been restricted from these rights because of unalterable circumstances such as race, sex, religion, or in the case of Grapes of Wrath, because of economic status. The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck takes place during the 1930's, a time of nation wide economic hardship. Many books have been written about the great depression but this book is unique in its focus on another great tragedy effecting the country at the same time. The great dust bowl caused the migration of thousands of people from the Midwest US to the state of California in search of a better life for their families. This book addresses the hardships suffered by those families. This book is very effective in portraying these struggles both generally and personally. Steinbeck chose to alternate chapters between general descriptions of the country's struggles and the story of one specific family by the name of Joad. The general descriptions display the widespread difficulties people everywhere were suffering by describing the people as a general, family unit, &quot;And the man, the leader of the family, leaned from the car. Can we pull in here an sleep?&quot; (Steinbeck, p268) These chapters addressing the &quot;big picture&quot; were followed by chapters that brought the issue to life by displaying the struggles of the Joad family. This alternation of big picture, small picture story telling resulted in a well-rounded image of a time period in American history. So much can be gained from this book it is a definite asset to anyone's reading list. Not only is it a great chronicle of history, it is a story about the American dream, and the quality of life. The length of the book shouldn't provide an obstacle for a reader seeing as how it is neither exceptionally long nor short and it maintains a good amount of excitement and adventure throughout the novel. The only thing that may be distracting to some readers is the periodic breakaway from the main story line. However, if one can see this as a valuable literary device instead of an obstacle, it will actually provide a greater understanding of the time period. The Grapes of Wrath provides a great insight into a period of history. By reading the book, the reader is left with greater understanding and empathy for those who lived during the dust bowl of 1930. The bravery and strength that is demonstrated by the Joad family is both phenomenal and inspiring. It is a good example for people today who are suffering through difficult times. When these people where faced with hardship, they did not roll over and die. They picked up their lives and their families and they set out determined to find a way to protect and provide for themselves. At a time when everyday people in our country are turning to drugs, gangs, or crime as solutions to their problems, a great lesson can be learned from these families: The world is not perfect but that is no excuse to give up on life. And life was the picture John Steinbeck was trying to relay in his book. A raw, honest look at life during a time of great hardship and trial. The Joad family was an excellent portrayal of a typical family from the Midwest in search of the better life they had been promised elsewhere. Steinbeck characterized the family through dialogue that depicts both the diction and accent of a typical Midwest family in the 1930's, &quot; 'You jus' goin wes'?' 'Jus' on our way.' 'You ain't never been in California?'&quot; (278). Choosing to maintain the dialogue in this natural state adds to the authenticity of the novel and creates a better picture for the reader."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"You know it's an American classic, and everything that has been written about it being a great book that depicts an era in American history in a phenomenal way is true. I will just point out two things that I think the person who reads this book should know (especially if the reader is anything like me):1. The book starts out sort of slow. I read the beginning and wondered what I had gotten myself into. In fact, it started out so slow that I would have put it down had it not been required reading. I urge you to keep reading! The book is a classic for a reason, and it is good. Eventually, it turns into a real page-turner, and you want to find out what happens next to the Joad family. Later, you will want to check out what other people have said about this book. I never would have gotten all of the Biblical allusions or other symbolism without reading and discussing this book with others.2. The ending will surprise you. It shocked me. I definitely won't spoil it, but the ending of this book left me, quite literally, jaw wide open. WHAT? I thought. Oh my gosh! I was glad I had someone to talk about it with, because even in today's world, I'm sure most people would find it shocking. And it is nothing like the movie.That's my two cents. This book is a great addition to your literary knowledge, and if you haven't read it, I highly recommend it, from both the literary angle and the historical perspective."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Between 1936 and 1938, Steinbeck wrote a series of newspaper articles for the San Francisco News and the Monterey Trader about the horrendous plight of the migrant workers in California, many of whom arrived from Oklahoma, Texas, and beyond, seeking work during the \\"Dust Bowl migration\\" of the 1930s. (Earlier, he had written and published a novel \\"In Dubious Battle,\\" about labor unrest among those same migrant workers.) The fruit of Steinbeck\`s years mingling with these workers and investigating their conditions, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a powerful and sympathetic fictional portrayal of one family's horrific odyssey across America in search of work after losing ownership of their farm.There is certainly more than one way to read this novel: as an incendiary historical document that galvanized the country (Eleanor Roosevelt and various politicians took up the cause of the migrant workers, while conservative-leaning groups and towns banned--or burned--the book); as an epic about human perseverance, survival, and dignity (reflected symbolically in the much-maligned \\"turtle chapter\\"); as a political manifesto unflinching in its condemnation of the insensitivities of corporate capitalism (for which Steinbeck was accused of Communist sympathies). Readers who find the novel unrelentingly depressing or unrealistic in its portrayal of the Joad family's fate should understand that the Joads were actually quite lucky. (Very few migrant families, for example, were fortunate enough to live in government camps.)The first hundred pages or so proceed rather slowly, in part because Steinbeck alternates the chapters about the Joad family with prosaic interludes describing the difficulties facing the migrant workers in general. But the pace of the novel accelerates (and the interludes become shorter), as various members of the Joad family experience frustration, sickness, brief periods of success, and death--never letting go of their dream of settling down somewhere and living in a house. The various members of the family are astonishingly realistic, and their motivations, if simple, are always believable. (The two children are, well, just like children). The ending, which must have been scandalously shocking in the 1930s, is still electrifying; it forcefully shows the desperate lengths the poor were willing to go to help each other when most of America didn't care about their plight.This is my second time reading the novel, and--although I again found it gripping and moving--I was not as impressed as the first time I read it two decades ago. (I was much more idealistic then, I suppose.) One of the novel's greatest weaknesses is that Steinbeck overstates the evil machinations of the \\"bad guys\\" and the good-natured intentions of the \\"good guys.\\" All the police and the bankers and the landowners are thoroughly malevolent; all the displaced migrant workers and the sharecroppers are faultless (or their shortcomings are unsophisticated, understandable, or well-meaning). As a result, the novel reads in a few places like agitprop rather than fiction.Of course, that was Steinbeck's intent: he wanted to wake up the country. Yet, as a work of art, this style doesn't date well. Nevertheless, only a cynic or a monopolist could be unmoved by the story of the Joad family. It is truly a classic proletarian novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"When I was first assigned to read John Steinbeck's book The Grapes of Wrath in English class, the first thing that I noticed was how huge it was. Over 600 pages! I was afraid it would be a story that wandered all over the place and didn't really have a point. Even after I had begun reading, it seemed that this assumption was correct since all book seemed to be doing was telling a very detailed and slow-moving story about a family in Oklahoma. However, as I continued reading, I began to realize that the very way the book portrays the life of these people so realistically and what the reader learns from their situation is itself the point of the book. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, an Oklahoma family of tenant farmers during the Great Depression who are kicked out of their homes because they cannot make a profit on their crops. As more and more farmers are kicked off their land to be replaced by men on tractors, over 300,000 people migrate west to California in hopes of earning a living picking fruit, cotton, etc... for owners with larger farms. Hardship follows them during the long trip to California. Even once they get there, they're divided against themselves as they compete for work so they can just feed their families. Throughout the book the family encounters opposition from all sorts of people, including land owning farmers who must pay extremely low wages in order to make a profit, cops who cause more trouble than good, locals who are afraid of the massive influx of people, and a government that seems unable to help. In the end it's sheer will that gives them the strength to continue to fight as the Depression relentlessly tries to break the people's determination and the family bonds. The Grapes of Wrath gives a very realistic view of the Great Depression and tells it from viewpoints you don't see from just reading about it in a history textbook. The book is divided into narrative chapters that tell the story of the Joads, and, every other chapter, the inter chapters that give information about the situation in a style that's part documentary, part editorial. Throughout the book, especially during the inter chapters, Steinbeck uses symbolism to convey ideas. In particular, there are many allusions to the Bible, including the title. Due to its realistic portrayal of the life of the migrants, the book has also come under considerable controversy for its profanity and sex, since those things were parts of the lives of these people. Also, Steinbeck uses the inter chapters both to make people aware of the problems and to give suggestions for how to deal with them, and many of his beliefs could be seen as Communistic. I have really found The Grapes of Wrath to be a difficult book to rate. On the one hand, it's a slow-moving book that contains a whole lot of talk that people who aren't really into reading books for fun will likely find boring, and it's just too long to hold some people's interest. On the other hand, however, the character interaction is very realistic and human, being based on actual migrants Steinbeck knew. Because of this, we get to feel like we really know the people in the book. The seemingly excessive length of the book is actually needed to give us a real understanding of how these people lived their lives. When the characters get into intense situations that threaten the physical and psychological well-being of the family both as a group of individuals and as a single unit, the book reaches hights of drama and emotional intensity that is almost never matched today in movies, books, video games, music, or any of our other forms of art. I often found myself just sitting there thinking about what I'd just read for a while after I finished with the required reading for the day. There's not really space within this 1,000 word limit to fully discuss my thoughts on this book, but what I can say is that it will draw you into the world of the migrants in the 1930's and show you plainly and truthfully just what it was like. I can understand the opinion of people who hate this book because it's all a matter of taste, and some people just would not be able to forgive the many parts they consider agonizingly boring. Although I give this book four stars overall, there are parts of it that I'd give 10 stars if I could. I highly recommend this powerful book to anyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The first thing that came to mind when I read Steinbeck's classic The Grapes of Wrath was its parallel to Upton Sinclair's The Jungle - the downward spiral of a migrant family who find themselves in a struggle to subsist in abject poverty. (Fortunately, where Sinclair rams Socialism down our throats in The Jungle, Steinbeck merely offers us a spoonful here.)Steinbeck provides wonderful development for each character in this story; though none of them could be called bright, each figure possesses a unique depth and personality. Tom Joad is the angst-ridden main character who has just been released from serving a long prison sentence. Ma is the family matriarch who provides strength and optimism even in the worst times. Jim Clancy is the fallen preacher who joins the Joad's on their sojourn. (Clancy is certainly the novel's most over-analyzed character - he has been likened to a metaphor for Jesus Christ, but I just didn't see it.)This now classic tale takes place during 1930's, and is about a family of Oklahoma Dustbowl farmers who, like countless others, migrate to California after losing their farm. But they don't give up without a fight, leaving only when the bulldozers come to raze their home. Packing up all of their possessions in the family jalopy, they make their way across a Depression Era America that has little pity on &quot;ignorant Okies&quot;. Along the way they meet other Okies fleeing back home from California after finding only starvation in the so-called promised land. (One of the most heart wrenching figures in the novel is the Okie who is returning after helplessly watching his child die of starvation). But, just like the Rudkis family in The Jungle, the Joad's are sure that, with some hard work, things will be different for them. Though the family does find work picking fruit, it is not the Garden of Eden they'd hoped it would be. Even the children must endure twelve hour days of backbreaking work in the hot sun under the cruel eye of their supervisors at their slave-labor-like work camps. They are forced to live in infested wooden shacks called &quot;company housing&quot;, and to buy their food at the &quot;company store&quot; whose prices are exorbitant and which comes out of their already paltry pay. The most horrifically ironic part is that while their meals usually consist of gruel &quot;with bacon grease for strength&quot;, they dare not eat the fruit they pick for fear of swift and severe punishment. Forced to flee the camp after Tom assaults a would-be rapist, the family is all but lost. The final scene is heart wrenching and unforgettable - and proves Ma's claim that the poor are the ones who can be counted when somebody is in need.The Grapes of Wrath is considered one of this century's greatest literary masterpieces, and with good reason. Its many layers are deeply thought-provoking - and provides insightful social commentary which could address many issues we deal with even today. Read it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Over the years I've read and heard from many people about The Grapes of Wrath. The comments ranged from, \\"it's overrated\\" to \\"it's the best book ever written by an American author\\". I will not try to make you believe either. However, this is the most powerful writing that I have ever read. There are passages in this book that just make you stop and sit back to think a bit. One that hit me very hard was midway through the book: \\"Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor\\". This line was written in response to the destitute tenant farmers scrabbling for work with nearly no money putting a few coins each on a pile in front of a tent where a little boy had died of malnutrition so that the family could have him buried.Throughout history the American dream has had many speed bumps or as in the case of this novel, barriers. But the spirit of the American people in every instance has overcome all. This is a book about that spirit, nearly broken, but not ever completely. There isn't much that can befall a family that the Joad family did not have to deal with. It's a story of persistence and overcoming all odds without losing your own humanity. When everything is against you and you can still look at the other person as someone in more need, then you will begin to understand what made these people.Seventy years later, this story has as much or more relevance than the period from which it came. The world is absorbing yet another economic crisis. There are many differences between now and the era of the Dust Bowl and Steinbeck brings these to the foreground with his typical prescience.The family unit is front and center in this work. The mother and father were so over matched by the elements of nature, progress and technology and just plain happenstance that every member of the family stepped in and picked up the entire group on their shoulders when it was needed. Looking back at this particular element of the story by way of 2011 makes me think that as a culture, we have lost some of this most fundamental building block of society.As liberal and progressive a thinker as John Steinbeck was in presenting this story, I cannot help but think just how conservative his thinking by today's standards. His use of ostracizing the children at croquet and then using a similar method on adults at the government camp would be thought to be draconian today, but in fact these were commonly used forms of punishment to protect the whole of society from those that wanted to break it down. Are we missing this element in today's society?In The Grapes of Wrath, several years of dust storms and drought have brought on major changes in the way farms and farmland are owed and operated. The big, bad corporations and banks take over the land when the tenant farmers are not able to make their payments. Is today's economic crash much different? Are we substituting housing for farms? How many of those subsequent bankers lost their jobs to a different but very real economic stress in 2008 as many large banks had to downsize and re-organize?The relevance is real, the emotion palpable, and the understanding that it could happen to anyone is scary. Yes, The Grapes of Wrath is as terrific as it is terrifying, real as it is relevant, and is as American as Apple Pie. If you haven't read it before, please do so. Instead of ridiculous demands in our schools to read Great Expectations, The Grapes of Wrath should be the book of choice. There is just so much to be learned from this great book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"When I first moved to Los Angeles, the majority population was White with fairly large Hispanic and Black minorities. Now the majority population is Hispanic, and I frequently find myself communicating with them in Spanish.Look in any newspaper. All around the world, large masses of people are on the move: Albanians to Italy, Serbs to Hungary, Rwandans to Zaire, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis to Britain, Algerians to France, and so on. Every year, the number of people in refugee camps grows; and the resources of nations are stretched to the limit to accommodate the influx.In America, we've had our own migrations: from the original 13 Colonies to the West, Blacks from the South to Northern industrial cities after World War II, and the Okies to California during the Depression.My point is that Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH discusses a very contemporary phenomenon with compassion and great artistry. His Joad family can just as easily be Mexican \\"Wetbacks\\" looking or a better life in the same places where the Joads went (Arvin, the site of the FSA's Weedpatch Camp, is mostly Chicano today). How Steinbeck, a native Californian, came to side with the Okies against the corporate farmers and their hired deputies, and the townsfolk who supported them, is an interesting story in itself. Suffice it to say that no one was more sympathetic with the plight of the poor than Steinbeck, who at times comes across as an American Gorky.There are other books that show equally great compassion. Steinbeck in this novel, however, rises to heights of poetry he was never to reach again. Tom Joad in this passage explains why he decided to become a labor organizer:\\"Says one time he [Jim Casy, the preacher] went out into the wilderness to find his own soul, an' he foun' he jus' got a little piece of a great big soul. Says a wilderness ain't no good , 'cause his little piece of a soul wasn't no good 'less it was with the rest, an' was whole. Funny how I remember. Didn' think I was even listenin'. But I know now a fella ain't no good alone.\\"There are scenes, such as the description of the progress of a turtle seen by Tom as he walks down the long road home after being paroled, where you see as if in a magnifying glass the progress of untold thousands of farmers fleeing the drought of the Dust Bowl.This is a book which will make you feel different about your fellow man. It takes the side of the hated, misunderstood outsider and sees poetry, goodness, a rough justice, and a tenacity that can move mountains."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"If you are looking for slick plots, witty humour, or fast paced action, don't bother looking here. Steinbeck trancends society's 2 minute attention span to deliver a work so thought provoking, so fundamentally touching and heart-wrenching, that the reader cannot help but ponder its effect long after having put it down.The novel follows the dust bowl migration of the Great Depression, alternating between the desolate struggle of a migrant family - the Joads - and more broad depictions of a people forced to the threshold of human tolerance and survival.The language is especially brilliant. As one less than ecstatic reviewer exclaimed,\\"this book was about dirt, poor people and dirt.\\" Exactly, and one could not craft a more beautiful picture out of such material. The imagery is wonderfully crafted to perpetuate exactly what Steinbeck wanted: gloom, anger, and a paradoxical will to keep faith and move on.\\"Our people are good people; our people are kind people. Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor. Pray God some day a kid can eat. And assosiations of owners knew that some day the praying would stop. And there's the end.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail.

No shocking climax (although there are a number of shocking events portrayed throughout), no personified villian... none of that.The Grapes of Wrath is phenomenal not for the unforgetable cross-country trek of the Joad family in the post-depression years, but for the essence of humanity which Steinbeck so perfectly captures in every chapter. Steinbeck demonstrates how people who are just barely getting by on what they have sometimes have more to give to their fellow man than the wealthiest citizens our society has to offer. He draws a vivid picture of struggle during hard times for the most disenfanchized Americans, yet shows the emotional side of poverty and disolutionment, and reveals how genuin humanity can often be most prevalent amidst the most inhumane of living conditions.It has been said that Steinbeck had a socialist agenda when he came out with The Grapes of Wrath, but I couldn't disagree more with that assessment. Steinbeck isn't so much jabbing at a political/economic injustice in this novel as he is striking at the lack of humanity that can be brought about when business efficiency and profitability are thought to trump human decency.As I write this review the American financial system is once again in peril, and themes from Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath are suddenly becoming more meaningful than they had been when I read this book in high school. I am amazed at how true and applicable Steinbecks points still ring today, and I recomend this book to anyone who hasn't read it in years or who has yet to read it for the first time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I get personally offended when I read reviews accusing this masterpiece of being &quot;boring.&quot; I suppose if one is extremely uneducated, this towering drama of American restlessness can seem boring, but if one is that uneducated, one should stick with Mary Higgins Clark. Steinbeck isn't difficult stuff, people. The language is far from that horribly stuffy Charles Dickens crap; rather, it's closer in style and elegant simplicity to the pinnacle of 19th-century American literature, Mark Twain. The dialogue is NOT trite, it's sparse. The descriptive passages are NOT monotonous, they're stark and yet detailed. The plot is NOT far-fetched, it's based on a journey undertaken by thousands of discontented pilgrims.I will not go so far as to call this work the Greatest American Novel, or even the Greatest American Novel of the Twentieth Century. It's up there, without a doubt, if only because of its social influence and the underbelly that it exposes. But in addition to being one of the GREATEST books, it is also one of the BEST books. It's genuinely interesting...gripping...engaging. I read it a few years ago, I think during the summer between the 10th and 11th grades, and I could barely put it down. It's one of those rare novels: a page-turner, yet with prose sometimes delicious enough to roll through your imagination a few times, savoring the language composition. And after you've finished reading, you find that the novel has left you profoundly affected.So it's not just a Great Book; it's a really really good book as well. It's powerful, it's enjoyable on every level. Read it and be changed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I will never forget how this book captivated me in so many ways. An American classic that will stand the test of time. I got the pleasure of being assigned this book in 10th grade as part of literature class. I was forever changed by this book, and helped fuel me to read more challenging books.John Steinbeck helped me to realize the poverty, the trangressions, and some hope of the Depression. It helped put me in focus with the pride problems that the family had during the collapse of an entire society during America's most trying times. It is well written and very captivating. It had me in tears more than once. It also reads much like The Bible at times, in its prose and style. It catalogs a family's journey from farmers to migrant workers that is easily readable and a classic that helped define a generation.A great book- and a must have."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I hungrily devoured this book, and yet, several times, I had to stop to digest the depth and import of a few simple words. Steinbeck is commenting on industrialization, big business killing small business, environmentalism, family, the extended family of the human race...all in an allegory of Exodus and Jesus Christ's life. I can't think of a more timely message for the modern world. The symbolism was a bit obvious at times, but there were also more subtle areas in which he left you with just a hint of import until you were able to analyze it more fully. The ending gives new meaning to the Milk of Human Kindness. I absolutely recommend this, but at least a basic background in the history of the Dust Bowl and Depression are recommended."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"A Review of The Grapes of Wrath by John SteinbeckI am not an economist so I am not even going to try to understand the economic mess were are in as a nation - but I cannot help but think about The Grapes of Wrath and the odyssey of the Joad family when I think about our current financial times. Massive debt. Budget shortages. Home foreclosures. Business failures. Bankruptcies. Job losses. In some ways I feel that we are all (well many of us) Joad's now - trapped in a financial system that we do not understand, trying to make a daily living, but always feeling that we are taking one step up and two back.My favorite scene in The Grapes of Wrath was early in the book, when a tenant farmer is trying to stop his home and land from being plowed over by tractor-operator hired by the bank. This is a man he knows, a local, who has taken a job with the bank to gain a regular salary and some stability for his family. But, this stability comes with a huge price. His job is to repossess the land of his friends and neighbors and ready it to be turned over to the banks. How many of us would do the same? Life is a struggle and when money is tight we would do most anything to pay the bills and feed our own - but where do we draw the lines? The tenant wants to shoot him - but the man explains the truth - it's not him, not his fault - it's no one's fault - we are all ghosts in the money machine. This is a slice of that conversation:\\"It's not me. There's nothing I can do. I'll lose my job if I don't do it. And look -- suppose you kill me? They'll just hang you, but long before your hung there will be another guy on the tractor, and he'll bump the house down. You're not killing the right guy.\\"\\"That's so,\\" the tenant said. \\"Who gave you orders? I'll go after him. He's the one to kill.\\"\\"You're wrong. He got his orders from the bank. The bank told them: \\"Clear those people out or it's your job.\\"\\"Well, there's a president of the bank. There's a Board of Directors. I'll fill up the magazine of the rifle and go into the bank.\\"The driver said: \\"Fellow was telling me the bank gets orders from the East. The orders were:\\"Make the land show profit or we'll close you up.\\"\\"But where does it stop? Who can we shoot? I don't aim to starve to death before I kill the man that's starving me.\\"\\"I don't know. Maybe there's nobody to shoot. Maybe the thing isn't man at all. Maybe, like you said, the property's doing it. Anyway I told you my orders.\\"The financial machine we live inside often challenges our morality, our faith, our ethics in exchange for a paycheck. Think Glengarry Glen Ross, think sell or be fired, think it me or you and its not going to be me. So we take a nice long trip to Disney to forget all about it. Maybe we have a food drive at school - help the less fortunate. How are we supposed to live? Is this really it? Work your butt off, get as much as you can, hoard as much as you can - every man for himself. Really? The Joad's are not bums, not lazy, not moochers. They are simple folk who want to work - an honest days work for an honest days pay. But the fruit growers of this novel are the factories of Mexico, China, Vietnam, and every other \\"third world\\" country that produces our clothes, shoes, food and products. They are in a race to the bottom - pitted against one another for jobs - always pushed to do more for less. Why? So we can buy three dollar T-shirts at Wal-Mart.Don't get me wrong - I shop at Wal-Mart - we all do - we have to make our money stretch. We are all stuck. But can it change? As the tenant farmer went on to say:\\"I got to figure,\\" the tenant said. \\"We all got to figure. There's some way to stop this. It's not like lightning or earthquakes. We've got a bad thing made by men, and by God that's something we can change.\\"I think the beginning is within each of us - within me. We (I) made this mess - we (I am) are part of this mess. We (I) can change it by waking up, beginning to care and changing how we (I) live, think and treat one another - today. We (I) need to begin to want less, expect less and need less. This concept is antithetical in a society based on consumption - but will help forge a world that is more humane and loving. It is time to withdraw from the \\"Grand Illusion\\", to unplug the television, cancel your (my) subscription to all your (my) magazines, especially - \\"You're Not Skinny Enough\\" Monthly, \\"My House is Perfect - What's Up With Yours\\" Weekly and \\"Look How Rich I Am\\" Daily - shut it off - go outside, appreciate what you have, love one another, seek God and be what he has commanded us to be in this life - witnesses to his Word, not buyers of more garbage. As Americans we need to see ourselves for what we are - from a global perspective - we are the rich oppressors. Our want's, needs, desires, and struggles impact the world. We need to heed the following:\\"Now listen, you rich people, weep and wail because of the misery that is coming upon you. Your wealth has rotted, and moths have eaten your clothes. Your gold and silver are corroded. Their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire. You have hoarded wealth in the last days. Look! The wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you. The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty. You have lived in luxury and self-indulgence. You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter. You have condemned and murdered innocent men, who were not opposing you.\\" - James 5: 1-6Although The Grapes of Wrath is a story about the Great Depression, it is a story of our lives - today. Many in this nation are doing very well - their houses keep getting bigger, their cars more expensive, their travel more extensive and their luxuries increase- but what about the rest. The Joad family represents \\"the rest.\\" All those people who have been foreclosed upon; laid off - forgotten. Where do they go? What do they do? Do we care?This is not a political perspective - politics do far more harm than good - nothing has been changed through legislation. Problems such as this require a change of the heart. It requires us to look each other in the eye - see one another as fellow humans - a mother, father, husband, wife, sister, brother, son, or daughter - not as a number or a servant. I believe that we as a nation will reap what we sow - it is for us to decide what that will be. Our final reward will be contingent on how we treated the least among us - every day. I am far from doing this - my eyes are just opening to my personal greed, narcissism and selfishness - but all change begins with the decision to change. What is your decision?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is an absolutely fantastic book illustrating the difficulties of many Americans during the depression (and the strength of a family to stick together and fight for each other). Though it is definitely not a page turner, and frequently slow, this is perhaps the only book I've read that I find myself frequently telling people they should read.I had a difficult time appreciating the book while reading it; however, I greatly appreciated it upon completion (about 4 years ago) and my appreciation keeps growing. I find the book to be very relevant and a good reminder of how life was for many just 80 years ago, especially when I hear people talking about how difficult or unfair things are today in the US. It's a sad reminder that, although I wouldn't wish the Joads' life on anyone, our society is far removed from the difficulties that instilled strength, resiliency, and a code of honor that made both that generation and this country great.I'm tempted to give this book 4 stars because it's slow and sometimes difficult to get through (though I am a fan of the chapter structure where Steinbeck alternates between long chapters involving the Joads and short anecdotes not involving the Joads but showing further insight into life during that time), but due to its impact on me and my continued frequent recommendation to others to read it, giving it less than 5 stars would be an injustice to this book. Also, I'm not sure who I would broadly recommend this book to, but I would not generally recommend it to younger audiences (who may lack sufficient insight into life and history) as I didn't read it until I was nearly 30 and still needed some time after reading it to fully appreciate it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time?

In depicting the life of the Joads, the novel offers a vivid portrayal of the lives of many who suffered through the Great Depression. On a broader level this work also provides a commentary on government, religion, and politics. The climactic scene is meaningful but does not flow from the preceding chapters, and the ending is odd and will make you wonder what the message is.By the end of the novel, one may realize that this story is not just about the Joads, but a story of all Americans, no matter what the background.

We both really liked it. We saw the movie also.I'm am one of those who considers this to be Steinbeck's best. I've read several others by the author and I feel that this was far and away the deepest and the most dramatic. The ending I'm sure some would consider more appropriate in an ancient Greek tragedy but he made his point - one that I have always found very traditional and very difficult to swallow. But it is fundamental.This is without any doubt and American classic. In my opinion nothing that Mr. Steinbeck wrote after The Grapes Of Wrath is in the same class. I know that there are plenty out there who disagree but nevertheless that is my opinion.In this novel, everything is centered on the characters. There is little blatent philosophizing - the story tells the tale. There is no Steinbeck filler material. He had a story he wanted to tell and he told it. It was great.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"BORING.

Although I found the plot (the plight of the Joad family and their journey to California to find a better lifestyle) interesting and thought provoking, the novel is too long to keep the interest of the reader. Intercalary chapters (usually odd numbered) add seemingly pointless symbolism and can confuse or bore readers.Another aspect of the novel that I severly disliked was the diction (an older Oklahoma twang) that was hard to understand.Overall, I didn't like many aspects of the novel, but I thought that the plot was interesting. Also, in my opinion, the ending was somewhat sick and twisted.So if you're in for a long read with a lot of symbolism, the Grapes of Wrath is the perfect book for you.

Buy it from Amazon for $3.99.hello?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The book \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was a great book for showing the effects of the dust bowl and depression on Americas people. This book shows how america has changed from a state of chaos and uncertianty in the dust bowl of the 1930's. Now it is a state of what america was meant to be, a land of success and prosperity. We truely see America as a place of confusion and uncertianty in the entire trip that the Joad's made. The Joad's don't know where they are going throughout the whole trip they were going to a better place for everyone(so they thought). The confusion happened thoughout the whole trip because they had heard so many good things about this wondewrful new land of work and money. As they go their though they realize through the people coming and going from the land of 'prosperity' that it isn't all that it's cooked up to be. They learn through people and their own experiences that the land of prosperity for one man isn't that for the other. But, they are confused and uncertian about this througout the whole book until at the end they realize that this land doesn't mean prosperity, it means death for them, but at that time it's too late.I didn't like this book because I believe it took to long to get to things. I think they could have cut out several chapters about the tractors and migrates because they just repeated themsleves and didn't really state a strong knew point. I would have enjoyed it more if they had condensed it and threw out some of the unnecessary stops and converstions as well as chapters and people they meet. I do believe most of the people were important like the Wilsons and the people at the government camp like Thomas, Mrs. Sandry, etc. But, the people they talk to at the stops sometimes and people they associate themselves with for a night that takes a chapter. Why do you even put them in? This book could have been a lot shorter if you cut out alot of the unnessecary things.I think this book has very good themes and gives you a good idea about what the 1930's and dust bowl was like though. I shows you the pain and suffering that people had to endure in different ways and ages. They showed you the Granma and Granpa, Ma and Pa, Al, Tom, Rose of Sharon, Connie, and Casey, Winfeild and Ruthie. Each person show you how this effected their age of people and the way they did things and conducted themselves. This doesn't acount for everyone in their age group, but a good portion. One example is Tom. He resembles the common worker who is ambicious and angry at where he is. It shows him nearly killing himself to try to get fair work and to be respected at the same time. Everyone resembles a different group in America and how they were effected by the turn of events that was happenign in America.I liked the books purpose, theme, and reasons for writing it. I think that some of the individual componients could have been changed, but over all I can look over those and see a very well written book with a great meaning and purpose."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath had to have been one of the most boring books I have read in my entire life. The plot is switched around so many times it is confusing, the some of the characters were given way too many names, and I couldn't tell what character was being talked about half the time. Most of the book is entirely pointless and the important part of the story is about ten pages long. The plot of the story is boring, and the story its self is ended in a very confusing manner.

The story line is quite boring and seems very pointless at times. The book does, however, redeem itself slightly when it is not focusing on the main story line. John Steinbeck writes about the Great Depression from other character's points of view other than the main family the story is focused upon, and he gives some profound insights of his own on this time period every third chapter as well. I would seriously suggest skipping the chapters which contains the main story line, and read the others instead. It would be much more worth your time and sanity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I like steinbeck. i really do. east of eden was wonderful. every other book i have read by him was good. however, this book is a waste of time. the people in the places he wrote about were insulted, and i don't blame them. my family were farmers(not in that area). i guarentee that they read, write, and do not get put in jail. they actually use proper english(gasp of astonishment). and they have shoes(does that blow your mind?). that said, this book makes a powerful statement about the time it was written, but i can't get past the characters. i cannot force myself to like tom joad, or the nasty preacher. any comparison to christ is just disturbing. maybe the mark of a good writer is to push the envelope, but i don't care to read a book written just for that purpose. good books are honest, and i simply don't believe this one is. also, look how long it is. as an added discouragement, my religion teacher likes this book. so to me that is another reason to avoid it. one last word about farmers. farmers are some of the best people in the world. and they are not stupid. and there are people who believe in God and actually act the right way. granted, a lot of people don't. but i am sick of all this one big united spirit garbage. and people think Christians are stupid for believing in God. you want something stupid, look at this transcendalism garbage. when are people going to stop saying something is beyond them when it is really below them?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I wouldn't even give this book 1 star.

The narratives describing a place, an event, a feeling or emotion were so well written that the reader would feel transported back in time, to the place, made to see the event as it happened, made to feel the emotions. This, no matter if one has to struggle to understand some of the spoken words in context.A lot can be learned from this book, not only about history and the appreciation of what we have in the present day, but also more about the human strength, tenacity and innate goodness in the face of a seeming insurmountable adversity. I really wish it has a happier ending, say a reunion of the Joad family, or better times...but really, what happier ending could it have than one's giving of self to a stranger in dire need?

As many of the inhabitants of rural America--especially in the South and Appalachia--are of Scotch-Irish descent (many of my own ancestors included) it is natural to expect that the American revival meeting might have its origin in Lowland Scotland. I also found that these Scottish \\"Holy Fairs\\" were ridiculed by the poet Robert Burns in his poem \\"The Holy Fair\\", as can be found inPoems and Songs of Robert Burns. Indeed, Burns considered such gatherings to be an assembly of hypocrites who attended these meetings in order to arrange assignations with the young women attending such events. Of course Burns (the sire of numerous illegitimate children) was all for debauchery--just as it was indulged in a way that was free of pretense! As I continued thinking about this aspect of religious revival meetings I remembered the section of The Grapes of Wrath in which Tom Joad encounters Jim Casy, who had been a revival preacher in Tom's youth. Casy tells Tom about how he would bed young women in the grass after they had been excited by such meetings, which seemed to have acted as a sort of aphrodisiac. In Casy's confession to Tom he worried about his own hypocrisy in those days--leading those girls into sin just after exhorting them to shun such encounters."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is a great book. I finished reading this in December(now it's April) but I still remember how realistic this was written by Steinbeck. He makes the characters come alive and breathe. Their hard lives are seen as heroic and well done scenes in a long play.This is supposed to be a communistic version of California with the scenes of the goons beating up the union leaders. Look now what is happening to destroy unions in Wisconsin, Indiana, and Ohio(pretty soon New Jersey, Florida, and who knows). So Steinbeck was right in 1938 to portray unions as the enemy of the rich capitalist ranchers and agricultural powerful interests. The poor Joads were only trying to do honest work and look what happened to them.First the banks wouldn't lend to them back in Oklahoma so they decided to travel to California to make a new living. Then when they tried to make a little more money they were beaten by the union haters. Their camp was destroyed by the owners.Supposedly John Steinbeck wrote this in 5 months in 1936 at the time of the Dust Bowl. This is history that is rarely taught in America today. Young people should read this American classic. There is a Steinbeck Museum in Salinas, California and I hope to go there as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"If you give the book a chance it will change you in ways you never before dreamed of. The Grapes of Wrath stacks up in its theme and scope to the greatest world novels, such as Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, Of Human Bondage, War and Peace. Its scope and theme are universal. Its ultimate message: Human dignity and suffering. If the Grapes of Wrath doesn't stir and shake you, check your pulse. A powerful and arresting masterpiece that should be required reading for anyone who considers themselves a member of the human race, and who has ever suffered deeply and wishes to be healed by the power of humanity.

It is a powerful book, about a time in American history that was among the most difficult we have ever faced. This book is a story of the survival of a family that manages to keep their dignity and spirit; no matter what hardships they must endure. Steinbeck's writing grabs you and draws you into the story of the Joad family, along with a vivid portrait of America. It's a book that once picked up is hard to put down. It has been called one of the greatest novels ever written, and that is an opinion I heartily agree with.

We, like the Joads, are all immigrants. Their story is the story of America. The migration from Oklahoma to California mirrors the migration from Europe and Asia to America. We all have a common bond with the \\"Okies.\\"While Steinbeck does seem to propose a collective style economy in several of his works, he also is able to identify the fierce individualism that has allowed a nation of immigrants to survive and prosper in a harsh and unsettled land. I think that he is off the mark in demonizing the haves and glorifying the have-nots. The true story lies in the battle of the just against the unjust. The struggle between givers and takers. There are good and evil on both sides.I did not especially care for the ending. I would have preferred that he follow Tom to some sort of climax as he stood out as the central figure all along. Of course, Ma was equally important and worthy of attention.In summary, we have become a soft people. We have forgotten the struggles and hardships that were overcome by our ancestors so that they might simply survive. There is, most likely, a strong spirit within most of us today. Unfortunatley, this spirit is buried very deep and held down by our numerous creature comforts and distractions. The Joads, and all of those like them, were no better than the rest of us. The circumstances of their lives, the proximity to mortality, forced their spirit to the surface.To me, the importance of this book is that it causes the reader to take a breath and to reflect on the struggles that we all are confronted with. We all have our desert to cross. We are all the same no matter how hard we try to be different."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is a wonderful way to understand what its like to be truly deprived of the things we treasure most in life. it helps to better understand how precious life and family are. one minute they're there and putting up a fight, and the next thing you know, they're gone.

My '90s eyes kept expecting a newer stranger to deny the Joads help, to not share their food, to not lend a hand. But that moment never came.

Being united against &quot;them&quot; (the banks, the landowners) is the only way to survive. This is shown on the group level by the self-governing government camp and on the personal level by Rose of Sharon's act of kindness to a starving man.

It is a complete joy to read the melange of roadside towns and attractions that seem to haunt the Joads' journey. Their jalopy becomes a metaphor of a broken down world that entraps them. However catastrophic the tragedy becomes, it is a slow and deliberate kind of grief. There always seems to be someone to help send the Joads' on their way. The tale hits home when the Oklahoma family reaches California, the land of hopes and dreams, of liberty, for the Joads' and the rest of the nation. There awaits them a cauldron of discontent among those sharing a similar fate, in the migrant worker camps.

It is a wonderful book and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"John Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath in 1939 on account of the great dust bowl in the 1920's. This horrible blight upon the land caused the topsoil to be literally non-existent; choking off crops of grapes, corn, and other crops that tenant workers of the time depended on for every day survival.The Grapes of Wrath is indisputably Steinbeck's best novel ever written, and is one of the best and most well known novels in history. The Grapes of Wrath also brought Steinbeck a Nobel Prize in literature, and world praise for his realistic depictions of daily, southern California life on the ranch, and the troubles that eat at the inhabitants daily.The Grapes of Wrath is a story that starts out with tom, a regular man, who is in search of his family. Tom soon finds out that his family has been forced to move to California the land of \\"new opportunities,\\" because the bank had repossessed everyone's land in that region for the growth of cotton, since the soil was so bad. Along the way, however, the family undergoes many hardships such as lack of money, food, and low, tired spirits. Finally, the family reaches a fertile valley in southern California where peaches are grown. The family picks the peaches for the farm, but soon loose their dream job due to difficulties. The family must now resume their search for a suitable job that is capable of supporting the over ten members of the family. The question is, will the family get their needs met by the new job, or will they find that hardships are too difficult in California, and they must move elsewhere? Steinbeck used chapters in the book describing the main family of the novel, but meant to be a broader, more generalized group. The dialogue in these chapters is not suggested with quotations, but is rather noticed by the reader through the different tones. This gives the further impression of hardship by allowing the reader to make associations to ones that they know whom have gone through the likewise.Steinbeck's classic novel, The Grapes of Wrath is a very sad book, however shows a very realistic view of life at that time and location. It shows themes of endurance through hardship, the importance of family, and that one day, a hope may be come upon, no matter how hard it may be to get there. For Steinbeck's great story telling capabilities, as well as his great usage of local dialogue, intricate character description, and portrayal of daily life, I deem this one of the best novels that I have ever read, and I gladly recommend it to all those who are up for a good classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath tells the story of the Joad family, a poor farming family who have been forced off their land and journeyed west to California in search of prosperity. The story of their continuing hardships gives the reader a personal connection to the plight of the poor population during the Depression.This was an excellent novel, putting the human face on one of the darkest periods of our American history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is a wonderful story that will take you on an often painful journey. The characters are so vivid and one can really emapathize for what they are going through. The story tells the larger story of a nation in transformation. No longer will small farmers be able to compete with large corporations. The spirit and determination of Ma is admirable as she maintains perspective and hope in the face of so many tribulations. This is a story of survival and the strength of family."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The gem has it all. Humor (you'll laugh out loud at some of the scenes), frustration, beautiful imagery not difficult to understand and ulimately, love. You will believe the ultimate triumph of love and compassion we have for each other as family no matter who we're born to. Let yourself see the pictures in your head Steinbeck gracefully describes as he writes. It's not hard. It's not difficult reading. If nothing else, read the part about the one-eyed man getting hilarious, believable advice about how to succeed with women. Great laughs!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Truthfully the only reason I read this novel is because it was part of my summer reading assignment this year for highschool. Somehow being told you HAVE to read a book rather than wanting to on your own makes the reading experience something to dread. Well all I can say is I am SO GLAD I HAD TO READ THIS!!!This is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I have added it to my list of favorites way up there with Animal Farm (people think 'cause they read it in junior high it's for kids, WHATEVER!!)and Wuthering Heights. Every chapter is a feast for the mind. You can picture ever bead of sweat, every loss and tear as if it were right there in front of you. The story goes from humorous, to serious, to hopeful, to emotional so quickly you almost don't realize it's there till it hits you.The story takes place in the 30's based on real events, following the fictional accounts of the Joad family. Apparently back then, there was a crisis where farmers had overworked their land to the point where the soil had been reduced to worthless dust annd could no longer grow crops. The bank then had to take it from them because, well, god forbid they lose any money. Thousands, maybe millions of people were kicked out from their homes, the homes that their grandfathers had built, where children had been born and lives been lived. They were forced to all move west to California, selling what little they had for cash, dreaming of a new life. Flyers promised work and good pay, but when only 10,000 workers are needed, and 100,000 see the flyers and come looking for work, what happens then?This is a story of survival. Not like in that movie Cast Away where he's stranded on a deserted island with no food or anything, but a time not unlike today. A place filled with stores and restaurants and yet a man still can't feed his children and they are dying from malnutrition. How can you buy food if you don't have any money? and how can you make money if there aren't any jobs? \\"water water everywhere and not a drop to drink\\". And hungry men become desperate, which turns into fear, which becomes anger, and this makes teh Californians afraid. So wages drop to pay for security, to pay for more sheriffs and police and spies, and all the while this anger grows...Like I said this is a wonderful book. I'm so glad I read it.Some parts were so touching I actually cried a little. They weren't even necessarily sad but very moving. Anyway, I recommend this book to everyone as a great read. Yeah and to the person who said teenagers can't appreciate a book like this, I guess I just proved you wrong."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck's Graphes of Wrath is an amazing book. I recommend this read to anyone who enjoys Steinbeck's style of writing. It is an excellent story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Forget about SAT success, SAT key and other useless stuff -This is the real thing. I raised my verbal by 160 points just after reading it (note that I didn't use any other prep material - just the book!)

But, as I read through it the plot developed into something a reader can appreciate and understand. Steinbeck's small 'metaphorical' chapters (that occur seemingly in every other chapter) enhance the message of the book. When I finished this novel 600 or so pages later, I realized my attitude towards life had changed. You come out for better or worse, a little different after reading this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I was much more impressed by Steinbeck's distinctive writing style than I was with the general concept of the book. The author brings characters to life better than any book I've ever read. It's very difficult not to be enthralled while reading The Grapes Of Wrath. The book has historical value, and sentimental value aswell. And it just simply belongs in any personal collection."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I did not expect to like this book because I hated Of Mice and Men, but I really liked it a lot. Although slow at times, I thought the way that the plot was layed out, and the strange inter-chapters were intrigueing. The story was extremely believable, and I found myself wanting to know what would happen to the Joads next.This is truly a great piece of American literature. I'm glad I was forced to read it in English! :)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; takes place in the 30's. It starts with Nate Joad coming back from prison to his hometown in Oklahoma. He returns to find that the banks are repossessing land because the farmers could no longer afford to pay their loans back. (Also, the stock market crashed which brought &quot;The Great Depression&quot;) When he returned his family was evicted from their land and living at their parents (his grandparents) house. The family had received fliers about California. From there, they decide to head west. The Joads loaded up the old Studebaker truck, full with all belongings, and went to &quot;Get their kicks on Route 66&quot;. Which was the only highway connecting east and west coast. Many problems were encountered on the way there. This is where life took on a whole different meaning.This book was like a real person. It had flaws, imperfections, but also had character and personality of it's own. &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; wondered in and out of little sub stories while, all the way it kept on a main story. The little sub stories served a purpose though, they all had a little meaning that built into the main one. Sometimes the sub stories became a nuisance, because when the real story was getting interesting, it switch to something else. The book was also slightly long winded, but was still well done all in all."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I am not sure that there are words capable of painting an accurate picture of the emotions that this book evokes. It is the unbelievably powerful story of the Joad family. Their trek to what they hope is paradise in the West is anything but.While the story can evoke emotions in us, it seems that the characters have had to let go of any possible emotion to cope with the state of affairs in their lives. That is except for Tom (Jr.), incapable of containing his emotions- and because of that pays a price.It might be tough for us to imagine the world that the Joads were forced into. But it was not that long ago. It is an important part of (recent) American history that, I think, is often forgotten.This book is bleak. There is no silver-lining. But Steinbeck's honesty should be appreciated. He shows that many of the great things with which America entered the 20th Century, disappeared in the 1930s. In the story, even the talk of God, once central to their lives, disappears as the Joads and their compatriots battle the Depression."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I mostly read Stephen King, Dean Koontz and true crime but when I worked at Talking Book World I decided to listen to a classic. Dylan Baker read this book on tape and I fell in love with it. Baker took an excellent book that deserves it place on Classics shelf and brought it to life. It is a wonderful book that will take you back to it's time and make you thankful for all that you have. Read this book or even better, let Dylan Baker read it to you."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The grass is green and sky is blue in this American classic by John Steinback.

I HATED this book! I thought it was the most droll, boring, depressing piece of ... I had ever read, at that time anyway. I read it again a few years ago and was amazed at how wrong I had previously been! It may have just been the difference between reading something because I was forced to and reading something because I wanted to, or I may have just been too young and/or nave to appreciate it back then, I don&#65533;t know for sure.Anyway, since then, I have gone on to read every other book Steinbeck wrote, and this is by far my favorite! This is the quintessential American novel and Steinbeck is the quintessential American writer. His character development, historical knowledge, vivid imagery are amazing, and the underlying sediments of human goodwill in, granted, often depressing circumstances, should be an example to us all. The way that Rose of Sharon, by far, the most ego-centric character in the book, winds up committing the most self-less act brought me to tears every time I read this.Anyone who gives this book a bad review is either too young and inexperienced to appreciate it (as I was when I first did), or doesn&#65533;t know a thing about literature. Have a mentioned that this is my all-time favorite read (besides also &#65533;To Kill A Mockingbird&#65533;)?P.S. If you do like this, I would also HIGHLY recommend Woody Guthrie&#65533;s &#65533;Seeds of Man&#65533;, another, much more humorous Okie tale.Also, if your into Steinbeck, check out \\"In Dubious Battle\\", the 2nd best book he wrote."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book is undoubtedly one of the greatest books ever written. It is Steinbeck's classic, which is really saying something. I've read some bad reviews here (though one spelled the name of the family wrong), but I just don't know how anyone can give this book 1 star.The Grapes of Wrath is the essential story of that time period, as it perfectly sums up the Dust Bowl and the Depression era American. Out of this setting, Steinbeck creates vivid characters that you will not soon forget.This book is not, however, uplifting. Yes it is pessimistic, but he is trying to make a point. And it can also be dry at times, though when you finish it I believe you will have found it well worth the read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is easily one of the best books that I have ever read. I was one of the few in my 12th grade english/history class that read the entire thing from cover to cover. It tells the story of the Joad family during the great depression and the dust bowl. They make their way from their desolate farm land in the mid-west to california to find work in the many orchards and farms. This is an american epic that no one should skip reading. The only one complaint that I and many other people have with the book is the last line or two. It does not ruin the book but really hurts it's quality."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I say that because this book will leave you despondent. If you're already poor, this book might not inspire you to succeed.

The authors vivid descriptive language draws one into the world as it looked like in USA at the time. Being non-american it really helped me understand a lot of the time being - and in addition to the history-lessons ;) I also felt that i had spend a great time with a great book. Certainly a 20th century classic. I love it. Now you go read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"It's a shame that the majority of people who read this book are forced to do so as a school assignment. I don't think you can fully embrace the scope of this work with the anxiety of a report hanging over your head. I was fortunate in that, I was able to read it just because I chose to. I found myself becoming completely absorbed by the book, to the level that it started to seem as if it were a part of my life. I actually felt empty after I had finished it, sort of the way you feel when you leave a loved one for an extended period of time.I would also like to point out, that I am not what you would call a bookworm. I read about 3 or 4 books a year, generally in the summer. I started reading this book while on vacation. I had just finished Hemingway's &quot;The old man and the sea&quot;. For those not familiar with the old man and the sea, it's less than 100 pages long. It took me the same amount of time to read both books (1 week). I think this speaks volumes about how engrossed I became with the grapes of wrath, considering it is over 600 pages.I have only seen bits and pieces of the film version, but I found it helpful to be able to put the face of Henry Fonda on Tom Joad. I do plan on viewing the film version, but somehow doubt that it could be that true to the book. I am curious how the film version will end. Based on the era that the film was made, I doubt that they can end the same.The ending is the only thing I found disappointing about the book. As I read toward the last few pages, I started to realize that it would not end in any sort of finality, unless it were a catastrophic tragedy. If ever a book needed a sequel, this one begs for it.If you read this book as a student, and as part of an assignment, I would highly recommend re-reading it. It has the potential to make one realize just how fortunate most of our lives are, and how insignificant most of our problems are."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I had to read this book for my Honors English Class.

I read 300 pages in one sitting and found that Steinbeck provided a vivid account of life in the early part of the century. Too often we forget that there was something besides two World Wars in the early 1900's. I encourage those of you who gave it poor reviews to re-read when you are a little older. I think when you have matured and experienced the real world, this book will have much more meaning."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Amid so many people disliking this book, I love it.

I was appalled at some of the reviews given by other people. They must not have grasped the concept of the novel. Steinbeck's purpose was not to criticize or complain, but to inform by creating a fictional family in a real-life scenario from the past. He uses detailed diction, colloquialism, and an extended syntax full of methaphors to add vivacity and keep the reader interested! This is a great novel and an important lesson about the past for people in society."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Every epoch or so a book comes along that gives you a painful insight into the nature of man in the face of suffering and the most abject of circumstance. &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is one of those books.The book exemplifies in each moment, between its powerful essays interlaced in an intense story of survival and compassion in the face of the greatest adversity. Steinbeck defines the greatest elements of man, defining the vital passion that separates him from his bestial predecessors. And he demonsrates his brilliance and the insurmountable power of his diction by containing all the power and suffering that man must overcome in life with the mere description of a turtle crossing the road.I'm am a lover of novels, perpetually immersing myself in books. But of them all, this shines as my favorite novel, and has changed my life in a way that I cannot describe."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I chose to read The Grapes of Wrath as part of my English coursework and found it a truly amazing book. The imagery was so powerful, it actually feels like you are there with the Joads, sharing their trials and tribulations. I reccommend this book to everybody, please do not reject it as too long or too descriptive; if read carefully, you will find that it is all part of Steinbeck's effect of creating the reality of the awful treatment of the Joads and the plight of the migrants of Oklahoma. (If anybody shares my view, them please e-mail me with your ideas as I need to make a collation of information for my coursework -thanks!)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I recently read this book, being forced to do so by my college level English course. I can clearly see from this work the reasons why Steinbeck eventually received a Nobel Prize. His syntax is creative, clear, understandable for those with less progressed vocabularies, but intriging enough for those with greater knowledge to remain intrested. However, this ending is quite vulgar, but, if taken on another level, it shows how Rose of Sharon grown. The end also leaves the audience guessing what happens next."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Here is a book about a family living in the most desperate of conditions. In fact, as the book proceeds, you come to realise that not only has this family lost its land - its home and livelihood for generations - but that they are also in danger of losing their lives, to of all things, starvation.Today, with our Western economies booming, low unemployment, improving standards of living, most of us desperate to lose weight rather than gain it, it's easy to take for granted the simple things in life: a roof over your head, enough food to eat, running hot and cold water, the respect and friendship of your fellow countrymen, the health of yourself and your family.What most impressed me about this 58-year-old book is that it made me understand something of what it must have been like for those people that made the terribly hard journey to California. I understood their dreams of finding a new home, new friends, new jobs, new life. I understood their fears as news started to filter through that things might not be so wonderful in the new world after all, that the future was increasingly uncertain. I understood their desperation as their loved ones began to leave or die, and their hunger began to grow.As the book proceeded, I grew to feel that these characters - Tom, the Preacher, Ma, Pa, Rose of Sharon, Winfield, etc. were real people, people I wanted to overcome the terrible treatment they received, to succeed, to survive.It shocked me that such horrors could have occurred just 60 years ago in the wealthiest country on the planet. Surely, if it can happen in America, it can happen anywhere. We know that many people in Africa and Asia still live in such squalor. Perhaps similar deprevations are now being inflicted upon the Russian people.Solzhenitsyn's &quot;A day in the life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; gives a moving account of a man living for his next meal in a prison camp. However, it is all the more shocking when you see a whole family living (or dying) this way.The ending of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; provides a shocking image, even by today's cynical and graphic standards. Even now, over a month since I finished reading the book, I cannot shake this image from my head. Perhaps that is the best tribute I can pay it: even after all these years, it's a book that still has the power to shock."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book was pretty good, but I think it could have laid back on the details.

What fun to be taken back to a time I've never lived in, and read such poetic descriptive language. You rarely find anything like this in today's novel; imaginative and expressive in detail."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Another book group choice that I openly groaned about at first. I have only read one other of this authors books, \\"Of Mice and Men\\", and while I loved that book (and the film) I thought that this book would be a painful struggle to get through.I was right about it being a struggle to read and almost gave up at page 105. However, I am glad that I kept on reading to the end. It is a book that has many different facets to it and will make a thoroughly interesting discussion for a book group.The story is a hard one to read because it is just still too real in today's society, where there is enough for everyone but the rich would rather destroy it than distribute it to the needy. Now I am not a Socialist by any description but this book certainly did make me think strong and hard about it. I am looking forward to discussing this aspect of the book with my Russian friend who was brought up in the most extreme end of the socialist scale in Russia.The writing style was varied throughout the book. Some parts of it were very descriptive and emotional and really drew me into the feelings of the characters while there were whole chapters that I thought were just too wordy and did not add significantly to the book as a whole. I, initially, struggled with the vernacular of the migrants on the road but eventually got used to their way of speaking and, in fact, it made it feel more real to me and put me beside them in their lives.The ending was intense and somewhat shocking to me but it did give me back some hope in the goodness of humans that had been stripped from me by the rest of the book.4 out of 5 with one star deducted because it was a struggle and could not be described as an enjoyable read and would not be for everyone. I would suggest starting with \\"Of Mice and Men\\" if you have not read any of this authors works before as I think this book would put you off reading any of his other books. However, put it on your list of books to read before you die.Why is it usually those that have nothing that will give everything to help a fellow person!

I had to read this book for a class and was reluctant. it became quickly an enjoyable read I recommended to many friends."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a well written, intriguing, darn good book. I was truly impressed by the art and detail that is put into this novel. The book begins with the telling of the truly hospitable conditions that farmers in the south-eastern plains were experiencing. The story follows a family named the Joad's and their desire and pursuit to get to California in search of work, easier times, and a happy life. Tom Joad, who is the main character in the book, is one who I became attached to early on, because of his rash and hasty nature, but kind and merciful attitude. His journey and growth really captured me through-out the whole book.The theme of the book was quite interesting. Humanism, unity, family, and the concept of the Oversoul persist in being the top reasons behind all the events that transpire in the book. The concept of Humanism, family, and the moral reasoning of leaving no man behind are powerful things. Ma Joad, mother of Tom, demonstrates the greatest form of humanism and family, by always wanting to help others in need, and making sure that people were working together to accomplish goals. She is also the one person in the family that is constantly trying to keep the family intact and functioning. Ma even gets physical when she feels her family is going to be broken up. This leads to the next theme, which is unity. Unity is shown in both the camps of people that the Joad's come across, and in a bigger sense of family, the community. The groups of people that the family stumbles across are groups in which everyone had a place, and people worked for the benefit of each other, not themselves. This is something that really takes a mental toll on some of the main characters, who go on to enact their newfound sense of place. Jim Casy, a former preacher, joins the Joad's early on in the book, and is really trying to figure out how to help people who are in need of spiritual help. He comes upon the idea of a shared soul, and no one person being separated from another. This concept of the Oversoul has a profound effect on both Tom and Jim Casy, who make steps towards who they are going to become through-out the book.This is a book that I truly do like, for all the detail and gritty realness of the whole situation that many people were in. However, it can get very dry, very quickly. The first part of the book definitely takes it's time to pick up, which it does, and it becomes very interesting after that point.

I'm totally a Joadie (roadie for the Joad's) after reading this Steinbeck ca-lasssic. Bravo sir!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"SPOILER THREAT: MINIMAL. I've tried to stay general as much as possible.The Grapes of Wrath makes you feel vulnerable and exposed to a monster greater than all of us. It doesn't take much, a couple seasons of drought (in this case), you miss those payments, and pretty soon the bank has your house. What can you do? You struggle to find a place to live or find a place to die. The dustbowl isn't what makes us vulnerable, it's the system itself; tragedy like this can strike for many reasons, and therefore is, in essence, inevitable.Steinbeck was an incredible talent. A lot of reviewers have said the book is slow, but I disagree. The plot moves forward immediately, but I think reviewers are responding to a plot that sneaks up on the reader and Steinbeck's emphasis on voice. He alternates his voice seemingly effortlessly between the Oklahoman drawl in chapters devoted specifically to the protagonist Joad family and the other chapters that magnify the tragedy to multitudes of families suffering a similar fate.Not only is Steinbeck brilliant with his use of voice, but his understanding of cool transcends time. Tommy Joad is straight up cool, and he's as cool today as he ever was. The world loves a man that does what needs to be done: supporting his family, being a strong leader and brother, but also when circumstances force him to action, Tom won't back down, up to and including killing a man (or two), going to prison, and possibly leading a communist revolution. I'm not advocating these actions, but you can't argue what a great character Tommy makes.There is also a great deal of gender role development throughout. When things are good, the family is structured one way, but as things go bad, the family structure must react, or adapt. Characters are pushed to their limits and strength is shown as both a masculine trait, but also as a subtle and often deeper feminine trait. Some writers seem capable of writing dialogue for only one sex, but Steinbeck proves himself to be a master of both.Another common complaint is that the ending disappoints. I assume those that didn't complain, probably went out and hung themselves. Yes, it's a depressing book! That's the point. When things get bad, you have to do unbearable things to survive. The worse things get, the farther the Joad family is willing to go to help their family and others. The events push the limit of human endurance. You think this book would be worth reading if the Joad family found steady work and lived happily ever after? But the ending is also beautiful in a way, exemplifying love and unity of man. It's unpredictable through omission and inclusion. It's worth it, so finish the book.The Grapes of Wrath is powerful, memorable, and remains relevant to modern society; it is truly a classic work of literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Never read it as a kid, kinda glad because so much would have been lost on an adolescent mind.

I don&#8217;t think I have ever enjoyed a book this much."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck's novel of social injustice was from the beginning considered a Great American Novel selling over 300,000 copies in its first year, \\"a phenomenon on the scale of a national event. It was publicly banned and burned by citizens, it was debated on national radio hook-ups; but above all, it was read.\\" Steinbeck scholar John Timmerman sums up the book's impact: \\"The Grapes of Wrath may well be the most thoroughly discussed novel - in criticism, reviews, and college classrooms - of twentieth century American literature.\\" Within a year John Ford made a major movie starring Henry Fonda and in 1962 the Nobel committee cited The Grapes of Wrath as a \\"great work\\" and as one of the committee's main reasons for granting Steinbeck the Nobel Prize for Literature.Perhaps it's most fundamental message is the equality of life, there is no difference between the poor and rich, other than a bank account, all life is sacred. Treat a poor person with dignity and respect and they will and can do as well as anyone else. It is a timeless message and one that bears constant repeating, although Steinbeck's treatment is a bit folksy and sentimental.Contemporary critic Carl Van Doren said \\"This novel did more than any other Depression novel to revise the picture of America as Americans imagined it.\\" The American image of the frontier pioneer moving westward had shifted to the Joad family. The Joads encapsulated the American character and spirit of independence, scrappy can-do hard-working virtuous, an American hero archetype. Martin Seymour-Smith says the work is fundamentally flawed because Steinbeck can not show why the California businessmen's behavior is wrong - after all, they are just trying to make a living, would the Joad's in their shoes have acted any different? \\"There is a conflict in him [Steinbeck] between the philosophical unanimist and the humane socialist,\\" in other word how the Joad's treat animals (as objects) but demand equality in humans. Thus the books message of all life being sacred, no matter its circumstance, is fundamentally contradicted.In the end Grapes of Wrath is of epic proportions and a gripping story. It's often seen as the quintessential American novel of the 1930s and certainly one of Steinbeck's best (along with Of Mice and Men)."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As a quick comment, the ending of the book is different from the movie. The book is a bit more depressing, especially near the end. Overall, the movie and the book are similar in plot, but here in the book the reader will find much more detail. In short, the book is a literary masterpiece while the movie is good but not great.I came across an Amazon.com \\"Listmania\\" list for the top 10 American works of fiction. I had read a few of the books, but not all so I decided to buy all those that I had not read. These include the present book, and some that I have now read and posted reviews including Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov and On the Road by Jack Kerouac. All of the books have been interesting reads and not what I had expected - lots of surprises.When I bought the present book I did not realize that this book is actually two books in one. There is a 44 page introduction (what I call the first book) by the Steinbeck scholar Robert DeMott. His introduction is much longer than I had anticipated. This is in fact a mini-biography that describes Steinbeck's state of mind prior to and during the writing of the book. Also DeMott describes Steinbeck's life leading up to the book and what happens after the success of Grapes of Wrath. In addition, DeMott has \\"suggestions for further reading\\". So I would recommend the present book.It is hard for me to rate the Grapes of Wrath since it has become something of a classic with about 15 million copies or more in print. The rating is a bit subjective, but I would say 5 stars, even if it was not famous. The book is a \\"reality fiction\\" or simply realism, i.e.: pure fiction but like many other fiction writers it is based on real events that are accurately described and has a few characters based on friends of the author.Steinbeck received both praise and criticism for the book. Many thought he had exaggerated the problems of the migrant workers. But as explained by DeMott if anything Steinbeck who had first hand working experiences with the migrant worker has slightly moderated the descriptions of the hardships faced by the migrants as presented in the book, and in no fashion did he exaggerate their problems.This is a very interesting book and I would highly recommend buying and reading. It seems that the world has not changed that much since 1939. We still have migrant workers working under bad conditions although they are no longer from Oklahoma. They have been replaced by illegal aliens from Mexico, eager for the jobs. We still have some corporations and politicians trying to deny the reality of the hardships and issuing counter propaganda. We have perhaps even more problems today such as global warming, also denied by some. The world has not changed in 65 years - but the book is still of interest and perhaps even timely."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Just finished the book. I spent the first 1/3 of this book not very interested at all. I appreciated Steinbeck's passages showing the workings of capitalism, but found the dialoge to be pretty artificial and, since so much of the book is dialogue, found reading it pretty grating. About halfway throuh I was finally able to suspend disbelief and forgave the bad dialogue. I suppose by then I was deep enough inside the world of the book that I was willing to accept the dialogue as real - like one might accept the dialogue in bible translations. By this time, I was pretty interested in the story, but still not convinced I was reading a great book. Good, not great. This view continued until the last few paragraphs. I don't know what more to say but the ending took my head off. Wow. Its almost an hour later and I'm still having brief fits of tears. The ending was both devastating and inspiring. For a writer to manage that is genius.Whatever you do, don't skip to the end. Saving it will be so worth it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, by John Steinbeck was the book I read for learning more about the 1930's decade and was a very interesting book to me, and overall helped me understand more about the Great Depressions and what it was about. I'll admit I wasn't too excited about reading The Grapes Of Wrath, but to be honest I liked it a lot. To be honest, I did not know a whole lot about the Great Depression, just some of the really general, easy facts that most people know, or at least I would hope knew. I knew when it was, how the stock market crashed, and how there were very few jobs available. This book helped me understand what the depression was all about because it gave me a personal tale of someone living during this particular time in history. The main character, Tom, is released from jail and goes back to his family farm. After being gone for four years, he realizes most of his neighbors have disappeared, and one of the town preachers tells him that everyone went to California to find jobs. So Tom and his family travel over there, even though it takes forever because everyone is on the same highway to California, they eventually make it. As they arrive at California, one of the immigrants tells the Joad family that there are barely any jobs and throughout the rest of the book, they struggle to make money and keep their family alive throughout this hardship.For me, it is hard to imagine that a personal story like this was probably very common for families during the 1930's. It was sad to read that many of Tom's relatives actually died on the trip over to California because the conditions were so rough. Before I read this book, I thought there were some similarities between the depression and all the job losses going on right now, but now I cannot even compare them because they are so different. Sure, people have lost a lot of their jobs right now, and although that may be tragic for that single family, it is nothing like what happened in the late 20's and early 30's. Families had no means of getting food for themselves because in the book it talked about how many of the factory owners were scared of a workers strike, so they made sure that there weren't many jobs for them to have.Later on in The Grapes of Wrath, it explained how when the Joads were done picking for cotton season, they must return home to find work, but rumors around the country were that there wasn't going to be any jobs at all for the next three months. That may not seem like a lot, but 90 days is along time with no income. I was so interested after I read this book because it made me really appreciate everyone who lived through that tough time and made it out stronger. We should not judge any single person, or their past, because unless we are put in the exact same situation, we can't really have an informed opinion on it. I think from this book I realized how many really hard years that our country went through, and that it is all worth it because it can only make us stronger and give everyone hope to make things right again in the future. Personally I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I hadn't read Steinbeck since high school and I have to admit that the brilliance of his work escaped me then. It didn't this time. This book is impressive on many levels. Steinbeck has captured the reality of life in America during the Depression like few others. In doing so, he has also captured a snapshot of America that is both poignant and enlightening. The greatest works of art and literature transcend themselves beyond the immediate and become timeless and that is very much the case here. Most readers will find they have little in common with the Joad family and yet Steinbeck portrays the human side of an Oklahoma family so well that most every reader can relate to them. Steinbeck's brilliance is apparent in his ability to portray and to relate the human condition. It is also apparent in creating a work of vision that is both immense in scope and finite in detail. Oddly, in a tragic story largely full of despair, Steinbeck still manages to communicate a sense of optimism and hope for our society. This book is worth reading more than once and I have to agree with its rating in the top 10 of the century."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book like no other one before it or after it expresses the dire situations that captalism and the endless need for profit that is built into the human psyche can create for our race. Steinbeck, a moderate leftist, portrays a family of &quot;Dust Bowl&quot; migrants as they travel through the Midwest to California, to seek land and new jobs(the banks supported by the government[in many cases being the same thing] pushed millions of people off their land at the time), but when they arrive all they find is people who are so corrupted by money and an endless fear of loss of capital that they do not offer the family any support or aid.Steinbeck wrote this book as a summation of real events that happened in the 1930's. His book realizes the need for social change in America and the world. It does not make anyone look &quot;evil&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; It simply makes the system humanity follows seem like the one tearing us apart. Just one of the things that makes this novel maybe the best one ever written. If only steinbeck was alive today, maybe he'd write a novel or two to take Bush down."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\`The Grapes of Wrath' is one of the most famous books written by John Steinbeck, and it also is largely praised as one of his best works. The book received a Pulitzer Prize and was made into an Award winning movie. This novel is one of the best when it comes to portrait the consequences of the Great Depression in the life of poor families that were forced to leaver their homeland to search for food and jobs.The narrative is filled with details of the landscape and the people. The main characters are the Joad family who embarks in a road trip to California, where they expect to find a better life. Throughout this journey they run into every sort of people --good and bad -- that will help, or not, them. Every new stop is a new challenge for the family, a new barrier to overcome.Not only is the story beautiful, but also very compelling. Steinbeck created an unforgettable portrait of those lives, which were so sad and difficult. One of the major qualities of \`The Grapes of Wrath' is the language. While the narrator has a clear and grammar-perfect voice, the author could reproduce the dialogues with perfection. They were written in the way those migrants would talk. It is difficult for the contemporary reader, but not impossible. Such device requires more attention of the reader, but it gives more pleasure once one gets used to this language.This novel interweaves two different kinds of chapters. In one of them the writer sets a general view of the migrants, their way of life, their habitat and such. In the other he talks about the Joads. Using such device, he makes the Joads' story universal. This single family could be everyone's who has to leave their homeland to find job and food in another place. The problems this family face are very down to earth. And, this kind of thing still happens everywhere.With \`The Grapes of Wrath', John Steinbeck created a story that criticizes not only the ferocious capitalism, but, above all, the human nature. The evil nature that always wants more and more, and that doesn't mind exploiting, deceiving and hurting other people to fulfill its ambitions."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is an utterly poignant tale - a reading experience that rends the human spirit. My week-long journey with The Grapes of Wrath is an intimate one because it has the expressions of passions whether tragic or bitter that have been beautifully written, an ingenious verisimilitude that is as close as a personal story. Although this intimacy is only but a woof of the awesome fabric, the warp is its universal allure; its actions - alive, soulful, depressing and frank that appeal to any man and woman regardless of experience and race.The Grapes of Wrath reflects the hellish downpour of misery upon the farmers who lived and loved their land as much as their life but whose farms have been encroached by capitalists whose only concern is profit and wealth at the expense of the abuse of the farmers and their family. This is a great tragedy, an allegory, by which an enduring family travels through life's travails. The story revolves around their sensibilities of hope and survival, that in spite of the foreboding, they are dauntless in their seek for a better life. The Joads mirror the plight of the migrant workers- depicting the same suffering, the same fear and the same hope. And all the misanthropies that happened have its bitter toll on them, nevertheless under the frosting of modernity, within the fillings of promises of abundance by science and economics and above little dashes of fraud and selfishness. And all these infuriated the migrant workers but whose voice are stifled under the narcotics of hunger.The whole story runs toward a single-paced arrow but the characters bounce back a certain tense, or perhaps a curiosity. They play transparent roles in a way that a reader is carried along some of their introspections. In particular, Tom who is the main character is given a trenchant role in the movements and resolutions of the story while their mother who is such an audacious persona embraces the moral force so that the other characters maintain their moral substance. The other interesting character is the defunct preacher, Casy who constantly denies his capacity to preach again, and who eventually becomes a martyr for the cause of the Joad family and for the migrant workers which he led during the labor strike. The rest of the family and the other fleeting characters also played brilliant roles - either in rich metaphors or as colorful realism.Along the precarious highway 66, their life-story evolved and adapted as they settled in from camp to camp. It is depicted as free as flying dust, as treacherous as the desert at the roadsides and as promising as the land of the west. It is at this highway that Steinbeck rolls most of his radiant poetic flair. John Steinbeck has smoothly used paradox in his materials, he has proved a master in dialogues and his metaphors and symbolisms elegantly put flesh between the story lines."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The scope of this work far exceeds any novel I've ever read. In this magnum opus by John Steinbeck, he covers theology, philosophy, history, sociology, class struggle, and an awesome breadth of the topics of man. His attention to detail gives the strangest sensation that I am actually there in the wagon with the Joads, giving a personal feel to the novel that is untouchable by any other writer out there. Certain images are absolutely unforgettable: Pa's last stand, Rose's lasting image, the spell-binding oratories of Tom, Ma, and Jim.On the other hand, John Steinbeck knows this is magnum opus, but he sets out on a course to prove it to the reader. He can be pedantic, didactic, and overbearing in his writing. He is so absolutely blatant in his symbolism (particularly his religious symbolism) so as to leave a bitter feeling in the reader that the author thinks him a fool. Steinbeck can seem a times as if he's WORKING to create a great work, utterly unnatural.Looking past these misgivings though, this book is an excellent exploration into the 1930s as well as human nature in general. The characters are spellbinding, their dialogue excellent. The intercleary chapters are for the most part excellent snapshots of time, with the exception of those that involve absolutely blatant symbolism. While the progress of the book can be a tad on the slow side, I find that it gives the book an excellent feel of rambunctous wandering and exploring a la Ruthie, physically, and a la Jim Casy, spiritually. The status of this novel as a classic is wholly deserved, and it is also deserved of several readings to capture the full breadth of the novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"In The Grapes of Wrath, by John Steinbeck, the Joad family fled their Oklahoma dwelling, in search of fictional California jobs. Scarred by the Great Depression and the seemingly everlasting Dust Bowl, the Joads futilely traveled to California, a land they dreamed was filled with opportunity, countless jobs, and acres of fruit that one could pick right off the tree and eat. With a large family plagued with hunger, sickness, death, and a pregnancy, the Joads struggled daily to survive among the thousands of other refugees from drought and famine. Steinbeck writes with startling bluntness. Nothing he writes is \\"candy coated\\" or semi-truthful. He tells accurately of the troubled times the Joads faced and tells us exactly what they would have said. He uses the words, the grammar, and the thoughts that such \\"Okies\\" would have expressed; as shown in this passage: \\"Danny in the back seat wants a cup of water. Have to wait. Got no water here. Listen - that the rear-end? Can't tell.There goes a gasket. Got to go on. Listen to her whistle. Find a nice place to camp an' I'll jerk the head off. But, God Almighty, the food's gettin' low, the money's gettin' low. When we can't buy no more gas - what then? Danny in the back seat wants a cup of water. Little fella's thirsty. Listen to that gasket whistle.\\" I liked the honesty and truth that John Steinbeck writes with and thought it was interesting how he would shift gears every chapter and, instead of focusing on the Joad family, would show the reader a bigger picture. He stops focusing on one particular family, and illustrates the daily routines that every \\"Okie\\" family dealt with. I recommend this book to anyone interested in an awe-inspiring and shockingly true book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Considering the age I was (12 years old) when I first read this book, I should probably be somewhat hesitant in giving my frank opinion about it. I imagine many older readers with affectionate emotions attached to this book would have a thing or two to say about my rating. Either way, I should enjoy recalling what my personal experience was like with this interesting piece.Steinbeck is a brilliant author. No need to deny that. He has written many different works that both the young and old can enjoy and contemplate on. I believe Grapes of Wrath may have been on of them. I gave this a 3 stars although I would've preferred a 3 1/2.This book was somewhat long and a bit slow-paced for me. Yet, luckily, it managed to barely hold my attention with a calming and vaguely melancholy air. It is definitely not a read if you were looking for tragedy and disaster and bucketfuls of tears by your bedside. Instead, Steinbeck tends to sneak in touches of bittersweet passages and theme that mingles with the smooth flow of the words. It certainly describes the lives of the common family during the Great Depression and I suggest it for educational purposes as well.I find that most books its length would have to be pretty catching to make me read through it and Grapes of Wrath did manage to do that. I probably would've rated it higher had I not had the experience of reading a book of comparable length (Helter Skelter) and seen how much more I could enjoy one . But I have, and it has made it evident that this classic was not satisfying enough to my tastes. It is a neutral opinion overall, that really depends on what kind of person you are or what kind of book you aim to read. I do suggest you read it at least once but perhaps you might want to try it out at a library before you actually invest and buy it. It might be a while before you feel like reading again as it likes to describe somewhat similar things or events that makes the whole book blend together into a blurry illusion. The ending was not particularily enjoyable for me, either. I admit that I am the kind of person that likes a clear, stable, and satisfactory finale which leaves me thinking &quot;Yes, that's right. All is said and done and as it should be.&quot; Grapes of Wrath might leave you in a bit of a fluster after ending a bit abruptly and mysteriously.Still, it is generally an enjoyable book and I wouldn't advise a person to avoid it. I think many of you will find that you can develop quite a few opinions about it depending on your mood. I enjoyed it in it's own way and I presume the majority of others will be able to, too."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This story is a foundation of \\"modern classic literature\\". It not only tells the story of an idividual family, but paints a picutre of an era as a whole, and more than that; speaks to the humanity in everyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck was a red, and this book is infused with politics; but, unlike Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, The Grapes of Wrath is a fine work of literature. Not perfect, not without flaws, not as good as Zola's similarly-themed Germinal, but still a classic achievement by a truly great American author. Everyone should read it, from socialists to Shriners, and, as with any work of fiction, take it cum grano salis.Steinbeck didn't like capitalism, because, especially during the Depression, there were many things about it not to like. His prediction that the private ownership of the means of production was soon to be over (as of 1939) hasn't been borne out...but the guy is not remembered for being a commie pantywaist, or a spectacularly-wrong prognosticator.He was a writer, an exceptional one, and most people claim this is his best book. (I would argue that Of Mice and Men holds that distinction, but Grapes is almost five times as long...and how can a six-hundred-page book be worse'n a novella?)Whatever you think, about politics, economics, or literature, this book is not a waste of time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I personally have read a majority of John Steinbeck's works, and I've found that the more popular the piece happens to be, the worse the piece is. The Grapes of Wrath is certainly no exception to this. The characters in the novel tend to be rather unamusing compared to some of Steinbeck's others, and they very often do things without any sort of reason. The plot is rather bland as well, with the action mostly repetitive through the majority of the novel. The novel also includes many irrelevant scenes that does not pertain to the story or its characters itself. The reason for this is mainly that Steinbeck designed this novel to be more of an illustration of the Great Depression than a story. To be fair, though, as a depiction of the Depression, this novel is great, showing all of those scenes which are unrelated to the characters that illustrate other aspects of the Depression that they do not encounter. If you are looking for a novel that will give you some of the attitudes of tenant farmers and others during the Depression, then this is certainly your book. However, if you happen to be more like myself, simply looking for an interesting story, you would be better advised to look elsewhere. Perhaps one of Steinbeck's lesser known works, like Cannery Row, Tortilla Flat, or East of Eden, which are all wonderful novels, even though they are often overlooked."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I can go to a used book store and find this book for $2 or so. It is ridiculous to charge this much."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I've been re-reading some the books I read 40-50 years ago. Some were required reading, others not. Many read better after you have more life experience behind you. For example Dickens, Hemmingway, Twain. There are things in those books you simply couldn't see or understand when younger. Little of that applies to The Grapes of Wrath. Even setting aside the tedious political and economic navet&eacute; of the author, the treatment of the principle characters is condescending and stereotypical. They are cardboard Hollywood caricatures. Maybe that is why it was turned so successfully in to a movie.I have/had parents and grandparents with dust bowl and southern California connections to that period so I have real people with which to compare the characters in the book. Perhaps the disconnect between Steinbeck's imagination and real people I knew is why I can't suspend disbelief.In sum, the book is interesting from the point of view of literary history, but if you want a good read try one of authors listed earlier, or even Bronte or Austen if your taste runs that direction."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Does anyone have the Grapes of Wrath on Kindle?

The old style theme of the book presentation also helps to set the scene (by \\"visually\\" taking you back in time). However, as you get into the story you realise you don't need this stage prop. Steinbeck is a master of words and describes the characters and events in such detail that you are there suffering with them, or enjoying the small happy moments they manage to grasp as the travel to California. This book was something we probably had to read as high school students and I somehow missed out. So, it is with great pleasure that I can do so now when I am older and am mature enough to realise what a tragic story it is and can understand the real history it portrays so realistically ... but in a way that you still don't want to put the book down. I totally recommend this book, and the Centennial Edition format is certainly a easy to read font and size to hold for the long periods you may want to keep reading it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read this book for my AP Composition class in school and I loved every little bit of it. Not only does it do an amazing job in reflecting the hardships of the society back during the Great Depression, but it also uses a variety of symbols that just wows the readers. Especially at the end, the last symbol that Steinbeck uses in his book is just speechless. This book is definitely one of the best classical literatures ever written."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read this book for my AP Composition class and it is just simply astounding. Not only does it do an amazing job of reflecting the Dust Bowel during the Great Depression, but also uses a variety of symbols in order to more effectively send the message of the book to the readers. Especially at the end, the last symbol in the book is just speechless. Read this book. It just may be one of the best classic books out there."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Great transacation. I received my purchase quickly and in very good condition.

This is a reading worthy of Steinbeck's masterpiece, and just as good as John Ford's movie version."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"What else can be said about a classic. It brings today's reader back to the 1930's. This is truly a timeless classic. Steinbeck undoubtly defines the era, a people, and the hardships that occurred."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is the fifth Steinbeck novel I've read, and I'm deeply impressed by him. The fact that there are currently some 445 other Amazon reviews out there (almost all ravingly positive) attests to the universal power of this novel. So, I'll just submit my humble little offering to this Grapes of Wrath shrine with 5 stars, and a caveat:The Grapes of Wrath is long-winded, and slightly &quot;boring&quot;. However, that said, don't be put off, it's actually hard to put down and reads relatively quickly. The style of writing matches the content perfectly, and if you read it at long stretches you'll find yourself rhythmically attached to the story. The long, drawn out narrative is meant to coincide very neatly with the long, depressing hardships the Joads face on their journey to California. What happens to them along the way, and how Steinbeck chronicles different aspects of 1930's America in alternating chapters is what makes Steinbeck an artist here. I don't think Steinbeck had quite reached the artistic capacity to create as vividly unique characters as he later does in Cannery Row &amp; Sweet Thursday, but again, The Grapes of Wrath is larger than specific characters, and Tom Joad isn't simply some displaced Oakie, but rather, he is a &quot;spirit&quot; that thankfully, refuses to die. This novel is as much history as it is a good story.At times you will feel indignant over how our country treated these people, and over the thoughtlessness of it's economic policies during the depression era. And you will probably find just as ugly parallels today in the arenas of civil rights, education, social welfare, tax reform, and so on. Thus, Steinbeck has created for posterity an American &quot;ghost&quot; which continues to haunt us. An American classic, on the &quot;dark side&quot;.If you're so inclined, Steinbeck kept a journal during the writing of this novel, titled, &quot;Working Days&quot; which I highly recommend for further insight into this masterpiece."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I'm shocked I was never forced to read it in High School. However, I think by reading it some years later I likely have a better understanding and appreciation for the book. Steinback's writing is truly impressive - each detail provided so that the reader really feels a part of the story. You feel the pain and sacrifice of the family... you share in their small joy and heartache. Lives up to its &quot;classic&quot; standing without a doubt...the Grapes of Wrath is my new favorite."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"We just read \`The Grapes of Wrath' in my AP Language &amp; Composition class and I loved it. My teacher recommended that we purchase a copy of the book so that we could make notes in the margins. I went all the way and bought this lovely Centennial Edition... and then I couldn't bear to write in it! I recommend this book to any and all people, while recommending this particular edition to true fans. It would make a great gift to a lover of great literature and/or John Steibeck himself."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a compelling novel dealing with the many hardships the Joad family undergoes while struggling to survive during the depression. John Steinbeck takes the readers on an emotional roller coaster as each chapter introduces new twists and turns hooking the reader and bringing them in. Throughout their endeavors the characters seem to transform and take on new roles; whether it be a desperate man trying to forget the past, live in the present and move into the future, a hopeless reverend striving to find meaning and holiness in life or a husband coping with failure and the fact that he cannot support let alone take care of his family without the strength and guidance of his wife. The Grapes of wrath focuses on family ties and humanities need of relationships and companionship.The novel is centered around one of the themes concentrated on this semester; the person's fear of loneliness as well as inability to be content with solitude and constant need of interaction and new relationships with that of other persons. This theme is very evident throughout the novel from the very beginning with the quickly evolving comradeship of Tom Joad and \\"Reverend\\" Jim Casey. The men find each other in the desolate and barren environment, which at one point had been a thriving community. Each man is in search of something; for Tom it is his home and family that he has been away from for four years and in Casey's case he is on a spiritual endeavor in the hope of finding holiness and renewing his faith. The two men find comfort and consolation with their camaraderie. The theme repeatedly presents itself in various situations for instance: the relationship the Joad's family forms with the Wilson's while venturing to California in hope of a promising new beginning, the effort of uniting the migrant workers against the intolerable working conditions they are forced to cope with initiated by Casey and finished by Tom Joad, and the last scene in the book in which Rose of Sharon saves the life of a man starving to death with her own breast milk. The Grapes of Wrath is an incredible as well as realistic tale of the ability to mend a desperate soul with the love and solidarity of another."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Overall, the novel was a very informative account of the historical aspect of the 1930s. It gaveinsight into one family's struggles as they packed up all they owned and moved west. Although the ending was very meaningful, it left you hanging. You never really find out whether the Joads survive."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I started reading novels at the age of fifteen. I read &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; when I was seventeen. I am now forty two, and God knows how many books I have read to date. Yet, twenty five years after I first read it, if I were to be asked which is the best book that I ever read, I will have to say that this was it. The book just blew me away. I confess that I barely remember anything of its characters now. Tom and Rose Joad are a distant memory. Yet the magic lingers on. The book lies in my cupboard, but I am scared of reading it again, lest the magic may not be recreated. I will probably never read it again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a wonderful combination of great fiction and descriptive history. Steinbeck, by following the Joads from Oklahoma to California shows not only their way of dealing with the Great Depression, but also how many other people dealt with the time of the dustbowl. This is a must read for anyone who values American history or great works of fiction."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"See my one line review."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I've been rereading The Grapes of Wrath, still stunned by how great it is. After reading some of the reviews below, I get angry that people cannot grasp the effect the book has. YES, the depression was depressing, YES, there was a lot of description, YES, it might not make you feel really great about that time in America, but God, isn't that's what great literature is supposed to do- take you to a place you would never know about and tell you what it was like? I don't want to sound condescending, but not every book is a romp in the park, and The Grapes of Wrath is one of them."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Grapes Of Wrath is one of the greatest novels ever written. This book will challenge what you believe about America and make you realize thatnot all history books speak the truth. With a graceful , sad prose, Steinbeck brings to life characters as real and as alive as your friends and neighbors. I felt that I wanted a magical force to sweep me into this book and allow me to help the Joads and help fight the evil plantation owners, and only the best books make you do that. Simply put, this is must reading for anyone who lives in America , and even the world."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"John Steinbeck is the true American author. His use of symbolism and allegories in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; immerse the reader in the Joad's world. In my opinion, this is the greatest piece of American literature available today. The tragedy and heartbreak Steinbeck portrays can wrench your heart. His writing abilities are far beyond any author. If you need a good book to read, make it this one. A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath is one of the few books whose &quot;classic&quot; status I agree with. His descriptive writing is beautiful but not for everyone. For example, one chapter is dedicated exclusively to the description of a turtle crossing a road. Reading on, one discovers that this was in fact an allegory to the life of the Joad family. The book is filled with allegory and allusion. Despite its use of figurative devices, I don't think this book has to be studied in order to be enjoyed. For a long trip or a secluded vacation, this book is excellent."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Grapes of wrath , simply put is one of the greatest stories ever penned by Steinbeck .

Both are marvelous stories, that interweave the author's political bent so well, that they each could be text books for a political theory class.

If you really want to challange your mind, read both then try to decide which theory you believe."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Dylan Baker's extraordinary reading of Grapes of Wrath is amazing!

Highly recommeded."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is of course an American Literary Masterpiece. I would highly recommend this novel. It may seem wordy if you are a slow reader. Steinbeck can get that way. This novel will give the reader great insight into the 1930s agrarian culture."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The word &quot;classic&quot; doesn't always mean a good book. But in this case, The Grapes of Wrath deserves the label. Being forced to read this book through an assignment, I started off with a bad outlook. After finishing the book, I found that my opinion had changed. TGOW has a great mixture of history and plot while being written skillfully and wonderfully. I would suggest it to anyone who enjoys the history of the Great Depression or Dust Bowl era; or to anyone researching biblical illusions in literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is a great book. I could hardly put it down.I was supposed to read it in college but somehow couldn't get into it back then. I was looking through some boxes and found the book. I read it every free moment I had. It was hard to get into it at first but after the third chapter I started to get it, then I was hooked. I felt very connected to the Joad family.I was pleased with the book up until the last page. I understood the message but was disapointed in lack of closure with the characters. I truly wanted to know what happened to them.Although it was long I would have been more than happy to read another 600 pages if I thought there would be character closure.I guess the author felt that if people during that time would lose track of their own family members we could sit back and wonder what happened to this family."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"There are some authors that have so much talent that it is inhuman.

Although it does have an uncanny ending, I suggest you read it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is John Steinbeck's finest work! It is truly a heart-breaking story. In The Grapes of Wrath you see capitalism at its worst, at its most hateful. The common man is nothing but scum. There is a lot of cussing in this book, which I did not appreciate, but that's Steinbeck. He is still a genius. The ending is a real shocker! I never dreamed it would end this way, and when it came, I couldn't believe it! It depicted, in no uncertain terms, the devastating, unspeakable hunger of a human being and the compassion of another human being in attempting to assuage that hunger. I saw the movie twice; once before I read the book, and then again after having read the book. The first time I saw the film, I thought it was great, but after having read the book, the second time I saw the movie, it just did not measure up at all; it was a real disappointment. I think Hollywood did a mediocre job of trying to bring The Grapes of Wrath to the big screen. It just didn't work, and of course the ending in the book couldn't possibly have been shown on the screen, not way back in those days, nor in these modern times of anything goes. It simply would not be possible. Is your curiosity aroused? Then read the book. The Grapes of Wrath is not merely a novel; it is a soul-searing experience!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck's chilling masterpiece about the American dream gone bad still resonates loudly and hauntingy today as it did sixty years ago. Police brutality, racism, and unfair labor practices still manage to take center stage and thwart the idea of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness being entitled to everyone.The superhuman strength and will of Ma Joad will rudely wake you up from your slumber and inspire you to go out and make a difference. Steinbeck eloquently takes you on a lengthy journey of faith, hope, and despair that, at times, requires patience, but that patience will be rewarded a hundred times over.Through Ma Joad, Steinbeck hints that the world is a better place to live in and more conquerable if people saw outside their own families and became one big extended family. A practice that is sorely needed today as technology increasingly diminishes the human element.STOP READING NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ENDING.In the greatest ending of a novel in American literature history, Rose of Sharon, who just delivered a stillborn child, offers her full breast to a hungry stranger in a barn. Steinbeck paints this beautiful picture of the ultimate act of human kindness with an amazing combination of power and poetry. This brilliant ending clinches &quot;Grapes&quot; as one of the greatest American novels ever."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I always hesitate before attempting to write a critical review of a classic novel, particularly one as monumental as &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; So let me start this out by saying, YES, the book is a well-deserved classic, and YES, I would recommend that each and every person go out and get a copy. As many other reviewers have pointed out, this novel has an uncanny ability to affect its readers, to make them re-evaluate the nature of compassion, fortitude, and human dignity. Much of this is due to Steinbeck's brilliant structuring of the novel, as he alternates the chapters dealing with the direct struggles of the Joad family with more elaborate &quot;big-picture&quot; depictions of the migrant movement in general.That being said, however, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; can be an extremely frustrating reading experience for an unprepared reader. Its sheer length (around 600 pages) can be initially daunting, and the copious amounts of dialogue (all written in dialect) take some time to get used to. &quot;Grapes&quot; can even be difficult for Steinbeck fans because it is in many ways rather an anomaly in his canon. Though the story of the Joads is compelling, there is evidence that Steinbeck was somewhat uncomfortable with these parts of the novel: Characters introduced in the beginning simply disappear halfway through, contributing little to the overall story, and in general the characterization is weaker here than it is in other novels like &quot;Of Mice And Men,&quot; curious considering that &quot;Mice&quot; is about one-fifth the size of &quot;Grapes.&quot; There is repetitiveness in the dialogue and the trials faced by the Joads, and the novel's pacing likewise suffers.In my opinion, the &quot;Big picture&quot; chapters are better written than the Joad chapters--on the whole more interesting, more powerful, and certainly more complex (as Steinbeck switches back and forth with his narrative voice and point of view). Chapter 25, in which the novel's title (taken from the Battle Hymn of the Republic) appears is probably the finest of the novel. Moreover, in spite of some weaknesses in pacing and plot, the story of the Joads personal hardships contain several scenes which are infused with a similar ability to produce a devestating and uplifting feeling in the reader. The novel's final scene with Rosasharn is positively brilliant in its conception and execution.I've tried to be fair and honest in this review, and I hope my comments will help you to enjoy &quot;Grapes&quot; without frustration. It is a remarkable novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I had to read this book for an English class and it is definitely the best book I have had to read for school in the last 5 years.

Some of the people who hate this book don't even know what it is about. The person who was complaining about the chapter dedicated to a turtle probably has no clue that the turtle chapter is a summary of the entire events of the entire book!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"John Steinbeck understood the condition of conflicting interests that had developed between the boundaries of man's landscapes. He wrote at a time of tumultuous social change and climatic severity in mid-west America. Faceless banks and machines were changing the labour-intensive family-based agriculture, and forced families and whole communities to migrate to California in vain hope. The image is of them being followed by a cloud of dust, as huge machines representing agribusiness and development ate at the soil like monsters. Steinbeck explored the negative trade-offs that are born when the land becomes removed from the psyche, and the whole, for all intents and purposes, no longer exists. His is a sombre comment on an approach which places value on particular components of the land and their functions, to the exclusion of other components, and this included the people. Steinbeck seeks to claim back an holistic perspective of the land and makes comment on the inappropriateness of linear Analysis. His thesis is one that cries that the land is more than just its analysis, that there is some other dimension with deep personal and social implications involved. Comments welcome - email me!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This was rated #3 in the Modern Library top 100 book list of Radcliffe Publishing Course. So I decided to read it and it is very good. Each chapter has a new meaningful of what happens to the Joad's family, like the Joad's are heading of to California to look for a job. Each chapters are good but most chapters are boring because the family talk too much. That's why nobody likes this book. I think this is one of the best book I ever read because it tells you what does the Great Depression looks like. You feel that you are really in it. What's more this book is not just about the Joad's family but there is lots of information of what the depression looks like. The preacher of Casy is my favorite character because he talks too much and help each other. Too bad he is dead on the end. It is not a hard book to read. I would reccomend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Having just finished a series of Ayn Rand books regarding objectivism and pro-capitalism, I thought I would be truly appalled by Steinbechs' great &quot;proletarian&quot; master piece. The truth was anything but! This story does not promote communism as some other reviewers on this page suggests, but rather shows the results when free market economy capitalism is exploited and perversed. The book shows that when labor organizes it is percieved as &quot;red&quot; since hundreds, if not thousands of individuals must publicly ban together. When the big boys (in this case the large farm land owners) ban together, they do it covertly and are never questioned about their patriotism.Steinbech has brought all of these moral and social issues together in his moving (if not sometimes over sentimental) story of the Joad family. Yes, it sometimes tends toward being long winded but it is one of the most compelling novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"&quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; is one of the greatest novels of all time. I am 14, and after seeing the Henry Fonda movie, I decided to read the book. What a masterpiece! To those who want to cut all of the description, it is necessary. That is setting the mood. Without the description, it would just be some cold, detached dissertation on the Depression. The description entrenched me into the book. I didn't feel as if I was reading a book, I felt I was THERE. I was part of the family, traveling in the car, feeling their pains, feeling their joys. It was as if I was Jim Casy, tagging along with the Joad family. This book is a great experience for any high schooler.

Since when is it considered &quot;anti-American&quot; to empathize with the restless and downtrodden? (&quot;Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses,&quot; anyone?)If one cannot relate to the plight of the destitute and the hungry (which is far too often the case in our society, especially among our youth), that is precisely the reason why one should read Steinbeck's masterpiece.

I had to read this one for a college history class and came away with a whole new attitude for Steinbeck. Since then I've read several of his other books and he has turned out to be one of my favorite authors.The story follows the Joad family from Oklahoma to California during the Great Depression. They lost their farm to dust storms and greedy bankers and were forced to go somewhere else to try to earn a living.This book has been banned by school boards for years, and I recently read that the reason for this is that the bankers who serve on the boards don't like the way bankers are portrayed in the book.It's a great book and an accurate look at one of the worst eras in American history.

I read Grapes of Wrath sophomore year, and it spawned a complete love of literature. This book takes the reader through an odyssey of emotions and troubled times. It so perfectly represents the 30's depression, and America in general. It opened my mind to the values of this country, and inspired me to see everything from a different eye. This is a book that will change your life. I will not vote for a president who has not read this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"At first when I started out, I wasn't too sure I would want to continue. This book is written in local dialect which I thought would be tedious but I was in for a surprise for it was not. After a while I began to love the dialect as much as I loved this book to tell the truth. No wonder John Steinbeck won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940 for this work.The Grapes of Wrath centres on the Joads; a Dustbowl family from Oklahoma whose land was confiscated from them, along with others in the Midwestern states. All these families head for California where it is understood that there is lots of opportunity in that golden state to start again. This being in immigrant work or farm labour in grape, pear and peach reaping.The trek is long but it's supposed to be well worth it with expectant good wages. and somewhere decent to live, somewhere to call home.Meet the Joad family of Ma Joad; a good Christian woman and as the strength and spine of the family, she holds a tight reign on the entire bunch of them retaining their team spirit, and keeping the morale alive amongst them. Then there is Casey a sometimes preacher man; Tom Joad her eldest son who is driven and afraid of nobody, but just anxious to get out to California to make some money; his brother Noah, a man consumed by quiet moments and little to say; Al the brother who drives the loaded down truck from Oklahoma, out to the West; Uncle John a restless soul, but who can blame him! These along with Pa Joad, the Joad sister Rose of Sharon, and the young ones Ruthie and Winfield, they make up the exodus. An exodus like none ever seen, we share in each heartache and disappointment as well as their hopefulness which Ma stokes daily.As the Joad family turn from farmers in their own right to immigrant workers, it gets harder for the family to retain their dignity. The reader will find himself living through these characters lives, and experiencing gratefulness for the little things which are so often taken for granted day in and day out.I would love to encourage anyone interested in good literature, to get your hands on this powerful book soon. It certainly encouraged me to look at life differently.Reviewed by Heather MarshallJanuary 10th, 2003"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"John Steinbeck, in my opinion, is probably the most talented author I have ever read. His descriptions are awe-inspiring, his narration unique, and his stories are emotional rollercoasters. I found myself, while reading 'The Grapes', at all times either laughing, crying, or just plain ticked off. In this novel is portrayed one of the saddest, yet least know tradgedies in our countries history. The story of farmers kicked out of their homes, forced to a strange land and despised, cheated, and starved when they arrived reminded me of medievil times but the sad fact is it happened while our grandparents were growing up. I admit I was not proud of America as I read this book! But it is oh so important of a read because if it can happen 50 years ago it can happen today, and only by learning from history can we avoid these same mistakes.But despite the feelings you may have while consuming this book please do not avoid it, for it is a must read. If you have somehow made it past high school without having read this one, then why not do it now. It is probably the best book I have read by an American author and too important to pass up. I don't guarantee you will happily enjoy it but I do guarantee you will be better for having read it!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"In John Steinbeck's fictional classic, The Grapes of Wrath, readers get aboard the Joad family's jalopy and venture through the southwestern part of America during the 1930s Dust Bowl. Through Steinbeck's intense descriptions and meticulous detail, his characters pop out of the book, and become alive in the reader's imagination. Due to these dynamic figures, readers begin to feel their emotions, experience their struggles, and share in their happiness. Although the tone underlines a grueling expedition, one filled with hardships, losses, and failures, readers still recognize that tremendous bond and overwhelming love within a family can prevail over all. Steinbeck's use of setting is critical in the book. The setting adds to the impact of suffering experienced by the characters and sets the dismal tone for the novel.The characters are so extensively described that a perfect portrait of each member of the journey is painted into the readers mind. Physically and emotionally we know who they are: laugh when they laugh, cry when they cry. The book sends a powerful message of everlasting love which is identified with all readers. The dry, dusty, hot, and painstaking setting is influential in the family's drive. The luscious, green, moist land of California lures the readers in for an unreachable dream, and symbolizes a life that the Joad's can never have."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"My youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re-reading books she was assigned in English class.

This is a novel for mature readers who enjoy books which don't have excessive violence, or mindless action on every page. Many high school kids are clearly not mature enough to appreciate a book such as The Grapes of Wrath. Perhaps their teachers should let them stick with works that are better suited to their maturity level, such as comic books...."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"i dont know why everyone hates this book. not only is it &quot;america's novel&quot;, its a novel that can be planted into todays plight of the mexicans and italians. its a story that is timeless and sincere and has much more significance than all those &quot;la-di-da&quot; novels that sell for 20 bucks and are composed of pure smut. you want some deep emotion read this book. i cant understand why everyone hated it i just think they are a bunch of immature asses who either cant read it or have no deeper literary aspirations. thats my opinion, bite me!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I think the reason why I love this book is because 60 years after it was written, it still has a place in our society.

This is the timeless story of the struggle for survival. This time concerning the Joad family - a simple crop sharing farm people - uprooted by changes both climatic and economic (it reminds one of the recent downsizing and the loss of blue collar jobs) on their trek westward searching for a new hope. This book works on all levels and raises important issues if you can get a handle on the depression. As literature it is excellent. Any author that can devote an entire chapter to the life-and death struggles of a turtle crossing the road and keep you on the edge of your seat deserves fame (what is the symbolism any how?). This book also raises the important issues of today. What to do with displaced (homeless) people? Who's responsible if anyone for peoples well-being. Are their abuses in the work place? Who's fault is it? What should be done? Are simple people to be admired or pitied?. Fortunately, he doesn't give you all the answers, but makes you think for yourself. Admittedly, he does go into melodrama. His brief dealings about the communist ideals with the government camp, and the breast feeding of an ill man showing how people must help themselves are two such examples. Yet, I feel it is a must read even if it leaves you drained and questioning your own ethics."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Wasn't it Albert Einstein who said, &quot;the map is not the territory?&quot; Just as TV and movie actors are mistaken for their characters, so are authors often taken for their stories. No, kids, Mark Twain was not a racist, in spite of the langauge of his characters. Had these myopic critics opened their eyes a little more, they might have seen that Jim the slave is a superior man to his lighter-skinned contemporaries. What &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; represents to some is a threat, a not-so- gentle stirring up of uncomplacencies, a brutal kick in the rear to the comfortable. Working in a grocery store I see this every day in my affluent customers. Most haven't a clue where or how their fruits and vegetables make their way to the produce stands. Some have vague ideas about unwashed and illiterate Mexicans, toiling away in the feilds like beasts of burden. I live in California, home to Proposition 187, and all of the attendant misconceptions about illegal immigrants. Why, it was only last year when federal authorities raided a strawberry farm in the Salinas Valley, discovering living conditions that mirrored exactly those portrayed in Steinbeck's novel sixty years before. In spite of the efforts of Ceasar Chavez, whom I regard as a saint, and uncounted others, working conditions for the farm worker have scarcely improved since &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; Remember the grape boycott?I'm getting a bit afield, I know. I recently tried out an American literature course at my local community college, and was unpleasantly surprised. Instead of a careful reading of good books, I was inundated with the crimes of the Eurocentric Male. Oh, and the books were included as supporting garnish. Seems to me that our culture of destructionism and revisionism is taking an awful toll upon our understanding of literature. Like the traveler confusing the map with the territory, our unimaginative academics are confusing the messenger with the message. Rather than spending precious time bashing the author, wouldn't it be more prudent to disucss the ideas as presented? Had Steinbeck been a Communist, would his ideas then be considered more suspect? I invite other readers to share their ideas. We need more of this."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"It does not surprise me that those brilliantly compassionate people who above criticized the book could only come up with: it sucks, man, its a piece of sh*t. What in depth understanding of the book! When it was released in 37, it became the most controversial book of its time. People saw hints at revolution in it; communism was seen. People thought that the harsh portrayal of class differences and some of the &quot;tough&quot; imagery and ideas given to the reader, along with the possibilty that America was not perfect and was deeply corrupted and injust, were reasons to ban this poignantly beautiful and epic story that defines an important novel and is both significantly historical and universal in its content. Those who argue for it to be banned today, like those who ban Huck for being racist(when its one of the greatest anti-racist books ever written), Salinger, and Of Mice and Men, do not understand it; perhaps they haven't read it- if they have, the obvious importance and beauty of the book has been lost on them. So yippedeedo! Once again people think it their right to keep us from reading books that are not only worth the read but important in literature and very influential in enhancing our moral intelligence. There was once a place across the sea that decided to not only ban but burn books; suppress important ideas from people who deserve freedom- and what a society that turned out to be!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Regarded by many as the seminal Amercian novel, The Grapes of Wrath is not merely a snapshot of Dust Bowl poverty, but of the strength of the human spirit. While the movie focuses on the character of Tom Joad, Steinbeck's book is really about Tom's mother, and how she eventually assumes the leadership of her family. The pages are literally choked with the red dust of Oklahoma's ruined farms, and of the dust and exhaust fumes on the road to California. The dialogue is colloquial and accurately portrayed. His characters are rich in substance, as is the entire story. Throughout the book, the scene is introduced with poetically-written interludes, giving the reader a clear sense of where he or she is. For those who feel content with the John Ford film, I recommend the book, if only for the sheer enjoyment one can get from reading this work."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I would like to get this book for the kindle but I cannot bring myself to pay 50% more for the Kindle edition versus the physical book.Hopefully these publishers will wake up and realize that they can sell an E-book at a lower sticker price than the dead tree version and still make plenty of profit.

I really feel like I can see and feel what these people went through."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This was the first book I have read of John Steinbeck's, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Steinbeck writes with a simple elegance, while telling a sad, yet compelling story about struggles through the Great Depression.In The Grapes of Wrath, Steinbeck uses a peculiar combination of diction. Overall, the book seems very conversational. Steinbeck uses very simple words, with the occasional large word thrown in, with a folksy sort of feel. His use of simple diction makes the book extremely understandable, in turn making it more relatable as people tend to relate to things they understand.To get more specific in areas concerning diction, I'd like to discuss the diction used when Steinbeck includes dialogue. In the dialogue, Steinbeck's grammar is atrocious. Words are left incomplete, sentences unfinished; the grammar is just awful. However, this does not detract from the appeal of the novel as would be suspected. It instead enhances the appeal of the book by making it more realistic. The way Steinbeck shows the way people would have talked in the era of the Great Depression. Personally, I quite appreciate Steinbeck's efforts to make the novel as realistic as humanly possible.The other aspect of Steinbeck's writing in The Grapes of Wrath that I came to really enjoy and appreciate was his use of figurative language and imagery. Steinbeck does a phenomenal job painting a picture in the readers' heads. He uses very detail oriented style, full of very rich adjectives.While the adjectives do more to fill the role of imagery, Steinbeck has an incredible talent in his use of figurative language. I found one of his favorite figurative language devices to be the extended metaphor. In one of the between chapters (the broad chapters, that aren't character specific) almost everything was an extended metaphor, and everything was being compared to one central thing. Everything was compared to a monster; the bank, the tractors, even the guys who drove the tractors were all somehow made out to be a monster. Even in the chapters that were character specific, Steinbeck loves his extended metaphors.Steinbeck uses these devices, and many others, to create what is a literary masterpiece in my mind. An important story was shared with the many people who have read and will read this book. It is a book that can be read multiple times and a person wouldn't tire of it. Steinbeck's use of simple, detail oriented diction creates a wonderful base on which to build such a story.This being the first of Steinbeck's works that I have read, I have been thoroughly impressed and will continue to read novels written by him. The Grapes of Wrath tells a phenomenal story in a simple fashion that is so incredibly understandable, and relatable, that I found myself completely drawn into the story; after the first 150 pages or so anyway, which I found to be a bit slow. Even so, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good, understandable book to read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Powerful, gripping, and realistic story of one Oklahoma family, along with other migrants, forced to migrate to California due to changes in financial and agricultural industries.

I have such regrets for not reading The Grapes of Wrath many years ago. I was motivated to purchase it because of the Ken Burns' recent TV series. Very informative about the period (except that people I have met from that part of the country say that the Dust Bowl era is not over) and the relationships among the characters were outstanding. Mrs. Joad and I have a few things in common - mostly trying to keep things together.

Steinbeck shows many classic examples of the events in the 1930's. For an example how farmers in the Dust Bowl suffered not only from the drought but the Depression also. I liked how Steinbeck is always paying attention to detail when he describes the family's and the living conditions.The 1930's was a very bad time for this nation. I think that Steinbeck not only shows the Depression setting but also what they done in order to survive. Steinbeck gives many examples of how the family's lived and their everyday lives. I think that this is important because unless you lived during the 1930's you wouldn't know how things were.He gives many examples along the journeys of the family's life from their home place to search for more work to feed their families. By doing this it gives the reader a glimpse of how they might have had to live if they lived during that time period. Sometimes it feels as if you are right there on the journey with the families. Like the world today only the strong survived the Depression in the 1930's. Some of the events that happen in The Grapes of Wrath are very sad and touching all at once.I suggest that if you want to learn about the Depression and the 1930's this is the book to read. It is not only is packed full of examples but takes you along with the family's journey for success in California. This book will make you glad that you're not in the Joad family's shoes."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"John Steinbeck is the most perceptive and creative authors I've read.

As for Joad's family , they decided to move to California to find better jobs and get a new life. On the trip to California, Joad's family met other family that also moved to the West. They helped each others to survive through the hardship. The humanity that people had for each other was so wonderful, and nothing was better than that. I don't think nowaday we can have that humanity in society because as time has changed, people don't share similar experience and it hard for them to understand each other."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"While Steinbeck's masterwork fit more perfectly into the era of recovery from the Great Depression, it addresses human interrelations in a most timeless fashion. Those of us who have discovered what it means to lose all (or nearly all) of our tangible possessions, as the Joads did, grasp a deeper meaner of life. The Joads demonstrate greater respect for fellow humans than for the clothes on their backs.Steinbeck also provides an eloquent look at those who clawed their way to retain tangible wealth. These people wanted no part of sharing with folks in desperate need and Steinbeck demonstrates this through both the path of the Joads from Oklahoma to California as well as more general looks at the circumstances of the dustbowl's victims."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read this awhile ago, but it sticks in my head. I must agree with some other reviews that the chapters explaining what is going on around the family can drag slightly. However, they become less and less and story is amazing.

With alternating chapters stuffed full of symbolism and spice, Steinbeck captures the picture perfect photo of Americans struggling through the Dustbowl. Not only does the dialogue fill your hunger for personality, it creates a bond between the reader and the characters. Closing the pages of this book is like turning away from a family member.

This is a reading worthy of this magnificent novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book cannot but be considered one of the greatest works of American literature. Its plot is simple, almost literally pedestrian, but it magically conveys the feelings not just of its characters, but of an entire social movement and era.The device of alternating chapters between the tale of the Joad family and descriptive narratives of the society around them only strengthens things. This is no academic, dusty view of history; this is reality, as people lived and thought and experienced.The human attachment to the soil, the desire for home and community, the struggle for social justice, the tyranny of property, the myth of the Promised Land, the hope and dreams of a new life - there is something here on every level, the social, the spiritual, and the emotional.The beginning of the novel is a bit slow, but it slowly picks up momentum as it travels west. By its end, one cannot but be riveted by the Joads and the struggles they endure. And one can feel the grapes of wrath building, the knowledge that some way, somehow, the human will to survive can never be defeated.But, despite its clear social messages, this is not a political tract. The novel's ending takes one of the most intimate of human actions into a bare, stark necessity. Eroticism, motherhood, generosity, desperation - what is it? We cannot tell for sure, but we know only that it is human. The most horrific of our trials only serve to bring out our humanity. A haunting and unforgettable message."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I finally got around to reading this classic tale of migrant workers during the Great Depression and I am so glad I made the effort. Lots of history here and a good explanation of the rise of the collective labor movement. I did study some of this in my school days and I would have enjoyed having the benefit of reading this relevant work back then. Steinbeck's portrait of the Joad family brings all of this much closer to home and some of the stories (most notably the chapter describing the roadside diner)are really terrific. It is not a quick read but it does stay with you. A great investment of your time to better understand major issues still confronting our country today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I can see why some may consider this book to be a jab at capitalism. It definitely doesn't hold back when it comes to demonizing banks and business.

It would take a cold-heart person to not be moved by the story of the Joad family. My favorite Steinbeck was always Of Mice and Men, but THe Grapes of Wrath easily took its place the from the second I finished it. You must read this amazingly well-written novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of those who left their friends and extended family in the Mid-west to pursue the American dream in California. Steinbeck painted a vivid picture of the struggles and hopes of poor men and women. They weren't looking for wellfare, but simply a job so they could feed their families and get ahead.The story focuses on the Joad family as they sell most of their possessions to raise enough money for the long journey from Oklahoma to California. Intermixed with their story are great descriptions of the land, the road they took (Route 66), and the hundreds of thousands of people doing the same thing the Joad's were doing.The book doesn't get into the factors that led so many families to head West, and after reading \\"The Worst Hard Time\\", it doesn't appear to be the Dust Bowl as much as it was the overall depression the country was going through in the 1930's.While I enjoyed the descriptions and brutal honesty of the novel, I knocked off a star because I didn't care for Ex-Reverand Casy's view on morality nor the ending of the book that left me wanting more closure for the Joad family. The ending got me to California with the Joad's, but didn't give me any sense of their fate."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I received this book and couldn't believe the good condition it was in.

And what a great talent as a writer Steinbeck was. His easy, fluid, yet intensely descriptive style is second to none. I have read books by him I appreciated more, and books I appreciated less, but I would say that this is his masterpiece. His high level of detail meshes perfectly with a gloomy, depressing slice of real American history. All of which he intensely researched. It's a well told story, and provided me with quite a bit of mental fodder to mull over. You don't have to bond with, or even like, the main characters, to enjoy the epic and panoramic nature. I am an artist and writer. I write my own novels now. Steinbeck still remains one of my biggest influences.You don't have to agree with every position held by Steinbeck to enjoy his writing, and at no point in this does he push communism on the reader. You know what one of my favorite novels is? Atlas Shrugged. I vote libertarian. My favorite genres tend to be dark Sci-Fi and horror. That's what I write, and what magazines I do illustrations for. That is also entirely beside the point."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"My whole work drive has been aimed at making people understand each other. . . .\\" --Steinbeck in a 1938 letterAfter years of suffering through the Great Depression and sweeping devastation caused by \`Black Blizzards' during the Dust Bowl era, farmers and share-croppers of the southern plains began an odyssey toward hope and the green valleys of California. This was a time of sweeping social and economic changes. This was a time when banks, powerful land owners, mechanized farming, prejudice and bigotry sent people packing.While working as a journalist in San Francisco, John Steinbeck wrote a series of feature articles about these migrant workers. He developed a powerful respect for their initiative and empathized with their plight. Those articles were the stimulus that drove him to write Grapes of Wrath. A short time after its publication, Grapes of Wrath received the 1939 Book of the Year Award from the American Booksellers Association. In 1940 it won a Pulitzer Prize for Literature.Steinbeck used powerful, lyrical prose while establishing many of the scenes his characters lived in and passed through. He had a gift of writing in the vernacular language of the people of Oklahoma, and the surrounding states. Most chapters were anchored in dialog between the Joad family members and those with whom they had contact. Most of the story centers on protagonist Tom Joad, second son and parolee from an Oklahoma state prison. Ma Joad, the matriarch of the family is the bond that keeps the family together.The first half of the book follows the family along Route 66 from eastern Oklahoma across the state into the Texas Panhandle, New Mexico, Arizona and deserts until they are awed by the beauty of Califonia. Along the way, they experience devastating losses, disappointment, and innumerable hardships. The Joad family meets and bonds with fellow travelers, and experiences generosity by a restaurant cook and waitress. After arriving in California, the family learns harsh realities of life as Okie migrants while camping in one of the infamous Hooverville camps or shanty towns.Steinbeck gives the reader glimpses of the causes and social issues as seen through the eyes of his characters, but he doesn't stop there. At times he breaks up the journey and branches into short narratives that read like prose poems. In these narratives he frequently uses repetition to drive home his message. He hammers on banks. He has little patience for land owners who call the migrants squatters even though they acquired the land earlier though questionable means.He shows us sheriffs, vigilantes and private security officers working as pawns of the powerful. These are the implements of injustice and the source of escalating tensions. They will stop at nothing to quash dissent. Migrants are exploited through the devaluation of their work by these land owners.Grapes of Wrath lives up to its accolades. Be prepared for an emotional ride. Use it as an opportunity to assess your prejudices and preconceived ideas about this trying time in our history. If you haven't read Grapes of Wrath, you need to do so.The Grapes of Wrath"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"In this novel about Oklahoma farmers forced by the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression to seek a new life for themselves as migrant laborers in California, John Steinbeck may well have written the Great American Novel. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of the Joad family, but it's also the story of a people on the move, a nation in crisis, and humanity in its extremes of greed and goodness.The first quarter of the novel tells of young Tom Joad's homecoming after several years in prison for killing a man in a drunken brawl. Contact with his family has been minimal over the years, and he looks forward to seeing his parents, grandparents, and siblings again - but the house is empty, obviously abandoned, like so many others in this land where a combination of drought and poor agricultural techniques has resulted in failure and foreclosure on countless family farms. Fortunately, Tom learns from a neighbor that his family has gone over to his uncle's place, and he arrives there just in time to join them on their way to California, where they've been told there's plenty of work in the state's lush Central Valley.The second quarter of the novel is the story of the Joads' arduous journey west on Route 66, a trip distinguished by breakdowns, death, and intimations by those who have been there that California may be something less than the paradise they've been led to imagine. The final half of the novel follows the Joads after they arrive in California, only to discover that it's possible to starve even in a land of plenty as too many would-be workers are forced to compete for available jobs by accepting wages barely sufficient to buy enough food from one day to the next. The novel ends with one of the most stunning and affecting scenes you'll ever read, and although nothing at all is resolved, the story feels complete.The structure of the novel underscores Steinbeck's creation of the Joads as the human face of a social crisis. Long chapters that advance the plot alternate with short chapters in which the Joads are never mentioned, in which Steinbeck's richly poetic prose establish the physical and moral setting of his work: the conditions leading to the Dust Bowl, the loss of a way of life, the journey to a new beginning, and the disillusionment and growing anger of the migrants - all on a massive scale. These short, poignant chapters are as beautiful, captivating, and necessary as the story chapters, as they provide context and grant a kind of holy universality to the Joads' experiences.Steinbeck's writing is raw, earthy, and viscerally powerful. This is realism at its finest: full of small, telling details, and at times casually vulgar, not for shock value but because life itself is casually vulgar. I was about 13 the first time I read this novel, and the blunt honesty of the writing was a bit much for my somewhat sheltered mind; I remember feeling uncomfortable when an old man reached into his pants and \\"contentedly scratched under the testicles,\\" as that wasn't a word I was used to seeing in print, at least outside of biology texts. I loved the background chapters but found the Joad chapters distasteful for the first hundred pages or so, when I finally allowed the vivid immediacy of Steinbeck's style to make the characters real for me. As an adult, I have no such difficulties and am able to appreciate the masterful style and rich characterizations immediately. This is a mature novel, about people too crassly human to elicit our pity, but too warmly human not to elicit our compassion.I must admit that as a native Californian, I feel a special connection with this novel. For most of my life I lived just a few blocks away from the old Route 66 (although farther west than the point where the Joads left it to go north). Several of my husband's children live in the Central Valley, around places Steinbeck mentions by name. However, Steinbeck's skill is such that even if you've never been there, you'll close this novel feeling as though you had. This is a novel every American should read - indeed, everyone interested in what it means to be human in trying times. These days more than ever we need this book, we need this reminder of the values of proud self-sufficiency and fierce decency, for it is when we stop pulling, and pulling together, that we lose our way."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The book arrived in described condition in a timely manner. This is an excellent edition if one is reading this for educational purposes. I'm just reading for pleasure, but it's nice to have the extra info if needed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The book is beautifully written. Steinbeck's style flows so smoothly and is so accessible. The book follows the Joad family for about nine months as they are driven from the place they've called home for generations and travel to California, only to find out that it is not the land of opportunity they expected. Steinbeck's formula here is to intersperse the lengthy chapters chronicling the Joads' journey with short chapters that encapsulate some nuance about the period or the people, giving you a picture of the greater struggle taking place, of which the Joads are just a small part. It creates a very powerful effect. This migration west involved hundreds of thousands of individuals. You see in a few pages the big picture, then you are pulled back into the intimacies of the Joads' lives and the tragedy is made very personal. In one especially startling example, Steinbeck puts these words into the mouth of a character after selling a nameless migrant and his family some gas for their car, \\"Well, you and me got sense. Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no feeling. They ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do. A human being couldn't stand it to be so dirty and miserable. They ain't a hell of a lot better than gorillas.\\" In the next chapter, the Joads make camp along a stream and Ma is so happy for the clean water and the chance to stay put for a day so that she can take a bath and wash the family's clothes. The Joads are good, honest, decent people looking for the means to earn an honest wage and thereby feed their family. The thought of charity repels them. At one point Pa talks about the prospect of picking cotton and is so excited about the fact that it's good, hard work, worthy of the wage he'll earn. How soft and incredibly privileged it makes us all seem. \\"They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless - restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do - to lift, to push, to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"this is the greatest book of Steinbeck.don't buy paperback edition, the paper is ugly."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I have to admit that I probably never would have read this book if it hadn't been a reading assignment from one of my first American Literature classes.

I think I lacked the maturity in high school to appreciate the story but as an adult I can really appreciate it. The character development in the first part of the book is kind of long, but so worth it. You begin to love the Joad family as you do your own and you feel so slighted for them as they move from one work camp to another and are exploited over and over again by greedy landowners and employers. You feel their hunger and their pain of loss many times.

He did it by bringing us into a story by telling it to us. Secondary to that he showed us the story. Yes, he was a great story teller and he obviously had a voice of his own. Interesting thing is his books made great movies but they still remained top sellers for decades. \\"Grapes\\", is still up there with the best Amrican writers.It might take a while for some readers to get into the pace. Steinbeck doesn't write like many of the current best sellers. So if your expecting a drop dead crises on every page, a cliff hanger with every turn - forget it. Steinbeck's novels pull us in and keep us there because we feel what is happening to the characters, not because we have to know what happens next. What a master!Who can review Grapes of Wrath and say something new or different and still be relevant? Not me, and not a lot of others either. This is a five star read and I thought so decades ago when I first looked at it. I appreciate it even more now."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Set during the Great Depression, this novel chronicles the life of a family of sharecroppers, the Joads. They are driven from their home in Oklahoma due to the Dust Bowl (a series of dust storms causing severe drought) and hard times. Along with thousands of others who have also lost their land, the Joads decide to move to California with the promise of work and a better way of life. However, once they get there, they find that there is not much work to be found and even if they get work, the pay isn't fair. The Californians they encounter treat them with disdain, calling them \\"Okies\\" and fearful that these newcomers might band together and take over the land.John Steinback's writing is so vivid that you could almost believe that the main characters actually existed in real life. The protagonist, Tom Joad, is portrayed as a man willing to protect his family, but with a temper that occasionally interferes with the course of his life. The novel opens with Tom Joad being released on parole from killing a man in self-defense. The man he encounters on his way back home, Jim Casy, is another artfully crafted character; a preacher with a penchant for giving long speeches about life and its inner workings. They walk together to Tom Joad's former residence, only to find that it is deserted. When they get to the house of Tom's uncle, the rest of his family is preparing to move, thus Tom Joad and Casy decide to go with them to California, and so the story goes on.A combination of authentic Oklahoma dialogue and articulate descriptions of scenery and action allow this novel to almost live and breathe, as if it is being presented before your eyes. The effect of this novel is similar to that of Charles Dickens' writing; that is, the novel is so close to the history it represents, it will leave quite an impact upon you and serve as a reminder to how powerful great story-telling can be."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As many reviewers have noted, I had a difficult time getting started with the dialogue in the book. Once I got used to it I realized how imperative it was to the story. Stick with it past the first few chapters and you will see the light!The characters in this book are simply put \\"inspiring\\"! As a mother, I found it impossible NOT to draw strength and purpose from Ma Joad. This is a fantastic, emotional read and worth every second. I doubt that there are authors of this caliber anymore.The ending was unexpected and gut wrenching, but oh so appropriate! I want so badly to know what happens to the Joad family. (The sign of a good book when it leaves you wanting more!)If you like the premise of this book, try reading \\"The Good Earth\\" by Pearl Buck.John Steinbeck, wherever you are, I salute you."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Since the birth of America in 1776, this country was known as the place where the poor could come and get rich. Reflected in the politic, religion, arts and literature; the possibility of hard-working, moral families falling thru the cracks and becoming poor was unspoken in the American psyche. Yes, you could become poor if you took to the bottle, like Huck's father in \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Huck Finn\\". Yes, you could become poor thru illegitimate and illicit behavior, such as the fate of the protagonist in the \\"Scarlet Letter\\". And yes, if you were new to the country, your fate was likely poverty, such as that seen in Sinclair's \\"The Jungle\\". But to be a native of America, white, Christian, upright, and hardworking, you were expected to succeed, or at least survive. Then came the harrowing experience that was the Great Depression and with it this novel, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\".Playing out in a series of alternating chapters; half the book lays forth the personal experiences of the Joad family and those they cross paths with from Oklahoma to the grape fields of California. The other half of the book extends the experiences of this one family to those of the nation. To read this book is to understand the mechanisms by which individuals, families, and entire communities succumb to poverty, crime, destitution, and eventually death. The trials of the Joad family at the hands of banks, lending agencies, the police, creditors and employers is all to real back then and now. For example, within an impoverished community, creditors will often divide and conquer by offering jobs to the very poorest that require them to betray their fellow citizens; such as repossessing their property.One of the most important, and missed points of this book, is how the economic success of entire communities depends on mother nature. The Dust Bowl is a great example of economic disaster caused by natural events; a unique tragedy in US history, but a yearly experience in many other countries. Another important point in this book is that when it comes down to it, the US economy is built along the same lines as those of other countries past and present; land ownership. The wealth of the US and the relatively high living standards here can be argued to be due to the large amount of livable land.All in all this is one of the best books written in the 20th century. A careful reading of it provides insights into economics, sociology, human behavior, agriculture practices, the entire concept of property rights, migration and immigration, and the convolution of business and politics. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As staged in the 1920&iexcl;s, Steinbeck starts with a subtle beginning. A slow developing plot, but worth while if you be patient. This book is definitely worth the time and effort, if you read a book once a year. A mixture of both intimidation and desperation sets fills your mind, and entices you to continue reading. The Joads, a family of four from Oklahoma, are on a journey westward toward California, with grandpa and grandma, after a famine sets over and destroys most of their crops. As the story continues on, the Joads realize that death and hatred pay a significant part out of their country. Death was the biggest cost from reaching their goal. Many family members died, and so, the family started to question the destiny. Being intimidated and threatened treason from the other states, the Joads feel despised. There is only one communication that Steinbeck wants to communicate, &iexcl;the hard workers survive&iexcl;. The weak does not. The perseverance and indifference from the other people create this silence war from other states. Some where nice folks and some didn&iexcl;t crack a smile at all. People not only scorn them, but actually refuse to serve them. As a book, it would be one of the most memorable one, and to compensate the slow pace, the conclusion. The Great Depression brought many people down, and this is actually what life was during that time.It is fairly a nice body, with many uses of southern accented language. Steinbeck should be famous for using all those apostrophes and accents, which I would never know how to do it. &iexcl;I ain&iexcl;t got nothin&iexcl; for you, boy,&iexcl; quotes the Joads, as an example.The ending was actually quite a shock. It was like, &iexcl;then I woke up and it was all a dream&iexcl; endings. I don&iexcl;t want to spoil it, and certainly I wouldn&iexcl;t tell you. It was abrupt and unexpected. A must read to all people of all ages, but beware; you are in for many surprises."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Nestled between the parched earth of the Oklahoma country and the flooded fields of the California valley lies a tale so stark that its own nakedness adorns it like the most precious jewel. The story is narrated in the rustic tongues of the Joad family and the poetic maelstrom of the author's conscience; the guileless, earthy wisdom of country folks and the refined, high-flying ideology of Steinbeck. I don't recall being more moved by any other piece of literature ever.The younger Tom Joad is easily one of the finest characters I've read. There is no magic attributed to Tom or his family and the author does not ask you to suspend reality anywhere in the novel. If anything, the reality is so overwhelming that I often found myself breaking in-between and taking a few minutes off to unwind.The book is written with excruciatingly detailed observations like \\"Joad took the bottle from him (Casy, the preacher), and in politeness did not wipe the neck with his sleeve before he drank\\"! To write something like that, a person would have to have powers of perception that transcend sight or sound. We've read so many times of vague emotions; unidentifiable joys, unnamed pains, inexplicable kinship and intuitive distrust. With Steinbeck, there is no ambiguity. It is, as is.Every alternating chapter details the journey of the Joads while the ones in between are the author's discourse on the larger issue of human depravity of which the sufferings of the Joad family are but the most nominal instance. My favourite such chapter in the entire novel was Chapter 25. To quote, \\"The Spring is beautiful in California. Valleys in which the fruit blossoms are fragrant pink and white waters in a shallow sea. Then the first tendrils of the grapes, swelling from the old, gnarled vines, cascade down to cover the trunks. The full green hills are round and soft as breasts\\"...The author proceeds to describe in the most tender and in the most fascinated of terms, the luscious growth of fruits and vegetables and flowers and the men who work to create this marvel of plenty. He sings paeans to their ingenuity and slowly trundles through to the ripening and maturing of this plentiful produce and suddenly we find ourselves facing the most abhorrent of truths. In the face of exploitation and refusal to pay the wages for this harvest to be reaped, Steinbeck wreaks his vengeance on this paradisical beauty so elegantly painted in his lyrical prose. He commands the birds and the wasps and the flies to feast on the decaying, stinking, putrefying apparition left in the aftermath of his destructive force. His weapon, his mighty pen. Truly, no sword could obliterate with such completeness.\\"Men who can graft the trees and make the seeds fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce. Men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten. And the failure hangs over the State like a great sorrow.\\"Steinbeck has had his revenge. It does little to comfort him.\\"There is a crime here that goes beyond denunciation. There is a sorrow here that weeping cannot symbolize. There is a failure here that topples all our success.\\"I shook when I was done reading this chapter. I am no Communist, not even quite a Socialist. But this book is one of the finest examples of how high the human mind can fly, how far and wide it can see, how unflinchingly it can comprehend and how limitlessly it can feel. I consider myself most fortunate to have read this book. Read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I can remember the brown clouds rising up and sweeping over our home, even in Oklahoma City in the early 1950's. And the stories from my parents and grandparents who stayed in Oklahoma through the depression, and the stories from my grandmother who moved to California looking for work, but it wasn't until 1967 when I was in the Navy in San Diego situations would inspire me to read this book.Even today in California, being called an &quot;Okie&quot; is not a compliment. It is said with a derogatory note of disdain akin to so many other predjudicial nicknames, and you really don't feel the entire impact unless one is directed at you.What was this about? Why was there such an attitude towards people from Oklahoma? A friend told me I would find the answers in this book. It was in reading this book I lost my naivete about the depth of human prejudice and callousness. It was this book that inspired me to participate in civil rights demonstrations when the Navy transfered me to Mississipi. It was this book that woke me up!I will always be grateful to Steinbeck for the skill to tell a story such as this, and I can only hope it's message will endure through all time."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a powerful indictment of the oppression endured by the migrant families of the American mid-west during the depression years of the 1930's. The farming-belt of the mid west had suffered severe drought. \\"Dusters\\" swept across the farmland, skimming off the topsoil, leaving behind a dust bowl, only a few sparse sprigs of wheat surviving. The tenant farms were foreclosed and the families forcibly tractored off the land in a ruthless drive to maximise profit margins. Circa 250,000 migrants, \\"refugees from the dust\\", pulled up stakes and headed west on route 66, the road of flight to California, the golden land of dreams and opportunity, drawn by the prospect of picking work, harvesting oranges and peaches. The influx of rootless migrant workers centred on the San Joachin valley, California, and the huge farms therein, drifting in search of work from squatter camps to government camps to shacks in tied labour camps charging excessive rents and inflated company-store prices. The overwhelming glut of migrants flooding through the valley swamped the harvesting work available, driving down wages to peanuts level, as they desperately scrabbled \\"to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food\\".This is the destiny that fate had in store for the Joad family in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Forced off their farm, truck piled high with their meagre belongings, the Joads set forth on an epic 2000 miles haul from Sallislaw in Oklahoma through the western desert states of New Mexico and Arizona and onto the San Joachin valley. The gut-wrenching story of the Joads heroic journey is interspersed with short \\"relief\\" chapters on peripheral aspects of their route 66 experience, the trickery of used-car salesmen or a snapshot of life in a truck-stop diner, to give but two examples; other chapters function as social commentary on, for example, the stomach turning practice of spraying mountains of oranges with kerosene or dumping potatoes in the river under armed guard to protect market prices, at a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants were literally starving. This structure enables Steinbeck at once to follow closely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road, chronicling the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of grit, guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment. The strength of the human spirit is witnessed in Ma Joad's struggle against the odds to hold her family together. Steinbeck's powerful story depicting the plight of the migrants during the hard times of the 1930's depression years, the hardship and oppression endured by thousands upon thousands of families like the Joads, will resonate for generations to come - a timeless classic that has inspired my belief in social justice."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book is the story of the Joad family, a family that has been forced off of their land in Oklahoma during the 1930's.

John Steinbeck's skills as a writer are amazingly displayed throughout, and what most struck me about this novel is the way he can transition from one chapter that delves so fearlessly into the inner psyches of his characters to another that looks at the time period and events unfolding with an almost documentary-like detachment.I can see how this book can turn off some. I must admit that the first time I started it, I didn't get past the first 100 pages or so. But something about it kept nagging at me to finish, and by the end of that particular summer, I had. Then I re-read it a few years later, and couldn't put it down. What keeps it so readable, at least for me, is the pure respect and dignity with which Steinbeck treats his characters. These are decent, hard-working people trying to make the most that they can out of a desperate situation, and the book is never condescending.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is filled with such humanity that it very nearly brings one to tears at several points---yet it's never maudlin. A scene involving a diner waitress offering free candy to two poverty-stricken children could be saccharine in any other hands, but here it's a wonderful instance of one human reaching out to another. And in a world like the one portrayed here, where retaining even the barest vestiges of human dignity becomes a struggle, scenes like the one above take on immense proportions.It's a shame that to many this book represents drudgery. For me it was actually intensely readable, to the point that I didn't want to stop, and the ending took my breath away. Again, it could have been hammy and heavy-handed, but it wasn't. Not with Steinbeck behind the scenes."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath was the masterpiece of Steinbeck's carrer, the full embodiment of his previous writings, his social, political, and religious views, as well as his look on human nature.Take it as a prediction for a socialist revolution in America, take it as a revelation of human injustice, take it as a story of the American Dream and the will to survive, whatever the book means to you, you'll take something away from reading it. Even if you don't buy into Steinbeck's political and religious views - that we are all &quot;one soul&quot; and that should work together as one big family - you will feel a compassion for the injustice that has occured to the working poor throughout history. It is a harrowing and powerful novel well worthy of five stars and its place as a classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Must read! Wonderful descriptions and character development. One of my top favorites."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Truly one the greatest books of all time, and my favorite book as well, from my favorite author. This book has two different chapter styles, one is the traditional story, the other is strange, poetic observational view of the immigrants plight as a whole and the twisted, corrupt world they must live through. The story begins with Tom Joad returning to his home in Oklahoma from prison. When he gets home however, he finds his family kicked off their farmland. Since the family before their eviction had been getting notices from california that made California seem like some kind of utopia full of food, long green fields, and happiness seeping from the land. So the family, along with some other people, head on to California across the country. Along the way however, the family witness trauma, injustice, and hardships as they head onward to California. And when they finally get there, they recieve even more pain and agony, and are constantly geeting abused by the oppression and injustice forced upon them by everyone else around them, from the law enforcers, to the regular California citizens.This book is not quite for the light of heart, or the hopeful and optimistic, and possibly conservative. This book hits you heavy, and leaves you in a glum, melancholy state. Any glimpse of hope or happiness found within the dark confines of this book is ripped apart, raped, and thrown into the infinite blackness within these pages. John himself that he wanted the reader to not quite feel satisfied but rather deppressed and sad after reading this book, And John succeeds greatly. John, who I consider the king of character emotion and development in literature, perfectly paints the dark and twisted world he set out to create, and has perfect characters to inhibatit it to boot. I won't tell you about anything else so you can read the book in a comftorble cloud of uncertainty, But prepare to see characters strained and twisted and bent under the injustice they must endure, as well as characters who break under it all.The other style of chapters in this book is interesting and further establishes this book's identity. It is a poetic style of prose that observes the plight of the immigrants as a whole, from their land evictions, to finding a car with the little money they have, to the journey westward and the perils that follow it, the the pain they must enudre in California. These chapters hit you so hard that you may find yourself recuperating from the book and laying down on the couch, resting your fractured head. This just makes the book all the more disturbing in its power.Besides the fact that this book does drag on a little bit in a few parts, I can't really think of a problem with it. I have heard that some people (Mostly rule following scholars and other people of such a type) din't like it because of the book bring too sentimental, and the talkin' style of the Joads and immigrants was a littl' stupid or somethin' like that. I for one found the dialogue interestng, and anybody that thinks this book overtly sentamental is most likely an emotionally hardened, cold person. A true classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Shouldn't we all read the grapes of wrath and reexamine ourselves...learning understanding, compassion and empathy for our fellow man?

Like Preacher Casy, I went off and did some thinkin' and then some more thinkin', and here's what I think probably came to pass in the lives of the principal characters:Ma Joad: The trials of migration, familial disintegration, and non-stop tragedy finally break this great lady down. An excess of greasy food causes a massive heart attack. The children, Ruthie and Winfield, returning from gathering firewood, find her dead on the ground near the cooking fire.Tom Joad, Senior: Being displaced as the head of the family wears mightily upon his mind. He catches pneumonia from the exposure to the flood, and dies in the barn two weeks after the original novel ends. He is delusional, and seems to be permanently in the land of shades.Uncle John: Scrapes up enough coin to \\"enjoy\\" one last big drunk. Found floating in the same river as the bundle he was sent to bury.Rose of Sharon: Finds work as a \\"hostess\\" in a bar in Lodi. Sells her favors for a while, then meets and marries a grifter and bunco artist. They travel the west, hanging bad paper, and one day she finds herself alone in a cheap motel. Goes to sleep forever after taking an overdose of something.Winfield: Lies about his age and joins the US Marine Corps in 1940 at the age of 15. Killed in action on Okinawa, 1945. Posthumously awarded a Silver Star.Ruthie: Found wandering near Bakersfield, picked up by a kindly childless family who are moving to Oregon. She lives in a good home surrounded by people who love her. Completes high school and then nursing school in Seattle. Specializes in pediatric nursing because of her love of children. Retires in 1968, dies 1970.Tom Joad, Junior: Caught just one month after last seeing Ma Joad, charged with First Degree Murder. Zealous young \\"leftist\\" public defender J.I. Hurwitz gets the charges reduced to 2nd Degree, but Tom still gets a 25 year sentence, at notorious Folsom Prison. His inflated reputation (by the press) as a \\"red troublemaker\\" and \\"cop killer\\" precede him, and guards make his life miserable. He does a lot of time in solitary, for petty infractions. After six years inside, he is a broken man. Found hanging in his cell, 1943. Foul play suspected but never proved.Al Joad: At last, a \\"success story\\". Many readers have noticed that Al is better adapted to a changing America, with his uncanny knack for fixing cars, coupled with a \\"can-do\\" cockiness. You can't keep a good man down, we all know that. He and Aggie Wainwright hitchhike to L.A., where Al gets a job as a \\"lot boy\\" at a big Chevrolet dealership. War breaks out, and the management finds out Al is a crackerjack mechanic. He quickly rises to be Service Manager, all the time squirreling away money from his day job and his moonlight job, fixing cars and trading in black market tires with fellow Okie Eddie Moon.In 1946 he takes over a down at heel used car dealership on Long Beach Boulevard. He gets the land and stock for free because the former owner owed him money from a deal that went bad. He buys lots of spot ads on local country/western stations, appealing to struggling young people to \\"come on in, yer job is yer credit, we know how it is, we BELIEVE in YOU!\\" Before long he is the owner of most of the used car lots in Long Beach, although leaving in place the former names. In the 50's he becomes a Chrysler/Plymouth dealer, and a constant presence on local TV, sponsoring wrestling matches, music shows, and demolition derbies. An only son, Thomas Winfield Joad, is found dead of a heroin overdose in Hollywood, 1969. Al retires from the car business but becomes a fierce spokesman for the War Against Drugs. He dies, fabulously wealthy, without an heir, in 1975.My apologies to Mr. Steinbeck. I mean no disrespect. Maybe too much's thinkin's bad for a fella."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The characters may be very simple country folk, but John Steinbeck creates personalities so palpable, that you crawl inside them and live their journey; you feel their trials and joys. The journey through American country side is so rich in detail, that you feel like you're in the back of the truck, travelling the roads. The strength of the human spirit when faced with such adversities, yet still managing to find joys and triumphs is truly indicative of the peoples of old. The march over and beyond human souls by the 'big boys' is so painfully unjust, that you truly feel those pains and injustices and join in the rage against the machine. Beautiful snapshot of the ability of man to endure adversity, and a terrible indictment on what the love of power and money will allow to be perpetrated on our fellow human beings.The Grapes of Wrath"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"When absolute naked wild Capitalism rules and there is no Government intervention, it wreaks havoc in society and the weak and the poor are at the mercy of the rich and powerful, ordinary working people become instruments like animals, worthless cogs of a machine that at the same time grinds them, This seems to be the main idea behind this colossal novelThe story begins when Oklahoma farmers are forced to leave their land, and head west to California because they are replaced by tractors, as the actual owners of the land, the ruthless Banks, understand that hand labor does not yield a profit. One of these families is the Joads (the collective character of this tale), which \\"in group\\" confront the continuous adversity \\"individualism\\" is offering them every step of the way from the moment they leave Oklahoma until they finally try to settle down in California where they had gone following the indications of a handbill requesting orange pickers and just one unique hope, to find work, but in California things does not seem to be the way it looked, and the battle renews and rages on. Contemporary issues arise, such as immigration, equality, unemployment, egotism, hunger, strikes, law, authority, social demands. The ending leaves a message of hope, related to the will each individual possess in its more intimate and spiritual values. Almost a classic, this novel has been classified among the best written in the 20th century by book critics"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"To summarize the Grapes of wrath is to destroy the book. But This book encompasses feeling, story telling, and symbolism, and incorporates them. The book is set in the beginnings of the great depression, and the travel of the people between oaklahoma, and California, and in particular, the Jode family, (Tom Jode, Ma Jode, Pa Jode, Noah, connie, ruthie, Winfield, Gramdpa and Grandma, Al, Rose of Sharon, and The Preacher Jim Casy). Who travel to California in hopes of having a better life. But durring the journey, Grandma and Grandma Jode die. But after the drive, they run out of money and supplies, and wind up in a camp in California that is bullied on by the corrupt cops, to which they set on fire, and drive everyone out. After a string of bad misfortions, the Jodes wind up in a government camp with crazy people, and still no work, but eventually, they find work picking peaches, and live in a box car, where the story ends with the now not pregnant Rose of Sharon feeding a starving man.The grapes of wrath breaks ground on a lot of levels. Even through my fourth read i feel as though im still picking out new concepts. I suggest this book for study and to read because John Steinbeck is truly a master of story development. I feel that the characters are vividly formed, and his scenes feel real! But the grapes of wrath encompasses an element rarely used on this scale today. Many people see the grapes of wrath as a book that merely is about the Jodes and their journey across America. But to look at this piece of literature from that perspective is to miss the book altogether. The stories theam is far greater than one family. It uses metaphors to express the pain felt in America. In the beginning it makes a bit of mention of a tortoise whose heading towards a single direction. The tortoise is knocked down and forgotten. But it seems to be a metaphors to the solemn perseverance of the American spirit. But this is far from the greatest bit of expression in the book, Steinbeck purposely utilizes characters in the book for hidden meanings. The preacher: Jim Casey. His role as a character is to provide a slightly religious influence to the book. Though Jim Casey is a preacher, he has frustrations with religion. This seems to express some of Stienbeck's views in religion. With the purpose that Jim Casey serves in this book, I believe that it isn't consequence that his initials are J. C. . Another brilliant use of a metaphorical concept falls with rose of sharron. She through out the book held a fairly useless spot. She constantly was a \\"lesser\\" character than most, but stienbeck uses her to illustrate another theme. The book ends with her and a starving man. The starving man cannot eat regular food without getting violently sick. He had no more options for food... Rose of Sharon just experienced her baby dying prematurely before even being born. So she has a source of food ( I found no other way of wording that...) so she feeds the starving man with her unused milk. To me it seems extremely strange that a book of this kind would end with a character as \\"unimportant\\" as this. He used rose of Sharon as a metaphor to how we as people look out for each other furring the hard times. Over all this book is a stellar book to read. It is full of vibrant illustrations, perfectly formed characters, and meaning on a deep level as an American, and as a human on this earth."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"A massive work about the migration of dispossessed farmers from Dustbowl Oklahoma to California in the 1930s, the story traces one such family, the Joads, as they seek the Promised Land of oranges and cotton, only to realise the truth isn't so simple, and the destination as arduous as the journey.Criticised for its less than in-depth psychological analysis of the characters like Tom Joad and ex-preacher Jim Casey, I however felt that the cinematic vision of the text came through because of the way characters are revealed through what they say and do. Ma Joad, in particular, struck me as an unwaveringly strong character who tries to hold her family together, even as it disintegrates before her eyes.In the interchapters, Steinbeck casts his lens on the larger situation and suffering of these migrants, and makes a sobering social commentary on the state of America and its politics of commerce and capitalism. Some readers have commented on the oppressive view that Steinbeck forces on the reader, but that to me is secondary, because the narrative persuades through both the examination of the micro as well as the macro, and it is a point of view that demands careful gaze."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As a 5th generation born and bred Sooner, this novel resonated deep in my soul. It isn't pretty or heart-warming, but rather a (gritty) honest look at the desperation and hardships poor folks faced during the dust bowl era.

Writing does not get any better than this."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"A brilliant look at the Great Depression and how it effected people. Steinbeck was one of the great American writers and this was likely his most important work. The book will educate you and also make you feel for the characters."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is so profound, so moving and so forever a source of debate and controversy that one may forget that it is first a great story. It gives voice to a people suffering badly and it portrays them as they surely would like to be seen - as honorable decent people trying to make their way against the forces of nature, man and economics. John Steinbeck masterfully interweaves the struggling of one family into the great calamity of the dust bowl that brought out the worst in some people and best in others as millions deal with poverty and dislocation.You could argue that he idealized the virtuous indigent and vilified the wealthy as cruel and callous but much of what he wrote came of direct observation and much of what occurred in fiction happened in fact. When the pie from which we all feed from shrinks the fight for what remains is dirty and there's a tendency for the empowered to leave the rest behind regardless of legitimacy.The Joad family have lost their farm in Oklahoma and they are joining the great migration to California and the promise of jobs and opportunity. They are a healthy close-knit family that care and look out for each other. The strain of homelessness and uncertainty pays a heavy price which is at the root of the book's story. It would be a hard man not to feel empathy for them and the millions like them. Steinbeck wrote the book in 1938-39. He is staring right into the abyss of the Depression. You can feel the immediacy still. His writing is beautiful as his characters take life and the scenes are clear.When you read one of the most famous books in American literature do you try to ignore the hype and just read the book? There is so much going on here. Is he arguing for bigger government? Is he anti-capitalist or perhaps supporting communism? My conclusion is he saying \\"look - people are suffering. We Americans have a collective responsibility to each other.\\" I did not see this as philosophy or a soapbox polemic against anything other than the breakdown in respect for human potential. It is a book that is supposed to raise your empathy and recognize the wasted potential of so many.That the book is still popular and evoking passions 70 years later is a good thing. I wonder if our legislators in Arizona or Alabama recognize their own actions as creating another generation of homeless, dispossessed immigrants who are fleeing their homes, jobs and schools. What are the costs for these broken families that will no doubt slip into poverty similar to the Joads? I hope there's a Grapes of Wrath being written now to give voice to them"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Some politicians and economists tell us the 'recession' is over, but it sure doesn't look like it to most Americans. In fact, when you see friends and others out of work or losing their homes it looks a LOT more like a 'Depression'. A recent article in the LA Times pointed out that what we *don't* yet see coming out of the hard times this time around is great art - it seems the movie makers and musicians are too far removed from the plight of normal Americans to see what's going on. I guess we can always revisit some of the art to come out of that *other* Depression back in the 1930s, like Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath.The book centers around the Joad family from Oklahoma. Having lost their farm to the bank they decide to move to California after seeing fliers advertising high pay for farm workers, and hit the road in an old truck converted to haul all their worldly belongings. On the road, however, they notice a lot of others in similar circumstances are also heading to California with similarly high hopes. And when they arrive they find a vast oversupply of labor has driven down wages to levels making it impossible to support a family. Even worse, however, they arrive to find that nearly all the land is owned by huge corporate farmers who are colluding to exploit workers and keep wages low, and using law enforcement officials to prevent unions from forming.In spite of the optimism the Joad family has for making a better life in California, this is not a happy story and was not meant to be such. Steinbeck famously wrote \\"I want to put a tag of shame on the greedy bastards who are responsible for this,\\" and there's a lot of that same sentiment today. While the migrant worker aspect of the story might remind readers more of the Mexican workers of today along with its attendant racism (\\"Okies\\" were as reviled as \\"illegal immigrants\\" are now), the fear of losing one's home and not being able to provide for a family will resonate with most everyone. And the book illustrates well the effects of the economic disaster on families. The Joads find themselves disintegrating even while on the road, and they learn that they must rely on their larger community more and more. Assistance by the federal government is an oasis from the persecution by the harassment of the California deputies, but isn't enough for them to become self-reliant again.The style of the writing is fairly raw in its portrayal of the poor. The Joads are people of the land and their language is coarse and talk of sex is frequent. Nonetheless, they come across as honest and deserving of respect and sympathy. Interspersed throughout the narrative are chapters that leave the Joads to show the larger view of the situation. And while I found some of these diversions annoying, the overall story is so powerful it makes the reader angry at the situation. Also, it took me about 150 pages before I really got into the story. It's not what you'd call a \\"pleasurable\\" read, but it's compelling for the gravity of the story and you can't help but feel hopeful for the family to get a break. And it's probably a story that should be read again in these difficult economic times."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"While Steinbeck does, in the end, manage to convey an image of a portion of America during the Great Depression, it was an image confused by wordiness. The chapters describing the family where extremely slow moving, with dialogue and descriptions that would go on for pages, but which did not have any real point in the context of the story, and, perhaps more importantly given one of the main purposes of this novel, was not necessary to give the reader a \\"feel\\" of the times. This overabundance of irrelevent information detracts from the story, in that it makes it difficult for the reader to fully submerse his-/herself in the story and, in the end, obscures the portrait of America at this time, as the reader is given so many details, that they begin to run over each other. Essentially it is a portrait that is completely lacking a frame, and this lack of a frame- or a context for all of the details, leads to a very confused image and story.I did not loathe the entire book, and even enjoyed some of the intermediate chapters describing the country as a whole (I particularly liked the one about the used car dealership), as I felt that these were well written, and the most concise. Furthermore, the symbolism was rather good, but again, overdone, as was Steinbeck's use of naturalism.However, the main plot line, the Joads' migration, was overly convuluted and, after the umptenth tragic mishap, left me utterly apathetic to the fate of the family or their plight, especially since there seemed to be a tendency to \\"kill off\\" or otherwise subject the characters to tragic fates before they had been developed to the point that I actually cared what happened to them-- that they became more than just characters in a book (with the sole exception of Casey). When I reached the end of the book, I found myself asking-- \\"what was the point?\\" Steinbeck dragged this family through the depths of hell, and yet it was done in such a clinical fashion that it lacked the human and emotional essence needed to make it be for a point, or even just that no one should have to suffer so pointlessly. One acknowledges that (hopefully) already on a logical level, but this book failed to invest it with any kind of emotional level, despite the seven page conversations. Having read \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" I know that Steinbeck can do better. I was decidedly NOT apathetic to the fate of Lennie and George. Even with allowances made for the different purposes of the stories, I cannot give a great deal of credit to a story seems pointless (except maybe post-modernism :-)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"ok so im a teenager so my thoughts are probably a little different than adults out there.

Unfortunately, the thing will take you about three years to read due to it's excessively boring, uneventful passages and, unless you're Jeff Foxworthy, impossible to decipher Southern dialect. So the Joads go from job to job, making a nickel a day. And then they lose their jobs and go to another job. This continues for the first 400 pages. Finally,if you are able to survive that ordeal, you reach the final ten pages, waiting for the killer, \\"Boo Radley is a nice guy\\"-esque ending. Nothing. In the end, they are still poor and desperate. I suppose that in its time this book was a revelation of sorts, exposing the pathetic conditions in which the average man toiled in during the Great Depression. Now? It's an easy cure for any insomniac, as it will bore you to death with its monotony. Classic, schmassic. Pantheon, smchantheon."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck is not an great author. Rather, he is an author who knows how to pick his topic and manipulate his readers. As in his other well known novels/novellas such as \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and \\"The Pearl\\", Steinbeck had again chosen a innocent good (the Okies) struggling against a unlimited evil (the California captalists). To give credit where credit is due, Steinbeck indeed does potray the hardships of the dustbowl sharecroppers vividly and at the same time, tells us of the awsome collective powers of humanity and society via Jim Casy. Unfortunately, the literary value of \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" ends up just about there. As Steinbeck repeatedly stresses the Joad Family's mistreatment, he does not explain nor justify why the so called \\"big greedy captalist\\" exploit the \\"impoverished sharecroppers\\". Furthermore, Steinbeck does not offer us a fair resolution, he simply and conviently leaves the readers hanging in the end without new revelations. Think of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or \\"Cry, the Beloved Country\\", we learn that sometimes the society is filled injustice, however, in the end, all people, white or black, rich or poor are inherently good. Sadly, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" fails to transcend its melodramatics. In essence, like a teenager's unwarranted complaint against his or her \\"phony\\" society which cannot be called literature, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" does not deserve the label \\"a great American novel\\"."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Words cannot express my hatred for this book. If Amazon allowed it, this book would get a -10 star rating. If I could find every copy of this book I'd bundle them up and hurl them into the nearest nuclear reactor, gather the residue, and put it on the next probe to a neighboring galaxy. If I had a functional time machine, I'd seriously consider making sure this book never was created.Somehow, John Steinbeck manages to simultaneously whine while also using an author \\"voice\\" that drips with unparalleled condescention. I consider The Grapes of Wrath an atrocity foisted upon generations of unsupecting students by brain-dead literati who call it Literture---most likely because they feel a tremendous need to prove they are intellectually superior to everyone else by forcing garbage down their throats.My grandparents were very much like Okies from the depression era. They came from the Missouri Ozarks, got married in 1933 and raised 11 children. During this era, my grandfather worked as a laborer on a pig farm, mostly shoveling pig manure. Obviously, my grandparents were very culturally similar to the Okies Steinbeck attempted to portray in this \\"novel\\". I find The Grapes of Wrath to be completely insulting to their legacy.The reason why is that The Grapes of Wrath uses symbols and referrents that were completely alien to their world view. In no way would my grandparents conceptualize or symbolize the world like Steinbeck does. Of course, Steinbeck doesn't care. He's too good and too arrogant to try to look at the world through their lens. Instead, he transmorgifies their world view into something palatable to self-indentified intelligensia based in university English departments. Of course, their experience, expressed in symbols that would have spoken to people immersed in their own culture wouldn't be sophisticated enough to make their experience \\"valid\\". Oh no. Instead, he needed to create something totally alien to them, and then claim it to be the ultimate expression of their experience.To understand how offensive The Grapes of Wrath is, it's as if someone tried to write a novelization of \\"Boy'z 'n the Hood\\" using symbols and cultural referrants typical among members of Augusta National Golf Club, using dialog with ghetto slang as rendered into dialect by a white man who spent his life in exclusive clubs, then trying to tell people the result is the definitive rendition of American urban experience. The Grapes of Wrath is a 169,481 word definition of Noblesse Oblige.In short, Steinbeck is saying we can't care about people like my grandparents unless we turn them into something the eastern liberal establishment can understand (while validating their self-proclaimed intellectual superiority).No passage demonstrates Steinbeck's psuedo-intellectual posing more than the scene of the turtle crossing the highway. Steinbeck tries to import evolutionary concepts into his work; but, he so thoroughly botches the attempt he shows his utter ignorance of evolutionary theory rather than the erudition he wishes to display. This passage clearly depends on something known as group selection theory; a theory that is, at best, a very weak force in evolution. Group selection was blown out of the water by altruistic gene theory. To be fair to Steinbeck, altruistic gene theory didn't appear in biological journals until the 50's (well after Wrath's 1939 pub date)---even so, anyone with a sound grasp of Darwin's Origin of the Species can see that Darwin himself understood the basics of altruistic gene theory. Thus, a truly knowledgable individual would have known group selection was an unsound basis for literary symbolism.I do recognize that my hatred for this book is extreme, probably driven by being forced to read it 3 times during my education AND WRITE PAPERS ON IT. Reading it was bad enough. Having to write three papers on The Grapes of Wrath is traumatic enough to make someone refuse to put pen to paper for the rest of their life. I so hated this book that I found myself wanting the California farmers to grind the Okies into dust so that the horrible thing would end and I could stop reading it. Or, perhaps, that the entire Joad family would get mowed down by a Zephyr hurtling down the highway so they'd be put out of their misery. Unfortunately, Deathrace 2000 wouldn't get made for another 36 years.I wrote this review hoping that people who revere this book (and I recognize that there are many) can understand why legions of students (I would suggest they are a silent majority) hate it (as I did many years ago). I'm trying to give a voice to these people that cannot be dismissed with condescending insults like \\"you're not mature enough\\" or \\"you're just not capable of understanding\\". I thoroughly understand Steinbeck's craft, and I despise it.I must admit, however, that part of my implacable hatred is a matter a taste rather than objective reason. I would like to think---were I to find myself in the position of the Okies---I'd find a way to \\"beat the game\\". The Grapes of Wrath offers no character with any hope of such an outcome. Instead, it portrays the \\"no win scenario\\" (to paraphrase the pop-culture Star Trek movie \\"The Wrath of Khan\\"); which, sadly, is reality for far too many people in this world. While knowing this situation to be part of human experience, I don't want it in my fiction. And I certainly don't want 169,000 words of it.What makes The Grapes of Wrath even worse is Steinbeck's undeniable literary gifts. The Grapes of Wrath is the artistic equivalent of Pablo Picasso painting a heroic mural glorifying Josef Stalin's treatment of the Ukraine."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I liked East of Eden better, although, The Grapes of Wrath is Great History. But, I was under the impression that the Oakies came West in Horse Drawn Buggies because I thought that it had taken place earlier. Of course, I knew that there was a DUST BOWL. But, I didn't realize that the farmers were Sharecroppers that the BANKS had abandoned, so that the Land could be cultivated by MODERN TRACTORS. I thought that the LAND itself had gone BAD. But, that's not True. The farmers in Oklahoma were displaced by AUTOMATION. In fact, the tractors knocked their houses over because they didn't OWN the land.But, it took place less than 100 years ago, so that's Shocking because I thought that the country had a lot more ON THE BALL. In fact, it gave me a Stomach Ache because none of the characters demonstrated (or manifested) the slightest CONTROL over their own Destiny. They followed their Noses. They were just like Lemmings. And the only people that Successfully ESCAPED were Single Men who didn't have any Family to worry about or worry about them (e.g., Connie, Casey, and Tom etc). But, Tom's ma gave him seven bucks so he could escape to Los Angeles because he was on Parole (in Oklahoma) and he had Killed somebody else (a Posse member) that had killed Casey, The preacher and Union Leader, right before his very Eyes (in California). But, Families couldn't ESCAPE. They were Stuck in a RUT. Just like a BLACK HOLE.The FOOD (?) that they Ate was JUNK: nothing but Lard, bacon fat, pork fat, and absolutely NO VEGETABLES (except for an onion once). They ate Fried Dough (which's nothing but flour fried in lard) everyday. And Meat (Hamburger, Bacon, Pork, and Salt Pork). NO EGGS. Bread and Potatoes occasionally. Some Fruit that they Picked at work. They had Coffee with some sugar. Biscuits with pork gravy was their main faire. I'd barf!!! They lived on GREASE that they should've Thrown AWAY. Therefore, they probably suffered from LEARNED HELPLESSNESS as well as chronic MALNUTRITION because they worked just for FOOD which was practically GARBAGE.But, the government Camp (in California) had HOT water and Toilets, so they were clean for the First Time in their entire lives, but they had to leave there soon because they ran out of money, even though they managed to survive the RIOT that the Sheriff had instigated at the Dance. In fact, Tom, nipped it at the bud. Too bad the government Camp didn't attempt to provide everyone with FREE FOOD. Perhaps, some of the Women could've cultivated some of that Excess Land to grow Vegetables for everyone in the Camp. That's what I would've suggested.If I had to live like that, I'd probably MOVE BACK TO EUROPE."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"There are few early 20th century books that are more self-important, ponderous, self-indulgent, and overexposed than John Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath. Ostensibly a novel that is intended to highlight the labor injustice in the California agriculture industry experienced by Dust Bowl migrants of the 1930's, the reader quickly finds that the gaunt frame of this plot is heavily draped with endless similes, metaphors, and other descriptive machinations that merely serve to bore even the most persistent. Chapter after chapter Steinbeck's words ponderously crawl across the pages on their hands and knees, begging the reader to flip forward a few pages just to relieve the monotony. It is sure to delight every English literature college professor and fill Steinbeck devotees with self-righteous pleasure and an endless supply of meaningless excerpts to be pressed on unsuspecting but appreciatively nodding folks at the specialty bookstores in Hyannis Port and Berkeley. But for most readers, Grapes of Wrath is an unrewarding chore.Given the novel's pretensions it is no surprise that in the intervening decades legions of harried college freshmen and gawky high school students have been required to read, and lord help us all, interpret the words of Steinbeck in Grapes of Wrath until no remaining literary stone is unturned and whole forests of trees are cut down to feed the maws of the paper mills that produce the neatly ruled blue notebooks favored by professors and teachers for book reports and final exams. This constant exposure and the endless self-reinforcing literary acclaim in the seventy odd years since the publishing of the novel might lead the unsuspecting reader to consider taking it on as thoughtful grist for the mental mill. Let this review serve as warning label that should be on the back cover. There are hundreds of thousands of works written in the century before, during, and after that will better serve to both entertain and provoke the critical thinking the reader is looking for.Yes, Steinbeck was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Grapes of Wrath, a dubious distinction if there was ever one. Pulitzers are liberally handed out to the newsprint literati for purportedly socially meaningful articles and books that uplift the oppressed and cast down the powerful. So it is no surprise the Grapes of Wrath was so recognized for shining a light on exploitative corporate farming interests and the conditions endured by many in the horrid years of the Great Depression. Throw into the mix the ecological disaster of the Dust Bowl and one has a sure fire formula guaranteed to please hard-to-please snarky book reviewers. Is the book a good read? Heck no, but that is hardly the point.Steinbeck, this reviewer is sure, meant to ape Victor Hugo's Les Miserables (1862) when he wrote the Grapes of Wrath. It is telling that even the English translation of Les Miserables towers over Steinbeck's novel in terms of depth and readability, no mean feat when one considers that the French novel was excoriated by reviewers of that era as overly sentimental socialist tripe. Grapes of Wrath continues to be a tempting resource for classroom assignments, particularly given its message of class struggle, social justice, and the neat ability to refer glowingly to FDR's social engineering conducted in his first two terms in office. Unfortunately this focus is in spite of the fact that the style of writing is tortured and archaic, that most plot elements have not aged well over the years, and that none of the main characters are overly interesting. These drawbacks are real achievements given the continuing relevance of questionable modern agricultural practices and illegal immigrant migrants in the 21st century.In terms of early to mid-20th century social relevance one could do better with The Jungle (1906, Upton Sinclair) or 1984 (1949, George Orwell). In the same era, but for literary visualizations, the reader is much better off diving into Something Wicked This Way Comes or Dandelion Wine (1962 & 1957, Ray Bradbury). And just about anything off of the Amazon bestseller list would be vastly more entertaining."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I believe it is a mistake for schools to continue to assign their students the job of reading The Grapes of Wrath.

And how can anyone expect today's teenagers to enjoy anything that doesn't have crashing cars, explosions, graphic sex..etc. etc. about every 3 pages.

Steinbeck is a gifted writer, and his talents are on full display as he chronicles the upheaval and trials of the Joad family, a band of 'Okies' who leave Oklahoma in hopes of a better life in California. Their story isn't specific to the Joads alone; it is the story of the dispossessed whose dreams continued to float away from them despite their best efforts to achieve them.The Joad family is forced to leave their home and believe a better life awaits them in California. Steinbeck chronicles in unflinching and bitter reality the travails of life on the road. He poignantly describes the hatred and greed of the rich against the poor, and the effect that mass-farming will have on the land. He captures the migrant life with vivid detail and touching observations.Steinbeck alternates between the Joad family's quest and the quest of all the dispossessed - the alternating chapters filled with descriptions of life during 1930s America, the depression and greed that collided when the have nots met those who had. The characters in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" continuously search for a better life, a life that is just as continuously denied them, as their family and their willpower breaks down. Steinbeck leaves the reader wondering what will become of the Joad family, and the others like them. And although we can guess what their plight will continue to be, the astute author leaves the reader with an indelible image of hope, however bittersweet."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" tells the story of the Joad family, small tenant-farmers from Oklahoma, who lose their home and livelihood to the twin disasters of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression of the early 1930s. Like many others in a similar situation, they spend their meagre savings on the purchase of an old car to take them to California, which they believe to be a land of plenty and opportunity where they will be able to make a good living as agricultural workers. When they arrive there, however, they find that they have been misled. California, its population swelled by thousands of migrant workers from other parts of America, already has a surplus of labour. Unemployment is therefore high, work difficult to find, wages low even when any work is to be found, and decent accommodation unavailable.The novel tells the story of a journey, and there are echoes of two other well-known stories about journeys; the Biblical book of Exodus and the true historical story of the nineteenth century American pioneers who opened up the West. Like their ancestors, the Okies, as the migrant workers become known, travel westwards in search of a better life. Like the Children of Israel, they journey out of what they perceive as a land of bondage towards what they see as a Promised Land. There are other echoes of the Bible in the book. The very title \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is taken from a line in The Battle Hymn of the Republic, a poem which uses Biblical language and imagery to convey America's vision of itself as a land of freedom. Several of the Joad family have Christian names taken from the Old Testament (Noah, Ruth, Rose of Sharon). Their friend Jim Casy, a former preacher who has started to doubt his former religious beliefs, nevertheless takes on an increasingly prophetic role as the story progresses. (He significantly has the same initials as Jesus Christ).In the Bible, of course, the Children of Israel did indeed reach the Promised Land after years of wandering in the wilderness, and many of the pioneers, despite dangers and hardship, did succeed in making better lives for themselves. In the novel, there is no such happy ending for the Joads or for the others who travel the same route. Steinbeck alternates between longer chapters, narrating the story of the Joads themselves, and shorter ones commenting on the general situation of the Okies. These shorter chapters are often used as vehicles for the author's left-wing political opinions, as he attacks the various individuals and corporations who have contributed to the plight of the dispossessed. The banks and landlords, in their desire for profit, force the tenant farmers off their land. The big Californian landowners lure them with misleading advertising promising abundant well-paid work, hoping to create a labour surplus and thereby keep wages down. The motor dealers exploit their desperation to get to California by selling them overpriced, unroadworthy vehicles, which they can only afford by selling off their few remaining possessions. When they try to dispose of these, however, they find that the dealers in second-hand goods are not prepared to offer anything other than rock-bottom prices. In California itself, the agricultural employers try to keep wages as low as possible, and vigorously resist, aided by a brutal police force, any attempts on the part of their workers to form unions or to combine to raise wages. Neither the State authorities nor the ordinary people of California welcome the newcomers in their midst, seeing them as a threat to either public order or to their living standards. The result is that the Okies lead a life of great hardship, living in squalid accommodation, desperately seeking work, however low-paid, in order to keep themselves from starving.As I said, there is no happy ending for the Joads, or even a hopeful one. Indeed, there is not even an unhappy or tragic resolution to their situation. The final image of the novel is the striking one Rose of Sharon using her breast milk, after giving birth to stillborn child, to feed a dying man. There is, however, no definite conclusion to the story of the family as a whole. We do not hear what becomes of Noah, who leaves the family shortly after their arrival in California, or of his brother Tom, who has gone on the run after killing a man, or of Rose of Sharon's husband, who has abandoned her. This lack of a definite ending is not, in my view, a fault. In other works of fiction, such as \\"The Pearl\\" or \\"Of Mice and Men\\", Steinbeck showed that he was well able to write logical, satisfying endings to stories when need be. His failure to provide such an ending to the \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" was quite deliberate. There is no conclusion to the story of the Joads because there is no conclusion to the story of the Okies. Their tomorrow will be the same as their today; a desperate struggle for the basic necessities of life.In some ways- his indignation, his social concerns and in the clarity of his prose- Steinbeck reminds me of his British contemporary George Orwell. Certain passages struck me as particularly fine pieces of descriptive or polemical writing- notably the opening chapter, which describes the harsh drought which led to the creation of the Dust Bowl, and Chapter 25, in which the author contrasts the beauty and fruitfulness of the California landscape with the inhumanity of the big landowners, wilfully destroying their produce to keep prices high while other men go hungry.Criticisms have been made that not all economic migrants to California during the thirties suffered the same hardships as the Joads and that many of them actually did manage to find well-paid work and to raise their standards of living. It has also been claimed that not all Californians were as unwelcoming or hostile to the newcomers as those shown in the book. There may be some truth in these claims, but to dismiss the book on these grounds is no more reasonable than to refuse to read Dickens on the grounds that not all Victorian boarding-schools were as bad as Dotheboys Hall and not all factory owners as stony-hearted as Mr Bounderby. There can be no denying that the Depression was a time of poverty and hardship for many, and Steinbeck's novel is possibly the most powerful and memorable fictional evocation of that era. Its place as one of the classics of twentieth-century American literature is a deserved one."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a fictionalized account of the plight of migrant farm workers in California during the Great Depression. Dust storms and poor irrigation have turned large areas of farmland in the prairie states into a Dust Bowl. Tenant farmers, unable to grow crops and pay rent to their landlords, have been forced off their land by the banks. The starving farmers are lured to California by the promise of plentiful fruit-picking jobs, only to find it an unattainable paradise.The novel follows the pilgrimage of an Oklahoma family named the Joads and their friend, a former preacher named Jim Casy. When the novel begins, Tom Joad has just gotten out of prison and returns home to find that his family is one of the many that have been dispossessed by the land-owning company. They are preparing to drive to California to seek better farming opportunities. The road to California is a wasteland of unfriendly cops, opportunistic salesmen, unemployed drifters, and lonely souls, all seen from the vista of the Joads' rickety truck. The chapters alternate between the Joads' specific experiences and interludes that give a sort of large-scale third-party perspective to the general plight of the land and the people.Once in the fertile valleys of central California, the Joads learn the reality of the job situation: The farm owners have lured many more people than necessary to fill the available jobs, so they get to hire those who are willing to work for the least money. The surplus of migrant farm workers group together in encampments called Hoovervilles and wait desperately for news about new jobs, while they are forced to face the hostility of the locals who call them &quot;Okies&quot; and consider them wage-deflating scabs. The living conditions are deplorable and the Joads can barely afford the most meager of food.The Joads eventually find work picking peaches at a large farm that operates almost like a labor camp, with armed guards stationed around to ensure there are no worker uprisings. It is here that Casy, who has been rallying for worker unionization, is martyrized when he is killed by a goon trying to break up a worker strike. Towards the end of the book, in Tom's &quot;farewell&quot; speech to his mother, Steinbeck conveys his message of the importance of worker organization and unionization to prevent exploitation by employers.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is thoroughly depressing to the very end. It has been accused of being too didactic and heavy-handed, but it's a book that needed to be written and one that took a lot of guts to do so. Who else but Steinbeck could have treated the downtrodden with so much dignity and sympathy without being condescending? Who else could have invested so much detail in even the seemingly least important characters, such as the one-eyed man in the junkyard, the storekeeper at the peach farm, and the fervently religious Lisbeth Sandry, making them unforgettable symbols of humanity? This book is an education. After reading it, everything else seems shallow."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book brings one of the most inaccessible disasters of the 20th century, the Dust Bowl, into focus. What a mean coincidence that it had to happen when banks were going through tough times. This book, perhaps Steinbeck's best, brings the personal melodrama of Of Mice and Men on the road with a family of 14 Oklahomans. Meet the Joads, who have lived on the same land for many generations. They have killed for the land and have died for it. The bank has forclosed on the home loan, and they have been pushed out. Now they gather all they can carry with them, sell all they can't, and hit the road in a rickety car and with only about a hundred dollars and wild hopes. Grandma and Grampa are the stern, traditional voice of the family, Ma and Pa lead the family in their oddysey west, Uncle John is a booze hound with strength and grit, Noah is a strange individualist, Al is the testosterone filled young man, Tom is an ex-con who just happens to be the pragmatist and clearest thinker, Ruthie and Winfield are the wild kids, and Connie and Rose are newlyweds. I know I am forgetting someone. The book is divided into two parts: the journey to California and their heartbreaking quest to make a living. It just happens that they are members of an outcast society despised by everyone. Throughout the book they are run out of settlements, antagonized and harassed, and mistreated. A member of the oddysey is Jim Casy, a former preacher. Casy turns himself in for beating a deputy to keep Tom from getting turned in and in prison meets a man who wants to end the victimization of migrant workers. He wants to form unions. While protesting against a peach orchard (that the Joads just happen to be at) he is killed by corrupt deputies. The book is shattering in so many ways: the way the Joads are treated, how the migrants at large are treated by the cops and by the rich malevolents, and how the general people allowed themselves to be blinded by bitterness and hate. There are several deeply affecting passages: one where a bunch of oranges are dumped in a vacant area behind a Hooverville (where 'Okies' lived), then kerosene was dumped on them so that the impoverished Okies couldn't eat them; the part in which the deputies send in a starving guy to start a fight in a government camp so they can break it up (because the government camp is treating Okies like humans), one man owning a million acres and not even farming it, just owning it so he can say he owns it. These concepts of gluttony and cruelty are more than the poor migrants can take. I absolutely loved the book and think every person should read it: it shows what happens when ordinary people are hated, and how devastating and frivilous that hate can be."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Who am I to review one of the greatest literary works of all time? Could I possibly give this book anything less than the maximum rating it so richly deserves? Should I even commence? Those were just some of my private thoughts as I finally put down a copy of this book - read. This is the book which stirred the American conscience, caused political reform and brought about change when first published in 1939. This is the book which described how families were starving to death because of corruption. This is John Steinbeck at his exceptional best. For those people who never got around to reading this engaging and absorbing account of the Joad family, may I suggest you actually purchase a copy (any copy!) and finally read it.Today the world is either in recession or emerging from the dark grip of this latest financial catastrophe. Whilst we may live in a time when millions of families are no longer allowed to starve to death - well, not in the developed world at any rate, I earnestly believe there are lessons to be learned from this book about the rich and powerful who care not for their fellow man but only for personal gain. More importantly, those lessons are as relevant today as they were in 1939.Another similarity also failed to escape my notice; In this book we see how US police and other officials use their positions of authority to threaten and even blackmail the many thousands of American migrants who were simply looking for work in order to feed hungry mouths. These people had not arrived from any foreign country and were not even black - something which would have made their persecution much easier. No!, these ordinary white American folk were honest farmers who had been forcibly evicted from their homes and the land they had worked for generations. Seventy years on, here in the UK, we are besieged by TV programmes depicting our different police forces undertaking their various duties around the country. Yet more cheaply produced \\"reality\\" television! Significantly, however, I have occasionally noticed how some police officers deliberately provoke a hostile situation where none exists. Whilst not on the scale portrayed in this outstanding work, it is interesting that I should recognise that underlying attitude of arrogant superiority.Whilst some may find the book slow going at the start, Steinbeck quickly gathers in those loose strands until they suddenly pull together to assume a story, reveal a mental photograph and produce a relevance into which the reader becomes fully immersed. I promptly learned local words and understood the dialect in which they were spoken as the Joad story unfolded. I could hear those southern accents as hardships are endured and explained through the actions of those who lived them. This was the organised, legalised daylight robbery and exploitation of the poor by the rich who were actively supported by the law enforcement agencies. A week's work for 1,000 fruit pickers paying 50 cents an hour is advertised to 3,000 hungry people who then pass on the message. Consequently, 5,000 starving workers arrive in search of that employment. With so much competition, the rate is lowered to 30 cents - take it or leave it! It was a deliberate ploy repeated time after time. Anyone attempting to organise his fellow workers is photographed, black-listed and branded a communist. Now feed that to your children. Then the banks insist the farmers reduced the rate to 25 cents and any landowner who questions that decision is swiftly reminded of his own vulnerability as a mortgagee! In short, either you pay them 25 cents or you join them! My own immediate reaction was to recognise a similarity between then and now - specifically with those modern banking practises which preyed on the sub-prime market. Anyone who cared to consider precisely what \\"sub-prime\\" meant, knew it was a policy destined to fail. And fail it did in spectacular fashion - and yet, the fat cat bankers still draw bonuses based on \\"personal performance\\" and not on their company's overall profit or loss...I note from some of the comments appended to certain editions of this book, that various issues have been produced in which, apparently, Steinbeck's prose are changed to make the work an easier read. Please don't take the easy option, take the version written as it was intended to be read - i.e. the version written by Steinbeck. If not, you cannot claim to have read this book at all - instead you have the equivalent of, say, a Romeo and Juliet story - set in Manhattan in the 21st Century - and there are plenty of those...In closing, I would urge anyone (indeed everyone) who has not already read an original version of this book to go out and buy a copy - any old copy, and then simply read it. Having done that, you too will draw parallels with our modern age and understand what I mean. You will also be richer for having done so - as would those fat cats who, unfortunately, will probably never bother. Having finally finished reading this outstanding work, I wonder how many of you will still be wondering whatever happened to that perfectly matched pair of Bays! I do...NM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"When I was a kid Steinbeck was one of my favorite authors. His observations always touched a nerve with me, and his characters always came alive, as the clich&eacute; goes. His stories were simple enough, the masterpiece Grapes of Wrath included, that the story enthralled me at the time, even if the politics somewhat escaped me.As most know, GOW is the story of undeserved poverty come to rest on an undeserving family. On the injustice of a capitalistic and bureaucratic society and the probable indifference of a not so loving God. Whether you reach Steinbeck's conclusions, and I personally don't, you can't escape how real the stories are themselves, how well told and entertaining and even humorous the most pointless and melancholic of human events can be.I remember as a high school kid being most disturbed by the government's attempt to battle the depression in the government's anti-common-sense way. With people literally starving to death the government, at the same time they gave handouts, were pouring kerosene on oranges and even shooting illegal \\"harvesters\\". It is hard to fathom today, the starvation I mean, not the logic twists of bureaucracy.There is a little something for everyone, for those who hate big business especially, but the government is not portrayed as much of a savior, either. If you need a happy ending this is not the book for you, but if you want one of the great American epics and a gritty slice of American history, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Although it is a little slow going at the start, once you have met all the chraracters, and the main story starts, it is actually painful to put down. John Steinbecks vivid writnig keeps you engrossed in the story, and gives the reader a clear mental picture. Having also read Of Mice and Men, I expected to get that mental picture and to be severely moved by the story. All my expectations were met. He also has a writing style that lets one get close to the characters. He has a way of making the reader really care about them. He makes the reader feel as if they are actually there, feeling what the characters feel. Although The Grapes of Wrath left me feeling quite sad and angry, I was thankful for having read it. It was very well written and an influential story. It had a positive impact on me. I feel very thankful for what I have, for everything the characters knew and cared about was taken away, without question or concern. I would really enjoy reading John Steinbeck's other works."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I had never read this book while in school, but have been trying to read some of the 'classics' on the Top 100 list. This book chronicles the plight of a midwest family as the dust bowl sets in. The famliy is forced to leave home and under the expectations of a better life and unlimited work, head west to California.The story is fascinating. The hardships that the Joads and the other displaced people is horrible. As a reader you start to sympathize with the 'Okies' and my animosity towards the Calfornia farmers grew. That is until you read a brief chapter on the issues that are driving the farmers. The state of the US economy is driving the farmers to let produce rot rather than be harvested. For the people who are starving this is another slap in the face.In reading this tale, I wondered how I would have dealt with trying to provide for my family. I can not imagine watching your child starve and not being able to do anything about it. This book gave me a greater appreciation for the depression era and what people had to go through to get by. This book should be on everyones 'must read list'."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"john steinbeck belongs to that small group of american writers able to capture a wide array of emotions and issues within a novel. 'the grapes of wrath' is certainly no exception. some readers may be put off by the book's length, or its decidedly 'okie' dialect. sure, it can be a bit tough to follow sometimes, but a couple dozen pages into the novel it's not too difficult to pick up on the dialect. and the book is quite simple to read and follow. it takes a master to keep is simple, yet profound.in 'the grapes of wrath' steinbeck once again proves he's the master of the moral dilemma--yet he doesn't dare presume to offer any answers. he puts his characters in situations and lets them succeed or fail (and they often do fail). it's one of the beauties of steinbeck's writing. while we tend to pull for his characters, we know they're as deeply flawed as they are--and perhaps that's why do we care as much as we do.the novel opens with tom joad jr's release from prison for homicide, continues through the joad's departure to california and their ultimate arrival in california and all the accompanying trouble. steinbeck, perhaps better than anyone before or since, captures the essence of america. what does it mean to be an american? what did it mean to be an american during the depression? how do we, as americans, treat our fellow citizens? what are our rights and obligations as citizens of this great country? as i mentioned earlier, steinbeck offers no answers--but eloquently poses the questions (as any good literature worth its salt will do). in many ways the joads are the quintessential american family, warts and all.what surprised me most, however, about 'the grapes of wrath' is that it's very much a story about matriarchy and the power of women. ma joad is one of the strongest women i've read about in literature. her's are the most heartbreaking scenes (when they're stopped at the border; when rose of sharon gives birth; when tom jr repeats his crime), yet she always comes out stronger and wiser. it's ma joad who herds the family. it's ma joad who looks after the men in her family. it's ma joad who understands why her husband and children behave the way they do. she's literally the glue that keeps the family together. i applaud steinbeck for writing such a profoundly wonderful, complex, and postive female character during a time when a lot of writers seemed to treat women as afterthoughts (hemingway?).there's much to admire in steinbeck's writing. as a writer, he's nearly unmatched. as a social commentator, he's peerless. as an advocate for the underpriviledged, displanced, and desperate, he's the master."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"When was the last time you read The Grapes of Wrath? I myself had not picked it up since I first read it, more than thirty years ago. I remembered the bare outlines of the plot, including the famous last scene, but little more. This time, I was struck by the force of many scenes: the brutality of the tractors that tear through the homes of tenant farmers, the plain rendering of the little caf&eacute; on the road to California, the small luxuries at the government camp in California. The characterization of Ma Joad as she struggles to feed her family is unforgettable. Most of all, I admired Steinbeck's handling of tone. The novel interweaves chapters of more general socio-economic observation into the story of the Joads. These chapters are angry ones, but Steinbeck does not permit his anger to warp his story. A lesser writer might have sentimentalized the Joads, but Steinbeck never does it, and that's what makes this a novel you should pick up once again."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Few novels portray the Hunger of the human spirit with more compassion and talent than Grapes. This was Steinbecks strong suit.

From the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma to the grim and cruel lives faced by migrant workers in California, the story captures the heartache of the Great Depresssion and the power and redemption of the human spirit.

The narrator is extraordinarily talented and completely captures the spirit of this classic. His dialogue is perfect.If I have one complaint, it is that the primary hero of the story simply drifts off in a bit of an anticlimax. But that's probably necessary to the overall plot. Taken as a whole, the story is the most moving and inspirational work of fiction I've ever read or heard."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This was required reading in HS which, of course, I didn't do :025 years later I decided to read many of the literary classics that I faked my way through. 'Grapes of Wrath' took me about 100 pages to get locked into. Steinbeck's writing style was difficult for me to digest at first. Once I got hooked, I went back a re-read the first 100 pages. At 500 pages it took me a couple of weeks to get through. But at every sequential reading session I found myself covering more and more pages until I read the final 100 pages in one sitting.Great story based upon anecdotal evidence that probably played out in many variations, thousands of times for thousands of 'Oakie' families after the great depression and dust bowl periods."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, is a brilliantly crafted work that appeals to readers of every class and background. It brings to life the battles of injustice and the strength of a family bond that all Americans, young and old, can identify with. Steinbeck masterfully illustrates the movement and transformation of an entire nation and the struggle of the powerful verses the powerless that accompanies this changing America.John Steinbeck's background and the events that he experienced while writing this novel helped to add realism and believability to his work of fiction. He wrote The Grapes of Wrath in the late 1930s during the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Drought and the Great Depression left workers without jobs, money, or food. Many people could not pay back their loans or mortgages so the banks took their houses and land, forcing them to migrate to a place where they hoped to start over. Since Steinbeck lived in California during this time of despair, he witnessed what happened to the people who migrated to his home state. He even lived with a family in Oklahoma and traveled to California with them so that his story could be as realistic as possible.The Grapes of Wrath plots the struggles of the Joads, an Oklahoma Dust Bowl family who is forced off their land and journey's to the \\"Promise Land\\" of California. Steinbeck tells the tales of their family and the millions that traveled beside them, pointing out the many injustices they all faced. People were thrown out into the elements when the banks came in like \\"snub-nosed monsters, raising the dust and sticking their snouts into it, straight down the country, across the country, through fences, through dooryards\\" (35). The protagonist of the novel is Tom Joad, the Joad's oldest son, who has just been released from prison. He returns home to find his family's farm abandoned and destroyed. Tom finds his family packing all of their belongings into a broken down pick-up truck at his Uncle John's house. They have decided to take the risk and make the long journey West to find work. This journey is filled with tragedy and struggles as the strong bond of the family begins to slowly break apart. Injustice and discrimination linger in each town, waiting for the Joads to arrive. They are viciously called \\"Okies\\" (279) and are forced to stay in dirty camps called \\"Hoovervilles\\" (234). They struggle to find work, prevent starvation, and fight for their pride. Tom tries to defend his family and people but goes too far and is forced to go into hiding. He eventually leaves his family to try to organize the migrant workers to fight while his pregnant sister Rose of Sharon uses her gift to help her fellow man. The story leaves the reader with a sense of hope that the migrant families will soon break free from their \\"slavery\\" and discrimination.Throughout his novel, Steinbeck effectively uses shifts in point of view to completely develop his ideas. He uses a narrator that is omniscient and all-knowing for a majority of his book. This gives the reader insight on the thoughts of all the characters as well as society. At some points during the novel, the narrator describes broad, social events that an entire group of people are experiencing. Also, the narrator can take on the voice of a type of individual that is a part of this group of people (like a migrant farmer or a California landowner). Steinbeck shows the readers both perspectives to try to capture the time as accurately as possible. Finally, many times the narrator is also objective and unnamed, like a detached observer who does not assume a character's perspective. It seems as though the narrator is there watching while the Joad family's lives unfold through conversations.Along with changing the perspectives throughout his novel, Steinbeck also utilizes many different and important literary devices. He effectively employs diction, tone, and structure to develop his plot and themes. Steinbeck's unique and descriptive diction develop his own informal style of writing. He uses a mix of both middle and low diction to illustrate the lives of the farmers. He is very descriptive and applies middle diction to paint a picture of the setting and important events of the time. \\"To the red country and the part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth\\" (1). Steinbeck also uses low diction and dialect when the characters have conversations to illustrate their backgrounds and to make his novel more realistic. He utilizes plain, easy to understand language so that the common man, woman, or child can read and understand his novel. He wrote The Grapes of Wrath to illustrate the plight of the lower class farmers of the Great Depression and intended that people of all economic and social backgrounds could discover his themes.Steinbeck also employs tone and structure to highlight his themes. He gives his novel a sympathetic tone toward the migrant families and at times it is apparent that he is outraged by the injustices that they face. But he knows that those injustices empower the workers and they will soon unite together. \\"Here is the node, you who hate change and fear revolution. Keep these two squatting men apart; make them hate, fear, suspect each other. For here \`I lost my land' is changed; a cell is split and from its splitting grows the thing you hate-\`We lost our land'\\" (151). Also, Steinbeck uniquely structures his novel to show the readers different perspectives and to foreshadow the future tragedies and hardships that the Joads will face. He precedes major events with short chapters that describe the state of America and that foreshadow the future. Steinbeck's use of diction, tone, and structure does an excellent job of creating an interesting plot and serving as a way to introduce his many themes.Finally, Steinbeck uses his choices in characters, plot, and setting to highlight his intended themes. He portrays a poor and struggling family from Oklahoma as the main characters of his story so that he can illustrate his theme of the powerful against the powerless. The Joads are left with nothing after the bank takes their land and are forced to leave the dry, dust-filled Great Plains where \\"it was black night, for the stars could not pierce the dust to get down, and the window lights could not even spread beyond their own yards\\" (3). Here the land is brown and dead, it has no power and no promise for a better future. So they travel to the California \\"Promise Land\\" which is full of \\"Valleys in which the fruit blossoms are fragrant pink and white waves in a shallow sea. The full green hills are round and soft\\" (346). California is green and alive, growing with opportunity and power, waiting to create brighter futures. The Joads are the stereotypical \\"Okies\\" that are forced to carry all of their belongings in a broken down truck and face the discrimination of people who do not understand their desperate situation. They do not have work, money, or food and as a result are left powerless. Ultimately, Steinbeck shows how a family's bond and the strength of women as the holding force of a family can overcome all injustice and unite people together.In the end, Steinbeck has created a brilliant novel that effectively utilizes many literary devices to illustrate the battle between those that have and those that do not. The migration of a country was filled with injustice and it brought out the best and the worst of America. Steinbeck could use his novel to unite a country, and to show people what The Grapes of Wrath can accomplish. \\"The break would never come as long as fear could turn to wrath\\" (435). Ultimately, the powerless migrant workers used their \\"wrath\\" to make \\"grapes\\" and good out of a terrible situation. Families came together and demonstrated how unity can powerfully defeat hardship and injustice."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath stands as the greatest piece of literature from the Depression era. No other work is as effective in portraying life at that time. The Joad family's struggle and journey are remarkably vivid to the reader, as Steinbeck makes it impossible not to sympathize with them. Steinbeck's writing style, as usual, makes for a great read, as he goes back and forth between the Joads and a kind of sweeping overview of the attitudes and effects of the Depression overall. But it is the Joads story that is really the meat of this incredible tale. I fully reccommend it to anyone; few works have had such a great influence and mark on American literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck made a living description of the live of Joad. I like some characters he created such as Tom Joad, Ma, and Casy(the preacher). I love some coversation concerning religion like Casy's self-confession. Also, when uncle John asked Casy if he was sinful or not, Casy said that a man had no right to tell another man what should do and what should not do. He also mentioned that one should not tell his sin to others so that he himself could feel better. Since I myself was in similar situation, I know better what I should do now.Now when I saw beggers and immigrants in my city, I start wondering if they led a similar life as the Joad did. I start sympathizing them. While before, I didn't like them, thinking them rude and civilisation-distroying people. Now I think everyone is equal to have a right to live better."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Great Depression in the 1930s continues to be regarded as the worst trauma of twentieth century America, and its scars are still felt to this day. If not for anything else, John Steinbeck will probably be regarded as the greatest chronicler of this cataclysm. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is arguably the best novel about the struggles of the poor during this time. Focusing on the hardships of the Joad family and their friends, Steinbeck gives us, in microcosm, a look at the entire population of the dispossessed of the Great Depression. The constant hunger, searches for work, violence, betrayals and setbacks that the Joads endure would have produced a grim and depressing novel in a less skilled writer's hand, but Steinbeck does not allow his characters to give in. In spite of all the calamities, the Joads maintain dignity, courage, and hope. Fortunately, for America, the poor did maintain these virtues, otherwise it would have vanished or rebelled, throwing the nation into anarchy. THE GRAPES OF WRATH, however, shows our generation just how close we came.Rocco Dormarunno, author of THE FIVE POINTS."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I'd highly recommend this book. I've read other works by John Steinbeck such as East of Eden (not a favorite), The Pearl and Of Mice and Men (liked both), but the Grapes of Wrath is a favorite. I was deeply moved by the Joad family story. Despite their hardships, injustices, and loss of family, they press on hoping for a better life and willing to work for it. There are some good lessons learned in their story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was the one great novel Steinbeck was born to write. Of the authors 17 books I dear say this must be the best one. The novel won Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize in 1940, and it was \\"a cornerstone\\" of his 1962 Nobel Prize award.From the first page I fell in love with Steinbeck's way of writing, his humble and delicate language. Published in 1939, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of the 250 000 American migrants who pulled up, and headed west on Route 66 - to California.Through the book we follow one of the families that headed west, The Joad family. We enter the story as Tom Joad, one of the children in the family, gets out of jail. He comes home, finding his family suffering from the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Tormented and forced to leave their land, the Joad's strap as many of their belongings as they can to their truck. With the truck piled high they hit the road for their journey to promise land - to California.The Joad's believe that leaving Oklahoma for California is the answer to all their troubles. California will be abundant with opportunities - work for everyone, plenty of food, oranges and peaches on every tree. Pa even has a leaflet saying they need thousands of men on the farms. Reality will soon catch up with them. The journey to California turns out to be everything but easy. They experience all sorts of hardship; loss of family members, trouble with the truck, harassment by the police and locals. When the Joad's finally make it to California, their troubles and suffering are rewarded not by work, plenty of food, and oranges on every tree, but with even more troubles. While moving around, following the different picking seasons chasing for work, the family is enduring such poor living conditions. They are living in squatter camps, government camps, and in the end shacks in labour camps.The characters in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" are all very well developed. They are so vivid and one cannot help but to care deeply for them all. Several of the characters have left a lasting impression; Tom Joad, Grandpa, the courageous ex-preacher, and above all Ma Joad. She is a loveable, courageous, strong woman and I admire her spirit, dignity and her determination as she struggles to keep her family together. Even facing so much testing and hardship, she still keeps perspective and hope.An experiment that works well in this novel is the \\"in-between\\" chapters. Short stories with reflections and background about the Great Depression; how a used-car dealer take advantage of his desperate customers or how farmers sprayed oranges with kerosene and threw potatoes in the river to keep market prices up while hundreds of thousands of people was starving, as well as other small stories, true literary treasures such as the first \\"in-between\\" chapter about the turtle.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is written in a most memorable way. The book is no less than a landmark in American history and it is one of the absolute greatest and most significant novels of the last century. This book deserves every bit of praise and reward that it has received. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Grapes of Wrath is, by far, the worst book I've ever read.I'm not kidding. I'm not saying this lightly. This book is all about some dumb farmers. And, unlike most Steinbeck, it doesn't end with all the characters dieing-- you just wish it did. This man spends an entire chapter on describing the movements of a turtle. Not a joke. A far more intereasting story then this one would probably be the man the main character supposingly killed, but even that would suck. Steinbeck would write it something like this:\\"And after seeing the corpse falled, he cried. He cried like he had never cried before, tears streaming down his face endlessly. Rivers of water flowed out from his eyes, drowning bacteria and skin pores alike. The tears tasted salty; like ramen. But he couldn't help it.His father had worked the land. His grandfather had worked the land. He had been born here, he had lived here, he would have wanted to die here. The land was like his lifeblood, flowing through him. Goddam bank people taking the land. The land! His forefathers had lived on this land!

I only wish I hadn't waited so long to read it. On the other hand, years of personal life experience helped me to truly appreciate a book of this nature. It earned Steinbeck the Pulitzer Prize in 1940, and I think it's well worth it.The story follows the plight of the dirt-poor Oklahoman sharecroppers who became victims of the great draught of the 1930's. The land literally dried up, turned to dust and blew way, so the banks and the landowners had no other choice but to expel the sharecroppers from their farms. Just like that, their services were no longer needed. The sharecroppers, in turn, were lured to California by a rain of colorful flyers depicting California as the land of opportunity with plenty of well-paying jobs and the chance for a brand new life. All they had to do was get there. So hundreds of thousands of displaced workers packed their eager belongings and headed west.The perspective of the story is from the Joad family's point of view. They were a typical poor family who managed to fix up their old truck with sweat and bailing wire and put together just enough cash money to make the long trip to the agricultural heartland of California. But, of course, something went wrong. Not one thing, but a series of misfortunes. And in my opinion, John Steinbeck did a brilliant job of writing a story that immerses you deep into the heart of the action, as if we, the readers, were sitting in that old broken down truck right alongside the Joad family, breathing the air they breathed, eating the food the ate, feeling their pain, and experiencing everything they experienced. And life on the road to California was tough beyond imagination.By some miracle, the Joad family eventually made it to California. But it wasn't exactly like the flyers had depicted it would be. It seems that the California farmers and landowners had send out thousands of flyers to fill a small number of jobs. If a farmer needed five hundred workers, he'd send out twenty thousand flyers. This tactic resulted in an all-out hunger panic, and forced thousands upon thousands of starving migrants to compete for a relatively few jobs. Thus, wages were negotiated lower and lower until it wasn't even enough money to feed a family. For instance, a man with a wife and children would gladly work for less than a man with no family. And the women broke their backs and worked their own fingers to the bone tending to their impoverished families, oftentimes feeding them nothing more than hot gravy made from a splash lard and flour. So the migrants basically found themselves in the same shape they were in before they left their homes in Oklahoma. They had no money, no food and no gas to go elsewhere. And on top of that, the locals didn't want them near their towns, houses, stores or children for fear of being overrun by thieves. So the police constantly harassed them, shot at them, threw them in jail, and drove them off the property and back onto the open road. Poor, starving, and marooned in a strange land, for the Joad family, as well as the thousands of other migrant families, California proved to be anything but the land of opportunity.John Steinbeck wasn't a writer known for using big bang endings, but to me, the ending of this book was exceptional and, in my opinion, can only be truly understood after you have read the entire book. You'll have to judge for yourself. I give Grapes of Wrath my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The crime and the sorrow that the subject sentences refer to was aptly characterized by Steinbeck in a previous paragraph: \\"Men who can graft the trees and make the seed fertile and big can find no way to let the hungry people eat their produce. Men who have created new fruits in the world cannot create a system whereby their fruits may be eaten.\\" I first read those words some 40 years ago, have carried them with me, along with the intervening image that Steinbeck described, that of hungry people not being able to eat the oranges that had been dumped, and squirted with kerosene in order to destroy them, essentially because the \\"market\\" demanded it. The hunger that Steinbeck described in America has been attenuated, but not eliminated over the years, and there is still a vast operation here in ABQ, involving thousands of volunteers, to \\"feed the hungry.\\" I live only four miles from the old Route 66, and each day one can still witness America's \\"lumpenproletariat,\\" although they would certainly never use that word, wandering up and down the street, on their way to California, where their life will be different, or returning, after it proved not to be.With the \\"new hard times\\" upon us, and \\"the market\\" has again proven to be \\"a god that failed,\\" I thought Steinbeck's book worthy of a re-read. It has lost none of its power over the intervening years; unfortunately the issues described resonate today. Only a few days ago there was a picture in the NYT of new homes being demolished in Victorville, CA, again, because \\"the market\\" demanded it.Steinbeck is a master storyteller. The epic of \\"those dustbowl days,\\" when large swaths of American farmers in the Mid-West were driven off their land, and turned into migrants, is told in microcosm, personified by the Joad family, trying to stay together in adversity, with the centrifugal forces pulling them apart. Ma Joad, in particular, is a stoic, heroic figure. And Tom was famously played by a young Henry Fonda in the movie. Steinbeck alternates these chapters with short, pithy descriptive chapters of the macrocosm, the overall social and economic forces that produced this tragedy. Steinbeck is a master of dialogue, capturing the rural patois of the heartland. His characterization of the members of the Joad family, and people they meet along \\"the mother road,\\" Rt. 66 is likewise strong. There are some charming vignettes, like the waitress in the diner, dealing with the nasty, economically affluent, and the kindness of truck drivers, the \\"knights of the road.\\" Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize for this book; modestly he claimed he did not deserve it, but no other book has so successfully captured the anguish of that era.Lessons for today abound: \\"And the great owners, who must lose their land in an upheaval, the great owners with access to history, with eyes to read history and to know the great fact: when property accumulates in too few hands it is taken away.\\" (p324). It didn't really work out that way. World War II was to finally provide the \\"meaningful employment\\" that ended the depression, and dealt with the issue of surplus production far more dramatically that kerosene on oranges. Essentially nothing has changed, save for the more global dimension of the issue, since Steinbeck wrote: \\"And money that might have gone to wages went for gas, for guns, for agents and spies, for blacklists, for drilling.\\" (p388)Later in life Steinbeck seemed to have forgotten: \\"...and they reassured themselves that they were good and the invaders bad, as a man must do before he fights\\" (p 386). Steinbeck supported the Vietnam War!I was surprised and sadden by the number of 1-star reviews, mainly by high school students, \\"forced\\" to read the book, \\"irrelevant ancient history\\" that they might start re-living. One even said that Steinbeck was a communist, apparently not having read: \\"A red is any SOB that wants thirty cents an hour when we're payin' twenty-five\\"! (p 407). Unlike some books that I had to read in high school, it is a good, solid, easy-to-read book. Alas, many of these students will become adults, who never read a book again, though they might now have the time standing in the unemployment lines.\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was excellent the first time around, and equally so, and even more relevant today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I love this book for a variety of reasons, and I'll share these before offering my criticisms:1) Wonderful tale of a painful time and place in American history2) Great characters - and powerful bonding between them.

John Steinbeck really knew his stuff, and brought it to LIFE! Kudos!5) Beautiful writing - so many times Steinbeck wrote scenes that sing off the page, transcending the story, the characters, and himself6) I just love Steinbeck's character of Preacher Casy. He adds such a strong dimension of honesty, emotional courage, and truth-seeking to the book... He's one of my favorite characters in all of literature.My criticisms:1) Having previously read this book fifteen years ago, I learned then that the \\"filler\\" chapters - the ones NOT about the Joad family - were unnecessary to the story, so I skipped them this time around. This made the book infinitely more readable and enjoyable. I would guess these skippable chapters account for about a third of the book's volume...2) I found the ending cheesy - didn't like it fifteen years ago, and still don't. I won't go into details (don't want to be a spoiler), but I found it too intellectual and emotionally disconnected to the pulse of the story...3) Steinbeck uses various of his characters (particularly Preacher Casy) to make all sorts of philosophical comments on life, but never does he state the obvious, much less come near it with a ten-foot pole: DON'T HAVE SO MANY KIDS! The whole book is about people trying desperately to feed their children - for whom they cannot provide. To me this leaves the parents - sharecroppers, who, at the best of times, had life REALLY hard - and not just society, responsible. Even ONE little comment to this effect would have been welcomed.

There are many parallels in the novel's plot to what is occurring in our economy today. There are differences, too, and they are poignant: the strong family bond, the lack of governmental aid to the poor, and how they lived, from their cars to their houses both simplifies and complicates the Joad's journey to California and they hope, stability for their family. Anyone who has driven along Route 66 or the Texas panhandle, for instance, can really appreciate Steinback's intense description of the Joad's journey to California and just how nerve-wracking it must have been without the benefit of a good car, motels, bottled water, and credit cards.For those who might complain that the narrative intermingled with the Joad's story is too lefty or smacks of propaganda, I think it adds a good balance to the story. It gives you a sense of the anger and sadness building among nameless people as their lives fall apart, while the Joads give a name and a face to the suffering. And again, I think it is pretty on par with what is going on today: a universal feeling of helpfulness that really hasn't found a purpose, plan, or footing among private struggles of individuals.Long story short: Grapes of Wrath is a really good novel.

Families moved to find work during the Great Depression and found themselves struggling to find work, just like the Joad family. A quote I found very interesting, \\"For man, unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond his work, walks up the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments,\\" shows the significance of growing from experiences.

The Grapes of Wrath masterfully tells a compeling story of the Joad family during the Depression and Dust Bowl era. However, it is not until one digests this story that the metaphors, and contaversial themes surely erupt in the conscientious reader. The final scene in this book shows that even when driven to the most dire circumstances, good will still exists. While many see the work as an historic piece about the Depression era, I believe Steinbeck's themes in the Grapes of Wrath could have been played out in any era about social turmoil and economic ruin. But I am glad he chose the Depression era, and I am sure other readers will be too. Inasmuch as some people will see this book as a snapshot of the Depression, I think many have found it to be a study in the human condition that is timeless.

Its a revealing story that depicts true poverty and the struggle for survival. Steinback does an extraordinary job on giving us a glimpse of what life would be like if jobs and food was limited. It was shocking to see what people were willing to accept for a hard day's work. Families were broken up , children were starved and put to work, it was really demoralizing. This book was basically the struggles of a family in the 1930's to make it to the West where &quot;work was plentiful&quot; , but later discover that things are not how they pictured them. It was a great book but it was a little lengthy."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Great Depression and the 'Dust Bowl', two of the worst disasters to strike our nation in the last hundred years. The author, John Steinbeck, takes a chance at creating a story to properly convey the story of millions of migrant farmers kicked off their land during this period in the 1930s. He succeeded through the Joad family. Trying to create a new and better life, the Joads leave their Oklahoma home and travel to the land of promise, California. The travel to and throughout the state provides the perfect setting for a story of the terrible injustices and obstacles that migrant workers of the time faced. The main problem that many will have with the novel is the pacing of the story for the first 20 or so chapters. Not without its bright spots, the first chapters although good, can be terribly slow. It took much willpower to keep reading this classic. Another contributing factor is Steinbeck's intermittent chapters, through which he giving a sort of social commentary. The chapters seem to take away from the story by destroying the pacing of the novel. Although these two characteristics didn't suit me, I am glad that I kept reading. The book is a surefire classic. While in some places overly symbolic, the novel tells such a great story, and is told in such a fashion, that you can't help but sit and think after reading the last words. I am writting this review directly after that period of thinking. I strongly recommend this book to anyone willing to think. And to dig deeply into their minds and souls to review what images and feelings that the book has imposed on them. I am a freshman in high school and the book is required reading for my class. The sad thing is that this wonderful story is lost on many of my classmates.

I am not a high school student who hated the interculary chapters (some of which were the best ones in the book...especially the one about fermenting anger). My biggest problem with this book is that Steinbeck simply takes it too seriously. The symbolism (through characters and otherwise) and life metaphors are so blatantly obvious that it leaves nothing to the imagination. Symbolism and cultural criticism works better when it's subtle and veiled behind, oh, I don't know, a plot. Yes, GoW did have a plot, just not an interesting one. It was a midly engaging story with occasional interesting points, but there were no plot twists. However, much more sadder than Steinbeck's storytelling is the reviewer who said &quot;I'll stick to Michael Chrichton.&quot; That is really, really sad.

The book is no great American novel but it is not piece of sh*t either. I had to read this book for my 11th grade AP English class and in general I like the book. It has strong themes, great characters and lots of symbolism. The Grapes of Wrath is more important as a political work that gives an overview of the Great Depression than as a literary one. The details do get very tedious. I had to read some chapters twice because I kept forgeting who the characters were. Once the Joads start their journey all the characters tend to blend together, especially the male characters. Steinbeck also tried to throw a few to many symbols in. It got so bad that I got a headache trying to find the deeper meaning in Tom using his own urine to heal a cut. In the end though all you can do is get through it.

I was looking for pure, 100%, Dust Bowl action, but it wasn't there. All in all, an average work with a good ending."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I made a resolution to read several of the greats works of literature throughout 2009, and got an early start with this moving saga.SHORT, NO SPOILER REVIEWThe novel is in one sense about the trials of a poverty stricken family of Oklahoma farmers, the Joads, who are driven off their land in the mid-1930s by the Dust Bowl, by greedy banks and by the never ending pace of modernization. Lured to California by handbills promising plenty of work at good wages, they set out on a perilous journey along that perennial American roadway Route 66. Along the way they suffer mechanical trouble, family illness and outright hostility from people who despise them and call them \\"Oakies\\" (roughly the same as \\"white trash\\" or a Caucasian variant of the \\"n word.\\")Upon arriving in the Golden State they are soon disillusioned by what they encounter. They are forced by corrupt police officers and hateful locals to move from one place to the next, sometimes not even allowed to get one night's sleep before being driven out. At the same time they are economically exploited by the same people who persecute them. They serve as cheap, disposable labor during harvest season. There is one particularly poignant scene where a farmer yells \\"get out of here, you filthy Oakies. You're not wanted! And don't come back until the cotton needs picking!\\"The strength and resilience with which the Joads endure the almost endless horror and travail they face speaks to their strength and basic decency, as opposed to the \\"respectable\\" people, who are driven by hatred, prejudice and greed. Steinbeck achieves a masterful level of social commentary in this powerful book. Highly recommended.FURTHER COMMENTS WITH POSSIBLE SPOILERSOn a more abstract level, The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful, affirmative answer to the question posed by Cain to God: \\"Am I my brother's keeper?\\"Steinbeck believes that all of us are, and he drives this point home with force.His words drip with contempt as he writes about the morally degenerate condition of the wealthy land owners. They dehumanize their workers, labeling them \\"Oakies,\\" by which they mean stupid, filthy, nearly worthless animals. They fail to see the common humanity they share with these people, and through their blindness they lay up grapes of wrath in the souls of the oppressed. In so doing they ensure that this righteous anger will one day drive the Oakies to revolt against them, raining every drop of the wine of vengenace down upon their heads.This theme is contrasted with another, more subtle one that pulses through the book: that all of humanity is one giant soul, as a character in the book phrases it, and the key to achieving justice is to act this principle out. Hence, towards the end of the book, the Joad's concern for their own family grows to envelop the other migrant farm workers. They see that they are all one, and the only way to achieve social justice is to take that truth and act on it by caring for each other's needs and standing united against their oppressors.The book ends on an inconclusive note. Steinbeck never tells us what ultimately happens to these people, whom the reader has come to care about deeply by the novel's climax. In the last scene Rose of Sharon, a migrant teenage girl who recently lost her baby, breast feeds a man who is starving to death. There is no titillation in this scene, quite the opposite. When read within the book's context it illustrates beautifully that Rose has learned the great lesson. She knows that all of humanity is one, and must act as one, caring for each person as if they were her own flesh and blood.This ending provides the weary reader with a hopeful moment to end with, after traveling with these people through nearly 500 pages of despair. Dismal, powerful, oddly inspiring and ultimately unforgettable, The Grapes of Wrath is a literary journey that none should miss."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I can't say enough about this book or the author, John Steinbeck. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a heart-wrenching story about a family and its struggles and perseverence through the Depression.

The Joad family, uprooted from their 40-acre Oklahoma farm during the late 1930s by economic hard times, brought on by drought and dust storms and exacerbated by corporate greed and efficiencies of big agriculture, journey westward to California because they \\"got to\\" in order to stay alive, make a decent living, and retain a tenuous sliver of human dignity.Through strife, exhaustion and personal tragedy, the Joads maintain their faith that the sun will shine tomorrow, no matter how heavily the rain falls today. In sharp contrast to Grampa's dream to \\"get me a whole bunch a grapes off a bush . . . [and] squash \`em on my face an' let \`em run offen my chin,\\" and the family's hope that \\"it'll be all different out there--plenty work, an' ever'thing nice an' green, an' little white houses an' oranges growin' aroun',\\" California for the newcomer Joads is synonymous with difficulty finding work, menial wages when work is available, harsh living conditions, blatant animosity towards \\"Okies\\" from the local residents, constant money shortages, and always being hungry. By story's end, we are left wondering how the Joads are any better off after being flooded out of their railcar encampment next to a cotton field in central California, but we somehow find solace and comfort in the poignancy of Rosasharn's bighearted willingness to give from her own breast the precious life she has to share.According to Steinbeck (and I think he is right on this point), the most generous people are those who have the least material wealth and fewest possessions. \\"For the quality of owning freezes you forever into \`I,' and cuts you off forever from the \`we.'\\" Further, in the words of (reformed) ex-preacher Casy (whose voice is probably Steinbeck's), \\"a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big one.\\" If only each of us, in our consumerist 21st century material bliss, could take this message to heart, perhaps our ever-so-efficient, profit-oriented, techno-mechanical world might become a friendlier, more compassionate place better fit for our one big human soul.From a stylistic point of view, I found the many interludes juxtaposed between the primary chapters of the book more distracting than informative, particularly the ones written in stream-of-consciousness form. If the reason for including these \\"extraneous\\" interludes is to provide background information to complement the \\"Joad\\" chapters, then, in my opinion, Steinbeck should have adhered to a more documentary form in these sections, doing the research to develop the interludes into a more substantive and factual picture of the historical setting, condition of American society during the Great Depression years, and ironies of California as a land of boundless opportunity."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"California, 1939: \\"The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed to keep up the price . . . oranges dumped . . . The people come for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges . . .\\"\\"There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificates--died of malnutrition--because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.\\"This is a brilliant and penetrating engagement of America's and California's cultural history, that will remain an important work as long as humans are willing to examine what it is to be human.Seventy years later, it is too easy for comfortable Americans to believe that Steinbeck's earthy and troubled scenes of people struggling to live are now removed from our present concerns. Displaced migrants for whom dignity or health is beyond reach, desperate to find enough work to feed their familial children, aged, sick and dying, being beaten and shot and driven from impoverished tent camps--we are _not_ seventy years removed. Present realities are actually worse. Trickle-down economics' trickles stay closer to the wealthy than ever before. 2.7 billion people live on less than $2/day. 1.1 billion live on less than $1/day. These are 2001's numbers, and it's not gotten better. The economic causes are global, and the people spraying kerosene on the systemic waste of food (borrowing from Steinbeck's account above), are America's largest agricultural conglomerations subsidized by comfortably disinterested Americans. US farm subsidies, instituted during the depression years to support America's family farms, are now flowing into megacorporations, providing permission, power, and position to adjust food prices to their advantage. The lion's share of today's agricultural subsidies is really taxpayer funded \`corporate welfare.' Don't expect your legislative representative to admit to this anytime soon, let alone try to grapple with it. And the reach is global. The would-be small family farmer in sub-Saharan Africa has no hope of competing with giant US food producers, brokers, and market fixers. Without any real hope for a domestic agricultural sector (excepting crops that can profitably be shipped to wealthier nations), these cultures have no light at the end of the tunnel. The tunnel has collapsed.No, expect instead that your representative is busy making sure you can buy more assault weapons, and more armor piercing ammunition too. Perhaps chumming with lobbyists for the afore mentioned market-fixers, or piously blustering about someone else's sexuality. Expect also for this representative to tell us what a benevolent people we noble Americans are. He may even interject some lovely sounding numbers in this regard. Question these numbers honestly. What percentage of a given program is for the salaries of American \`consultants'? What percentage of our GNP is this generosity as compared to the percent GNP contributions of the other nations of the wealthy west? Are wealthy and/or complacent Americans the people \`spraying kerosene' on the food that could feed the hungry? This is a very expansive issue, and perhaps I digress just a bit.Steinbeck was a wonderful writer, subversive in the eyes of the cultural status quo. We need another Steinbeck, of sorts. We could use many of them. This same basic storyline is painfully intimate in the lives of hundreds of millions today, but the scale is much larger and the distance and differentiation between the malnourished migrant and the wealthy lords of lands and foods has grown dramatically.\\"Tom stepped clear of the ditch and wiped the sweat out of his eyes. \\"You hear what that paper said \`bout agitators up north a Bakersfiel'?\\"\\"Sure,\\" said Wilkie. \\"They do that all a time.\\"\\"Well, I was there.

I read it over the span of about 3 days and can't say enough great things about it.Steinbeck's tale is still frighteningly relevant today, a time where they'll slash the jobs of thousands of factory workers so that top executives can get raises. The scorn and contempt that average citizens express for the \\"Okies\\" in this story is eerily reminiscent of the attitudes that many of today's more fortunate people have toward those who are forced to collect unemployment for years on end, or else settle for minimum-wage jobs that don't even come close to supporting a family.I'm so impressed by this book that I'm going to get my hands on as much Steinbeck work as possible."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The product received was exactly as described by the seller.

He has a definite talent to tell a story and when you read the effort he went through to write this book, you learn to appreciate it even more, not that you won't appreciate it otherwise, but it's always nice to know the background of a certain book. The story he is telling probably happened more than a hundred times, that's why it is so powerful, because we know that it is true. That's what makes it a true American tragedy.The chapters in which he gives us the Joad's story are really compelling and interesting. But what really makes this book stand out above other is the even more powerful chapters where he tells the story without giving any names just for us to know that the Joads are not the only one in the samew situation.Even if this book is very long (600 pages or so), it is still very interesting with no straining and lowpoints. The constant switching between the3 two types of chapters helps build a unique rhythm.Definetely a two thumbs up."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"For whatever reason, I started this book several years ago and did not finish it.

He read slowly and had far better voices than my own mind conjured up. After that, I read some chapters at a much slower pace, and what a difference that made. So, that is all I want to add to what others may have written.

This powerful novel vividly portrays a universal crisis of humankind, a crisis that remains as destructive today as when Steinbeck undertook to illuminate it for all those who dared to read. Massive disparity of wealth in a society is far more than an economic conundrum. It has the power to destroy self-images, families, and lives. It has the power to confuse honest laborers, to rouse them to helpless anger, and finally to sink them into abyssal despair.Industrialization drives sharecropper families from the land that they have tilled, harvested, bled upon, dropped sweat into, and been buried in for generations. Severed from the anchor they have always known, the families become wanderers, searching for a way and a place to survive. They become the \\"have nots\\" of American society, feared and shunned by the \\"haves.\\" Soulless land companies, banks, and agricultural industries are great, faceless controlling forces that exploit the landless and then drive them elsewhere. How do ignorant sharecroppers fight such exploitation? Mortals might as well take up arms against a malevolent deity. The totality of despair created by such an economic system can hardly be imagined by one who has not experienced it.Is there no way out? Steinbeck suggests that there is perhaps one hope. If the migrant poor will only stick together, cooperate and support one another in solidarity, create a union of workers, then the impersonal corporate giants must listen. If two hundred men speak as one, the voice becomes loud enough to demand fair and humane treatment. Easier said than done, especially when those who would speak of this aloud are jailed, beaten, and murdered by the giants' \\"hired guns.\\"This discussion suggests the essential difference between GRAPES OF WRATH and Steinbeck's other novels. The others paint struggles of mankind against the background of an amoral universe in which irony often distorts the outcome. This one paints struggles of the \\"common man\\" against profit-and-loss ledgers of the agricultural industry. It is brutal in its portrayal of how the \\"system\\" methodically destroys families, and it is equally brutal in its portrayal of the fear engendered in economically comfortable men by the influx of those who are in need. In the inevitable confrontation that follows, the veneer of civilization is replaced by stereotyping, then by hatred of the stereotype, and finally by repression of Americans by Americans.Yet, Steinbeck allows us to hope. After Casy, the canny former preacher who finds courage to lead a strike against inhumane treatment of workers, lies in the mud with his skull crushed, Tom Joad leaves his crumbling family, vowing to follow Casy's vision. Casy and Tom are our \\"Joe Hills\\":\\"The copper bosses killed you, Joe;They shot you, Joe\\" says I.\\"Takes more than guns to kill a man,\\"Says Joe, \\"I didn't die\\"Says Joe, \\"I didn't die\\"And standing there as big as lifeAnd smiling with his eyes,Says Joe, \\"What they can never killwent on to organize,went on to organize.\\"From San Diego up to Maine,in every mine and mill,where workingmen defend their rights,It's there you'll find Joe Hill,It's there you'll find Joe Hill!Now, who should read GRAPES OF WRATH? Is anyone concerned with the plight of the common workingman or woman? Is anyone concerned about the effects of industrial globalization? Is anyone concerned about the final impact of the \\"Wal-Martization\\" of America? Is anyone concerned when fertile fields lie fallow or, perhaps worse yet, are converted to barren asphalt-covered flats? If anyone cares, read the novel. If one is financially secure and therefore does not care about such things, then he especially should read the novel, for then maybe, just maybe, he will begin to care."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I recently had to read this novel for highschool, and it's one of the best books I've read. It's a pretty simple book with easy to understand symbols and themes, but it is written perfectly...the general layout of the plot, the inter-chapters' poetic style, and the finely crafted characters all set this book above others. The writing is just so tightly knit that I was in awe at how the book was put together. It's just perfect and everyone should read it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is an important book, I think, in the history of the American novel. It tackles firsthand the transience of American life, and the changing roles of labor, government and faith in the twentieth century. By all means, read this book.However, I don't think this is really as great a novel as its reputation alleges it to be. I had read someplace that Steinbeck wrote this in 100 days, and I believe that might be true. The basic outline of a great novel is here-- the characters mesh together well, and the conflicts are clearly outlined. But it reads like a strong first draft. The structure of the novel is too simple and brief to justify its weighty conclusions. The characters never grow beyond types, which takes a lot of the political punch out of the book. Tom, in particular, never really develops enough as a character to make his eventual departure the powerful moment it should be.It's still a good book. But compared to Steinbeck's other novels, the characterization and plot structure just seem a bit flat. In the end, it's sort of a weepy prayer for communism amid some graphic yet empty scenes of American squalor.Historically, this novel is important. But for those who love the form, its impact might seem a bit hollow."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Whenever I revisit a classic I'm struck by how much more I get out of it now than I did when I was 24 or 19 or, God forbid, 15. Giving a book like the Grapes of Wrath to a 15 year old serves largely to put them off fine literature for the rest of their lives. The depth of understanding and compassion for the human condition as communicated by a book like this is simply unfathomable to those who haven't lived much life yet, but after you've gotten a healthy dose of living, it comes across like fine music to a trained ear.My heart doesn't bleed for the Joads today as it might have 25 years ago. Yes, it's grim and unfair, but it's no longer shocking or disturbing, and I can see now that Steinbeck didn't intend sensationalism to be the main point. What he's about is revealing the human dignity, the innate goodness and unbreakable pride of these people, and by extension the American people in general, something that still resonates today, especially with reference to the working classes. When the Joads and their kind decline government hand outs, requesting instead the simple opportunity to work hard and be rewarded commensurate with their labor (even if it means a grueling cross-country journey to a place they don't know) one can hear today's white working poors' exasperated disdain for government, insisting that they simply be allowed to keep more of their pay and not be held back in their efforts by nit-picking legalities and cultural trivialities that disapprove of their lifestyles.Sadly, most such people will never read the Grapes of Wrath. Worse yet, many liberal lawmakers won't read it again after high school and won't glean from it an essential understanding about the pride and perseverance of the American working class that could benefit them in cultivating this constituency. A book like the Grapes of Wrath should be required reading - for every American over 30."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a powerful indictment of the oppression endured by the migrant families of the American mid-west during the depression years of the 1930's. The mid-west had suffered severe drought. &quot;Dusters&quot; swept across the farmland, skimming off the topsoil, leaving behind a dustbowl, only a few sprigs of wheat surviving. The tenant farms were foreclosed and the families tractored off the land in a ruthless drive to maximise profit. Circe 250,000 migrants, &quot;refugees from the dust&quot;, pulled up stakes and headed west on route 66, the road of flight to California, golden land of dreams and opportunity, drawn by the picking work, harvesting oranges and peaches. The flowing in of rootless migrant workers centred on the San Joachin valley, California, and the huge farms there. The overwhelming glut of migrants flooding through the valley swamped the harvesting work available, driving down wages to peanuts level as they desperately scrabbled &quot;to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food&quot;.This is the destiny that fate held in store for the Joad family in &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. Forced off their farm, truck piled high with their belongings, the Joads set forth on a journey 2000 miles haul from Sallislaw in Oklahoma through the western desert states of Arizona and New Mexico and onto the San Joachin valley. The gut-wrenching story of the Joads heroic journey is interspersed with short &quot;relief&quot; chapters on aspects of their route 66 experience, the tricks of used-car salesmen or a snapshot of life in a truck-stop diner, to cite only a couple examples; other chapters function as social on, for example, the stomach turning practice of spraying mountains of oranges with kerosene or dumping potatoes in the river under armed guard to protect market prices, at a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants were literally starving. This structure enables Steinbeck at once to follow closely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road,the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment. Steinbeck's powerful voice shows the migrants during the hard times of the 1930's depression years, the hardship and oppression endured by thousands upon thousands of families like the Joads, will resonate for generations to come. It is a voice that packs alot to say!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I watch the movie whenever it is on TV, its one of my favorites from that era. This past spring, I decided to read the book, something I rarely do if I've already seen the movie. I can understand now why the movie, compared to the book, tried to put a more promising spin on the Joad's (and many Americans) situation at the time. After all, the future for the working class and the country as a whole,was very much in doubt circa 1930's America. I recently saw a documentary on the making of the movie and it mentioned how the famous speech from Ma Joad towards the end of the film,about how they are the -&quot;little people&quot; and how there's many more of them and they just keep a-coming and things will eventually work out- this dialogue was actually added by Daryl Zanuck to end the movie with some hope. The book offers none of that hope...I was shocked at just how unforgiving and relentless the book is in its outlook of despair and misery for the Joads and others like them. The final chapters truly are some of the most desperate and hopeless depictions of the American Dream gone bad that I have ever read. You can really appreciate the progress we have made over the past 60 years in assuring that the country doesn't undergo anything close to &quot;The Great Depression&quot; again(so far)...Even if you've seen this movie first, the book is well worth reading and is dramtically different in its scope and mood..Definitely one of the best of the 20th century."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"There is no denying John Steinbeck's brilliance. I feel that his best work is &quot;East of Eden&quot;, but &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a monumental work, probably the one that captures his political sensibilities and the times he wrote about better than any. &quot;Grapes&quot; has character development, pathos, irony and social commentary, all biting, poignant and loving at the same time. Its political message is Socialist. The problem with this is that it offers great misery, packaged in the plight of the Joad family and Okies headed to California during the Dust Bowl '30s, but it does not offer solutions. Business owners, capitalists, policemen and authority figures are fairly evenly displayed as unfeeling, selfish, sometimes racist, and mean.What Steinbeck chose not to do was to see the 1930s from their standpoint. The message would seem to indicate that he advocated that the government just handle all the Okies' problems, but this creates some problems. First, the FDR Administration did more in this regard than any previous government, or any since, possibly. With this in mind, then the question devolves into the conclusion that government intervention is not the answer.The question I kept asking was, Why do roadside business owners or cops or others barely struggling during terrible times owe something to these Okies? From the Christian standpoint, they do. But the Okies had no job skills. They offered little. They were not marketable. They were willing to work, but they could not do anything other than manual labor.It is easy to criticize them for coming to California where there were more people than jobs, but they apparently were coerced into it by misleading flyers advertising fruit waiting to be picked and jobs aplenty.In the light of historical retrospect, the unsaid message of this book at its time was that the people described would be &quot;saved&quot; if they lived in Communism. Those who flirted with Communism in America in the 1930s can be excused, considering the times. But Steinbeck was an educated man, and by the time he finished this book, the basic facts about Stalin's Russia were known. Russia was in shambles, millions had already been murdered, starved and imprisoned. It was hell on Earth. Steinbeck had to know, if not every gory detail, enough to establish the fact that Communism was utterly evil.This left him, it seems, between a rock and a hard place, which was the big problem for all the Communists and fellow travelers in the West. The Utopian ideal does not adhere to reality. In the end, &quot;Grapes&quot; describes misery and plays to guilt, a powerful strategy.What history tells us is that the &quot;answer&quot; to the Okies' predicament, while not perfect, while not timely, was in the end the fact that they lived in America, which to paraphrase Chuirchill is &quot;the worst country known to man with the exception of all other countries known to man.&quot;To live in America offered more hope and more chance of success to these people than all other Earthly possibility. Steinbeck does not portray that. He does not necessarily deserve to be excoriated for it; it would require perhaps more vision than he had in light of his publication and probable editorial time constraints. However, travel the California landscape today and one will find the children and grandchildren of these Okies, and they will mainly tell you stories of struggle that ended in various forms of happiness and success for the ancestors of the Okies.Despite any political differences, Steinbeck is a writer of such talent and inner greatness that it cannot be denied.STEVEN TRAVERSAUTHOR OF &quot;BARRY BONDS: BASEBALL'S SUPERMAN&quot;STWRITES@AOL.COM"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Sure, this novel is beautifully written, but the propaganda aspect of the work gets in the way pretty quickly. Every aspect of capitalism is condemned as evil by Steinbeck and the characters in the book are depicted as one of three types of people: A) The Victims, B) The Helpless Tools, C) The Evil Capitalists.The victims, such as the Joads, are portrayed as helpless one-trick ponies who, despite having some wonderful skills that could have made them some money, can't seem to adjust to the changing times and are either too dumb or too nostalgic to strike out on their own. They spend the entire novel drifting toward some sort of idiotic fantasy world that they're warned off of time and time again. Do they listen to the warnings? No. They continue stubbornly, in a way that isn't really explained by Steinbeck. Why exactly is it that the Joads don't believe the various characters telling them not to continue on to California? Who knows? Apparently, Steinbeck doesn't because he offers no explanation for -- or even acknowledgement of -- this.The Helpless Tools are those who serve the monsters, the corporations, which have grown uncontrollable by the men who created them. The tools do the bidding of the monstrous companies and, though they empathize with the Victims, they're helpless to resist the will of the companies -- the companies who eat profits and die without them.Then we encounter the Evil Capitalists. These are the evil men who actually dare to make a living for themselves by making a profit. Oh, stop! What are you!? The Devil!!?!? Good, God, man. Steinbeck would have fit right in at any of the recent 'Occupy' rallies anywhere in the world. Were he alive today, I'm sure he'd be giving some magnificent speech at the Democratic National Convention -- and hosted by Hugo Chavez soon after.Despite all of this though -- if you're a writer, this book is mandatory reading. There is so much masterful technique to learn from this book that you're only doing yourself a disservice by not reading it. You're literally limiting your potential because if you have the education and experience to appreciate it, this book is a gold mine of advanced technique.Pinch your nose at the politics and read this if you're a writer -- or else I'm giving you an automatic 'C'! :)"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"* * * * *The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is a great read. It's worth sticking with all 619 pages. With this book John Steinbeck discusses the Dust Bowl migration. It may seem as though this may be a boring topic for a book, but this novel is actually very interesting. Plus, it is a great read when studying about these hard times during history class. The book looks at the situation from two different angels. It first looks at the migration from the west to California from the eyes of the Joad family and then it looks at the situation from the eyes of any person who has lost everything and has to travel from the west to the east. The Grapes of Wrath touches on many different themes such as the suppression of man, and how man can pull together though hard times with wrath. Once you begin to read you really do get into it. I would have to recommend this book for teenagers on up. This is because there is some light language and I feel that a young adult would better be able to grasp all of the symbolism and meaning that this book encompasses."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is one of the most informational and interesting books I have ever read. It dates back to a time in which recent generations may not understand. The 1930's were a difficult time for a lot of people. The Joad family demonstrates the struggles of some of these people on their quest for life.The main character in this book is Tom Joad. He and his family leave their home in Oklahoma because they are pushed out by the banks and forced to move west. Their journey is like no other as they struggle to stay on the road and find money for food. Like the Joad's, thousands of other families are compelled to do the same. These families move in hopes to find a better life.The Grapes of Wrath is a one of a kind novel that widens a person's outlook on life. It shows the audacity and strength of families that have nothing to rely on, except each other. It demonstrates both sides of man; the cruelty and the love. John Steinbeck has filled this book with unforgettable characters that can only be seen through the eyes of the reader. The Grapes of Wrath is an outstanding book that brings to life the courage of mankind."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is the reason many people feel he is one of the best American authors of all time. This book is fantastic, there are no other ways around it. This is probably one of the best books he has put out in my opinion. The story is really good and it is really engrossing. The characters come to life and stay with you almost like old friends. He is such a good author that he describes the environment with such skill that you see everything. Once you start you will not want to stop."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Some books are better read, and some are better heard. The poetry of Steinbeck's Grapes of Wrath takes on even greater depth with the Okie dialect of Dylan Baker. This is probably the greatest American novel of the last century. Despite the condescending attitude of academics, this book lets us all in on our own history. Steinbeck doesn't tell us who we are, he shows us who we are by showing us what we have been. As Samuel Clemens dug up our essence in the disease of slavery, Steinbeck confronts us with the violence of our economic system. Also like Clemens, he shows how religion tends to compound injustices. But what makes this a truly great novel is that all this understanding of the world and how it works is communicated by the lives of characters so real and complex that they have become part of our personal history. We experience the depths of our own emotions and capacity to love. The final scene is perhaps the most powerful depiction of human love in all of literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I've always thought the best measure of art is how it moves someone emotionally. The Grapes of Wrath is a work of art that irradiates such movement.

It also has a VERY gripping ending. Highly recommended classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I've never known poverty. Every day I have had food, every night I have had shelter and all of my needs have always been fulfilled. After 28 years on God's Earth, my understanding of poverty has now become clearer. Grapes of Wrath is timeless. When a 60 year-old novel can move a grown man to tears that is powerful. I won't spoil the ending, but I will simply say it is the most touching ending that I have ever read in a book, seen in a movie or heard in a song. I had to read the last page three times to really get the full effect. I have young children, this will be one of the first novels I will want them to read as teens. I think I would have been more compassionate and understanding in my teens and twenties if I had read this earlier. For years I have listed To Kill a Mockingbird as my favorite book. Hats off to Steinbeck, I've changed my mind and Grapes of Wrath is Simply the Best!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The first 16 pages of this novel really knows how to put a person to sleep. If you are in to analyzing characters in text to Biblical figures (aka Jesus Christ) then you'll like the preacher J. Casey. From their journey until they arrive in California is fairly accurate in giving you a description of what the life was like for these displaced farmers. You can see the developement of Ma Joad as she takes center stage in the family. As for the ending, it was rather odd how Rose of Sharon gave of herself after showing such selfishness and wistful dreaming. Overall, a very good piece of American Literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"well, i think there could not be enough said about how good the story is.

The story based on the worker migrations to california is beyond a doubt a classic novel that MUST be read... enough about the book...the audio book is excellently read by david baker who reads with great clarity and pronunciation. it is unabridged so the listener will get the whole thing as it is. i had read the book twice already and was well on my way during my third pass through when i ran into the idea of listening to this. i had high expectations of the book's content, but was wary about the readers interpretations being thrown upon the reader. baker does a good job of not throwing out too much of his own interpretations/feelings into the words as he speaks them {and when he does they coincide with my interpretations/feelings}.the unabridged audio book is well worth the price. only thing is that audio books cannot compare to actually reading the book for yourself. even with the audio book, i often went back to the book to reread certain parts, and i recommend that everyone pick up the book too and read it... but the book being around 2 inches thick, and if you do not have time sometimes for reading it, the audio book is a good alternative!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is John Steinbeck's classic novel about the Joad family of Oklahoma and their journey to California in search of a new life. The Joads are forced from their family farm due to the Dust Bowl crisis of the 1930s. Once their farm becomes unproductive, it is foreclosed on by the bank and the Joads are left homeless. Steinbeck's classic is a depressingly honest look at the poorest socioeconomic class of the Depression. As the Joads move West to California and then try to assimilate themselves into a land where their kind is unwelcome, Steinbeck often pauses to observe the larger picture of the desperate circumstances of life for the common American of that era. The Grapes of Wrath is a beautifully written novel about an ugly side of life. While it is heart-breakingly sad, readers will appreciate it as a classic because it is so vividly real. I think most will come away from this story with a deep appreciation of where the United States has come from."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"After being assigned a novel project in Language Arts, I decided to read The Grapes of Wrath. This book is about a family, the Joads. They get kicked off their land and set out to California to look for a job. During this book you follow the Joads journey to California. They have to go through many obstacles on their way to California. As you read this book you will learn about the things that they have to go through. They have determination, and are very brave people. This book was a good book but sad because of all the thing that the Joads had to go through, and how hard that it would have been to live back then in the Great Depression. If you are looking for a good book to read about the past I recommend The Grapes of Wrath."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Amid the desperation of the 1930s Dust Bowl, drought and changing agricultural practices force a family of Oklahoma sharecroppers to leave their home and join the great migration to California. Piling their broken-down Hudson with the few possessions they can carry, the Joad family sets off for what they believe will be a paradise of bountiful fruit and plentiful work. When they arrive, enduring one hardship after another along the way, the California they find is not at all the one they imagined.Though a work of fiction, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a painfully real story of what can happen when profit is placed over concern for one's fellow human beings. Like the Mexican migrant workers of today, the Joads flee desperate circumstances in search of a better future, only to find exploitation at the hands of wealthy farm owners and resentment on the part of the people already settled there. Enticed by handbills telling of the need for workers, the Joads discover that the farm owners are merely flooding the market so the starved migrants will fight for the lowest wages. There are constant attempts to keep the migrants in a state of helpless docility: their cardboard Hoovervilles are periodically burned (under the guise of \\"public sanitation\\") to keep them from settling down, and any attempt to assert their rights can result in being blacklisted as a \\"Communist.\\" Meanwhile, they watch with simmering anger as perfectly good fruit is thrown away in order to keep prices up. The locals have little but fearful hostility for the people they derogatorily label \\"Okies,\\" whom they view as less than human.Despite their unending hardships, the Joad family pushes on with dogged perseverance, never losing their dignity. Even when the reader is tempted to lose hope, the Joads find the strength within themselves to push on.One of the strengths of the novel is its characters, who are simultaneously flawed and admirable. The protagonist, Tom, is on parole after unintentionally killing a man in a fight. He can only make the journey by breaking his parole and must not be discovered, which creates an undercurrent of tension. When Pa's status as the head of the family is weakened by his inability to support the clan, Ma emerges as the family's indestructible backbone and one of the strongest characters. Along for the journey is Reverend Casy, the reluctant preacher and a kind of Christ figure, whose philosophical ruminations provide much of the book's social commentary.It is ultimately the pregnant young Rose of Sharon who most embodies the story of loss, resilience, and renewal. Throughout the novel, she is an immature and emotionally fragile girl who seems defeated by the dashing of her dreams: her teenage husband, Connie, runs away, and her baby will be born into unbearable poverty. However, at the end she shows a tender heroism, and her actions in the book's final scene are powerful and unforgettable.This is a deeply moving book. You will grieve for the Joad family's tragedies, all the more because these tragedies are largely the result of human folly and greed. But you will also dream along with them, and find hope in their resilience and will to survive."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As a former resident of California, I was often shocked on how the locals treated the Mexicans. After working all day, some were paid virtually nothing, and some were actually paid nothing. And because they couldn't complain to the government they were just \\"out of luck.\\" This book addresses that very issue, if only dealing with the white \\"oakies.\\" The point of this novel makes about migrant workers is just as valid today as it was 80 whatever years ago.Steinbecks writing is occasionally criticized, but I cannot figure out why. Steinbeck takes a quasi-journalistic approach to his writing, flawlessly fusing fiction and reporting throughout the writing. This is a book that is simultaneously interesting and informative. Its like a newspaper thats also entertaining. The writing is very fluid, and despite the novels length (my edition was over 600 pgs) its actually not a boring, slow read. The characters are well developed and interesting, if in some cases a tad unbelievable.A great novel.

Both gave me a rare view into a time in America that I knew little about. Published in 1939, the Grapes of Wrath is about the brutal and sad time people had to live... shall we say struggle through... and for the lucky some... survive during those days.I learned that back then people entered into agricultural agreements where they did not own the land but were allowed by the owners to use the land in return for a share of the crop produced, and as times got really bad because of the lack of water, the \\"dust\\" storms and the inability to produce, they could no longer afford to pay the agreed share and were therefore, run from their land... even though they had worked it for over 70 years seeing many family generations come and go on the land which they called home...How incredibly sad... simply horrible... The story centers on a family with the last name of Joads and it is so hopeless at times that I felt the pain and sorrow of these characters daring to hope for a better life.Desperate times, children left without food and without care because parents earned miserable wages and had to go to find whatever work was available. Labor contracts were not respected, conditions were oppressive, and the spark of an attempt to correct the situation was seen as a crime and punished as such.The emotions are deep and while the family undergoes many trials and desperate moments, they continue to have pride, human dignity, and the willingness to share whatever little they had. The road trip that takes them from their home in Oklahoma to California is at times exasperating because we suffer right along with these characters. The scenes at a road side diner where they buy bread... only able to pay for a 10 cent loaf is heart rendering and it is with a certain sense of trepidation that we realize that times in America today are again desperate for many. Never learning the great lessons from the past, we seem to repeat history over and over again, and between the housing market fiasco, the home foreclosures and the price of gas, let's hope we do not see Americans brought to another period of depression.This is a must read and must see, while it is depressive, at times shocking, it poses fundamental questions of humanity. How can we live our lives in peace witnessing those who have so much and yet others not being able to eat? How do we ensure that our social systems protect our people from ever having to endure such harsh living conditions? At what point do we stop being human if we stand by and do nothing to change and bring opportunity and the right to work and earn a living to every person willing to work to make a living?"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book will make you look around with open eyes. I highly recommend reading this book, even if you hated it in high school. A person cannot appreciate hardship if you are a young adult that has everything you need, and a lot of times whatever you want.

The Grapes of Wrath will change your way of thinking about what is truly important in life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"For the last few years I've been on a quest to read the one hundred greatest books ever written. Unfortunately I've discovered that there doesn't seem to be any consensus as to which books deserve to be on that list. Out of the three lists I've come upon only two books were even listed more than once (\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", and \\"Of Mice and Men\\" both by John Steinbeck), so I've been forced to read as many books as possible from all of the lists to try and compose my own.Based on the listings I suspected the \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" was going to be a special book so I wanted to own the hardback copy of it, but since it has been out of print for so long I finally broke down and just bought the paperback. Let me just say that this is one of the best novels ever written and certainly will make my final listing. It definitely was deserving of the Nobel prize it received.Written in 1939 this book captures the story of the Joad family during the Great Depression when thousands of families left their farms in Oklahoma and moved out to California to try to improve their fortunes, only to find sorrow and death waiting for them there.The story opens with Tom Joad being released from prison on parole for a charge of murder he committed in self defense. He returns home after being away for several years only to find his family packing up and moving away. The crops hadn't been good for several seasons and the banks were foreclosing on the loans. Small farmers were being squeezed out by the big corporations and people were forced to try to find a different profession.When handbills arrive declaring that there was plenty of work out in California picking crops the people took it as a sign of hope. They sold most of their possessions, packed whatever was left up in a broken down truck and headed west on route 66.The Joad Family consisting of fourteen people and friends plus one dog, along with all of their belongings set out for the trip in just one truck that they bought from a very charismatic salesman and had customized. (I'm sorry but this was one of the few things in the story I had a problem with, since I just couldn't picture it. I'm one of seven kids and the nine of us could never fit in a station wagon. How did fourteen people and a dog fit in one truck with all of our belongings?) There was Mr. and Mrs. Joad, Grandma and Grandpa Joad, Uncle John, Casy the former preacher, the boys Noah, Tom, Al, and little Winfield, and then there was the daughter Rosasharon (Rose of Sharon) who was pregnant along with her husband Connie, Rosasharon's younger sister Ruthie, plus the dog...While home on the farm when there was work Mr. Joad and the men ran the family, but when they got out on the road without any work Mr. Joad became a lost without his purpose in life, and Mrs. Joad had to take over as the head of the family. She made all of the tough decisions on the road and showed her strength to keep everyone going. Uncle John is a dark soul who had never forgiven himself for not being able to do more for his wife when she got sick and died. He fluctuates in the novel between being a drunk and someone who gives away all of his possessions to the kids to try to make it up to the world. The oldest son Noah I believe is mentally challenged due to a birthing accident and is kind of lost with all of the changes. Tom who is the next oldest son represents justice and truth throughout the novel. Al is a tomcat who's always out looking for girls, but wants to settle down some day and be a mechanic. Rosasharon and Connie are a young couple who dream of owning their own home with a white picket fence and raising a family. Casy used to be a preacher but lost his belief in God. Out in California he discovers a new calling. The kids Winfield and Ruthie I believe just represent innocence.Along the road they live day to day, dollar to dollar with the belief that all they need to do is get to California and they would find salvation. They meet many adversities along the road which they struggle to overcome. By working together and making some new friends they manage to survive. The whole country seems to be moving and change is in the air. Route 66 is perfectly described, from the truck stop restaurants, to the broken down gas stations, we are shown different levels of haves and have nots. The Joads do a little better job than some in maintaining their moral standards and beliefs but they see the road take it's toll on the people.After many tragedies and tribulations they finally arrive in California only to find that they were mislead. California may be beautiful and the land fertile but it is all owned by greedy men, who don't want to share any of their wealth.A great number of people have been lured out west in order to produce a cheap labor force to pick crops. With thousands of people fighting for just a few jobs they would accept lower wages just to keep from starving. The people tried to turn to the government for help only to find more greed and corruption. The government would only grant assistance to people who had been in the state for more than a year and the police were all either related to or paid off by the wealthy land owners who wanted to maintain the cheap labor force, so they kept the people moving so they couldn't obtain any lasting residency.People were living in make shift homes on the edge of town called Hoovervilles (after Herbert Hoover, president 1929-1933), until the cops came and forced them out.Even in desperation the people still tried to ban together to create their own rules and maintain their basic morals for what was acceptable, but they were being plagued on at every turn. They still acted as men, but you could see their tolerance reach critical levels.Each chapter you could feel the tension rising as the people were beaten down and mistreated. It was hard to believe the level of cruelty. The rich were afraid of the poor people and thought they were going to take everything they owned so they treated them as less than human and gave them nothing. The poor could only turn to other poor people for help since no one else seemed to care. Throughout the book as the people reached a greater and greater level of desperation you wondered when they were going to break, but the human spirit seems to persevere.After all that transpires you are just amazed at the ability of these people to keep fighting and go on, and that gives you a little bit of hope.I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"An incredible tale of the aftermath of the Great Depression coupled with factory farming.Definitely in the top quarter of books I've read, my only complaint was in the ending - I'm not saying it should be different, it fits the story very well, but darn it I wanted to see a little more happiness in the end for a family that had struggled so.One of the top American novels ever."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The next time somebody asks me what the Great American Novel is, I'm pointing them right here.

Guess what! It does more than live up to it - it surpassed my wildest expectations!!!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"Ya gotta eat...\\" Dad used uto say if we thanked him for taking to the local hamburger stand; he could have, just as easily, been stating the obvious theme of Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. One can easily imagine Tom Joad or, more to the point, his sister Rosasharon saying it in her \\"sharing\\" scene in the closing pages of the book. I read this book, the first time, in sophomore study hall just before lunch in small town Wisconsin; largely as a result of the wretched deprivations depicted in the book, I remember rushing home, sure I would starve to death if I didn't immediately ingest the bowl of soup and sandwich my mother had waiting for me. As the Joad family move out of Dustbowl Oklahoma toward the promised land of California, the Joads must survive on fried dough and unripe fruit (from which they are warned they may \\"get the skitters\\"); Along the way they meet tragedy and, in most cases, their dreams of a better life are smashed like last year's fallen fruit...And, yet, they still hope for the best. Maybe the next Hooverville will be different, maybe the next fruit ranch; if they could only make it there. Government offered little or no help. Long before the rest of the nation hit the skids, farmers were getting the short end of the stick; they never saw any of the prosperity of the 1920's, and the Dustbowl didn't help either. But Tom Joad sees hope in numbers, \\"Wherever a guy is hungry, I'll be there...\\", he says, urging the readers to come along, to fight injustice wherever they can: a challenge as urgent today as when Tom made it in this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"First introduced to John Steinbeck via \\"Grapes,\\" some thirty years ago, I've found myself a fan of his work ever since. This is no short read, but it is easy to follow and a great record of a period in American history when everything was falling to pieces.Basically the story of the Joad family as they migrate from the dust bowl in the thirties to California, it is intricate in its telling. The character development is especially rewarding and it would be impossible to read this great novel and not be moved by the extreme hardships that this family endured.There are only a handful of \\"great American novels,\\" and this is certainly at the top of the list. The only other Steinbeck that I enjoyed more was \\"East of Eden,\\" with its themes of family dysfunction and turn-of-the-century turmoil.Whether you're a fan of long novels or not, this is a must read book for anyone interested in great literature and seeking to know more about a period in American history that shaped our country.

I'm not qualified to review this book, but I'd like to make one observation. This masterpiece is the only book I've ever read that builds and builds until the very, very last word. Three words before the end I had no idea of the unutterable tenderness that followed. I will always remember how I felt at the moment I finished reading that last word. It was \\"Huh? No. Oh my God. That's it? Of course it is. I need a drink.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is a scathing look at the Dustbowl era, with its mass migration of displaced farmers out of the plains and towards the vague promise of the Californian coast. The chapters of the work alternate between long episodes detailing the journey of the Joad family from Oklahoma to California, and short sections written from a more abstract point-of-view, about characters un-named. Though the work is over six-hundred pages, it roars through your head as fast as any book can, with Steinbeck's fury over the plight of the migrants bursting from every page.I doubt anyone can read this work and not feel pity for the Joads, and the real men and women that Steinbeck drew these characters from. On the other hand, I felt that Steinbeck did not adequately explain the situation from the other side. It too often seems that the troubles of the migrants stem from the greed of some heartless monster, rather than a honest person who has troubles of their own. Sometimes, bad things happen and no one is to blame. Steinbeck seems to forget this.Overall, this is still a classic work of American literature, both for its beautiful prose and intensely important reminder of how things were not all that long ago, and how far we have come since."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Quite simply, The Grapes of Wrath is THE Great American Novel.This is the powerful story of the Joad family, &quot;Okies&quot; who are forced from their bank-foreclosed farm during the depression.John Steinbeck's writing is sheer literary art. There is beautiful description, incredibly realistic dialogue, and a compelling story that captures the heart and seeks out the very core of one's conscious. And the beauty of it is that it's thoroughly understandable. The eloquent writing and flawless story can be savored by anyone from a junior high school student to a PhD.The book is also innovative, intertwining short chapters that capture the plight of the dispossessed with longer chapters that follow the long road traveled by the Joad family to California. This is accomplished without at all disrupting the flow of the story.No wonder that this book won the Pulitzer Prize and was the key work cited for Mr. Steinbeck's Nobel Prize.It's a mighty piece of literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is one of the few works of fiction that is truly heart-wretching, that is capable of bringing people to tears. Not only that, but although it is a work of fiction, it is a truly believeable story, and not only COULD it happen, but it DID, many times over. Many families went along a similar route to the Joads during the depression and the Dust Bowl. That is why this book leaves such a profound impact on people, it tells us a little bit more about ourselves than we maybe want to know.Being from Oklahoma, this story really hit home for me. There is a part where the Joads are trying to head North, away from Hooverville, and they are stopped, the policeman tells Tom &quot;We don't want you goddamn Okies here&quot;. Tom wants to hit the man with a jack, but Ma won't let him, and he, stone cold Tom Joad, cries. This is a moving scene, and there are many such ones in the book. This is highly reccommended.Also, DO NOT READ THE EDITORIAL REVIEW AT THE TOP OF THIS PAGE OR THE INTRO AT THE FRONT OF THE BOOK IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY, THEY GIVE AWAY THE ENDING, AND A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TOO!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book is as wonderful to read now as it was when I stumbled across it some 20 odd years ago.If you want to experience what Wilco, Woodie Guthrie, Pete Seeger and others were singing about, this book will bring it all to life through Steinbeck's timeless words. Steinbeck makes the life of migrant farm workers come alive for us, while revealing the prejudices they were up against in the 30's.Sadly, it is timely because it seems to be part of human nature to separate ourselves from those who are in need. If we can convince ourselves that our own wants, needs, desires are different, or that we are more deserving, we can rest assured that nothing bad will come our way.A thick juicy book, with every word necessary and perfectly placed."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I must have read Steinbeck's &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; a half dozen times since I first picked it up as a high school student. The story of the ongoing hope and determination of the displaced migrants, pitted against the disdainful land-owners, highlights a 20th century conflict between traditional values of inherent virtue and the interests of business, economic efficiency, and the profit-seeking wealthy. The first few times I read this story, I saw only a tract that promotes centralized state authority and socialist constructs as a solution to injustice and poverty, as also appears in Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;. In my later years, however, I have seen Steinbeck's prophecy against the hypocrisy of those who would call themselves &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;righteous&quot;, then ignore the essential tenets of their faith to serve their own interests, the minute they've left church on Sunday. The book continues to speak to our own age, when the well-to-do in the &quot;winner-take-all&quot; competition of the modern marketplace find it all too convenient to neglect the poor that remain. Although history has since proven the value of a free-market economy, its &quot;winners&quot; are just as human as its &quot;losers&quot;, and cannot in good conscience brush them aside, discounting them as products of their own failings."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Oddly, I first read John Steinbeck's classic tale of the 1930's depression, Grapes of Wrath, as a result of listening to Woody Guthrie's also classic Dustbowl Ballads. In that album Woody sings/narrates the trials and tribulations of the Joad family as they get the hell out of drought-stricken Oklahoma and headed for the land of milk and honey in California. After listening to that rendition I wanted to get the full story and Steinbeck did not fail me. His tightly-woven story stands as a very strong exposition of the plight of rural America as they tried to make sense of a vengeful God, unrelenting Nature and the down-side of the American dream. For those who have seem Walker Evans's and other photographers pictures of the Okies, Arkies, etc. of the period this is the story behind those forlorn, if stoic, faces.The story line is actually very simple. The land in Oklahoma was played out, the banks nevertheless were pressing for payment or threatening foreclosure and for the Joads, as for others, time had run out. In classic American tradition they pulled up stakes and headed west to get a new start. With great hopes and no few illusions they set out as a family for the sunny and plentiful California of their dreams. Their struggle along the way is a modern day version of the struggles of the old Westward heading wagon trains-including the causalities. But, that is not the least of it. Apparently they had not read Frederick Jackson Turner's thesis that the frontier was gone- the land was taken. The bulk of the story centers of what happened when they get to the golden land-and it is not pretty. Day labor, work camps, strike action, murder, and mayhem-you know, California, the real California of the day. Not the Chamber of Commerce version. In short, as Woody sang, no hope if you aint got the do re mi.Grapes of Wrath was made into a starkly beautiful film starring a young Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. On a day when you are not depressed it is a film you want to see, if only for the photography. So here is the list. Listen to Woody sing the tale. Watch Henry Fonda to act it out. And by all means read Steinbeck. He had an ear for the 1930's struggle of the Okies and their ilk as they hit California. What happened to those people later and their influence on California culture and those who didn't make it are chronicled by others like Howard Fast and Nelson Algren. But for this period your man is Steinbeck."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"You have to read this book. It has been one of my favorites for the last 10 years and I often re-read it.While the Joad's story is definitely moving, I think the best parts of the book come from the narratives between the Joads story.Most people look at this book as a history of the Great Depression and how it affected the Dust Bowl in the 1930's in terms of the Joad family. I hope that people can remove themselves from the Joad story long enough to realize that Steinbeck's narratives exemplify the history of EVERY CLASS STRUGGLE THAT HAS EVER BEEN.Anyone who has ever studied revolutionist theory, be it the American Revolution, Civil Rights, Women's Right's, Gay rights, etc. cannot NOT appreciate the insights that John Steinbeck gives in the alternate chapters. It is unfortunate that most people won't bother to read this book because,a. it's a classic, and classic means \\"boring\\" andb. it may be about a group of people that are not at all interesting to them.As an Black-American, I see the looks of people when I say this is one of my favorite books (along with \\"Great Expectations\\" but that is just because Estella is a the kind of woman I admire), especially among other Black-Americans. I mean, who cares, we have CURRENT struggles in our midst. But to not read this book would be a mistake. This book is very relevant to what we currently face. And with the current immigrant situation, I would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone illegally in American as well. This book is not about just the dust bowl in the late 1930's, it's about being strong in the face of adversity. It's about going when there is nothing left. It's about coming together for survival. It's about what causes change.Many people won't care about the Joads (although I don't know how you cannot - if Ma Joad doesn't remind you of the stereotypical strong black grandmother holding the family together - I don't know what does). But even if you don't, you can at least read the narrative chapters.Particular chapter favorites are:If you are not moved by the words in the above mentioned chapters, then you have never been on the other side of \\"the right\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"A thousand years from now this book book will be in the Bible, like Job. ...

However, it did bother me that there was an entire chapter dedicated to the trials and tribulations of a turtle. It made a good point, but it was so long. And how long can one go on about dust? I realize it's the dustbowl, but some of Steinbeck's descriptions are a bit excessive.

It is true that there are more safety nets now for people, though some in our country are trying to get rid of these. As a result of the social legislation of the 1930's there is unemployment compensation, aid to dependent children, protection of an individual's assets in banks that fail. Why would our legislators want to allow these to disappear to save a few bucks when they continue to rent public lands for exploration to huge pick companies @$5.00 an acre, same with mining rights to mining companies, depriving the US government from receiving justified revenue, no royalty rights???"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" well over twenty years ago, in my first year of college.

Steinbeck's style makes it feel natural to read though this large book that initially scares off many readers. While many people shy away from the classics, they are part of our common culture. Reading The Grapes of Wrath will help you understand your culture at a deeper level."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"It's been about 10 years since I read this book.

I believe this book has changed something inside me I just cannot explain right now. The wounds are too fresh. I could almost feel this book move in my hands as I held it and read it. Please, ignore the political rhetoric surrounding this book by critics who see the book as socialist propoganda. I ask you as you read it to put yourself in their shoes! What would you do, and how would you react?I can honestly say I am of no political persuasion so it was easy for me to relate to the Joads' frustrations of identity. Although we have it better these days, these days are not looking bright. It would benefit anyone with care and concern for each other to read this important novel (I think, the MOST important novel ever written).For some who could not find a plot, consider this: The only plot in life we are guaranteed is the one they lay our body in when we die. I believe if you look past all of the biased political criticisms about this wonderful book you will see Steinbeck only attempted to show survival during the Dustbowl era depended upon help from each other; and that is only just skimming the surface.

Having lost their land to creditors and pressed to vacate, the Joads watch helplessly as land held by their family for repeated generations is unceremoniously uprooted and industrialized. With little left to their name, the dispossessed Joads set off on a westward journey in search of a better life. On the road they are joined by many thousands making the same trek, and soon new connections and kinships are formed. Their journey consists of hardships, deprivations, and death, pushing the Joads to their outer limits of endurance. However formidable their journey to California was, their toughest challenges still lie in wait beyond the Mojave Desert...Brilliantly woven, John Steinbeck's novel is a must read. I found it both inspiring and depressing; capable of imposing both grief and hope simultaneously. The Joads tragic losses will have you mournful one moment, while the next will find you filled with a hope that their undying resilience inspires.READ THIS BOOK. You'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The second Steinbeck book that I've read as an adult, and probably one of the best books I've ever read. I had no idea California was so messed up until I read it. Unlike some modern readers who may complain about the alternating chapters, one dealing with plot and the other with seemingly irrelevant information, I thought that they added a lot to the book and gave it the feeling that there was more to it than just the story of one family.

The movie's also great, and I can't say that either one is better than the other."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"One of my favorite books is East of Eden, I also loved Of Mice & Men. I'd never read Grapes of Wrath for school, like most people, I figured it was about time. Having high hopes, I was a little disappointed. I did not like it nearly as the other Steinbeck's I'd read. But, still the overall work makes an amazing piece of history, fiction and memorable tale. Personally, I think it's highly relevent at this period in time with what our country is going through.Mainly, this book was a little tough to keep reading on, as the story didn't immediately grip me. I was about half way through before I really got into it. Before I really began to care about the characters and get where this novel was going or what it was trying to convey. Yet there were times when I'd just sit back and slowly read a page and take in the beauty of what was written.I did give it 4 stars because I think the writing, the story that it tells about the Oklahoma farmers & migrant farmers and the symbolism was phenominal! To me this book tells the story of our history, one that is important to tell and remember. There's a reason it won the Pulitzer."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck is a book that I really did enjoy. A couple of years ago I took the trip west that they talked about in the book. I went with my uncle who actually grew up on the pan handle in Oklahoma and took route 66 to California. A book that he suggested that I should read was The Grapes of Wrath. At first glance I did not want to just because of the size of the book. But I really wanted to see why he thought this book was so good. While reading the book I could really understand what the characters were going through. My uncle still has relatives in Oklahoma and we went to visit them on their farm. Comparing them to the characters in the book, I would say that the farming in that state has not gotten any better. My uncles' childhood home had fallen to the ground, and it just showed me how everyone really did just pack all that they had and left. John Steinbeck really emphasized the emotions that the Joad family went through. What kept me reading was wanting to know how the next leg of their journey would be and if I had been where Steinbeck was talking about. I felt like while the Joad family traveled through each state on their way to California I could relate to the same adventure. I remember going through Arizona and feeling the dry heat in the desert, or stopping at a Now that there are only pieces of route 66 left I could not get the whole affect of taking their trip, but I feel that I have taken a trip with the Joads now.

They face many hardships along the way and find the truth about California.The book might have been more interesting and enjoyable if it wasn't required. Although the book went off topic in a couple of chapters, the story got interesting towards the end. I admit it was a little dull at the start but then it captivated me by the middle of the story. The book teaches us that many issues from long ago still trouble us today and that everything that shines isn't gold. Steinbeck does an exceptional on describing the situations that many \\"oakies\\" or migrants from Oklahoma face on their fight for survival in the hostile land of California.The Grapes of Wrath may not be the best book ever but its not the worse.

He tended to be unpopular among his peer group because he became a champion of the poor working class. This novel is about migrant farm workers, in particular one family who are refugees from the Dust Bowl.The novel details the family's stuggle to survive under difficult conditions. High unemployment provides a surplus of labor which farm and orchard owners can exploit, paying them as little as possible, and gouging them further with high prices at the \\"company stores.\\" Attempts by workers to advance themselves were held down. The law is on the side of the landowners. It was an era when workers were easy to replace so little thought was given to their safety and welfare.This was an era that gave rise to labor unions, and open warfare between employers and unions. Accounts are available elsewhere of incidents such as the Everett Massacre.It should be noted that the author received the 1940 Pulitzer Prize in fiction for this novel. He later received the Nobel Prize in literature."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a powerful indictment of the oppression endured by the migrant families of the American mid-west during the depression years of the 1930's. The farming-belt of the mid-west had suffered severe drought. \\"Dusters\\" swept across the farmland, skimming off the topsoil, leaving behind a dustbowl, only a few sparse sprigs of wheat surviving. The tenant farms were foreclosed and the families forcibly tractored off the land in a ruthless drive to maximise profit margins. Circa 250,000 migrants, \\"refugees from the dust\\", pulled up stakes and headed west on route 66, the road of flight to California, the golden land of dreams and opportunity, drawn by the prospect of picking work, harvesting oranges and peaches. The influx of rootless migrant workers centred on the San Joachin valley, California, and the huge farms therein, drifting in search of work from squatter camps to government camps to shacks in tied labour camps charging excessive rents and inflated company-store prices. The overwhelming glut of migrants flooding through the valley swamped the harvesting work available, driving down wages to peanuts level as they desperately scrabbled \\"to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food\\".This is the destiny that fate held in store for the Joad family in \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\". Forced off their farm, truck piled high with their meagre belongings, the Joads set forth on an epic 2000 miles haul from Sallislaw in Oklahoma through the western desert states of Arizona and New Mexico and onto the San Joachin valley. The gut-wrenching story of the Joads heroic journey is interspersed with short \\"relief\\" chapters on peripheral aspects of their route 66 experience, the trickery of used-car salesmen or a snapshot of life in a truck-stop diner, to cite but two examples; other chapters function as social commentary on, for example, the stomach turning practice of spraying mountains of oranges with kerosene or dumping potatoes in the river under armed guard to protect market prices, at a time when hundreds of thousands of migrants were literally starving. This structure enables Steinbeck at once to follow closely the fortunes of the Joads and cast a wider eye over what is happening in society during the depression years.However, Steinbeck's narrative, in my view, is at its most powerful and compelling on the road, chronicling the Joads suffering and misfortune trucking along the endless narrow concrete miles to Bakersfield, California, revealing qualities of grit, guts and resilience in their desperate struggle for survival in the face of death, starvation, hostility, exploitation and harassment. The strength of the human spirit is witnessed in Ma Joad's struggle against the odds to hold the family together. Steinbeck's powerful story depicting the plight of the migrants during the hard times of the 1930's depression years, the hardship and oppression endured by thousands upon thousands of families like the Joads, will resonate for generations to come - a timeless classic that has inspired my belief in social justice."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read this book when I was 12 and I loved it! It's interesting to see how the people of the Great Depresion lived through things. John Steinbeck is a great author and I think he deserved the nobel prize. After reading this book of his, I'm also going to read 'Of Mice and Men' and 'East of Eden'. I'm sure they'll be as wonderful as 'The Grapes of Wrath'. This is probably my favorite Pulitzer, read it!!!!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath was written by John Steinbeck. It basically describes the tragedy of the Oklahoma sandstorms. The first section of the book is nothing more than a very detailed chapter, describing the sandstorms and the lives of the people living in Oklahoma at this period of time. Steinbeck does a great job at describing the miserable life of these people. I thought this was an essential part of the book because it set the mood of the book. It showed the reader, right away, what was going on in the world, and how horrible it was, before he gets into the characters of the story.During this horrible time, a family decides to leave Oklahoma like every other family was. They decide to travel to California in search for some fortune from the Gold Rush. Their trip is very long and harsh. They all travel across the country with a carriage and a couple of horses. They experience a lot of hardships on their journey. Close to the end of their trip a family member dies because of a disease in their foot. When the family finally gets to California they are expecting an easy life and they are expecting happiness but all they find is more poverty, like in Oklahoma. Nothing was different.This is the part of the book when I finally realized the family's pain. I finally started to feel really bad for them. This is a huge reason why I loved this book. Towards the end of the book I had serious feelings for the characters. It amazed me.The Grapes of Wrath doesn't have a very complex plot. It actually doesn't have much of a plot at all. It simply follows a family through a period of their life."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"My favorite book. Simple. I love this book. I was not someone who was forced to read it (although we did do Catcher in the Rye for English, and I loved it still) and all the can say is &quot;ThiZ book sux!11!1&quot; Steinbeck is a master storyteller. He is not a master of the language as say, Dickens, but that is why he is so brilliant. I feel like I'm right there with the Joads. I've read this book three times in a year, and I always love it. Steinbeck's writing is so simple, you feel like you are listening to your grandpa tell a story. His initial description of Grandpa is hilarious! I love how he changes back and forth between the Joads and the scenes of the other migrant farmers. Two scenes really stick out in my mind. The car dealer and the trucker diner. Steinbeck's style makes you feel like you're in the diner right next to Al.Steinbeck's characters are simple, static,and one dimensional, but this works for this book. They are simple people, and help Steinbecks universal message of oppression.If you want to start reading great books, start here."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I have always hated the so called 'classics' but then i started reading this and i just couldn't stop. I feel it is an amazing book. Even if you have no previous knowledge of the context or even any interest in the time period it is still brilliant in its portryal of humanity and the human will for survival. It is not simply a novel that was great it is a novel that is great and will continue to be great for a long time to come. The language is a bit hard to get into at first but after about the first chapter it becomes so much a part of the experience....i even found my self thinking and speaking using the language of the novel.

It's the story of Tom Joad, out of prison and finds that his family is moving because they will push their house over because they cant afford it. Tom meets a former preacher Jim Casy and finds his parents. They head over to California picking up the Wilsons. This book showed me the Depression better than any history book could. I like the message it sent. I lke the former preacher's message of we can only believe in each other. And of course you probably know the famous speech from Tom Joad (...I'll be there&quot;). It was great, I read it during winter break of 2001-2002 in a week. Not at all boring in my opinion."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Beyond the Depression-era stereotypes often presumed from Steinbeck's classic are the values stemming from the Everyman nature of Tom Joad's plight.What Tom Joad faced is what we face each day.Joad might be seen as just an Okie looking to make it another day beyond dust and grime. Instead, once the dust blows away, we have post-Depression Oklahoma, and WWII, and today.The struggle of Joad is not just his struggle in a hard time, but the same perseverence through adversity faced by Carl Sandburg's characters in his &quot;Chicago Poems,&quot; in Dicken's &quot;Bleak House&quot; and in Billy Joel's song, &quot;Allentown.&quot; Tough times are universal, no matter the environment.Complex situations wrought hard decisions by Joad and his family. In these contexts, things seemed complex and heart-breaking --- and they were -- but no less are our difficulties today. Hence, Steinbeck's book is transcendent of his time and culture, and worthy of reading today.Beautifully... deliciously written, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; will likely captivate you through each page.I fully recommend this book.Anthony Trendl"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I am reading this book for school and it is the only book I have ever read for school that didnt bore me to death.

This seminal work transcends the fictional construction of it's impoverished family, as they suffer the loss of their elders on the journey to the promised land of migrant laborers, only to find their hopes dashed in the dwindling labor markets, and mounting hatred of California's equally impoverished population. This is Steinbeck's greatest creation, and a telling piece of Americana which affirms the indomitable spirit of those who experienced the worst era in modern history."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"That THE GRAPES OF WRATH is a timeless classic is not news. It is one of those rare books that was recognized as genius from its initial publication and it has endured in popularity to this day. A staple of high school required reading lists, John Steinbeck's tale of displaced Okies hits the reader on so many levels that it bears repeated reading. The dialogue sparkles with depth and emotion.For those who are only familiar with THE GRAPES OF WRATH through the splendid movie with Henry Fonda, the book opens up even more vistas and provides a compelling view of Depression-era America. Through the eyes of Americans in a time of traumatic transition, John Steinbeck paints a lasting portrait of our culture and heritage."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a sobering account of the lives of a midwesterner family that takes place barely fifty years ago. What's even more sobering about it is that the general events in this story are true!Meet the Joad family --a hardworking Oklahomian family living happily on the farm they have lived on for years. *BAM* the Dust Bowl strikes and they are forced to sell their assets at a ridiculously low price and buy a cheap jalopy for a price twice as high as it should be. So this family does what most any families would have done if they were in this sort of situation: move to California, a place that promises great riches and prosperity. But when they get there, it quite the opposite (I don't want to give much away after this point).Really, everybody ought to read this classic. We must do everything we can to keep this part of American history from repeating itself.A great book on all accounts with great dialogue and a well-constructed storyline. A must read!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is one of the most enduring books i have ever read. The message Steinbeck was attempting to portray is just as relevant now as it was in the time the book was written.

I love the majority of his work.Also, I'm writing this review before I do research on this book. I have just finished reading it, so my opinion is fresh and mine only. It has not been influenced by what others think. I do plan on reading a great many summaries and opinions from great thinkers to try and find out why people generally think this is such a great book.I like Steinbecks ability to demonstrate the human spirit in this book. What I do not like about this book is that it starts off with bad things happening to folks and it just goes downhill for these folks all the way, getting worse off the whole time, till the end when they are as bad off as they can get. People dying left & right, thrown in jail, everyone who already lives in California are mean, pregnant woman can't get enough food, kids starve, no more work for three months, river floods, baby dies, etc. This is the most depressing book I think I've ever read. And where is the plot? There isn't one. This book could have been written in one chapter, but John drags us through this misery over and over again, round and round. This book is a statement, that's for sure. Maybe everyone thinks it's so great because it is a great statement. I do believe that later in John's life he regretted writing this book, or at least wished that he had written it differently. I have read online that this book is still banned in certain places of this country. That is wrong. I don't feel that way. I don't like the book, but I think anyone that wants to read it should be able to read it (I warn you it's depressing and a waste of time!) It's not the politics of this book that I don't like. To me, there were no surprises. None. Not like \\"Of Mice And Men\\" or \\"East Of Eden\\" or other fine books I've read by Steinbeck. Still, if your a Steinbeck fan, you must read this book. If you've read his bio you must read \\"Grapes Of Wrath\\" to understand why Californians hated him so much. In a way I feel I have to apologize for not liking this book. One friend of mine who is an avid reader told me he didn't really care for Steinbeck novels, but he loved \\"Grapes Of Wrath\\". Go figure."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The difficult lives of the Joad family during the Great Depression of the 1930's are very relevant to the America of today. The transition of the 1930's economy in the Midwest to mechanization is similar to the current transitional economy in the U.S., where we are moving from manufacturing to more of a tech base. We are moving away from what we know to something we don't know, and people are not sure what to do or what to make of it.I have loved the Steinbeck books I have read up to this point (Travels With Charley, Of Mice and Men, Tortilla Flat, and Cannery Row), but Grapes is much too one sided for me. In typical Steinbeck fashion he puts you right into the story, but he paints with much too broad a brush here. It is slanted, and does not give equal time to both sides. The bad is too bad and the good is too good. Steinbeck seems to leave out a basic understanding of economics, perhaps intentionally, and I'm afraid lots of people just swallow the anti-corporate message without thinking. Some think companies are an unending fountain of money. They are not. Education is the problem, as it was then and continues to be.The Grapes of Wrath brought to light many things that needed changing in the United States of the 1930's, and for that I give it credit. Illegal monopolies, unfair labor practices, corrupt local officials, etc. are all effectively criticized here by Steinbeck. The immigrating Joads, as legal U.S. citizens, have rights as citizens which should be protected.The character of Al, one of the Joad's sons, is a bright spot. Al is changing and embracing the future by learning to work on cars, even after the mechanization has forced the Joads out of their sharecropped farm. The Great Depression forced people to move and to change, developing new skills as the economy changed. Al's forward-thinking adaptation made me wonder if the government relief mentioned in the book simply enables people to sit right where they are when things change and simply cash a government check each month, draining society instead of adapting to the change and contributing to the new economy in a positive way. I am afraid this type of thinking so prevalent in modern society is teaching people to become dependent on the government (in exchange for votes) instead of going out and making their own opportunities.While reading The Grapes of Wrath I lost patience with Steinbeck's rhetoric in which corporations and the wealthy got that way by unjustly taking advantage of others. Even small businesses (restaurants, stores, gas stations, etc.) in the book are treated with contempt. Small businesses create jobs. Large corporations create jobs. Individuals who gamble their family's security and future by starting their own businesses create jobs. These are positive forces in the economy. The Government taking money away from these positive forces is a drain, which must be justified in one way or another.At times the Joad family is starving, but they balk at working for wages they deem are too low. You do what you have to do however, and the Joads end up working and eating. Companies don't get ahead by cheating people for very long, and The Grapes of Wrath effectively illustrates the labor abuses of that time. Reforms were made and things eventually got better for the workers as well as for the economy as a whole. It is how the Free Market works, for better or worse. The real challenge lies in dealing with the transitional economy and figuring out how to prosper in it. It is a cycle, and The Grapes of Wrath is timely today because we are in that same type of economic cycle in the U.S. right now. Rather than looking to The Grapes of Wrath for answers, however, maybe we should look to it instead to learn from our past mistakes."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"After reading this book I found my own life looking much better.

The dust bowl was brought on by poor planning by poorlyeducated individuals, as is demonstrated by this finely crafted novel which allows the reader to follow closely the lives of many members of the Joad family and their traveling companions without the emotional involvement obtained by many novelists. Steinbeck did this for a reason; he wanted us to come away from the story able to see &quot;the big picture&quot; and managed this by layering in observational chapters between chapters of the Joad's travels. The Used Car Salesmen interchapter is a real eyeful and the allegorical adventures of the Joads and Jim Casy will resonate in today's violent world of haves and have nots.

I found this story to be a page-turner and very absorbing. Excellent local color and superb character development. You know, I think today's younger generation could take a few lessons from this story - the stocism these people demonstrated throughout their ordeal was fascinating. The simply did what they had to do and only complained periodically (with exception of Rosasharn - who bitched and whined all the time). This is also a great review of a bleak period in American history.My advice to people who haven't read it is: by all means, read it, learn something about history and the human spirit.Now for the oddities:1. Maybe this was symbolic and I just glossed over it, but several times in the book, drivers (including the protagonists) are squashing with their vehicles animals who have the misfortune of using or crossing the road they use. Well, that was kind of strange I thought.2. Why Connie left Rosasharn is sort of a mystery. She was pregnant for crying out loud. Was her constant carping about her wanting a house and nice things just driving him bug-s---?3. Noah left and was never heard from again. I suppose you could argue that this was symbolic of a family disintegrating and how they dealt with it.4. Now the really odd thing. It ended at a weird spot. Not much closure.

They ruefully discover that this is a false promise to induce hundreds of thousands to travel west so that the owners won't have to pay the workers a decent wage. The journey is analogous to the Hebrews slaves escape from Egyptian captivity as they sought out the Promised Land under the leadership of Moses in the bibilcal book of Exodus. Consider the affinities:1. 12 persons are in the Joad party as there were 12 tribes of Israel.2. The elderly grandparents grandpa and grandma Joad die before California is reached; similar to the death of Moses on Mount Horeb and the death of the exodus generation before Israel was settled.3. Water and the crossing of rivers is important in both Exodus and The Grapes of Wrath.The book has many memorable characters:Rose of Sharon-This Joad young woman is deserted by her husband Connie while she is pregnant. In the last unforgettable scene of the book she gives her breast filled with milk to a starving vagrant in a dank barn.Noah Joad is a mentally damaged Joad son who decides to stay by a river and fish instead of moving west with the family.Al Joad is the youngest Joad brother. He chases girls in all the camps the family stays in and keeps the beat up truck going down the road. As the novel ends he is engaged to be married to a fellow migrant girl of 16.The book abounds in minor characters which range from a determined turtle eager to reach his destination (much like the Joads are eager to reach the Golden State); slutty waitresses, burly truck drivers and fellow migrants suffering the slings and arrows of Depression era poverty. The language in The Grapes of Wrath is graphic, profane and based on the ungrammatical speech of poorly educated country people.The novel's title \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is taken from the second line of Julia Ward Howe's \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\" The book is a battle cry for justice to the poor migrants of the 1930's. \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is still a controversial novel since its publication in 1939. Interpretations and critical judgments vary. Read the book and decide for yourself! This is a great American classic every literate person should peruse. Outstanding in its gritty reality and compassion for the suffering multitudes!4. A dead baby is placed in a box and floats down a river in The Grapes of Wrath reminding one of Moses in the bullrushes.5. Natural disaster in The Grapes of Wrath are reminiscent of the plagues of Egypt in Exodus such as drought, floods and disease.There are other biblical resonances. Jim Casey (his initials are the same as Jesus Christ) is murdered by a mob for defending the poor and weak as Jesus was crucified on the cross. Tom Joad is a doubting Thomas figure and Uncle John with his insistence on sin reminds us of John the Baptist.The book is filled with memorable characters:Tom Joad-the prodigal son who murders a man in a fight and is sent to prison; later he will kill again in defense of Jim Casey. Tom was played with brilliance by Henry Fonda in the John Ford classic film \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\"Ma Joad is the matriarch of the family. Tough and sentimental she holds the family together.Rose of Sharon-Deserted by her husband Connie she is pregnant. In the last unforgettable scene of the book she will give her breast to a man who is starving and needs milk.Ruthie and her brother are children.Noah is a mentally deficient Joad who leaves the family to live by a river.Tom Joad Sr. is somewhat weak and defers to Ma Joad in family decisions.Al is the young hot pants brother of Tom and Noah who is a good driver and keeps the truck going which transports the family to California.There are many memorable minor characters; destitute families, waitresses at the diners on the road; animals such as the turtle who symbolizes the determination of the Joads to cross the road and move forward; dogs and the animals of the night. The book is also exquisite in its portrait of the American landscape in the hardscrabble years of the 1930s. Steinbeck is a genius at reproducing how poor Americans talked at this time. The language is ungrammatical and laced with profanity and folk wisdom.The best place the Joads were able to stay was the Weedpatch federal camp based on one Steinbeck visited. The novel takes its title from Julia Ward Howe's \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\" This book is a battle cry for justice for the poor and the need for Americans to work together to restore dignity and hope to the millions who were devastated by economic hard times.The Grapes of Wrath is a controversial novel with many interpretations being offered. Every American needs to read this book; decide for yourself and read this essential novel of the American experience by a great author!You will never forget \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Simply the greatest American novel ever written, which can only be rivaled by Nabokov's Lolita.Steinbeck captured the voice of the American people, in despair and in hope. A social commentary to be read again and again, as it is as relevant in its observations today, as when it was written, some 70 odd years ago."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"It seems to me that whenever I come across a review on this website titled \\"An honest student's review\\" or something along those lines, the sentances \\"This book was so boring\\",\\"I was forced to read it\\" and \\"I can't beleive this is considered a classic\\" always pop up, with \\"If I could give this zero stars I would\\" always present at the end of the review. I, however, although a student and \\"forced\\" to read this book, beleive this novel, by John Steinbeck, to be a true classic of American literature. There are many other reviews below that give a far more indepth plot summary, so I will keep that portion of the reveiw succinct. The Joad family, suffering from the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, strap as many of their possesions as they can to their car and head west to the purported paradise of California. However, they find their paradise to be little more than a dystopia, run by the few plutocrats who have managed to stay afloat in the depression by standing on the shoulders of those below them. Steinbeck is nothing short of a master here, splicing \\"intercalaries\\" of heartbreaking human suffering into the Joad's comparable tale of woe and misery. This juxtaposition shows the extent of which the poverty and despair has blighted half a nation of farmers.Anyone who wishes to truly understand the human condition, its depths and its misery, should read this book. However, it should be noted that anyone looking for an uplifting tale of human tenacity should perhaps look elsewhere, for this novel is unrelenting in its depiction of destruction and despair.If I could give it 10 stars I would"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"What a great novel...i wasn't much of a reader in high school, but now that i have a child, i thought it best to see what i missed. Boy, did I miss! If you have to pick one &quot;classic&quot; novel to read, this is a don't miss. Now I see why classics are called classics."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I got caught shoplifting makeup when I was thirteen. I waited for my mom to come to the store after security called her, imagining the anger she'd have in her face when she saw me and feeling shame, shame, shame. I didn't cry until she walked into the office and burst into tears, herself! Then I did, too. And on the way home, as I sobbed, she said things like, \\"I know, I know,\\" and \\"Shh...\\" Then she bought me a pineapple softserve ice cream cone at a drive-thru Mexican restaurant and took me home, where I laid in bed waiting for the sound of my dad's diesel engine and my impending doom.I thought of that while reading this book because Ma Joad, the strongest character I've met in a Steinbeck story, would tell her kids or her husband to hush when they started doubting themselves and their choices. She'd say something like, \\"Of course you did what you could! We all did. Everybody did what they could, so hush now, and peel these potatoes. Your pa and brothers need to eat!\\" Even her son who had killed somebody (in self-defense) was given a full pardon by Ma and told to just hush up about it! Of course you didn't put shame on the family! You did yer time, now hush!So, scrawny Ruthie Joad goes and tells a whopper of a family secret that changes things for everybody and puts an instant fear into the whole clan, including Ma, who gets wind of it from little Winfield. And Winfield says, hopefully, \\"Gonna whup her, Ma?\\" But no. She orders everyone to be quiet about it to Ruthie and not make her feel worse than she already does. When Ruthie shows up, she runs to her ma's middle and screams and cries into her belly. Ma knew, of course. Nobody can punish a person like him or herself. Just read the book and look at Uncle John, and you'll know it, too.Now, this book is not historical fiction--it's fiction from history. John Steinbeck wrote this book while all of the labor injustice was happening. Effigies of Steinbeck were burned all over California in protest over this revealing saga! He grew up in Salinas, well off, but idealistic. He spent his school vacations working in fields and on farms and listening, listening, listening to people's stories. He felt love and empathy for these people. He saw it as another Civil War for our country, but this time between the \\"haves\\" and the \\"have nots,\\" which is why he used a phrase from a Civil War ballad as his title.Books about injustice and upheaval make me feel so anxious because they make me look at myself. My students read books about Martin Luther King, Jr., or Rosa Parks, and they feel empowered. They say really lofty things about justice and rights and humanity and what was wrong, and what they would do. And I'm glad to hear them talk like that, but I get anxious during this sort of talk, too. I don't think I'd have been the one to stand up against anything. If I were there, I wouldn't have been picketing, facing violence! I'd have been hiding in my cabin, wishing everyone else would just go back to their cabins and work and stop causing trouble. People are likely to get their heads smashed in when they stand against power. And thank the Lord (Ma Joad's Lord, please, not Rosasharn's or Uncle John's) that there are people who will. Okay, enough about me and how I am no hero. It makes me feel squirmy.Though, maybe I'll find my cause. There was one thing that got to Ma Joad enough to shame her kids, and that was selfishness or self-pity. \\"It's not all about you, Rosasharn,\\" she says to her pregnant daughter. She tells her that if she were well and not with child, she'd give her a whop in the face for all that self-pity. She wanted her to understand that you can't be self-serving! You've got to give even when you've got nothing! And Rosasharn learned that lesson. I learned that she had in one of the most beautiful paragraphs I will ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I have mixed feelings on how to rate this book. The reality of it and the way it follows the depression are excellent. I give it a five on accuracy and detail. BUT.... I really believe it's only worth reading it if you don't mind horrible, depressing, sad endings. I was very dissapointed. I felt like I was reading a history book instead of a reading book because for me, a book I'm reading for fun, should at least have a satisfing, if not happy, ending. In history books anything bad can happen and in this case it did. The situation in the end was hopless."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I absolutely LOVE Steinbeck. I would consider him one of my five favorite authors. I think East of Eden is one of my favorite books of all time. I especially like Cannery Row and Tortilla Flat. I even liked The Wayward Bus.HOWEVER, having said that, I must say that I cannot handle The Grapes of Wrath. My tolerance for pain is not nearly high enough. I have to be honest - I've never actually read the entire book. It's much to difficult to read through the tears in my eyes. I am sure that it is, like most of his other novels, a well-written, fascinating account of the lives of some very interesting people. I simply cannot willingly subject myself to such abject despair. I read novels for enjoyment, and I don't enjoy the feeling of having my heart pulled apart piece by piece, page by page.Undoubtedly it is to Steinbeck's great credit that he is able to draw that kind of emotion out of a person through simple words on a page. Only one or two books have ever been able to move me in that way. Unfortunately, it is not a feeling I desire. Perhaps I'm overly sensitive. The book made me want to open up a vein, but apparently millions of people loved it..."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"In Steinbeck's novel \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", readers are introduced to the Joad family in their miserable living conditions in Oklahoma and their dreams of a new and better life in California. All thirteen Joads pack up in one old truck and begin their journey on Highway 66 to California along with thousands of other families looking for any work. Their trip take them through the loss of five of their passengers for various reasons, bullying from cops, threats of starvation and no money, and even the death of their dog. Yet, there is some sunshine as they meet up with another family halfway through who become their travel mates for a while. As the Joads enter California, they eventually find refuge at a government camp for migrant families looking for work. However, their luck is minimal as they know they can't stay and continue on, looking for better work and wages. This brings them to their last stop in the novel which isn't any better than the last few. Steinbeck leaves the readers almost wishing they hadn't even read the book, because there is no solitude for either the Joads or the readers.I gave this novel two stars, because it did not appeal to me. The story itself was depressing; it starts out sad, gets worse, and ends even more sad than it started. The bad plot doesn't make the novel any better, either. The book is literally just about a family riding in a car, looking for work. Another big factor was the writing style. I don't know if this novel is an example of all of Steinback's writing, but only half the novel was actually about the Joad family. The chapters alternated between the Joad family story and a story about migrants in general. This approach wasn't appealing. I found the book to have a very slow start, and once it started moving along, the chapters about the migrants just seemed to be in the way, prolonging the story for nothing. I wouldn't recommend this book, unless you're a fan of Steinbeck."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"i'm very happy with this product. it shipped super fast, the book is in great shape. now on to reading!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"No problems with the book - great story.My issue is with the description of the condition of my copy which was purchased as a used book - this was listed as \\"Very Good\\" condition - which to me means some minor creasing on the spine and maybe a couple of minor marks on the pages.

I read The Grapes of Wrath in 8th grade for &quot;fun&quot; and re-read it this year for summer reading (i'm 16) and wasn't too fond of the book either time. I'm probably going to be lumped into the category of &quot;all the high schoolers who read it for english and didn't like it because their generation has attention-span problems,&quot; but, frankly, that's not true. I've read and loved such wordy books as The Scarlet Letter, each of Umberto Eco's tomes (essays indcluded), The Great Political Theories (volumes one and two, no less), among others.The Grapes of Wrath, though, was just boring. It's sort of like an old-school Saving Private Ryan - let's beat into our readers'/watchers' heads the horrors of a terrible time in our history. What comes from this are preachy stories without base because, ultimately, we realize they are fictional. There was no Tom Joad or Private Ryan. The Depression existed, yes, but none of these characters did.Why should this make a difference? The story is fiction, after all, right? The difference is that Steinbeck, as in almost all of his mediocre books, tries to make us, through deathly boring descriptions and symbols, that his characters really existed. Oh well. I guess people are going to keep on reading this, so what I say here doesn't really matter. Read it once, and regret you ever did."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath may be to many people a triumph of American storytelling, but I found it to very stale and overwrought. This may be due solely to the fact that I do not enjoy Steinbeck's writing style, but I think it is also because he pushes the story to the limit, and in essence milks all of the entertaining qualities of his characters to death way before the story is over.While the Grapes of Wrath has several 'nuggets' of brilliance (my favorite one involving a Native American chief), they are so swamped in boring sub-plots and narratives that switch back and forth that the novel can hardly be considered a masterpiece. By the end of the 619 pages you hardly care what happens to the Joad family, just as long as the darn thing is over with.In short, while I hate to discourage those who think this book is a triumph of 'American perseverance', I have to say that if you really want to know about the Dust Bowl (which is actually a fascinating period in history) read a history book, not this novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This was of course, wonderful"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I'll give you good advice when deciding to buy this book : DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.

I finished the book two weeks ago and have not been able to stop talking or thinking about it. Read this book. It will truly change the way you view the world.The book is beautifully written. Steinbeck's style flows so smoothly and is so accessible. The book follows the Joad family for about nine months as they are driven from the place they've called home for generations and travel to California, only to find out that it is not the land of opportunity they expected. Steinbeck's formula here is to intersperse the lengthy chapters chronicling the Joads' journey with short chapters that encapsulate some nuance about the period or the people, giving you a picture of the greater struggle taking place, of which the Joads are just a small part. It creates a very powerful effect. This migration west involved hundreds of thousands of individuals. You see in a few pages the big picture, then you are pulled back into the intimacies of the Joads' lives and the tragedy is made very personal. In one especially startling example, Steinbeck puts these words into the mouth of a character after selling a nameless migrant and his family some gas for their car, \\"Well, you and me got sense. Them goddamn Okies got no sense and no feeling. They ain't human. A human being wouldn't live like they do. A human being couldn't stand it to be so dirty and miserable. They ain't a hell of a lot better than gorillas.\\" In the next chapter, the Joads make camp along a stream and Ma is so happy for the clean water and the chance to stay put for a day so that she can take a bath and wash the family's clothes. The Joads are good, honest, decent people looking for the means to earn an honest wage and thereby feed their family. The thought of charity repels them. At one point Pa talks about the prospect of picking cotton and is so excited about the fact that it's good, hard work, worthy of the wage he'll earn. How soft and incredibly privileged it makes us all seem. \\"They streamed over the mountains, hungry and restless - restless as ants, scurrying to find work to do - to lift, to push, to pull, to pick, to cut - anything, any burden to bear, for food.\\"I live in a citrus community in Florida, which is populated by a large number of migrant workers. It never occurred to me to wonder how they felt about their lives. I never thought to wonder if they had dreams of someday owning their own home and staying put for a while. I've read criticism that \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a communist manifesto. It may have socialist leanings, but how long can individuals or a society overlook the less fortunate without feeling some shame? Read this book. It should be mandatory, but would be wasted on most teenagers. Pick it up as an adult, as I did, and read it. You'll never again look at others or yourself in the same way."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I don't know how anyone could read this book and not give it a five star rating. The true test for me of a &quot;great book&quot; is one that stays with me -- one I can't stop thinking about long after I've finished. I read this book for the second time in my life a month ago (first time was in high school many years ago), and I'm still haunted by the suffering endured by the Joad family. The interesting thing is that Steinbeck wrote this book in 1939 at the height of the injustices being fraught upon the migrant workers in California. I'm sure it wasn't popular then as it brought to the forefront the corruption of some powerful people in America. It also spoke to the conscience of every American which eventually led to political reform in California. After reading this book, I did some research into Steinbeck's motivation and learned that he was haunted by the plight of California's migrant workers to the point of obsession. To fuel his anger, he would visit the migrant camps each day full of their dirt, disease and hungry people and then return home to write about those people responsible for these conditions -- people he considered to be murderers.Steinbeck concentrated on the circumstances of one family, The Joads, tenant farmers in Oklahoma until they were forced out by the larger companies who wanted their land back. With dreams of luscious grapes and peaches in abundance waiting to be picked, they loaded up their belongings and began their journey on Route 66 headed for Bakersfield, California. They began their trip with a bevy of colorful characters led by Ma and Pa Joad. It's amazing how much power Steinbeck gave to Ma Joad -- years before women had any right to a voice. Unfortunately, just as the Joads were heading out, so were thousands upon thousands of other families. This would ultimately lead to supply and demand. There would be too many workers for the few jobs available and, consequently, people would be agreeing to work for peanuts just to be able to feed their families.Steinbeck's writing is astounding as the unrest of the migrants builds to a crescendo and just as the dust has risen in Oklahoma, so will the voices of the poor migrant workers. Steinbeck says, &quot;In the eyes of the hungry, there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people, the grapes of wrath are growing heavy.&quot; It is just a matter of time before their wrath is unleashed and you can feel it in every page you turn. He says that, &quot;Our people are good people; our people are kind people. Pray God some day kind people won't all be poor. Pray God someday a kid can eat.&quot; I don't know how you can read some of his words and not get teary eyed. But sixty years have passed since the writing of this book and there are still migrant stories to be told and kids who have no food to eat yet sadly the world continues despite its injustices.I won't kid you into believing that this is an easy book to read. The first 150 pages are so slow going that I almost had to put it down. But I kept on going just as the Joad's kept on going and I'm certainly glad I did. We could all take a lesson from their quest for survival and their quest just to be able to eat the next day. Their determination, in light of all the obstacles they had to face, is truly a lesson to be learned. You feel a sense of accomplishment after reading a book like this -- I know I did."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I have never read a better novel written by an American than THE GRAPES OF WRATH. Steinbeck's deeply touching tale of displaced families and a nation rent by Depression will never cease to be relevant.The Joads and thousands of others are driven out of Oklahoma by drought and the Depression. It is bad enough they lose their farms to homes and have to move. It is worse that the big business fruit growers in California print misleading flyers claiming to have far more well-paying jobs available than they ever intended to have. It is miserable when they get to California (where the people curse them as \\"Okies\\") and find out that as few as one man owns as much a million acres--much of it lying fallow in front of their eyes.As difficult as the plight of the Joads and families like them, Steinbeck does not paint the Californians or their police as evil so much as scared into treachery and violence in order to protect their own. No one wants to starve and starvation after the dust bowl and thanks to the exploitative wages paid by the vineyard owners is a very real possibility. Nor does he canonize the migrants--the societies that grow up by the side of the road each night have their own laws and lawbreakers, stout hearts and slatterns--but does show them as civilized people who don't deserve being treated like animals. Many fearful Californians don't agree.Steinbeck's character Tom Joad (whose ghost lives on in a Bruce Springsteen's song recently covered by Rage Against the Machine) is as important to American literature as Huckleberry Finn, Holden Caulfield and Jay Gatsby. Joad knows life offers no simple solutions, but he also knows that fair is fair. When a man's employers charge him for his work gear AND operate the stores where he must buy his food so that he often ends up OWING his employers more at the end of the week than his pitiful wages can cover, Tom Joad knows that's not just. He knows the land is fertile enough to feed everyone, so don't try giving him any speeches about \\"private property\\" and \\"supply and demand.\\" If the test of a system and a society is how it treats it poorest members (especially in a crisis like the Depression), then the world the Joads live in fails miserably.No less strong a character than her son Tom, Ma Joad embodies all the cliches about being a tower of strength without actually being a clich&eacute; herself. She and her family possess all the true grit and hearty spirit America prides itself on as a nation of pioneers, but by the 1930s the frontier has been bought up and the pioneers are in desperate straits.This book is occasionally criticized for being too socialistic. This criticism is misguided; what THE GRAPES OF WRATH does is show how capitalism can and often does enrich the few while the many suffer. Steinbeck shows how breadbasket farmers were thrown off the land they had worked for generations so bankers in the East can make more profit. Can this happen today, even in a time of tremendous prosperity? Ask today's family farmers what agribusiness has done to them. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is no call to play the \\"Internationale,\\" but it does starkly and intelligently raise questions about the meaning of equal opportunity and justice for all.This is a book that should be required reading for Alan Greenspan, the editors of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, and triumphal capitalists everywhere who wince for their stock dividends when the unemployment rate goes down. Not to mention every single elected official in the United States. The subject matter is extremely heavy and sad, but Steinbeck's style is straightforward and easy (even with the various dialects he employs perfectly). THE GRAPES OF WRATH does what so very few great novels can: it will take a lot out of you, but leave you with much more than you had when you began."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I always hesitate before attempting to write a critical review of a classic novel, particularly one as monumental as &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; So let me start this out by saying, YES, the book is a well-deserved classic, and YES, I would recommend that each and every person go out and get a copy. As many other reviewers have pointed out, this novel has an uncanny ability to affect its readers, to make them re-evaluate the nature of compassion, fortitude, and human dignity. Much of this is due to Steinbeck's brilliant structuring of the novel, as he alternates the chapters dealing with the direct struggles of the Joad family with more elaborate &quot;big-picture&quot; depictions of the migrant movement in general.That being said, however, &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; can be an extremely frustrating reading experience for an unprepared reader. Its sheer length (around 600 pages) can be initially daunting, and the copious amounts of dialogue (all written in dialect) take some time to get used to. &quot;Grapes&quot; can even be difficult for Steinbeck fans because it is in many ways rather an anomaly in his canon. Though the story of the Joads is compelling, there is evidence that Steinbeck was somewhat uncomfortable with these parts of the novel: Characters introduced in the beginning simply disappear halfway through, contributing little to the overall story, and in general the characterization is weaker here than it is in other novels like &quot;Of Mice And Men,&quot; curious considering that &quot;Mice&quot; is about one-fifth the size of &quot;Grapes.&quot; There is repetitiveness in the dialogue and the trials faced by the Joads, and the novel's pacing likewise suffers.In my opinion, the &quot;Big picture&quot; chapters are better written than the Joad chapters--on the whole more interesting, more powerful, and certainly more complex (as Steinbeck switches back and forth with his narrative voice and point of view). Chapter 25, in which the novel's title (taken from the Battle Hymn of the Republic) appears is probably the finest of the novel. Moreover, in spite of some weaknesses in pacing and plot, the story of the Joads personal hardships contain several scenes which are infused with a similar ability to produce a devestating and uplifting feeling in the reader. The novel's final scene with Rosasharn is positively brilliant in its conception and execution.I've tried to be fair and honest in this review, and I hope my comments will help you to enjoy &quot;Grapes&quot; without frustration. It is a remarkable novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"&quot;The Grapes of Wrath,&quot; written in 1939 by John Steinbeck, is a book about the Great Depression, and one poor sharecropper family's struggle to survive the worst deprivations that American society in the 1930's had to offer. Indeed, perhaps no American work of fiction fits the label of &quot;The Great American Novel&quot; better than Steinbeck's wonderfully written and still highly controversial masterpiece of fiction.Set in the 1930's, in America's &quot;Dust Bowl,&quot; this is the tale of the Joad family, a large clan of poor Oklahoma sharecroppers, and how they are forced into a decision to migrate to California. It's also the story of the many trials and sufferings that they endure during their long and harrowing journey.Forces of nature and the forces of economics have conspired to force the Joads off their farms. So, this proud, hard-working family, sells most of their worldly possessions in order to buy a run-down old jalopy. The whole family - Ma and Pa; Granma and Granpa; Tom (the oldest son, and an ex-convict recently paroled from prison); Al (Tom's younger brother); Uncle John (Pa's brother); Ruthie and Winfield (Ma and Pa's youngest children); the heavily pregnant Rose of Sharon (Tom's younger sister) and her husband Connie; and the Reverend Jim Casy (a family &quot;friend&quot;) - pack themselves, along with their essential goods, aboard their decrepit old vehicle, and depart for the &quot;promised land&quot; on America's west coast.The vast majority of this compelling novel tells the story of the Joads' plight while on the road. They are almost immediately confronted with the death of a loved one. This compounds their grief at the loss of their home and possessions. They find that most people they meet along the way despise, reject, and vilify them as dirty, filthy &quot;Okies;&quot; they receive aid and comfort from very few along their route. Yet, they remain undaunted; throughout their struggles, they remain focused on the ultimate realization of a dream: jobs, high pay, and a new life in California.The great climax of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; sees the Joads once again suffering in unspeakable squalor as they attempt to survive the violent forces of nature and humanity in this, the great western &quot;promised land.&quot;The basic plot of &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is exciting, suspenseful, gripping, and possessed with a terrible beauty. It is written perhaps in the finest traditions of the early twentieth century &quot;muckraking&quot; novels, exposing, as it does, the worst societal ills that were prevalent in American society of the 1930's.This book serves as Steinbeck's soapbox, as he deplores the exploitation of California's migrant workers during this era. Indeed, the author is frequently barely able to contain his moral outrage at the sufferings of thousands of &quot;Okies,&quot; and their often violent treatment by landowners, businessmen, and even law enforcement officials.&quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; abounds with wonderful character studies. The effects of indescribable suffering and abject poverty give Ma Joad the steel to evolve from her traditional role as a silent, obedient wife to become the true leader of the family. Conversely, Pa Joad's traditional role seems to diminish; he recognizes the fact, and, after only brief resistance, he defers to his wife's new role. Tom, ever so careful not to do anything to jeopardize his parole at the outset, finds himself increasingly outraged at his family's plight, and emboldened to action as a result.This novel's central theme is still as relevant today as it was in 1939: the growing disparity between the &quot;haves&quot; - the rich - and the &quot;have nots&quot; - the poor. Perhaps this is the real reason why the book still generates such controversy. It holds a mirror up to us, and forces us to confront some unpleasant truths that we, as an &quot;enlightened&quot; society, would rather not face. And that, in itself, makes this brilliant book well worth reading."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"If you have not read this book, what are you waiting for? Is it because it was written before you were born? (1939) Does its name scare you, as it did me, into imagining it would be about all sorts of odd things, as I did? Well don't let your preconceived notions fool you. It's a terrific novel. It is a great piece of literature that won Mr. Steinbeck a well-deserved Pulitzer Prize, and eventually, with his other contributions to literature, earned him a Nobel Prize.What can I say about the Joads that has not already been said in the past sixty-odd years? How could I have missed knowing them earlier? I read this story, with its \\"country speech\\" and \\"country ways\\" and wanted to take them all in. I wanted to comfort them all. I didn't know what I would find at the Joads when we first meet Tom going home. Who is this Tom Joad Jr. and why was he in jail? He must have had a HORRIBLE life to end up there, he must have. Then you meet the 'fambly.' You live with the 'fambly.' You see proud Pa try so hard to be the head of the home during the Dust Bowl migration. This family, who for generations upon generations, upon generations lived off their land. The land wasn't a piece of property, it was family. It fed them, it housed them. They raised a crop to sell, so they can pay off the loans they took when times were tough before. When the rains stopped coming, and the payments to the bank stopped being made, the 'banks' came and told all these people to leave. Imagine someone coming to tell you that the land you have lived on all your life, the land of your fathers and grandfathers belonged to the banks and you had to leave right now. Imagine the dread. All your life spent in the same place, with the same neighbors, the same strong values; \\"Yes Sir! Yes Ma'am!\\" No talking back, everyone knew their place. And then the dust came, and took away everything you knew.The Joads sell everything they own, load up a beat-up truck with the necessities (food, water, mattresses, clothes, pots, pans) and head towards the promised land of California. Along with 500,000 other displaced people. All looking for land to work; it's all they know. You get land, you work it, it's yours. They had no idea what life outside of Oklahoma was really going to be like.There's Ma, trying so hard to keep the family strong. She's the backbone. She eventually takes charge, which, back on their farm, was unheard of. Times were changing.Ma & Pa, 6 kids, Grandma & Grandpa, Uncle John, the Preacher Casey, and Connie, the husband of one of Ma's daughters. Thirteen people in one truck.I wanted to bring them home, let them eat, give them a hot bath, tell them it'll be ok. I wanted to simultaneously smack the heck out of Rose of Sharon (Rosasharn) and comfort her in the end; tell her she really did do good in God's eyes at that very last paragraph. I saw Ruthie grow in those 7 or 8 months into someone I did not like. She was mean, she was vindictive, she was 7. I saw humanity at its worse. Things like this really did happen in the early 1930's, after the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl. These \\"Okies\\" were treated with contempt. They were kicked off their lands, treated like animals, paid meager wages or in some cases, they were paid with a loaf of bread for 16 hours of work, and it's disgusting. How would you fare? What would you be willing to do to feed your starving family?It's a terrific book. I wish I knew how Noah fared. I wish I knew what happened to that spineless Connie. Is Tom ok? Did he take up the cause that Casey so tragically and instantaneously had taken from him? I imagine so. I imagine Tom forcing these cities who spurned them, who burned them out, who arrested them, to have to accept them; 500,000 strong. If not directly, then inspiring others to go on and on. The packing plants who throw away food, while these people sit outside the gates dying. The orange growers who sprayed kerosene on the overstock of oranges rather than give them away for free. The food thrown in rivers, with armed guards making sure no one took the food. Pigs slaughtered because they could not sell them, and hungry people staring, not understanding that there's a profit to be made.\\"And they stand still and watch the potatoes float by, listening to the screaming pigs being killed in a ditch and covered with quicklime, watch the mountains of oranges slop down to a putrefying ooze; and in the eyes of the people there is a failure; and in the eyes of the hungry there is a growing wrath. In the souls of the people the grapes of wrath are filling and growing heavy, growing heavy for the vintage.\\""},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I don't know if I can adequately express how wonderful I think this book is. Steinbeck writes with incredibly vivid imagery and passion in all his books but this is his best and affected me the most.Grapes absolutely should be required reading, not only because it is Steinbeck or excellent literature but because it is a powerful story of human nature, social conscience, prejudice and classism. This book opened my eyes to the plight of yet one more minority group, migrant farm workers. I cannot drive by fields filled with people picking our fruits and vegetables without thinking of this book and the lives of these folks. Thank God for people like Cesar Chavez and the union he created to help. But I digress....This is a heart-wrenching, sad story of a family's search for relief from the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma and a better life in California. The better life doesn't come by the end of the book but the reader is left a more compassionate person. Quite an accomplishment. Thank you Mr. Steinbeck."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Detractors of this novel will tell you that The Grapes of Wrath is melodramatic, contrived, and relentlessly preachy - and I can't argue with them. The Grapes of Wrath is overwrought and about as subtle as a hand grenade, but it is also a powerfully affecting novel. I challenge even the most cynical reader not to be moved (at least a little) by the tragic story of the Joad family.The novel is often described as a \`sweeping epic' (which means it is longer than the average book). It is undeniably a classic and well worth reading, but is not without its flaws. The novel is compelling and I found myself having trouble putting it down as I neared the final chapters, however it does get bogged down in spots and some of the dialogue is repetitive. Steinbeck is unquestionably one of the most important writers of the 20th century, but (and let's be honest here) his prose is largely unremarkable (certainly when compared to Fitzgerald's \\"The Great Gatsby\\").And then there are the politics...Personally, I don't have a problem with an author having a strong point of view and expressing it in a novel. Yes, Steinbeck portrays a complex issue as if it were clear-cut. He portrays the migrants as good and noble (the men-folk may behave badly at times; drinkin', brawlin', and womanizin' but they are inherently good). Meanwhile, the banks and the land owners are evil personified. There is no middle ground in The Grapes of Wrath.Despite what some reviewers would have you believe, The Grapes of Wrath is not a communist manifesto. It does however, question how a country so plentiful can allow so many to starve and suffer and Steinbeck doesn't hesitate to point his finger at those he feels are to blame. Reality is considerably more complex. The plight of the dustbowl farmers was inevitable as the economy changed and small family farms became unsustainable.Steinbeck's narrative alternates between the Joad family's story (the even numbered chapters), and a series of expository chapters (the odd numbered chapters) that provide a broader perspective of the migrant experience. These expository chapters are the most politically charged and blatantly biased of the novel, but they also feature some of the best writing.My review sounds mixed because I have mixed feelings about the novel. It is bold, but contrived, compelling, yet melodramatic, powerful, but preachy. All in all though its strengths outweigh its shortcomings. The Grapes of Wrath is well worth reading, just don't set your expectations too high. This isn't one of the best novels ever written, in fact, it isn't even Steinbeck's best."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I first read this in high school- 40 some years ago- and I am still deeply moved by its power. Steinbeck never wrote highly polished prose and he liked plebian themes. It's easy to dismiss him, particularly if you think great novels must be word perfect or concern renowned people and events. In my second reading, Steinbeck's politics and philosophy came through more insistantly than I was aware of as a teenager.The 1930s federal government was as inept as present day FEMA. The police were as facistic as the Nazis. The banks and rich landowners were as greedy and grasping as Enron execs. The moralistic religious were as closed minded as Fallwell. The public was as whipped up over \\"Reds\\" as it is today over \\"terrorists\\". The heros are the Joads and other Oakies who have unlimited reserves of ambition, industry and resourcefulness, but by novel's end are reduced to questionable survival. You know they don't deserve their fate: people that eager to work, that loving and generous, that willing to improve the world should not end up destitute, hunted and starving.Since my first reading I have traveled the length of Route 66 and actually lived in some of the spots wherein the fictional Joads picked peaches. I've encountered numerous Oakies who made the trek and are proud of it. (By now, even the kids of the '30s are gray and choose to remember the best of times.) However, the hard times and nastiness in Grapes of Wrath is not a fabrication. Steinbeck researched the migrant camps extensively and came away with plenty of evidence and strong opinions. He chose to take the lowest point in his American history and expose its faults. In so doing, he also consecrated its common people. The novel also hints at themes that are currently more in vogue: agricultural ecology, the wisdom and strength of women, the need for new economics. America deserves a great novel for every era- this one nailed the dirty thirties."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"When I was first assigned to read John Steinbeck's book The Grapes of Wrath in English class, the first thing that I noticed was how huge it was. Over 600 pages! I was afraid it would be a story that wandered all over the place and didn't really have a point. Even after I had begun reading, it seemed that this assumption was correct since all book seemed to be doing was telling a very detailed and slow-moving story about a family in Oklahoma. However, as I continued reading, I began to realize that the very way the book portrays the life of these people so realistically and what the reader learns from their situation is itself the point of the book. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, an Oklahoma family of tenant farmers during the Great Depression who are kicked out of their homes because they cannot make a profit on their crops. As more and more farmers are kicked off their land to be replaced by men on tractors, over 300,000 people migrate west to California in hopes of earning a living picking fruit, cotton, etc... for owners with larger farms. Hardship follows them during the long trip to California. Even once they get there, they're divided against themselves as they compete for work so they can just feed their families. Throughout the book the family encounters opposition from all sorts of people, including land owning farmers who must pay extremely low wages in order to make a profit, cops who cause more trouble than good, locals who are afraid of the massive influx of people, and a government that seems unable to help. In the end it's sheer will that gives them the strength to continue to fight as the Depression relentlessly tries to break the people's determination and the family bonds. The Grapes of Wrath gives a very realistic view of the Great Depression and tells it from viewpoints you don't see from just reading about it in a history textbook. The book is divided into narrative chapters that tell the story of the Joads, and, every other chapter, the inter chapters that give information about the situation in a style that's part documentary, part editorial. Throughout the book, especially during the inter chapters, Steinbeck uses symbolism to convey ideas. In particular, there are many allusions to the Bible, including the title. Due to its realistic portrayal of the life of the migrants, the book has also come under considerable controversy for its profanity and sex, since those things were parts of the lives of these people. Also, Steinbeck uses the inter chapters both to make people aware of the problems and to give suggestions for how to deal with them, and many of his beliefs could be seen as Communistic. I have really found The Grapes of Wrath to be a difficult book to rate. On the one hand, it's a slow-moving book that contains a whole lot of talk that people who aren't really into reading books for fun will likely find boring, and it's just too long to hold some people's interest. On the other hand, however, the character interaction is very realistic and human, being based on actual migrants Steinbeck knew. Because of this, we get to feel like we really know the people in the book. The seemingly excessive length of the book is actually needed to give us a real understanding of how these people lived their lives. When the characters get into intense situations that threaten the physical and psychological well-being of the family both as a group of individuals and as a single unit, the book reaches hights of drama and emotional intensity that is almost never matched today in movies, books, video games, music, or any of our other forms of art. I often found myself just sitting there thinking about what I'd just read for a while after I finished with the required reading for the day. There's not really space within this 1,000 word limit to fully discuss my thoughts on this book, but what I can say is that it will draw you into the world of the migrants in the 1930's and show you plainly and truthfully just what it was like. I can understand the opinion of people who hate this book because it's all a matter of taste, and some people just would not be able to forgive the many parts they consider agonizingly boring. Although I give this book four stars overall, there are parts of it that I'd give 10 stars if I could. I highly recommend this powerful book to anyone."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Here's another book I once avoided, an arrogant young student impressed with my collection of bitter satires by bitter, younger writers who thought just as little of humanity as myself. Surely my decision to drift through a test and a paper on other people's discussions (ranging from 'greatest book ever' to 'a tiring, endless bore')was appropriate at the time for my cynical inexperience had not yet adjusted me for the sheer force of humanity of this titanic struggle.A story in pictures and abbreviated words, The Grapes of Wrath paints an honest vision of crushing defeat endured through hard times when visualized hopes were the only things required for living. We are swept in to a duststorm, a cascade of brief apocaylpse that batters our eyes shut only to force them open to see what is going on beneath the howl of the wind. This is what calamities cause and here is how man will always scramble for survival.The world opens up and becomes filled with people, beginning with the solitary wandering of a just-released inmate ambiling through the dead, dried out land, to search for his family. People join and surround Tom--later the Joads--and the dazed survivors all travel, bringing customs, and search the wide world for a new place to make a living. Their dreams and ambitions mix and then expand, groups are formed, families split apart and multiply, the crush of the storm has infected the people and now they go forward and tear up even more of the land in the search for a home.The book ends in the rain, all pain and dryness washed away into the mud, the dreams coming to an end, situations grown more desperate but at least temporarily endurable--the truth about where hope lay shining and glistening before them, lost in the bible or dreams of wealth or hopes for the future or the nucleus of a loving family surrounding them. Something is planted in that rain, finally, the milk of human kindness mixing with the mud to burst forth flowers and dew and yet another new chance to make something out of survival.It really is a wonderful story told with great wisdom, dignity and style."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The novel The Grapes of Wrath written by John Steinbeck is a master peace of literature. Through the travels of the Joad family you get an incredible feeling of what it felt like to travel during the Dust Bowl of the late 1930's. The novel starts with a recently paroled Tom Joad hitchhiking to his family's farm in Oklahoma. After being let off, Tom starts walking towards where his farm was before he was put in prison for homicide. Soon after he begins walking he meets up with another main character, Jim Casy who is a former preacher. After shooting the breeze for a while the both of them continue the journey to the Joad farm. Upon arriving at the farm, they find it deserted. Tom, clueless as to what happened does not know what to do. After looking around the property for a while, Tom notices his neighbor Muley Graves, coming towards him and the preacher. Tom asks him if he knows where the Joad family is. Muley states because they cannot afford to stay on their land they were forced to relocate to Uncle John's farm. After spending the night at the Joads house, the preacher and Tom Joad continue on their journey to Uncle John's. When they arrive at Uncle John's two things happen to Tom. First of all his own mother does not recognize him, second of all, after everyone does figure who he is, they all asked him when he escaped. To which he replied, \\"I was paroled\\". Soon the family realizes they cannot celebrate Tom's freedom. They quickly load their 27' Dodge pick- up with all the belongings they will need, and soon they are on their way to California. The character that forms his identity throughout the book is the main character Tom Joad. He does what is best for the group by going with his family to California. He easily could have stayed in Oklahoma where it would be safe for him. But instead he breaks his parole in order to go California with his loved ones. I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone who likes thinking while they read. A book such as this one deserves the utmost attention while reading it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"My title says it all. To me this is the greatest piece of literature ever written. I had to read it in high school and even now 30 years and many more books later it is still my favorite.

In this wonderful depiction of the horrors the Oklahoma farmers faced during the great dustbowl of the 1930's, I was once again awakened to what a story is supposed to be about. Too often, we are zapped with this wild tales of one explosion after another, with characters so much bigger than life that they would need the whole universe to survive in. Here, we see the intimate interactions of those who must struggle to survive in a hostile environment. We even see those little devilish schemes certain characters assume in order to be human. (The preacher is the perfect example.) I was mesmerized by the wonderful way the great novelist paints the mannerisms of each of his characters.The story evolves in a slow and natural way, blazing a trail through the perils the Joad family faces on their journey to California, where hope drives them and keeps them sane. And even when they complete this trials, other, more severe setbacks are waiting for them in ambush. It is a story of struggles and greed, of honesty and deceit. The story finds its way into the deepest chasms of your heart and then tears out a piece.I recommend reading other Steinbeck books first, to savor the best for last."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I think that everyone should read this book.

While I sometimes find Steinbeck a bit too descriptive and wordy, he definately tells a beautiful story."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"An extremely touching tale of a family seeking greener pastures, this book will surely change the way you look at big time capitalistic maneuvers. No denying that the big corporations brought the deadly efficiency and productivity to major markets, but in the face of all the success, one would tend to forget the millions of people who suffered for most of their lives to make way for the changes.It also brings us up close to the situations during post-depression times which drove people to abject poverty and suffering. The kind of treatment the characters of the book undergo due to the policies of the rich landowners will surely make you shudder with shock. People can be so cruel at times to their own fellow beings that it is hard to comprehend the reasons behind such behavior!Inspite of all the adversity, the characters in the book exude a level of endurance that is truly heartening. Anyone who reads this book will definitely face life's problems in a far more spirited and never-say-die manner. It definitely redefines one's conception of adversity and pain!I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the happenings which have moulded modern America. If not for the historical insight, this book is a fantastic journey into man's calibre to face challenges. One could read it just to discover the emotional strength of Ma in the Joad family. I am sure this is a book to be remembered for a lifetime!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"It's hard to know how to begin talking about a novel with as many threads running through it as the The Grapes Of Wrath. For me, it's primarily the story of how capitalism, initially a benign force, became the ravenous &quot;monster&quot; that it is today. But to portray The Grapes Of Wrath as merely some sort of leftist tract is to betray its power, its depth. It's the kind of novel that you're constantly quoting to people as you read it, picking it up and saying, &quot;Hey, listen to this...&quot;.It's simply one of the finest American novels I've ever read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"One of the great novels of the 20th Century. This should be required reading at the high school level.The story is that of the Joad's, a displaced family from Oklahoma who migrate West,looking for work in the rich agricultural areas of California.No novel tells the story of depression era America better than the Grapes of Wrath.The Joad's, like millions of other Midwestern and Southern farmers, lose their land through a combination of generations of bad farming techniques, dry weather that occurred several growing seasons in a row, and the depression.The end of the rainbow is California, rich in agriculture with the promise of plenty of work. Along the way the family endures physical and emotional hardships, as well as ridicule and humiliation.Once they arrive in California, the Joad's find that the labor supply is so plentiful that the promised jobs are either non-existant or the pay is paltry. Furthermore, the California land barons want the 'Okies' to stay only long enough to pick the crops and they employ whatever means necessary to keep workers migrant.There are many poignant scenes in this novel and the character of Ma Joad is truly a classic as she strives to keep her family together and from starving to death. The last scene involving the loss of a child and a straving man are heart rendering.But the real value of this novel is in the social conscience that it attempts to evoke. For his work Steinbeck was villified as a Communist, although his later work showed Steinbeck as a political moderate."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The passionate saga of the Joad family, who like thousands of American farmers lose their homesteads through a combination of bad luck and poor farming techniques. The Joad's travel west under the false promise of plentiful work in agricultural rich California.The journey is long and frightening as the family endures humiliation and the threat of starvation. When they arrive in California the Joads discover thousands of other displaced 'Okies' looking for work forcing down wages that the landowners were are willing to pay. They also discover that the landowners will do whatever is necessary to keep wages low.The Grapes of Wrath is an important American novel that tells a tragic story of an American family trying to stay together and survive under the most dire of circumstances. Generations of young Americans have grown up and never seen economic hard times. Although the bleakness of the conditions may be exagerated, depressioon ravaged America was not anything like it is today. This book gives an insight into just how tough times were.Ma Joad is one of the strongest female characters ever depicted in American literature as she struggles to feed her family and keep them together. The last few pages involving the still born birth of a child and the feeding of a starving man are tragic. Steinbaeck's novel is passionate and heartbreaking and he had to endure public vilification because of it. His later writings revealed a more conservative nature. Every young American should experience this novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I watch the movie whenever it is on TV, its one of my favorites from that era. This past spring, I decided to read the book, something I rarely do if I've already seen the movie. I can understand now why the movie, compared to the book, tried to put a more promising spin on the Joad's (and many Americans) situation at the time. After all, the future for the working class and the country as a whole,was very much in doubt circa 1930's America. I recently saw a documentary on the making of the movie and it mentioned how the famous speech from Ma Joad towards the end of the film,about how they are the -&quot;little people&quot; and how there's many more of them and they just keep a-coming and things will eventually work out- this dialogue was actually added by Daryl Zanuck to end the movie with some hope. The book offers none of that hope...I was shocked at just how unforgiving and relentless the book is in its outlook of despair and misery for the Joads and others like them. The final chapters truly are some of the most desperate and hopeless depictions of the American Dream gone bad that I have ever read. You can really appreciate the progress we have made over the past 60 years in assuring that the country doesn't undergo anything close to &quot;The Great Depression&quot; again(so far)...Even if you've seen this movie first, the book is well worth reading and is dramtically different in its scope and mood..Definitely one of the best of the century."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"There are some historical novels that are so interesting and tell the details of the past in a creative interesting way.

I read a lot of plays (I LOVE the Glass Menagerie) and I've just started Allen Ginsberg's autobio. However, I HATE HATE HATE this book!Let me tell you why. First of all, these poor people have SUCH BAD LUCK. I mean, you'd think that at least one good thing would happen to them within the entire novel. Not so. I mean, if this book were just a hundred pages longer, all of them would be dead. Also, Steinbeck managed to kill off the two best characters in the entire book: Grandma and Grandpa, while Rose of Sharon, possibly the most annoying character I have ever read about, remains alive and whining till the dreadful end. Also, Steinbeck uses a lot of sexual references that are kind of weird and not very enjoyable. For example, he talks about the tractors &quot;raping&quot; the land. Lastly, you'd think Steinbeck is an insane guy or something because whenever something gross happens he really gets into describing it somewhat graphically. He spends a good amount of the book describing, in great detail, a pig eating a baby, cleaning a dead rabbit, and a dead dog squashed flat on the ground."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I am a Junior in High School and am instinctually drawn to literature.

Perhaps if the novel had ended 400 pages or so before it actually did, I could have stomached it better."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is 619 pages of complete boredom. I am reading this over the summer for my 10th grade English class that I soon will be attending on an everyday basis once school starts. In my opinion this book is too wordy and boring. They could take this 619 page book and cut it down to about 150 pages if they wanted to. I believe that no high school student should suffer the extreme pain and boredom of reading this book. My advice to any high school student who has to read this book is get it on audio tape and fast forward through most of it you wont miss much, only a bunch of useless dialogue!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a book to be treasured...Steinbeck's weaving of storyline with the historical background of the dust bowl era served as an education for me. Just when you thought you were getting tired of all the additional background information, though, the plot kicks in to high gear. Following the life of the Joads was both emotional and suspenseful. The scenes were so vivid to me that I still can picture certain scenes in this book years after I finished it. One thing I found particularly intriguing about this book is the ending. You can read it all you want before you start the book, but understanding doesn't come until you've read the whole thing. I'm a huge Jack Kerouac fan, but I have to bow to Steinbeck, who showed me that spontaneous prose existed in a professional form before Kerouac and the Beats."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As I look over the reviews of the classic works of literature, I am appalled by how often I see the word boring being used. I guess it's because great books don't come with big screens, speakers and a joy stick. Welcome to the Millenium."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"this book is amazing because it reveals so much about the human condition and the perils of capitalism when taken to an extreme. i very much enjoyed this book thoroughly. this is a story that is troubling at times, which just adds more to the experience presented. this is the kind of book that leaves an aftertaste that doesnt soon go away. with all that said, will someone please email an explanation of the ending to me? i have come to my own conclusion, but find it altogether unsatisfactory."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Without a doubt this is one of the greatest novels ever written, if not the best. Steinbeck captures the feel of the dustbowl and transports the reader to the era. The book is long, has many references to socialism, and ends somewhat abrubtly, however throughout the entire novel Steinbeck masterfully shows how life was for the poor during the depression. At the end I could only sit, stare at the wall, and thank God I was not alive during the depression. Then it occured to me that the book could be written today, not portraying the okies, but maybe Vietnam in the early 1970s, or Mexican migrant workers today. The book is a hisorical account of what life was like, but it still rings true today.Afterwards I read two more Steinbeck novels: In Dubious Battle, and East of Eden. Both were excellent but neither carried the impact of The Grapes of Wrath. Steinbeck wrote a powerful novel that I think everyone should read. If you don't like it the first time, reread it ! until you understand it. This book is amazing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I thoroughly enjoy many of John Steinbeck's books. I truly recommend East of Eden and Of Mice and Men to anyone who hasn't read them. This book however I found very tedious, slow, and overall quite boring. I know it's a classic and all but really had a tough time getting through it and after all that work I really felt the conclusion left me hanging."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I have been reading and re-reading this book for last couple of weeks and haven't been able to get over it. The backdrop, the politics, the facts behind the fiction, are all a different world to me. Separated by several decades. Yet, there are factors that connect you straight to the book. Tom is a man who reminds you of someone you wanted to be in school after being expelled. Ma stands for strength in adversity. Pa for being an understanding human being.Amidst everything, the characters Steinbeck has created are ephemeral yet so touchingly representative of human strength and dignity. The language of the characters is also communicative of the understanding of the lot Steinbeck has wanted to portray. The Scriptures' discussion between Tom and Ma when she comes to ask him to go (and her understanding the fact that children, especially adoloscents are likely to make mistakes in the heat of the moment) has a stark resemblance to the discussion of Indian scriptures I have overheard travelling to my village. It makes you wonder about the irony that when you are engrossed in reading such stories in fiction, you get appalled. But when you are just skipping through the newspapers, you miss the stories. There are quite a few Joads living out there, but we do not have the time to read through the stories in between the lines of the news columns.To sum it up, Grapes of Wrath is like a huge picture on a very large canvass that portrays the human life with a perspective that is way larger than we choose to adopt towards life. A must read."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As a Junior AP English student, I was bombarded with summer work, and my assignments included chosing a summer book to read from a selected list. I chose the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; by John Steinbeck, and was immeadiatly captured in the sad story of the Joads and there turbulent Oddessy. Sad and depressing yes, but hopeless it is not; if anything this book is about hope and compassion and empathy for others, and for many of us, including the characters in this novel, that is a lesson learned the hard way. There will probably never be a writer as talented as John Steinbeck; he has a way of making you not only imagine, but feel what is happening in his story. Steinbeck uses his great skill to show both great beauty and harsh reality, and I hope at the time this book was published that it caused political uproar and brought the people in American aristocracy down to Earth to realize what was occurring. Although people moving from Oklahoma to California are the least of our great nation's worries, the thoughts expressed in this book have the power to open the eyes of Americans to many troubling situations that exist today."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book is probably the most influential book that I've ever read. It has truly opened my eyes to a different time to help me appreciate the life that I have, now. The story follows the Joad family; they are heading West, to California, after being kicked off of the land that they farmed and were sharecroppers on. The Joads have heard that California is fruitful, rich, and beautiful. What they don't know is that 300,000 people just like them are also heading West to the &quot;green pastures&quot;. Along the road, they battle death, hunger, and fatigue. When they get to California, they battle poverty, crooked authorities, and hunger. The family struggles to find work and find a decent place to camp. The story has varying chapters. One chapter is a generalization of what is happening at each stage of the migrants' journies. These chapters use vivid descriptions, metaphors, and history to create a picture for the reader. The other chapters are specific to the Joad family with plenty of personal adventures and dialogue. With each new chapter comes more intrigue, hardache, and adversities. Excellent, emotional portrayal of this devastating time period. I would have liked if there was a little more closure at the end. The book is long as it is, but I was left wondering about some of the characters. I guess it's just one of those cravings, same with movies, when you never want it to end. Steinbeck has opened up a world, to me, that is begging to be delved into and researched. I can't wait to learn more about what I read.This book has really made me think about my life and the gratitude that I owe to everyone in my life. It's excellent to find that feeling of true thankfulness."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As a reader, I move pretty quick. I tend to devour books in weekends, or in some cases, overnight. It took me over two months to read Grapes of Wrath. And it was well worth the time invested. I can liken reading it to drinking a fine wine. You don't gulp, but savor. Enjoy. Relax.Steinbeck nailed it. He captured the flavor, feeling, behaviors, attitudes, societal woes, and speech of that era. The prose was beautiful, and the ending was extremely profound on so many different levels. A great novel will educate the reader in some way, or at least challenge their thinking about the world around them. This book did just that. I've heard the term &quot;Okies&quot; used a slur several times during my childhood, but never understood where it originated. Now, I do. Whenever I hear that term again, I will have an image ingrained in my mind of Americans, our brothers and sisters, searching for not just a new way of life, but FOR survival. I won't soon forget this novel."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book sat and sat on my book shelf for years. Thinking it would be one of those &quot;classics&quot; that I &quot;should&quot; read I neglected it. One day I picked it up and found out the my fears were misplaced. It reads like any pleasurable popular fiction, with suspence, mystery and great characters, but it also goes beyond and delivers a powerful and heart wrenching message.How do &quot;we&quot; (those in power, those with wealth, those with land, those with plenty) choose to neglect &quot;them&quot; (powerless, poor, disenfranchised)????? This book isn't so much a look at political systems or an indictment against the rich, it really is a deep glare into the heart of man. And man's heart is often a dark and terrible place.What really makes this book great are the little victories, those things that made me the reader long for the great sense of love and community that followed the Joad family wherever they went.Sometimes a man's heart has been recreated, and when it has, nothing dark or evil can overcome."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Most of the review accurately recap the plot of this masterpiece, so I will avoid doing that in my review. I have read most of Steinbeck's work and I am most impressed by the vivid skills with which he colors reality. Steinbeck's books specialize in early 20th California. This is the centerpiece of that collection.It is true that this book can be both dry and depressing at times. In reality, life also fits that description. There is not always a happy ending. This is one of the great qualities of Steinbeck, he does not feel the need for a happy ending in his work. When the dustbowl era of the 1930's dried most of America's crops in the center of the country, many people were forced to move. California was the promised land for some. For the majority, life in California was a nightmare of discrimination and starving through poor working conditions. People suffered and died. Life was harsh, and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a perfectly painted picture of that reality.While the movie version of this book starring Henry Fonda is well done, certain things are omitted. The controversial ending of the book is too much for the silver screen. The story of Tom Joad and the rest of the Joad family is enjoyable read. The fighting spirit and sense of justice in the tragic hero Tom Joad is still very real in the world today. If only there were more Tom Joad's in the world."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful, heart-wrenching story of a migrant family's struggle to find a better life in the \\"Promised Land.\\" It begins with Tom Joad getting out of jail on parole, and coming home to find that his family was moving west to get out of the Dust Bowl.Believing that California would be the land of opportunity, they left Oklahoma in search of a better life. The journey was difficult, and the difficulty they faced did not end as they entered California. Rather than finding themselves in the land of opportunity, they had to endure horrible living conditions and low wages.Throughout all of this, Tom Joad is running from the law because he violated his parole by leaving California. Although he has broken the law, he dedicates his life to doing good. The lives of the Joad family are filled with overwhelming disappointment and anguish, but there is a small spark of hope for the future and for humankind which transcends this sorrow.The story will captivate you, but to appreciate this masterpiece you must read his words, not only his ideas. The Grapes Of Wrath is not just a novel; it is a flawless piece of artwork filled with figurative language, brilliant characterization, illustrative description and euphonic, melodious words. The structure of the story is very interesting as well. There are interchapters, short stories giving some background about this time period, woven throughout the entire story, and they are reflected in the later chapters.This was the most interesting and most beautifully written story that I've read in a long time. Buy it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The Grapes of Wrath, I remember distinctly having to read in high school, and I hated it. Now, years later, I sat down and read it again, and had so much more of an appreciation for the book and the depth at which John Steinbeck was getting to in his portrayal of the Joads' trip to California in search of the American Dream.The story has both allegorical as well as literal elements to it. Set during the depression in the 1930s, it is the tale of the migrant farm workers from Oklahoma who leave the South for a chance at better job opportunities and life in the West. Specifically, we follow the path of the Joad family in their journey, and they use a rickety old truck that can barely fit the entire family to head westward. There are some from the community who refuse to go because of their principles, namely Grandpa Joad, who holds strongly to his belief that leaving Oklahoma is admitting defeat. Tom Joad, who recently got out of jail, and Jim Casy, a former preacher, join the family on their way west. Along the way, the Joads have several mishaps and disasters, and the family tries to stay together and maintain their hope that once they get there, everything will work out for the better.One of the more interesting characters in the novel is that of Jim Casy. He continually tells the family that he is no preacher when they want him to recite some type of prayer for them, yet, despite his protests, his role to the family and significance in the book is critical to their faith, as he represents a \\"moral\\" voice in the book. He is also responsible for the transformation of Tom Joad, the book's protagonist, who slowly begins to look at life from different viewpoints after meeting the preacher, and, by the end of the book, has changed his outlook.Among one of the great aspect of the novel is Steinbeck's descriptions of 1930s California. Some may think that this is tedious to read in a novel, as we have many chapters sole devoted to descriptions of the Central Valley and its scenery, as well as the situations of the migrant workers, but it seems to me an essential tool in establishing the context from which this novel was written. In effect, it really paints a picture of what life was like for many who made the trip west, and their difficulties along the way.Not only is the novel a testament to the situation of the migrants in the 30s, but it depicts and indirectly criticizes man's inhumanity towards others in times of need. This is represented in the plight of the Joads, who represent a microcosm of a family in need during this time. These families get shuffled around from place to place, and try to keep their dignity and hopes up despite the lack of compassion from some of the landowners.I'd say that, if you have to read this in high school and don't like it, try it again a few years later down the line. There is also a movie version of this book, with Henry Fonda, from the 1940s, an excellent film that is quite faithful to the book."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"A required book is always a drag believe it or not, but the The Grapes of Wrath, written by John Steinbeck, was a different story from the beginning. The Grapes of Wrath is the story of the Joad family, who travels to California during the Great Depression (1930's. During their trip to the great land of California the Joad family goes through sadness, happiness and obstacles all while migrating to California. Once they arrive to California they are faced with racism in their own country. The attention-grabbing novel had the Joad family face racism, while migrating from Oklahoma to California. They are referred to as \\"okies\\".The heartfelt story that may relate to many people also had a twist. While traveling to California the Tom Joad, one of the main characters is faced with his past and reflects on it while making the journey. He was faced with jail, and knows that he can't be seen doing anything wrong. Scared of being caught or thrown in jail once again he and his family move on even thought they had already found a pleasant place to settle.This book deals with issues such as discrimination. In the novel the Joad family is faced with discrimination. They are lied to when they try to get a job, they are called \\"okies\\" and they are evicted from the land they travel from. This novel isn't all negative. Steinbeck also shows how the migrating families help each other by creating communities over night and then moving on, and every night communities are set up, and everyone gets along, and no one is left in hunger.This novel may be required in High School, but it is also a great book to read on your free time. Enjoy this incredible book, while learning the struggle of families that migrated during that era and still migrate with the same hope and dream of having a better life for themselves and their loved ones. This book deserves four out of five stars.Eder Gaona"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Hearing this story again on tape was just wonderful. The actor is very good. I love books on tape, and this is among my top favorites ever.I loved Grapes of Wrath (read in my sophomore year). It was a joy, and often hard, to rediscover this beautiful story about the determined and downtrodden Joads. This actor does a great job in rendering the characters with sensitivity.My favorite part is when they cross into CA and Mrs. Joad makes her stand, saying \\"We're not bustin' up this family!\\" This scene was just as moving on tape as it was when I first read it long ago. It brought tears to my eyes all over again. I highly recommend this audio book!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Never read it in high school. I'm glad because I don't think I would have enjoyed it as much. Perhaps the best ending of a book as I have ever read. Seriously almost made me cry, which a book has never done. Guess that's why it's a classic."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I read the reviews for this book when I was first given the assignment to read it. Some were negative, but most were positive, so I went into reading the book with an open mind. John Steinbeck is a skillful writer, and takes great care in putting his point across.This novel was not just about the depression, and the families who moved west, it symbolized all of the groups in history who were looked down upon as less than human.Though the symbolism is way out of control in this book, it shows you how careful Steinbeck is at writing."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This is an excellent book; I'd highly recommend it. I've read other Steinbeck books such as East of Eden (not a favorite) and Of Mice and Men (liked it too). However, Grapes of Wrath is by far one of Steinbeck's best. I was deeply moved by the story of the Joad family, their hardships and their caring for others in need. What a classic!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Set in the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma, and on the long road to California, the promised land in the time of The Great Depression. The Joad family is one of many families, sharecropers, thrown off thier land when the crops fail and who must become migrant workers. There is the promise of jobs in California, so to California they must go. Piling thier trucks and cars high with what few possessions they have not sold, and heading out on the road.This is more than the story of a single family though, much more. This is the story of hundreds of thousands of families, homeless and wandering and starving while trying to maintain a shred of dignity and humanity. They must endure the cruelties of the road, the police, the foremen of the farms who will work entire families all day for only enough money for a single meal's worth of food at the company store.Though this book's length is rather daunting, I found myself so caught up in the struggle of the Joads that I read through in a short time. Through the story of the Joads, the story of the migrant workers of that era is well portraied; the struggle of many in the migration, the search for work, the pain of death, the dispair of watching the children go hungry and feeling helpless to stop it."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Interpretation of great American literature usually requires some perspective...indeed one must have lived a large portion of life to fully appreciate it's hardships. This philosophy is never more evident than when considering John Steinbeck's &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;. At once a testament to human fortitude while also a study for the historian to obtain a more humanistic perspective on the Great Depression, Steinbeck achieves a sort of literary pantheon with this timeless classic.This is the story of the everyday mid-western crop farmer during the great &quot;dust-bowl&quot; tragedy of the Depression. Forced by economic and personal factors to disband their farms and land (leaving generations of family history behind), they head to California to start anew with the promise of economic stability. Alas, this notion is soon discovered to be false as life there becomes even more destitute than the one that they have just left. Steinbeck's fictitious Joad family most assuredly mirrors the many similar groups that actually made this treck across a suddenly barren mid-western United States. Hardships and sorrows accrue as their savings run out and the promise of work becomes an ever lengthening ideal. Steinbeck presents a tome that emphatically enforces this personal sorrow while maintaining a fast paced novel thats unique in literary circles. Historical accuracy is never compromised as Steinbeck keeps the State and Federal governments' skewed Depression Era's economic policies at the forefront of the story and shows how these mis-guided actions indirectly become the driver for Franklin Roosevelts &quot;New Deal&quot; policies.The overriding virtue of this work, however, is Steinbeck's ability to take the reader along and make him a part of the story. Time and again, I truly felt the compelling sadness and overwhelming desperation of the Joads plight and when this is coupled with the incredible &quot;readability&quot; of the story, one can see why this work has long been considered &quot;the great American novel&quot;. Having half-heartedly read this in high-school, I'd submit that it should be re-read by those who now have families and responsibilities...a new appreciation will most assuredly be gained and I give this my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"I hadn't read this since high school. Purchased it after watching a special on the Depression and was not disappointed!"},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Is it within Amazon's power to ban all \\"I had to read this book for class and it is sooo boring\\" reviews.

Fell in love with Of Mice and Men in high school (one of the few I actually read) and my all-time favorite book is East of Eden. So I kinda hoped this would be another love. I did like it, but it's a lot more depressing than anything I've read. It deals with real life, real emotions, and real poverty. You will definitely feel more empathetic to immigrants and the impoverished after reading it. I would certainly recommend this book and now know why it's a classic and required reading in many schools."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"Grapes of Wrath is historical work of fiction. Covering the migration of tens of thousands of tenant farmers from the mid-west to the West of America. The book is half-fiction and half historical narrative.Amazing and absorbing are two words that initially come to mind when recalling the story. We follow the Joads, a family of tenant farmers, from Oklahoma to California. The mid west has become a dust bowl and the crops are performing badly. The land owners are heavily indebted to the banks who call in their loans. The land owners have to bow as industrialization thunders down on them and tractors and massive earth moving machines plow and turn the land. The tenant farmers are evicted and slowly but surely, reality sets in. They have nothing but each other. All the work is out west they hear. Our story starts as they point the old jalopy west and set off for better days.Steinbeck writes the story from 3rd person perspective and writes using the vernacular one would hear if one were a fly on the wall. Only becomes On'y, something becomes sumptin, every becomes ever', family becomes fambly. After reading for a while, the voice in your head takes on a Southern drawl as you read over the exchanges of the family. Conversation is scant yet, succinct. Articulation is nonexistent but the emotion leaps from the page. It truly is amazing the amount of feeling Steinbeck manages to get across to the reader. You truly are in the wagon, tents, camps, fields with the Joads as their personal Odyssey develops.There are 30 chapters and every other one is a historical perspective that Steinbeck uses to color in the hurdles and forces working against the migrants who were headed West. These folks were treated with contempt, condescension, abuse, left to starve and physically abused by law-enforcement yet, they continued on their way with hope. The hope was eroding from within yet, onwards they went. Tight family units looking out for each other and helping others along the way.The characters all add their \\"something\\" to the story. One of the more interesting ones, for me, was the character Casey. Casey, an ex-preacher, is somewhat like the phone in the old movies. Someone would grab the phone and use it to fill in some parts of the movie. Casey has that role in some places. He's a thinker and we find him thinking and explaining things to the Joads as they come to terms with their predicament.This work is a classic, no two ways about it. It's an American Odyssey during the great depression. Down home, heart of the Nation people uprooted by progress and forced to adapt to a world that didn't want them. Excellent work.6 stars."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"As a student of History I had to read this book again. The old adage \\"There's nothing new under the sun\\" applies to the current economy and the main theme of this book. The careless disregard for fellow man in the quest for material wealth fueled by greed. This theme should be taught as a subject in American schools."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"The great depression was an unrelenting harsh time in American history where many families starved to death just trying to provide for their families. The Grapes of Wrath is an excellent book that depicts one families struggle during this time. John Steinbeck executed and wrote this story very well. He truly is an amazing author, descriptive and precise, capable of creating mood and atmosphere that makes you feel as though you are a member of the family throughout the entire story. Steinbeck is not only socially and politically observant of the times; he also adds depth to his story by depicting the conditions that the people lived in, and describing the desires of not just individuals, but the nation during the struggle of the great depression, after the dust bowl. The story is an epic tale of one Oklahoman family and their forced migration west. After having their farm and home foreclosed on by the bank, the Joads are forced to leave the only home they have ever known. With word that there is work out west they are forced to make their trek across the country to survive. Even though it happened almost eighty years ago, The Grapes of Wrath is reminiscent of what is happening now in politics. With such a large gap between the wealthy and the poor there is a sense that all people want is a fair chance in this book. I would recommend this The Grapes of Wrath to anyone who has interests in politics, history, or social sciences. John Steinbeck has a very good understanding of these and even makes a few suggestions on ideas that he thought were good and later came to be( Like rotating crops in farming, the formation of unions, and other regulations that were put into place after the great depression). John Steinbeck demanded that a full copy of \\"The Battle Hymn of the Republic,\\" be put in the first edition of his book. It contains the line \\"He is stomping out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored.\\" Which Of course is where he got the title for his book; also it captures the essence of his writing. If you are looking for a good fictional read, that is informative about the way people lived during the great depression, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"An oldie but one of the best.

I think it should be required reading for everyone who calls himself an American. At first, I'll admit I was intimidated by its size, but I wanted to read it because of its &quot;classic&quot; status. It earns its honored position from the start. One can compare the trials of the Joads to those of Holocaust victims or Civil War participants. I am not saying their experiences are as horrible as those of the Jews and soldiers, but it is amazing that we (as a country at the time) could care so little for our own brothers. These people were not leeches before the Bank takes over the land. They made an honest living and worked very hard for it. Then they have to force themselves to rely on the kindness of strangers when they move West. Pride is broken sometimes, but it is ultimately restored, as the &quot;reds&quot; realize they must take care of each other to survive. Also, I have never been so moved as I was by the ending.

The love in the story isn't romantic, but it's love within families and neighbors. The family in center of the story is about to kick out from their land. They have a son who just came out of the prison. Also a pseudo priest had joined in the family. Their occupations and situation they're in are worthless, but their love to other members is enormous. Each family member shows love and faith to the others, and it ties them all as one. They dream to have stabilized life in California, but they end up losing every thing they had. Still love remains in their heart. The family shares their love to the strangers. They offer what they could give even though they end up in a situation of barely feeding themselves, which hardly can happen. The family thinks of others who are in worse situation than them first. In the story, the love they shows to the others is big enough to revive the society where obeys nothing but money, power, and egoism. After reading this book, you'll be able to think how big the love of your family is. You also might get a chance to think about egoism, whether you weren't selfish at all. Then you'll learn that love still remains in this world even though people are becoming more world lings. Probably that's what the author wanted to say.The author's message was love to the family and others, but he also intended to give deep emotion to the readers. Therefore, he had set the characters' situation as worth as it could be, and still showing love to their neighbors. This gave the story less reality. When people lose their house, car, and got nothing left to eat, they don't have extra time to think about the others. That's how people are like. The author might want to change basic thoughts of people being selfish, but it made the story unrealistic. If I were the author, I would end the story as happy ending, such as reunite of the family, so the family got what they have deserved for sharing their foods and love to the others. That's more realistic.The theme of the story is love. Love is the one that makes every life in the world work properly. It isn't money or power that people satisfy with, but it is love that makes people satisfy, through their hearts too. This book shows this fact well, and is recommended to read at least once. This book is recommended to teens and older who lived to be financially rich or be famous. Once those people read this, they may get a chance to look back the life they had lived. Also they'll learn being financially rich isn't the best life, and there is nothing happier than giving and receiving love from others."},{"Title":"The grapes of wrath, (The living library)","review":"This book is a major classic. The story flows and leads the reader into the depths of the Great Depression. Amazingly accurate and increasingly personal, the story about the Joads is very emotional.The book starts out with Tom Joad getting out from prison and expecting life to be as it was. But it isn't, instead his family is about to get kicked off the land by &quot;the monster bank owners in the east&quot;. As the story progresses, Steinbeck tells of their journey to California. The place where all their dreams will come true. But dreams aren't always reality. When the Joads finally reach California, their fantasies and visons are all shattered as they slowly realize and witness the evils of humanity.The ending is so profoundly emotional. After I finished the book, I sat there with the book in my lap, just thinking about the ending. So amazingly written. Touching and beautiful. Definately Recommended."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],q={key:0},E={key:1};function j(n,e,s,u,r,i){const f=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",x,[(t(!0),a(y,null,p(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(t(),w(f,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",E,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",q,"See more"))],8,H)):b("",!0)])}const J=c(W,[["render",j],["__scopeId","data-v-e41cecec"]]),B=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/14.md","filePath":"library/14.md"}'),P={name:"library/14.md"},G=Object.assign(P,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(J)]))}});export{B as __pageData,G as default};
