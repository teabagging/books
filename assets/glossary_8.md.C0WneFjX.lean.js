Yet Tom Sawyer's story continuously outsells Huck Finn's for the simple reason that \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" is the more enjoyable read. That does not mean that \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" isn't enjoyable, but that perhaps Twain tried too hard to impress and outdo himself that he muddled his story with unnecessary tangents.Everyone is familiar with the basic outline. Huckleberry Finn fakes his own death to run away from his abusive alcoholic father and finds Miss Watson's slave Jim has run away too. The two construct a raft and take off down the Mississippi River so that Jim can become free, an unheard of action for a white boy to take, even one as poor as Huck Finn. Along the way they face trials and high adventures, pair up with a couple of royal frauds, and find themselves in heaps of trouble when they impersonate the wrong people. Despite these setbacks, readers know that things are going to work out all right for the two main characters and that a happy ending will be had.Yet Huck's story drags on too long, especially the ridiculous plans to rescue Jim in the last several chapters; it seems as if these could have been excised to strenghten the story. Twain's humor is evident and contagious, but his adherence to local color and various dialects is demanding and downright frustrating at times. While many have claimed that \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is a racist book, because of one certain word, it is nothing of the sort, especially when its hero is championing for the rights of a poor, misunderstood slave. In fact, that storyline would have been rather revolutionary in Twain's time. While the prose and the language may be dated and sensational for our sensitive, politically correct time, it is a unique and faithful depiction of the time in which it was written."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Like many people growing up in the US, I read THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN as an obligatory assignment at school. No one likes obligatory reading, and it was like water off a duck's back. Regretting that I remembered nothing of the novel, I recently re-read it, and I found it entertaining reading, and also much more for a grown-up audience than I expected. Of course the book was only started as a sequel to Twain's novel for boys THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER before being turned towards much more serious themes, such as child abuse and the conflicts in antebellum southern society. But even much of the novel's humour is intended for older readers, requiring some knowledge of European history and of Shakespeare.The book's status as one of the Great American Novels is curious when it paints so bleak a picture of America. Any signs of refined culture among these inhabitants of the Mississippi comes not even for the East Coast but from Europe. For all of Twain's love of the land--indeed, the Mississippi River is itself a character--he was clearly a cosmopolitan figure by this point. Or perhaps the praise of America is subtle, as it is a portrait of a land free of aristocracy (the characters who call themselves the \\"king\\" and \\"duke\\" are scoundrels), and the novel is written in the honest vernacular of country people.The novel cannot in any way be considered a perfect work of literature when it is an arc that soars towards quality only in the middle. The opening pages are still in the realm of children's literature, while the final section reads as a tiresome parody with far too much serendipity to be believable. For that reason I've rated it four stars."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel by Mark Twain, originally published in 1884. It is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Ernest Hemingway (and many others) called it the greatest American novel ever. Huck Finn picks up right where Tom Sawyer left off - Huck's abusive father appears to lay claim to Huck's fortune, so Huck fakes his own death and goes down the Mississippi River with Jim, the escaped slave.Much like Tom Sawyer, there's not a lot of plot going on here most of the time, and that's okay, because Twain's writing is extremely entertaining. Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor. After Jim is abducted and Tom Sawyer reappears, things just get silly, not to mention highly convenient (And Tom Sawyer here is just as immature as he ever was, reinforcing that no real maturation occurred in Tom Sawyer, and that that book really isn't a coming-of-age story in the truest sense).Twain has made Huck the narrator. On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word. So is the novel racist? Certainly the characters have the racism of the day ingrained in them - in that sense, it is racist. But more important to most people is whether Twain was racist; that is, whether he put his own personal racism in the book. That is harder to determine, especially since Twain has made Huck the narrator. Perhaps the fairest thing to say is that Twain was genuinely criticizing racism, but the way in which he portrayed Jim and the other characters contains some residual racism of its own.So is Huck Finn America's greatest novel? Well, maybe not. But it's definitely up there."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I was down in the dumps I was. Wonderin' when my Huck Finn would come, and wonderin' if it would be righ' on time. But it was, I tell you, it was."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a timeless classic that lives up to its prestigious name. It takes place in an array of locations along the Mississippi river around the time of 1835-45. The story is about Tom, a free-spirited boy, and his numerous adventures with a run-away slave named Jim.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn proceeds Mark Twain's original novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but within the first page Huck acknowledges this and says reading the first book isn't that important. However, I personally recommend reading The Adventures of Tom Sawyer before this book. While it is not essential, it adds a lot to the book and gives an initial understanding Huck's character.The book starts right where The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ended: Huck is struggling to fit into his new found \\"civilized\\" life with the Widow Douglas. Huck is uncomfortably forced to learn to be proper while his fortune is held for him.It wasn't long till Huck's Pap, the village drunk, came to kidnap Huck for his fortune. After living with his abusive father for a while, Huck decides to escape. One night, Huck feigns a robbery on his Pap's cabin and then feigns his own death. Huck escapes to a nearby island and decides to live there. Soon word spreads through town about Huck's death and the town suspects Huck's father, but then suspicions transfer to a runaway slave named Jim who was living on the same island.Jim and Huck set off on a raft before people could find them. They embark on a series of adventures, including boarding the ships of robbers, murder mysteries, gunfights, family feuds, great storms, mobs, con artists, and other extravaganzas. During their voyages they also come to deal with a series of topics and realizations, such as the irony and hypocrisy of \\"civilized\\" and adult culture, slavery, racism, morality, human nature, and superstition."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Reading the slang in this novel sure beats reading the formal English of snobby, dull authors. The vernacular is fun. I don't give a damn about the so-called proper English. If you don't enjoy the language in this text, then go read any 18th or 17th century English text, and tell me which is more entertaining to read. I enjoy watching Twain break the grammar rules we all learned in English class. It is not that he does not know the rules, he just wants to be creative. Breaking the rules for grammar allowed him more space for creativity."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is a classic story by the wonderful and famous author Mark Twain.

Miss Watson's N*, named Jim, was setting in the kitchen door; we could see him pretty clear, because there was a light behind him\\" (Twain 6.)What I liked about this novel was that it was from a child's point of view, \\"you don't know about me without you have read the a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter\\" (Twain 2.)

It is a very good book that is suspenseful and really draws you in. It starts off with Huck imprisoned in civilization surrounded with good manners and sophistication. Daily he goofs off with his pals Tom Sawyer and others, imagining up scenarios where there is plenty of action and fun to be had. When his father returns, Huck has to stay with him but soon escapes, faking his own death and running away to a local island to live on his own. There, he meets Jim, Miss Watson's slave who he thought was going to sell him, so he ran off. Soon after, Huck and Jim start traveling down the river as many men were out looking for Jim. They travel only on nights, surviving on fish that they catch and other vegetables that they manage to scavenge. Unfortunatly, they run into two men, duke and king as they are known, who both claim to be royalty. They end up being a nuisance, as they demand everything be done for them. Soon afterward, they arrive at a small town where a respected man has just died. Everything in his will is pledged to his two brothers, who have not arrived. Duke and King pose as the real brothers, as they are hoping to rob the family of their money. When the real brothers arrive, Huck and Jim try to evade the con men, but as they make their escape they are caught by Duke and King. They travel futher down the river, and stop at yet another town, to resupply and hopfully make some money. When Huck, Duke, and King return to the raft, they find Jim missing, apparently captured as a runaway slave. Huck goes off to try to recapture Jim, and he poses as Tom Sawyer when he stays at Tom's Aunt Polly's house. Coincidentally, Tom arrives, and joins the cause to save Jim. Tom, as he has to throw some finesse into the escape plan, makes it much longer than it intended to be, even thought it would have been quite easy to escape in the first place. after weeks, The boys and Jim make their escape, but a few days after, Jim is captured in a town a few miles below the escape point. As Jim faces death, Tom steps in and says that Jim was already free, and that Miss Watson had freed him in her will, as she had died a week or so earlier. With Jim free, Tom returns to his original town and Huck get adopted to be civilized by Tom's Aunt Polly."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I read this book once in the 8th grade and recently as a sophomore in high school and this book has earned a place in my heart.

That's the magic of Twain's masterpiece: it's attraction to both young and old for both the same and different facets. For the young, this is a rollicking adventure story of an ornery youth and his escaped slave friend. It's the classic buddy tale infused with humor and narrow escapes. For the adult, There are the deeper layers of Huck's constant struggle with his own inner morality versus the popular opinion of what is considered to be right in the eyes of whites in the pre-civil war Mississippi River area.For a great escape and a look into the culture of the central United States just prior to the Civil War, I highly recommend Huckleberry Finn for all audiences."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"A set text in Yr 11 English, this book has become a favourite of mine.

Better versions illustrated with Kemble's images exist for a cost, of course. I posted this not as a review of the text itself (which may surprise those who forget how the plot falls apart towards the end despite all its earlier strengths!) to help others searching for this e-book version. It looks as if the illustrated version is the more complete e-book text, at least the one offered at PG for free.Paul Killebrew in Aug. 2011 reviewing found a flaw in the public domain text version Amazon offered as of that writing: no end to Chapter 23 and no Hamlet's marvelous mash-up of the Bard's greatest one-liners--so I wanted to mention this. I compared a printed copy and the e-text of the U of Virginia with that of the illustrated Gutenberg and they matched for Ch. 23. But the online Gutenberg text lacks the Hamlet material. I suspect the non-illustrated one via the public domain text at Gutenberg as with that offered for Kindle download in this listing may lack the material too.Any public domain text now seems by Amazon to be lumped into all sorts of media. So, evaluation of one e-book (or audiobook) appears harder and harder to carry out as the editions proliferate for newer devices.

It is the story of Huckleberry \\"Huck\\" Finn and his adventures on the Mississippi River as he and the runaway slave, Jim, escape downstream. Along the way they have adventures involving fog banks, con artists, feuding families, mistaken identity, and countless others. Twain takes you on a trip of the Mississippi River culture of the mid 1800's.Huckleberry Finn is a great book that is related to Tom Sawyer, but is truly a whole different animal. It has a serious, thoughtful side to it. There is definitely the trademark Twain humor to be found throughout the book, with moments that will have you laughing out loud if you try to visualize them. However, there is an important underlying story and lesson about racism, friendship, loyalty, and human decency. That is what makes this story one which I have read and reread several time since I first was assigned to read it in 7th grade, more years ago than I care to admit!There have been school districts in the past that have banned this book because of concerns about racist content. This is something that needs to be addressed. There is certainly racism in this book. In fact, racist attitudes and the use of racists terminology is a consistent theme throughout the narrative. The problem is that if you just notice that it has racism, you truly miss the point that Twain was trying to make. Yes, Huck Finn had lots of racists views that he was raised with, as were most people of that time period. He doesn't question them, because he was always told that's how things were. Even the runaway slave, Jim, sees things much the same way because that was the culture of the region. What is so amazing about this book (and what makes me weep anytime a school district bans it) is that Huck Finn, without even realizing it, grows past his racist upbringing to see Jim as a true person and friend. He still used the same racist language, as does everyone in the book (and, historically, from that time period), but he sees past the words. Here is a young man that is convinced that people who help slaves escape are going to Hell. Once his friend is in danger of being sent back into slavery, he faces an internal struggle about what he should do. He finally comes to the decision, \\"I just reckon I'll go to Hell, then!\\" Reading that statement in the book almost makes you want to cheer out loud. Yes, he still uses language and sees some things in a way that is disgusting by modern standards, but he still took that step into the light and was willing to take such a bold risk for someone that he no longer saw as a slave, but as a man and a true friend.If there is a downfall to this novel, it is the language, and I don't mean the racist language (which still makes it a little uncomfortable to read even when you take its setting into account). Twain tries to capture the colorful language and terminology of the age and region, but the spelling and liberal use of apostrophes can be painful to the brain and even more painful if you try to read it out loud. I found that I had to read quickly through a lot of sections so that I wouldn't think too much about them and confuse myself on what he was trying to say.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a time honored classic that should be on most people's shelves. The controversy surrounding it and the language issue costs it a little in its review score, though. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I begged a grammar teacher to visit these characters!Christopher Slaterauthor of Trapped in Shades of Grey"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Tom Sawyer is a vibrant telling of life in a small town along the Mississippi River in the 1800's. Mr. Clemens paints great word pictures in a dialect of the times. Even though the offensive word for blacks is used, the reader should realize that the word is historically significant and tolerate its use as reflective of those times."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Largely plotless and oftentimes difficult to read because of the extensive use of particular vernaculars, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has, regardless, entered the American subconscious in the late 1800s and has stayed with us now into the 2000s. The work itself is a long, drawn out traveling blog of a young boy who needs to escape an abusive father, the rigors of becoming \\"civilized\\", and the confined spaces of a family oriented lifestyle. Huck Finn, not yet 14, is an inventive, creative, but also rational individual who's sense of adventure is only rivaled by Tom Sawyer. Where Tom creates plot and adventure and suspense, Huck is willing to allow life to take it's course, like the river he travels upon, and will simply adjust to the bumps encountered on his travels.Huck leaves his old life behind and begins his travels and ends his travels with Jim, a black man who, despite the time period, is the single most rational individual in the entire story. In fact, his one liners and his ability to have a sincere sense of empathy and care for Huck raises him above the other adult characters that are riddled throughout the story. More often than not, the duo will encounter murderers, swindlers, and drunkards that don't have a single redeeming quality about them to compare with the soft spoken, attentive, and motherly association that we garner from Jim.Despite being relatively without a plot the book is simply about life, namely the life of an American boy and all the adventures he can get into when allowed to roam free. That mentality is the very embodiment of our desires, our wishes to travel, explore, to understand, to live, and to feel free. Huck feels the most freedom when it's quiet, away from the noise and bustle of cities and towns, and when the river is peaceful and the sky is alight with the moon and stars. He sometimes feels alone, but rarely lonely. He accepts Jim's company and is happy to have him as a traveling companion while nature takes its course.Though it was written as a sequel to Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain creates a stand-alone story that has captured the minds and hearts of any exploratory individual, whether as a child or as an adult and it will most likely continue to captivate us for many years to come."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Like many people of my age (62), I read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as a child because at that time it was widely perceived to be a child's or young adult's book. This is unfortunate as it is not nor has it ever been directed at the young. In my rereading I discovered for the first time why it is still called the original great American novel. Huckleberry, like Twain, is opinionated and perceptive. His narration and point of view drive the novel forward. Rather than relegate this work to the children's shelves or castigate it as racist, folks should embrace this novel for what it is, a bildungsroman that shows the growth of a country as well as the growth of its young protagonist."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"In Adventures of Huckleberry Finn we see the initial paragraph introducing this story as a flashback. Huckleberry Finn, or Huck, starts to recount how he and his friend Tom Sawyer discovered a lot of money and right from the start we see a style of writing that mimics that of an under-educated youth. It is wrought with spelling and grammar mistakes, which help to develop the character of Huck and you instantly understand his education and maturity level, or lack thereof. This first person recounting of events does a lot to draw you into how Huck saw the world around him.The setting of this book is in the mid 19th Century, starting in Missouri in a small town on the Mississippi River. The locations change many times in the book as a main theme of the story is escape. Huck initially escapes life under the guardianship of Miss Watson and Widow Douglas, then he ends up having to sneak away to escape his father. After this escape he discovers the slave Jim and embarks on a journey to help him escape to Ohio to break free from his slavery.When Huck meets Jim we see an internal struggle, the conflict of the overall story. Huck wonders if he should turn in Jim, since he is someone's property after all. At this point in the story he decides not to turn Jim in and then starts his transformation.The two of them begin to build a friendship that ultimately changes Huck. You see a shift in his views on people and slavery that continues all the way through the end of the work. During this building of friendship you slowly see a shift in how Jim is portrayed in the story, from a very racist caricature of a black man to a friend and equal with Huck; from a slave fleeing captivity to a free man. We see Jim's compassion when he doesn't let Huck see the dead body in a flooded house they find, which we later discover was Huck's own father.Another interesting little sub-story within this work is when Huck and Jim get separated as a steamship floods their raft. We see Huck get taken in by a man name Buck and his family the Grangerfords who are locked in a feud with a rival family the Sheperdsons. The whole thing turns to a major conflict as Buck's sister runs away with a man from the Sheperdsons. This is a parallel to the well-known Romeo and Juliet story that we all can relate to, and in this conflict we see the excitement as Huck barely escapes alive.This story goes on to tell the story of this little adventure but much of it is little more than enjoyable reading, except for the introduction of two new characters, King and Duke. This is important because this leads to the re-introduction of the conflict, whether Huck should help Jim or turn him in. The King, ends up playing the Judas of the story and sells his information about the escaped slave Jim. This leads to the crisis and climax.Jim gets seized and help on a plantation, which we find out is owned by Huck's friend Tom's aunt and uncle. At this point we see Huck overcome his conflict. He feels that he is helping to steal Miss Watson's property (Jim) but decides that regardless of the consequence, he was going to do it. When Huck goes to investigate he is mistaken for Tom and uses this opportunity to gather his information.The story the goes into the intricate escape plan that Tom and Huck devise. We see an exciting scene where Tom is shot in the leg and Jim stays behind to help him. Jim's decision ultimately leads to the failure of this attempt and he is taken. This leads into the final resolution, as we find out that Jim was already free. Miss Watson had died and freed him in her will.This is a very fun story with a few sub-stories included. The overall theme is escape and the conflict, crisis and climax are all very apparent. The resolution of the story comes as a welcomed surprise as any reader would develop a connection with Jim just as the first person narrator, Huck, does. This is a well structured work and a very interesting read."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I received Paul Newman's reading of the Adventures of Tom Sawyer as a gift. It's a stunner, a wonderfully entertaining two and half-hours of fun and thrills. I enjoyed it so much I decided to get Jack Lemmon's companion reading of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Wow, this performance is so enthralling I listened to the entire audio book in one sitting. The book is written with Huckleberry Finn as the first person narrator. Who would have ever imaged it but Jack Lemmon is Huckleberry Finn. Two time Academy Award winner Lemmon's Huck is full of pluck and cunning, mischief and excitement when he escapes from his Pap, confronts the King and the Duke and plots with Tom Sawyer. His contrition after playing the mean joke of Jim after they separated in the fog is palpable. And the famous Lemmon mannerisms are everywhere in evidence. Mr. Lemmon seems to be enjoying every moment of Mark Twain's wry and wonderful writing; he makes the characters live. I really loved this."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Have you read Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn? If not, then I highly recommend you do. Mark Twain sure knew what he was doing when he wrote Huck Finn. He was sending out a message to the world. As Huck once said &quot;Humans can be awful mean to each other&quot;. I believe that this is the message that Mark Twain wanted to get across. An ignorant little boy, Huck Finn, defies all that he knows when rescuing Jim. He even recognizes that we are all the same underneath the skin; we are all human. Huckleberry Finn is the most unlikely hero. As aforesaid, he was ignorant and unconventional. Knowing nothing, he set out into the world and had amazing adventures. He might have been uneducated but he certainly knew what was most important in life. As a literary piece, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is amazing. It drags a bit in the middle but it picks up again and has the perfect ending. If you haven't read it, read it now. It will enlighten you and enrich your knowledge more than you can imagine. Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will always have a place on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I must disagree with the few teenagers who complain about such a masterpiece as Huck Finn.

What truly burns me is the *adult* children who take it upon themselves to *ban* books, such as Huck Finn, based solely on the presence of six-letter &quot;n&quot; words which they've been taught to hate -- without properly knowing why, as they haven't even bothered to read the hated book which best explains it.

This is the &quot;darkest&quot; American novel I know of, which is probably one of the reasons that induced Hemingway to say that American literature begins and ends here. Like Conrad's Marlowe, Huck is journeying &quot;upriver&quot; into a region of the human psyche best left unobserved by any but the most stalwart of heart. His eyes are opened on the voyage. His ultimate character is shaped by what he experiences. His is a passage from naivete to wide-opened observer.What begins as an idyllic raft trip turns more and more turbulent the closer to Illinois he gets. What begins as a Tom Sawyer lark becomes more and more Faulknerian. Yes,it is a voyage from inexperience to experience. Yes, it is a quest story. Yes, it is a novel about man's inhumanity to man, etc. etc. But there is so much more at work here..Twain shared much in common with Swift. We are looking primarily at the underbelly of humanity here, not its bright spots. The ending, as pointed out by numerous critics,is problematical. Exactly what is Huck's position vis-a-vis Jim? Has all that has occured previously been given up in the moment he is counseled by Tom? Is Huck so ready to overthrow his hard-fought allegiance in order to conform to society's dictums? Twain offers no clear resolution, but this should not keep this novel from being taught in high school or college classrooms, when students are given the liberty to consrtuct their own conclusions.Personally, I believe what Twain is telling us is that we can never exhibit our true natures in society without risking being stoned to death. Conventional pressures have not really changed that much from Twain's day to the present. Just by espousing my support for this novel I am opening myself up to criticism aimed my way from the righteously correct. American society hasn't changed all that much. Religious piety and indignation has been supplanted by political correctness. Harriet Beacher Stowe, bless her, is alive and well. There are people out there convinced that Uncle Tom's Cabin is a more significant work than Huck Finn. What would Vonnegut say here?"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"For such a simple story, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn often proves to be elusive for its readers. Here are some guideposts to look out for:This story is told by Huck, and is not in the classic shape of a novel. Rather it is a precursor to Ulysses and Remembrance of Things Past, where other great writers attempted to capture the essence of our internal dialogue.Huck is also hiding a lot from himself. You as the reader can quickly see through him, though. He is trying to put a brave and positive face on a very dangerous situation. We all do that.Huck also has to face himself before the book ends. What really is important? We can all spout a lot of moral talk, but what we do is critical.If we lived in Huck's times, we would also see that there was an emormous moral dilemma. The rules of humanity were often not applied to black people. You could choose to go along and feel like a hypocrite (if you thought about what you were doing), or you could do the right thing. Sensitive people of that day often found it hard to do the right thing. If your neighbors were open-minded and you lived in the North, you might do one thing. If your neighbors were slaveholderes and lived in the South, you might do another.Also, think about the trip down the river as an analogy for going through life. How will it turn out if you just let your direction go with the current?"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"If you have never actually read it, or it's been a while WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?

The only reason I wouldn't rate this particular book a five star is because it's not exactly the one I was looking for. I've been reading this book in school, and the one we used in school was slightly more durable looking, and included definitions of some confusing parts in the book. This book didn't have those footnotes, and in fact it also didn't have chapter titles, so it may get a little confusing for you to navigate.But other than that, it was perfect.

Yet here I am reviewing it, anyway. I must admit (not without a fair share of embarrassment) that I just now got around to reading this American classic for the first time. I never had to read it in school, and to some degree I felt pretty familiar with the novel even without having read it - that's just how popular and important Huckleberry Finn is to the social fabric of America.Nowadays, with all the politically correct liberals having escaped their Berkeley zoo and run amuck all over the nation, many of our young people are told not to read this novel. In fact, legions of voices cry out for poor little Huck Finn, that beloved rascal of literature, to be banned from schools and libraries - for the crime of using the n-word, a word commonly used by both blacks and whites up and down the Mississippi during Huck's time (not to mention numerous hip-hop artists of today). Turning a blind eye to the fact that Twain made the slave Jim a noble, human, easy-going fellow with his heart always in the right place (unlike Huck's other companions), the literary fascists contend that this novel is poison to the minds of youngsters. One can only imagine the reaction Mark Twain would have to the hysteria his book incites in liberals today (although he would certainly not be surprised, as he had to fight censorship of this book from the date of its publication).One of the great ironies of the \\"Ban Huck Finn\\" brouhaha is the fact that young people will surely find this novel much more entertaining than the vast majority of other literary classics they are asked to read. This is a very funny book, especially once \\"the duke and the dauphin\\" arrive on the scene and, later, when Tom Sawyer meticulously plans out Jim's rescue from captivity (no thanks to the captors, who didn't even try to make it as difficult as Tom says it should be). Young readers will also relate to and understand this book, a fact which should give rise to spirited discussion of it in class. Don't we want our kids to be excited about books and reading?The more outrageous the hissy fits thrown by liberal critics over the \\"dangers\\" of Huck Finn, the more important it is for everyone, young and old alike, to go out and read Twain's novel. Whenever someone tells you not to read something, it's important that you go out there and read it - and discover whatever it is the book banning loonies don't want you to know. Prove to them that you are intelligent enough to know the difference between the social values of the past and present, fiction and reality, right and wrong, etc. Think for yourself.

It is a shame that so many students feel \\"forced\\" to read this. Reading this book is a privilege and a delight.

But after reading it and discussing it in AP English, I discovered just how brilliant it was. Huck is caught in an eternal struggle between doing what society tells him is right and doing what he feels in his heart. It's a classic Pikaresque type novel, and a funny one at that.

Read the book again."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I can't even say for sure how many times (four? five?) I've read \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" but each time I notice something new and admire something different. Having read several biographical accounts of Mark Twain's life in recent years, however, I learned some background that explains an aspect of the book that always puzzled me: how a book that is a sequel to an adventure story for boys seems to be of a different genre entirely.Many readers come to \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" via its predecessor, \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" Sure enough, the second book opens not long after the first book, and the first chapters of \\"Huck\\" resemble the tone and style of \\"Tom.\\" Twain's initial plan was indeed to write another boyhood adventure story; he began the sequel soon after \\"Tom Sawyer\\" was published, and so we read about how Huck's low-life father desires the treasure Tom and Huck found in the previous story, about Huck's escape from his father's cruelty, and about his comical disguises as a girl and as a survivor of a wreck on the river. And then Twain set the work aside when he reached Chapters 15 and 16, in which Huck and Jim take off on their now-famous raft journey.It was three years before Twain worked on the book again, and by that time he'd decided that \\"Huck Finn\\" would not be a simple, episodic adventure tale for children. It took Twain another five years to finish it. During that period he wrote a travel book, \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" (in which he included an eventually deleted passage from \\"Huck Finn\\"), and you can see its influence on the river adventures of Huck. More significantly, the centrality of Jim to the story transformed the novel into a work on race, slavery, freedom, and life on the frontier--hardly the stuff of children's literature.This amalgamation explains why the early chapters seem to be written for kids (much like \\"Tom Sawyer\\") and why the book still resonates with so many youngsters. It develops into a different book altogether the moment Huck and Jim step on that raft, become fugitives, and eventually head \\"down the river\\"-- away from the promise of freedom upstream and toward the territory where the institution of slavery is even more inhumane. (A constant fear among slaves in Twain's later novel \\"Puddn'head Wilson\\" is to be sold \\"down the river.\\") Huckleberry Finn--both the character and the book--loses the aura of childhood innocence; as a result, Huck's journey is much less like \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and more like Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness.\\""},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is considered by many to be the American novel; the work that most closely represents the America experience. What then makes this such a great book to read, and such an embodiment of America? Many things.First, this book addresses the issue of color racism thoroughly and subtly from multiple viewpoints. The latter includes the naive reluctant racist (Huck), the naive apathetic racist (Tom), those discriminated against (Jim), and of course the active, enthusiastic racists (most everyone else we meet in the book). Racism is examined from both the mental viewpoints; how individuals consider others of the same and different race, and from the social viewpoint; how individuals of different races interact in public and private. This emphasis on race points to the heart of American history; few other countries have struggled with skin color bias as long and as deeply as the US.The second major point examined in this book is slavery; an issue strongly related to the first. Slavery as existed in other countries was rarely as delineated along color lines as it was in the USA. And rarely was it defined as a feature of different skin colors. For example, slavery throughout Europe was used as a form of criminal punishment. Likewise, slavery in the Middle East was a side effect of military conquest of one group of people by another. Not so in America. Here it was an inherent feature of how two races dealt with each other.The third theme of this book that strongly embodies the American experience is the fractured / divided family. Walk through any neighborhood in China, India, Japan, Mexico, Egypt, Ireland or most any other country, and most of the children you encounter live with their parents, and most of the parents you meet live with their children. Unique among nations is America where many children do not live with both their biological parents. True now, this was true in the mid-1800s when this book's story takes place. Jim is searching for his family and Huck has left his. At the end of the book, they meet Tom, another boy who is not being raised by his parents. In fact, the two most stable families nuclear families encountered in this book are the Grangerfords and Shepherdsons.This leads of course to a fourth feature of this book that is reflective of America; the family feud. For a country where everyone has so much, both back then and now in the early 21st century; Americans seem to have problems with neighbors. Nowadays, everyone wants a house with big yards to maximize separation between them and their neighbors, and neighbors rat on each other to their homeowners assocation. Back then, they had feuds.The fifth topic dealt with in this book is the con. Unique to America is the role of the con artist in our history and culture. Consider Jim and Tammy Fay Baker, Robert Millikan and Charles Keating of modern times, and Ponzi of the early 1900s. In this book the reader encounters numerous cons and con artists. Huck himself cons Jim at the end of the book whereby he concocts a series of escape plans that puts Jim thru a series of ordeals, all for the naive amusement of Huck.Having read several versions of Twain's classic by different publishers; this reviewer has only praise for this version. The book itself is a great classic and worthy of anyones time and effort in reading it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huck is a poor boy with an alcoholic father who lives in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri. Huck and his friend Tom Sawyer find gold in a cave and get six thousand dollars apiece, which judge Thatcher puts into a trust. Huck was then adopted by the widow Douglass and she tries to refine him. Huck's father comes to town and demands custody and the money. He can't get it so he kidnaps Huck and takes him to a log cabin. Huck escapes by faking his own death with pig blood and escaping to the river. There he meets a runaway slave named Jim. Soon they find out from a woman that her husband is seeing smoke from the island. Later Huck and Jim meet a pair of con artists that end up selling Jim to a local farmer. But Tom and Huck manage to free Jim, and Huck heads to the west. I would recommend this book anyone.The characters in this book where very interesting. Huck, the protagonist, is thirteen and hates it when people try to refine him. He likes to be on his own. Tom Sawyer, also a protagonist, is Huck's imaginative friend. Pap, the antagonist, is Huck's mean greedy alcoholic father, who later in the story kidnaps Huck and keeps him trapped in his log cabin.Huck is a rowdy boy stereotype in this story and even makes a point of that in the beginning of the book. As you start off reading, the narrator, Huck, says that he dislikes his new life of cleanliness, manners, and church. Also if Tom wasn't there to encourage him to start a new life he would have run away in the very beginning.I enjoyed reading this book because I read the Adventure of Tom Sawyer but I never knew that the Adventure of Huckleberry Finn was the sequel to that. This tied into the Adventure of Tom Sawyer because the money they made in the first book actually caused the problem in the second one. After reading both of these books I am still a fan of Mark Twain books.This is a very well written book that anyone should consider reading. It took me a while to read this book but in the end it was more than worth it. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Before the beginning of Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, renowned author Mark Twain writes: \\"Notice- Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot.\\" After reading this, human nature compels us to think one of two things, either \\"There are a motive, moral, and plot in this and I am going to find them,\\" or \\"I guess he's trying to tell me this is supposed to be fun. I like to read for fun!\\" Either way, you'll be reading it within the next minute.When you've reached the words \\"The End. Yours truly, Huck Finn\\" 220 pages later, your suspicions, which there are a lot of in this book, will be verified. The book is a fun read for everyone above the age of nine or ten (although it might appeal most to those age 13-20), and also has a very definite plot and multiple morals.The story begins where The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, another classic by Twain, left off. Huck is living with the Widow Douglas when Tom organizes a band of robbers, which doesn't last very long. However, the fun doesn't begin until Huck Finn's dad, a whiskey/alcohol addict, comes to town. After being \\"kidnapped\\" by his father and living in conditions similar to those of the underworld, the teenage Huck concocts an escape plan.After his escape, Huck, as the narrator throughout the story, tells of his adventures. Among these adventures was rejoining with Jim, a runaway slave on the widow's estate and rafting down the mighty Mississippi with hopes of freedom, and while rafting, stumbled upon, and contributed to an ancient feud between two families. Huck and Jim then met up with fugitives who claimed to be royalty and helped them earn money. They did this first by pretending to be a troupe of traveling actors and various other things, and then acting as a rich dead person's brothers to get the thousands of dollars in money granted in the man's will. After that, Huck pretended to be a nephew of the man who bought his friend Jim. It turned out he was acting as Tom Sawyer! Huck soon met up with the real Tom Sawyer and tried to free Jim. In the end, all became well again and Jim became free, which he had unknowingly already been due to his recently deceased owner's will.As long as you're not offended by the \\"n-word\\" used to describe African Americans, this adventuresome book will shortly be a favorite!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I love Mark Twain, and this is Twain at his best! This is one of the best American novels of all time, in my opinion. Twain is very funny and irreverent."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I read this book after enjoying reading Tom Sawyer to my 5-year old. Firstly, this book also stands out for its readability: There is a flow and abundance of detail that pulls you in permanently. This is due, in part, to its being written in the voice of a kid, of course, but we should also credit Twain's efficiency with language. Twain can plot through the logistics of a story, maintaining continuity and credibility (barely), but without getting bogged down with too much complexity.The characters are real and timeless. The episode that convinced me that this was a great book happens early on: Huck's drunken, good-for-nothing dad goes on a tirade, blaming his woes on the guv'ment and the negroes. It's a perfect and timeless little slice of life and takes up barely a page. You could just see Twain thinking through all the little morals and wondering how he was going to include pieces of his philosophy in this story. Interesting thing about the Huck character: He is not learned or wise, being young, he has a quick sense, he is conniving, he lies constantly, and yet, judged from a higher plane, he seems to be morally perfect!The author's admonition to the reader not to find motives or morals in the book is obviously just ironic bunkum. This is Aesop's fables combined with Homer's Odyssey with a little Rousseau thrown in, brought up to date."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Although Huckleberry Finn was an AWSOME book the little details were really really hard to follow. I read the same part like three times and i still didnt get it. Once you start to understand it a little bit better then it gets way better. I also loved the whole conflict in the story. It really makes you think :} Also it is kind of funny ( at times) Overall Huckleberry Finn has a good Plot and good moral but if you dont pay attention you will be left in the dark :{"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"That's right folks, Mark Twain uncovered the mystery of the Lost King, son of the beautiful Marie Antoinette. He is was alive and living in America. Along with a Duke, Huck Finn, and Jim, they travel down the Mississippi putting on shows for the good river people.Huck faked his own death to escape his father, Jim ran away for fear of being sold, and they catch up with the other two. Jim talks to a hair ball he pulled from the fourth stomach of an ox to tell the future. Jim also has to dress up like a diseased Arab and stay on the raft for fear of being discovered as a runaway slave.Along with Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry makes escape plans for Jim after he is captured. Little does Huck know that Aunt Polly is on her way down for a visit and calls the whistle on the whole thing. Including the part that Jim has already been set free.This is a great book. It's unfortunate that it is not in school libraries because it contains the word 'nigger' numerous times. Maybe if people stopped being so politically correct, they could open their eyes and minds to this and other great literary works."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"Alright then I'll go to hell\\" Huck's great moment of loyalty to Jim, and decision to let that personal loyalty override the traditional conventional morality that straightjackets him is one of the great memorable moments of the book. Another is the \\" lighting out of the territory ahead of the rest\\" the near final word of the American adventurer on- the- road again, the proof that in Quixote's words it is the ' road not the inn' that matters, and it is the great going on like the river itself which is what we want when we are young. America as a dream of always going westward and the river as moving on and on with us moving along with it , and its never coming somehow to the sea. Huckelberry Finn the great colloquial classic in which Mark Twain succeeds through speaking the many dialects of his time in putting American literature in closer touch with the Everyday . He connected American Literature with the heartland a moved the whole enterprise down- to- earth in a more humorous and realistic way. In childhood it was the scary Duke and Dauphin that almost turned me away from the book. And I must admit that there were many pages which seemed to me to be there just to make me turn them faster. But in the end and somehow there is that picture of a time, of Huck and Tom and Jim and The Widow Douglas and the Judge and of America itself more American and more rural than the American of my small - town Troy, New York streets. The river rolling on with more life than I could imagine and the dreams of a different time and a different world strange to me then. O America my old home and lost country , land of my childhood and youth , where have you gone ? still rolling on whether I am there to see you and read you, or not ."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This was a required reading for my son's class at school. Although he enjoyed the story line, the use of the local slang (written out phonetically ) was difficult for him to read and distracting to the story, he felt."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book, which is more of a companion to \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" than a sequel, has Twain displaying his talents on all fronts. His classic wit shines through as does his knack for expressing deep observations about life through the life and events of a child. This book lacks some of the mystique that Tom Sawyer has and the plot moves more slowly. This is still great reading, however, as Twain's effort here is better than many authors' strongest moments. If you liked Tom Sawyer, you will enjoy this book. If you're curious to try Twain, I would recommend Tom Sawyer before giving this one a try."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Let's face it, the novel is flawed. At best Twain is commenting on race poorly; at best he's blind to his own racism. Want to judge for yourself, you can read it again or give it a listen here--it's the complete text."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This classic tale is a story of boys on a raft trip. If you haven't read this novel, you owe it to yourself to check it out."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" by Mark Twain is an absolute must read. Twain masterfully creates an interesting story line while staying true to the times, setting, and language. Huck's tale of his adventure down the Mississippi will keep you turning the pages. It is very interesting because things happen when you least expect it. This is an amazing story full of adventure and fun.But of course, you will find the character's speech to be either annoying or downright confusing. But remember, this takes place in the past! It was normal for people to talk like that. So try your best to translate the character's speech. All in all, this book is an unforgettable and amazingly adventurous. When I read this book,(I thought)it should be in the top 5-50 best classic of all time.by Pra"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This was a great book. Very adventurous and fun to read. I like how it went from aventure to adventure. One of the best books I've read."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I have just finished reading this book to my two boys (7 and 10). It was a bit long for them really, especially the younger one. And yet it is a very engaging novel that had them periodically laughing, or breathless with their eyes popping out. It is at times a bit grim, and at times a bit farcical. It's also pretty hard to read aloud with all those accents and voices. But it is above all a story of resourcefulness, of conscience and of survival. And, of course, it is sufficiently exotic in time and place for modern Australians, as we are, to add an extra dimension to the enjoyment.If you plan to read it to your children, allow yourself plenty of time, be prepared to pause and discuss some of the issues (such as slavery, which we no longer tolerate and yet it was not necessarily the worst of outcomes for some people). You will enjoy it I am sure (and, yes, we had read Tom Sawyer earlier although that isn't necessary)"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I felt that this was generaly a good novel. I really enjoyed the life of huck fin. He is a very creative charctor and very inteligent. I like how he has the ability to set up a life, not be fully satisfied with it and decide to just run away and leave every thing behind.Not only is Huckleberry Finn an adventurous book, it also can be comical and light, though the book has a grave meaning, showing the wrongs in society at the time in the late 19th century. This book was also very good at showing you what life was like at the time. It shows how life was much simpler then.On a negative side i did not like how the book focused so much on racism. I do not reading about it and i would say that it strongly influinces this book. It does provide some good moral value on the subject though.Huck gets a lot done in the short period of time that the book is baised on. Huck is adopted by the well-intentioned but way too overprotective Widow Douglas(needless to say, Huck is none too pleased with the widow's attempts to turn him into an upstanding citizen). Because of this he runs away and soon after finds himself living with his abusive fauther. He enjoys this at first but eventully decides that the abuse is enough. So again he runs away and this is where he meets jim. Jim is a runaway slave and togeather as outcasts they become best friends.I would definitly reccomend this book to any age level. Even thew it can get boring at times it is worth it to keep goign for the action. I wish i would have read The adventures of tom sawyer first i feel like it would have given me a greater understanding of this book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"When I read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain in high school, it was possibly the first book I enjoyed that was assigned by a teacher. Twain's imagery puts the reader right beside Huck while he escapes &#65533;sivilization&#65533; and floats down the Mississippi river with his slave-gone-fugitive friend Jim. Huck&#65533;s innocent outlook on the world is both humorous and adorable. Huck&#65533;s respect for Jim is admirable. Even though Huck was brought up with Jim being a inferior slave, he still looks up to Jim. Also, I think that although Jim&#65533;s dialect adds to the effectiveness of the book, it is very difficult to understand. I think Twain writes it a little too much how the dialect sounds. I would recommend this book to anyone. It offers plenty of excitement and surprises."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"It seems that everybody's initial reaction after reading Huck Finn is to debate if Twain was a racist or not. It's a pity because such a debate takes away from the greatness of the book. Was he a racist? I don't know, I never met the man. History and his own writing would seem to support that he was. Do I think any less of him, despite my opinion that he might have been racist? Not in the least. His racism was born out of a time when racism was the norm and rooted more in fear and culture rather than hate. Perhaps ignorance would be a better term, but I dare not call this man ignorant. I really don't think he was a mean hearted man, but being nice doesn't exclude one for being a racist. Read the book, you may form a different opinion."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I read this book in high school and I was blown away. Huck Finn has been on the banned books list for a while, I really don't understand why (except for the unappropriate word that Twain uses). Many people assume its a racist novel because it uses that bad word, but the central theme of this book is that Huck abandons what society has told him, and helps and befriends a run away slave. This book was really great and the ending is... um... interesting!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The book THE HUCKLEBERRY FINN, by Mark Twain is the best adventure book that I have ever read during the past few years.

There were times when they were in danger and almost died and there were times when they shared precious moments together like father and son, even though one is black and the other is white.

This book is hard to read because of their southern dialect and bad grammar. This book is very hard to read. If you can get used to thye language, then you will do fine with this book. It is a very adventurous book. There is always something crazy going on, which makes it a lot more exiting and fun to read. Not only is the whole theme and plot and characters wonderful, but there is also a great authors style. Mark Twain did an excellent job of first of all capturing the setting of a hundred years ago in the South, by making sure you got the feel and image in your mind of where this takes place. He also writes from Huckleberry Finns prospective, and does a wonderful job on trying to really become that character, and you can tell in the things he writes. Mark Twain is an awesome writer and makes it half the reason it is so good. If you enjoy books with much adventure then read &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;.

However the edition I received, which was printed by Oxford World Classics, was missing pages 123-154. Luckily, I could go on line and actually read those pages (chapters 21 through 25) but that did not make up for the hole in the book that is now part of my library. Very disappointing! This is a classic I had hoped to pass on to the younger members of my family.I rated this edition 2 stars (rather than 1 star) because it did include Twain's \\"The Raftsmen's Passage\\" in an appendix as a bonus."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"You'll notice pretty quickly when you pick this up that Huck doesn't spell too good and his grammar isn't so hot either. But if you look a little more closely, you find that he sure knows how to use the semi-colon, and his sentence structure is picture perfect. Mr. Twain may have decided that he was going to have some fun with his charming narrator, but he sure wasn't going to sacrifice good writing to do so.The novel, as everyone knows, is a masterpiece, and works splendidly on every level. Plot, character development, theme; everything is here. Anybody reading this review has probably read the book several times and moreover has probably read about it a dozen more so it's pretty certain that my little review is not going to add much. I would, however, like to comment on something which struck me while reading it most recently, which is how richly it evokes middle America of the mid-nineteenth century. In other words, as well as being literature of the first rank, Huckleberry Finn also functions as a thorough and fascinating historical document of a time and place that every year sinks deeper and deeper into our collective memory.Here he is describing Uncle Silas' place in Arkansas upon seeing it for the first time. \\"It was one of these one-horse cotton plantations and they all look alike. A rail fence round a two-acre yard; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps, like barrels of a different length, to climb over the fence with . . . some sickly grass-patches in the big yard, but mostly it was bare and smooth, like an old hat with the nap rubbed off; big double log house for the white folks--hewed logs with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar, and these mud stripes been white-washed some time or another; round log-kitchen, with a big, broad open but roofed passage joining it to the house . . . hound asleep there in the sun; more hounds asleep round about . . . outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch; then the cottonfields begins, and after the fields the woods.\\"The first thing that strikes you about this is how . . . impoverished this all is, especially compared to how we live today. And this is a cotton-field owner with a number of slaves! But this was the south: rural, poor, hot, languid. Oh, yes, we are all familiar with the palatial southern mansion from novels like Gone With the Wind; I suspect that most of the South in the 1840s was closer to Huck's description than to Margaret Mitchell's.Here's Huck's description of the town in which the King and Duke put on their first show: \\"The stores and houses was most all old, shackly, dried-up frame concerns that hadn't ever been painted; they was set up three or four feet above ground on stilts, so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was overflowed. The houses had little gardens around them, but they didn't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson-weeds, and sunflowers, and ash-piles, and old curled up boots and shoes, and pieces of bottles, and rags, and played-out tinware . . . There was generly hogs in the garden, and people driving them out.\\" Charming, eh? Of course, we in our modern twenty-first century aren't immune to such slovenliness. Sometimes, historical descriptions remind us that things don't change much.Along with his brilliant observations of humanity and the human habitat the novel also contains breathtaking descriptions of nature, especially the Mississippi River. There's heavy timber on the Missouri side, mountains on the Illinois side, the lights of St. Louis: \\"We run nights, and laid up and hid daytimes; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up--nearly always in the dead water under a towhead . . . Next we slid into the water and had a swim, so as to freshen up and cool off; then we sat down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee-deep, and watched the daylight come. Not a sound anywhere--perfectly still--just like the whole world was asleep, only sometimes the bullfrogs a cluttering, maybe. The first thing you see, looking away over the water, was a kind of dull line--and that was the woods on t'other side.\\" How wonderfully evocative this is; how it makes one ache to experience such things!Again, the novel is so much more than this. I'm not going to bother with the theme and the plot and the characters--what else is there to say?--but I can not finish this without giving an example or two of the wonderful humor contained in here. Here's the charming Huck after sneaking into the circus under the tent: \\"I ain't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ain't no other way, but there ain't no use in wasting it on them.\\" And when the King and the Duke run on hard times: \\"First they done a lecture on temperance, but they didn't make enough for them both to get drunk on. Then, in another village, they started a dancing-school; but they didn't know no more than how to dance than a kangaroo does, so the first prance they made the general public pranced in and pranced them out of town . . . \\"Oh, how rich this is. Rich and funny and lovely and hilarious. Read it for the pure entertainment contained in here, if nothing else."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The most charming element of Mark Twain's writings is that he masques his utter disdain at the defects and foibles of society under a superficial layer of humour. Indeed the simmering screen of wit and hilarisity so readily associated with this great 19th.century American novelist lends an air of deceit to his work. Now,humour and comic satire have always been great writers' subtle instruments to deflate the ever-expanding balloon of society's corrupt lifestyle and the gift of employing boisterous means to mirror moral decay is firmly exploited by Mark Twain in his remarkable novel \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\",arguably the best work of the author.For those who haven't read Twain's previous book \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\",a meeting with Huckleberry Finn for the first time would prove both awkward and interesting. Huck Finn,as we know from his plethora of adventures with Tom Sawyer in the aforementioned book,is a mischievous urchin always in the uttermost fear from his drunken,never to do well father. At the end of this book,we discern Huck Finn to be fed up with being,or rather trying to be,a decent,well-furnisheeeed lad and even runs away from his adopted mother-of-sorts Old Widow Douglas only to be brought back by Tom Huck takes up the funny and great tale of boyish mischiefs from there and himself accounts in his very own American dialect in a conversational tone that imbibes the readr's interest and takes him through his various adventures,misadventures,joy,agony and an innocent and gradual maturation.Huck is saturated with putting on a fresh and fair appearance and longs to escape the realm of Old Widow Douglas,Miss Watson and others propagating 'civilization' and returns to his old familiar,accuatomed ways of 'uncivilized' living. His drunken father's whim to take him back with him and his fortunes enentually proves to be a blessing in disguise as he escapes from his perpetually inebrited and cruel father only to meet with another fugitive in the shape of Jim,a \\"nigger\\" and and slave of Miss Watson. Jackson Island proves too insecure an abode to sustain life with the whole of St.Petersburg hot on their heels and so Huck and jim make a raft and flow along the Mississippi river and what \\"a raft of trouble\\" their floating journey would turn out to be.The eponymous protagonist of the novel and the frightenrd slave encounters numerous characters on their journey. Huck Finn undergoes changes in his perceptual capabilities as he decodes the latent meanings in ordinary and seemingly harmless folks' intensions. Most notably Huck and Jim meet two men,old in years but youngat deceit,and enforcrd by trying circumstances to accept them in their journey,are subjected to myriad critical moments,which when congregated,direct at the moral corruption of people. Huck and Jim have to harmonise reluctantly with these two characters in their success in fooling a whole village and then in attempting rob an innocent family of its money. Huck learns to refine the good from the evil and foolowing the echo of a pure conscience saves many a misfortune from crashing upon a number of innocents. Huck and Jim are finally successfully in absconding these two men but land up in Uncle Silas Plhep's place,two miles below Pikesville,and then the inevitable takes place. Huck is kept back under the care of Aunt Sally,Uncle Silas's wife.\\"The Adventures of Hucleberry Finn\\" reflects a typical Mark Twain---witty,hilarisity and sarcastic. This book goes much deeper and is more intense in the sense of exposing the debaucheryand sheer foolishness that society favours to live in. What the American great sketched in \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\", he finishes addind the final touches in this novel---the abject custom of slave-trade and racism. The easy and nonchalent manner in which the poor villagers are taken in by the two \\"Royal Nonesuch rapscallions\\" mirror the intellectual bankruptcy of humans in a smaller landscape. Hollow laws are mocked at and individual pecularity ridiculed. But Twain doesn't make this essentially boys' book a dark,exhaustive social novel and riddled with with comedy and fun,this novel is then added by a hint of romanticism when the representative of all boys Tom Sawyer arrives onto the scene and both enthralls and pleases te audience the audience with the implementation on his notion of heroism and style.The plethora of dialects used in the book do make it difficult for the reader to properly absorb their meanings but with the passage of time,he gets to comprehend them and finds them somewhat funny. The word \\"nigger\\" too is an utterly controversial one as scattered through the pages actually divert the major essence of the book. And Jim's marvellous escape from the jaws of death after being bitten by a rattlesnake becomes a trifle too romantic. Is it really possible to survive a rattlesnake bite that easily?Even after taking the flaws into consideration,one must ackowledge its conguency to the life of a boy undermined by a boozed father,uncompromising circumstances and bitter society. Huck finn is the eternal effigy of a street-urchin captivated within the narrow scope of civilization and in his urge to free himself from the shackles of civil codes,this \\"poor devil\\" confronts the harh realities of life and through his innocent,pure perception,learns more about the world and the umpteen dark aspects of it. His explicit desire to return to his old days of uncivilized manners is never realised as escaping from Widow Douglas,he falls into the grasp of Aunt Sally. Indeed the book ends in the rstoration of all pieces of the jigsaw puzzle and pehaps this fairy-tale gratification is a vital part of life that propels us to carry on with our own adventures."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"As a high school teacher, a question we always face when teaching the classics is... will my students think this boring, irrelevant, and inscrutable? While many of my students struggled through Hawthorne, Emerson, and Thoreau, Mark Twain's Huck Finn caught their interest more deeply.What makes this classic appealing to high school students is its taboo character, its humor, and its characters. The novel is a taboo; knowing that the book has been banned in places all across the nation rouses students (\\"oooo... they say we can't read it? I'm in!\\"). With heated issues like the use of the n-word, smoking and stealing, students are in. Further, the novel is genuinely funny, even to teenagers. Huck is honest to the bone-his observations about conventions are amusing. And the messes he gets into with Jim (among other things, dressing up like women) are hilarious. Finally, the characters are genuinely likeable-students can relate to Huck's restlessness and mistrust of authority, and can despise the rigidity of the Widow.There are many particularities about Huck that students will love. For one, he smokes and questions traditional things like prayer and Christianity. He hates school and doesn't see the point of wearing nice clothes. He sneaks out late at night. There is one scene that students will particularly find amusing. Huck has run away from the widow and ventured into town incognito to find out what people are saying about him. The thing is, he is dressed like a girl. It is hilarious to read the descriptions of this lanky boy attempting to play the part of a sweet modest girl. The students read with interest and enjoy making fun of Huck here. They appreciate his wild side.There are a few precautions in teaching this book to high school students. There are passages that border on racism-not only the use of the n-word, but many a passage that underscore stereotypes about blacks. These are indeed a reflection of the time and do not invalidate the book, but they must be approached with high school students conscientiously and explicitly. Also, the dialect in the book is hard and frustrating for many of the students."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain contained many different morales.It help encouraged me to continue to listen to my heart. I love the friendship between Jim and Huck, and I know that no matter what color, or difference between society, a relationship and still survive.Many people from different place and time, took one look at this book and thought it was a racist book. What ever happened to the saying that wrote, \\"Don't judge a book by its cover?\\"Obviously, those who have read this book, knows the true meaning.I gave this book 5 five stars not just because my teacher told me too, and that I know she is reading this, but because it truely does deserve it. I appreciate my teacher giving us an opportunity to read this novel, because I know that I wouldn't have picked it up to read it. This novel taught me many different things, which I still cherish today. I recommend this novel to anyone who loves different great morales. I recommend this novel to everyone.

This is the most amazing classic American novel I have ever read, honest! It is the kind of book that you keep close to your heart forever. Not only is the language simple, you'll literally fall in love with the characters, each so intelligent and charming in their own way.I am very impressed with Mark Twain's writing ability. It is astonishing that the book he wrote so long ago is still so adventuresome, still so educational, still so universal today. Although I found this novel more exciting than \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" fans of the book that started it all will enjoy this too.This is an awesome read for a high school English class. You'll like the action and your teacher will like the thematic purpose! Even though America is now slave-free, \\"Huck Finn\\" reminds us of the evils of human bondage, ensuring that the U.S. will continue to maintain freedom for all. Listen to the words of Jim and the thoughts of Huck after Huck fakes his death--it'll all come together.Peace!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"a amazing masterpiece of american literature. I hate people who discredit it by saying its a racist book, by no means was it racist besides the use of the N word alot ( but that was how the southeners talked at that time ). the story many centers on how huck is struggling to help free a slave named Jim who is running away for freedom, and throughout it huck realizes its the right thing to do, even if it means going to hell for it ( so hence the quote above ). and its not only about slavery and racism, it also deals with child abuse, deceitful robbers pretending to be preachers fortune tellers and people like that, the horrors and stupidity of feuds, and also tries to tie in some light hearted good old fashion Tom and Huck type humor to keep hope alive for the characters in the book. Overall this book is basically about the horrors of human hatred and how its wrong, its supposed to be a eye opener to people to change their ways and see the truth of the matters such as racism for what they are. not at all racist, deserves way more than 5 stars, and one of the best classic books ever. A MUST HAVE"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"We all know \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is a 5-star novel. My complaint is about this particular edition of the book. The type is horizontally compressed to the extreme and the layout on the some of the pages was canted. Mark Twain and his readers deserve better treatment!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"My daughter's fourth-grade reading teacher urged that parents continue the practice of reading to their children, and specifically recommended ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN. It had been some 35-40 years since I had read the work myself, and so I relished the opportunity to read it again with my daughter.For those who have just arrived from another planet, HUCK FINN is 19th-century humor writer Mark Twain's episodic adventure tale about a good-hearted young rustic named Huckleberry Finn, who boldly and ingeniously escapes the abusive treatment of his father and sets off on a raft down the Mississippi River. Almost immediately, he is joined by a runaway slave of his previous acquaintance named Jim. The greater part of this lengthy novel consists of the various adventures they experience on the River, including an encounter with thieves aboard a sinking steamship, an escape from a bloody family feud, and, most prominently, various scrapes in the company of a couple of ne'er-do-wells who wish to be treated by Jim and Huck as the Duke of Bridgewater and the King of England. The novel is written as a sequel of sorts to THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER, but can be read independently of it.Two things stood out for me in reading HUCK FINN aloud; with respect to the language, the racial epithets and Twain's masterful attention to dialect. Let me start with the second: reading this story aloud really helps one appreciate the dialects that Mark Twain captures in the novel. Certainly, Jim's dialect is different from Huck's, but with careful attention to the language one will also notice the distinctive dialects of the other prominent characters such as the Duke and King. The first thing that stood out for me is how uncomfortable I was reading a literary work--even a classic such as this one--that liberally uses the \\"N\\" word and heaps other abuse on African Americans.This is one reason the book is banned by many libraries. In reading HUCK FINN with my daughter, however, I found that the story could be both a literary experience and a teaching tool. We could and did discuss the terrible power of words to hurt people, as well as the treatment of slaves in 19th-century America. Also, over the course of the novel, Huck Finn comes to see the humanity in Jim and sees him as a friend. Still, the novel doesn't entirely justify itself on those grounds, particularly after the humiliating treatment Jim experiences in the final chapters. Moreover, one might argue that, at least in parts of the story, Jim comes off as a racial caricature.Thus the novel does pose a challenge to the reflective and concerned parent. HUCK FINN is no doubt a masterpiece of fiction. It is, moreover, a humorous and sometimes moving adventure story (albeit one that moves at a deliberate pace compared to 21st-century YA fiction). Nonetheless, with respect to the racism that is pervasive in the novel, in reading this story to children one should be prepared to talk about its underlying social problems in the light of American history and contemporary mores.My daughter and I read this edition (Puffin Classics). It is a conveniently sized book that does not stint on font size to create a small format paperback. It would not be the edition I would choose permanently to grace one's library, but it is an excellent choice for children."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was assigned for my American Lit class this semester. The book is told in the voice of Huck Finn, the son of the town drunk. Huck starts the novel living with the widow Douglas, who wants to \\"sivilize\\" him. He won't put up with that, however, and starts on a series down the Mississippi river in which he befriends a runaway slave named Jim. I will refrain from giving any more thoughts on the book, because although I'm sure most people know the story, I don't want to ruin it for anyone."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"In Twain's most prized novel, he reveals the problems in a judgmental, racist society and shows the need for reform. He argues for an end to such acts throughout the novel with Huck's union with the runaway slave and his ultimate decision to leave such a tainted world for more free ground.Throughout Huck's travels, he struggles with the decision of whether or not he should stay loyal to his most precious and dedicated friend or turn him in just because he is a runaway slave, revealing the problems with judging people based on their skin color alone. In the beginning of the book, before Huck runs away to be alone, he would talk to Jim, Miss Watson's slave and property, on occasion, playing tricks on him with the help of his friends. But once he is able to escape society and discover the runaway Jim along his path, he decides to protect him and they band together in their journey. Although Huck repeatedly refers to him as \\"my Jim,\\" he sees him as more than property but more in the sense of him being his friend. It is only when Huck is able to abandon all the \\"ideals\\" that society had taught him that he accepts Jim as his friend, not at all associated with any means of property. He decides this one night, even willing to go to \\"hell\\" for his actions, showing how he achieves Twain's goal of ending the extensive judgment in society based on a man's outward appearances.As Huck learns more related lessons, he notices many problems that society has and decides that he does not want any part in such actions, abandoning those who do not share his views and becoming the full embodiment of Twain's wishes. Once Huck has decided that he will not dispose of Jim and return him to the hands of his owner he decides that he must break Jim out of \\"jail.\\" He finds himself once more reunited with Tom and shares his goals, amazed at the fact they Tom is willing to free a runaway slave. He thinks that Tom has changed to share his views, but is once again let down by those who were once close to him. It turns out that Tom only agrees to do this after he learns that Jim is already free. He would not have agreed to help Huck otherwise because he still believes in the fact that slaves are property. When Huck discovers this and Jim is set free as he should always have been, he no longer wishes to live in a place where people are considered property and others do not keep their promises or base their acts on faulty premises. He then decides to leave for the Indian territories--a place where he can act as he knows is right and how things in the world should be."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I first read this book (unabridged) when I was in grade school, and it is still one of my favorites. I was fortunate to discover it on my parents' bookshelf long before it ever occurred to my teachers to assign it to me.In this masterpiece of the road trip, we meet a bumptious, self-confident, self-absorbed young America in person as Huck and Jim hitchhike along its first great highway: the Mississippi River of sternwheelers, flatboats, keelboats, canoes and crude rafts. We see the vast river and its people (with all their warts, quirks and odd ideas) through the eyes of a young white runaway orphan (Huck) and his much-wiser-than-he-lets-on black companion (Jim). This is the same Mississippi River highway that Abraham Lincoln saw as a young man, when he worked on the crew of a flatboat that delivered goods from the Ohio River Valley to the seaport in New Orleans.If you can forget that it's an assignment to read, notice that each of Twain's colorful characters has his or her own authentic way of damaging the English language (dialect), and let yourself go with the flow, I think you will find this to be a wonderful story with many delightful surprises.The journalist Mark Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is to America before the Civil War as the impoverished cavalier Miguel Cervantes' &quot;Don Quijote de La Mancha&quot; is to the underside of imperial Spain at the time of the Spanish Armada. In both books we see a rough-hewn society in the midst of rapid cultural change through the eyes of a pair of puzzled innocents. To a first approximation, Huck Finn is Don Quixote, and Jim is Sancho Panza."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Do you need some Orwellian Big Brother to 'edit' a classic book for you? Do you want someone else to decide what you should or shouldn't read? Are you incapable of seeing a word used in a century-old context without throwing a fit over it?If yes, then this is the censored book for you.If NO, then keep browsing for an UNEDITED, UNABRIDGED version -- and leave this piece of dreck to rot.Why?First, consider the attribution that appears in this book's search result listing: \\"Mark Twain 'AND Sarah Matthews.'\\" Why is there a second name on a classic book that everyone knows had only one author? Why, because the second person is an ~Editor~ -- a self-appointed Judge of Words, a modern-day INQUISITOR who has removed parts of the original work because THEY decided that you, the Reader, don't need to see them.What parts of the original did this Inquisitor decide you don't need to see? Well to begin with, every last use of the word N-gg-r -- you know, because somebody might wet their diapers if they see that word in print in a book that's more than century old, despite the fact that black people all over this country use the same word every single day even NOW.But then, just for good measure, the Inquisitor also removed whole sentences and sections that didn't have anything at all to do with 'the N-word' -- but which might have stirred up thoughts in you that the Inquisitor doesn't want you thinking.The result is a butchered and mangled parody of the original: a pathetic, PC-sanitized piece of crap. Everyone involved in the production of this edition should be ashamed -- indeed, they should be barred from working in the Publishing industry ever again -- and anyone who rewards their censorship by buying this edition is contributing to the decline of Freedom and Free Speech in America."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The temptation to teach Huck to high school students must be taken seriously. No matter the racial makeup of the class, the \\"N\\" word has to be defused before reading begins. We can explain and discuss and meltdown some of the ascerbity of the word, but unless the issue is fully resolved, the 200-plus appearances of such a slander will eventually work us back to tender. Background reading on Twain is a must. His short story, \\"Disgraceful Persecution of a Boy,\\" about a boy returning from Sunday School who stops to stone a Chinaman (in San Francisco) makes a pointed comment about the \\"teaching\\" of prejudice. This story makes good pre-reading since a reference with a similar point is made in \\"Huck Finn.\\" When a river boat has an accident, a riverside discussion goes: \\"Was anybody hurt?\\" \\"Nope. Killed a N- though.\\" This bit of dialog slipped in and overheard is painfully offensive and yet such a perfect contrast to Huck's feelings and the \\"teaching\\" he has received, both from the Widow Douglas and from life itself. Jim, of course, is the subject of Huck's racial feelings. Throughout the story, Jim is a father, brother and friend to Huck, but never a servant. He is everything, a good man tormented with love for his lost family and Huck, yet in his world, he is literally bound (by chains and threats) and so cannot come close to the dignity of African Americans of today. Huck and Jim's world requires that we board a mental time-machine and accept both the life on the raft and the values on shore as they were then, not now. Teach the book with joy after preparing with compassion."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Plain and simple, this is a book that you have to read again and again and again just for good measure. One cannot possibly appreciate modern American literature as it exists today without reading Huck Finn. Twain's style is one-of-a-kind, and his keen sense of politics and history is one that rarely exists in modern times. Get past the racial implications of this book and look at what Twain is -saying-. Huck Finn is a character who is a rogue, a modern scoundrel; however, we trust his moral judgement and are able to look inside another time and place through his journey with Jim up the Mississippi. So get out your maps and notebook and enjoy Twain at his finest."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I'm intrigued to read how many modern readers have objected to the &quot;wordiness&quot; of this nineteenth-century masterpiece in their reviews here. By modern standards, it may well be rather long-winded. Or it could just be that we have a harder time understanding the words and phrases Twain uses, which evoke images less familiar to us than they were to his original audience.What intrigues me about this is that Mark Twain himself levelled this same charge of wordiness against James Fenimore Cooper's &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;, which were written in the early 1800s. In a famous essay, Twain picked apart Cooper's description of a woodsman making camp, line by line. Each word, each phrase, each sentence was evaluated for its value in setting the scene, and far more than half of each were discarded. At the end, Twain gave his readers his own--much shorter--rendition of the passage, then congratulated himself on having improved it greatly by shortening it.Languages and usage change over time. By John Milton's standards of the mid-1600s, Cooper's sentences and descriptions might well have seemed terse and choppy. By Mark Twain's time, the same sentences sounded long-winded. Today--80 years after Ernest Hemingway taught us to expect our vivid descriptions in telegraphic prose--even Twain can sound wordy, reading Cooper can be an enormous struggle, and few beyond English majors learn to appreciate Milton's &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; as a complete work.But we can learn a great deal about ourselves and our own times by reading popular writers from our ancestors' times. First, it teaches us tolerance, as we see that &quot;the past is a different country: they do things differently there.&quot; Second, it warns us that our own ideas, speech patterns and writing styles may also seem quaint, antiquated, ungrammatical--even boring--to our grandchildren. Learning to expect this can help us avoid taking ourselves and our times quite so seriously.Life goes on, and so does the language."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I read some of the other reviews and understand that some people had an issue with the candid way in which Mark Twain dealt with the race issues. However, as a person of color, I am a Black Bahamian, I have absolutely no problem, it is what it is, and it doesn't make sense to sugarcoat the past. I loved the book when I read it as a child, and enjoyed reading it again. Previously it was just an entertaining book, however, in reading it as an adult with a lot more exposure and understanding of the subtle and not so subtle undertones, it took my experience to a whole other level."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is one of those novels that could easily go either way in the minds of a reader. Some people find it either boring or offensive, particularly because of its excessive use of the \\"n word.\\" Others balk at the unbelievability of the plot premises (such as carrying an escaped slave south rather than north). Still others find the excessively colloquial linguistic style distracting and difficult to read. Any or all of the above could cause a person to dislike this story.I myself certainly noticed the shortcomings above (although I personally enjoyed the colloquial language and realized that the use of the \\"n word\\" was historically accurate and would have been used much as we today say \\"black\\" or \\"African-American\\"). However, I was able to largely overlook the problems of the novel and appreciate it on a more simple level: an adventure-filled journey down the river.In addition, I appreciated the central device of Huck's character: he acts consistently against his conscience, which is representative of the deplorable attitudes that were prevalent at the time. Through his actions, we see that he is not truly racist, but that society has imposed racism upon him. We see that he is impressionable, and will allow bad things to happen for a while, but ultimately he will step in and try to stop them. In this way, he is representative of the \\"innocent\\" child, whose worse qualities are always a result of others around him rather than anything innate.Overall, this book is worth reading as a parable on freedom and conscience, and deserves a place among the great American classics."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Twain's colorful and darkly funny critique of the antebellum American South is no less stinging (and no less controversial) 125 years after it was first published. Its satire of race relations, vigilantism, hypocrisy, and romanticism may remain just as relevant, but it's Huck and Jim's travels down the Mississippi River - the quintessential journey to reinvent oneself - that makes Huck Finn the decisive Great American Novel."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book has the reputation in some quarters as the greatest American novel, and now that I have finally read it, I can see why. Mark Twain's great achievement is to write a story that is so thrilling, engaging and, at times, laugh out loud funny, yet can also be appreciated on a very deep level.Huck Finn resists being \\"civilized,\\" but he proves to have a practical intelligence and an innate moral sense that is superior to that of the civilized and educated society that he stands outside of. This is most powerfully represented by Huck's friendship with the runaway slave Jim. Even though he believes, along with the rest of white society at that time, that he is doing the wrong thing by helping Jim escape, he cannot turn his back on a friend and decides that he would rather be \\"bad\\" than betray his trust. They are joined for a time by a pair of con men who are terribly cultured (or at least do a good job of faking it), and Huck is deeply impressed by them until he begins to realize the full extent of the harm they cause. This is also the funniest part of the book. The last section, in which Tom Sawyer reappears, slows things down a bit, but here, too, we see Huck's superiority. Tom is an eternal boy, always looking for games and adventure. For reasons I won't reveal here, we learn at the end of the book that Tom has inadvertently been quite cruel to Jim because of this never-ending search for excitement, and that Huck would have done better to obey his own inclinations rather than follow the lead of the friend he idolized.As in \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" Twain presents a fascinating and detailed picture of life on the Mississippi before the Civil War. He makes it easy for us to immerse ourselves in Huck's world. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"...sivilise me, and I can't stand it. I've been there before.\\" This is a small part of the long book of \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" by Mark Twain. This book is about a fourteen year old boy named Huck Finn who escapes from a life of abuse and sailes down the Mississippi River with an old friend. I think this book has extrordinary vocabulary like the words scour, numskull, and meek. These words in the book describe a person or an object. Although the text doesn't give much of an idea of the word's definition; it's fascinating to see the tremendous vocabulary Mark Twain uses. Also, I think this book rises in the plot and then stays there. I think this because Huck and Jim encounter a \\"king\\" and a \\"duke,\\" and they keep attempting to escape from them. A good age group for this book is grades seven to nine because this book is somewhat long with some confusing parts in it. Also, the vocabulary is for more advanced readers. Overall, this book was a great classic. It is one of my favorite books written by one of my favorite authors."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"It's interesting to read this book 150 years after the Civil War and the Emancipation.

Mark Twain managed to keep the boyish atmosphere of the Adventures of Tom Sawyer while adding in adult like concepts, such as decisive moral choice and honor, to create a work of fiction that many hail to be the \\"Great American Novel.\\"If you're not familiar with the story: Huck, after having found riches with Tom Sawyer, is living with the Widow Douglas and no longer leading a life of vagrancy. I won't go too deeply into the story because: a) there are a lot of plot elements and it would be impossible and b) it really is something that you have to experience through the eyes and in the language of Huck Finn (the entire story is written from his perspective and in his dialect as opposed to the Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which was written in Twain's distinct voice). Notable plot elements: Huck's escape from Pap, Jim and Huck's travel down the Mississippi, the Duke and the Dauphin and the Royal Nonesuch, and Huck and Tom's (who is present at the end of the book) contrivance to \\"free\\" Jim (you'll understand the \\"quotations\\" after you read the book).Overall, all the hype surrounding this book is well deserved.

Huck's dedication to his friend, Jim, is truly touching and serves as an inspiration to all!Since the beginning of Huck's journey, Huck is living on his own without real adult supervision for the first time. He escapes from the custody of his abusive and manipulative father, and runs into Jim, who becomes a father figure to Huck later on in the story. Along with this \\"independence\\" Huck is forced to make his own decisions, which Huck first derives from the racist thoughts he had learned growing up, which he was having problems applying to his new African American, and escaped slave, friend. As Huck sees the cruelties of the world, where the white race call African Americans \\"[...]\\" and when the life of a slave is not valued, he eventually decides that what he was taught as a young child, no longer applied to the circumstances that he now lived in. As a reader, we can read and marvel at the brave adventures that Huck takes on and acknowledge him for his independent thinking!Huck's refusal to give up their friendship and trust, and the knowledge and wisdom that Huck gained should be envied by everyone. Therefore, Huck is an inspiration for courageously breaking away from the negative views of society by upholding honor and establishing his individuality.

Through the eyes of main character, Huck, the reader is able to see how Twain is satirizing this society. Characters such as Pa demonstrate the ignorant \\"white trash\\" in the society, and the widows Douglas and Stevens are examples of the Christian women in the society. Through Huck's thoughts, the reader is able to find the irony that Huck the \\"uncivilized\\" character in the book, may have the most civilized attitude and ideas of all the characters in the story. Twain uses Huck's friendship with Jim, the runaway slave, to deal with the issue of slavery and suggest that slavery is wrong. Twain's strong take on issues in the story are evident and create a powerful novel told in an innocent manner through the eyes of a boy.Hope diz haz helped u"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"When I had to read this book, my first thoughts were, Southern life in the 1800s? Why would I care? Some people are just living in the past.How wrong I was.This book is so great and can be enjoyed by all people, with the exception of close(d)-minded inviduals. The story is about Huckleberry Finn, son of a drunk, regarded as uncivilized and morally lacking. The book is written in the 1st person point of view from Huck's eyes. \\\\To put it briefly, the whole book is about Huck trying to help Jim, a runaway slave, get free. Throughout, there are many episodes on the Mississippi River, where many adventures take place. We get to see Huck grow and mature as a person, having to make decisions and occasionally lie or dress up, yielding humorous moments often. The characterization of Jim is done very well by Twain, and we realize in the end that Jim is the most humane, caring person in the story.The ending was extremely disappointing, from the standpoint of the rest of the book. I will only say this: Tom Sawyer is a jackass. But don't take my word for it, read it yourself and judge for yourself; many regard the ending as great and an appropriate way for things to end. What's done is done, though, and the book still remains a great tale of friendship and adventure.What the book is not, is racist. The N-word is used, but that is for the effect of realism and credibility. If anything, the book is anti-racist, as can be seen in the relationship between Huck and Jim.

While, on the journey down the Mississippi the two become loyal friends.Twain's novel relates to readers through his views on slavery, religion, and politics. Throughout the book he makes a mockery of the time in which he lived. Also, by having the main character, Huck, befriend a slave it shows how even in pre -civil war times there were people who thought people of color were the same as whites.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is highly recommended for its exciting and adventurous monologue, which can be shared with reader's young and old. This book also offers an innocent young man's views on slavery, religion and politics. So all in all, if adventure and eye tearing friendship are what you are looking for, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, in my mind is one of best American novels of all time. It did a great job making me feel like I was in the South during the 1800's because; the dialog from Huck's narrative, the way the book showed how southerners felt about blacks, and what they had to go through to be friends with a slave. Twain also did a great job with the characters, he didn't make any one character better then the other but at the same time did a great job describing the characters. For example, characters the King and Duke, Twain really made them come to life. The novel also keeps you on your toes the whole time; you never know what's coming up next, because there's a new adventure ever couple chapters. But the novel isn't just about the adventures that Huck; a young southern boy goes through. It's also about the learning experience he goes through by becoming a good friend with a slave. By reading this book I feel that you will want to read more of Mark Twain's novels and short stories. I would recommend this novel to all students who are willing to learn while having to read a book with a different style of writing."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Hucleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, is a wonderful story about the adventures a young boy could have in the 1850's. The story takes place in the states along the Mississippi River during America's early years. Huckleberry, also known as Huck, is a young boy who grew up with an abusive and drunk father. When Huck's father disappears, he is taken in by a widow who tries to civilize and instill manners in him. The book starts out with adventure when Huck and his good friend Tom Sawyer form a gang. Huck is later kidnapped by his father, but he devises an extremely clever escape. He teams up with a runaway slave named Jim and they travel up the Mississippi River in hopes of getting to the northern free states. Huck always seemed to be torn between right and wrong. One minute he feels remorse for helping a runaway slave but the next he feels bad for him. This is evident when Jim is captured later in the book; Huck is set on finding and freeing Jim. Even though The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a very controversial book it should be read by people of all ages. Not only does it allow young people to relate to it, making their reading easier, but it also, in a non-direct way, explains the way life was in the earky years of America."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The book Huckleberry Finn is a very entertaining book for everyone. It is about a boy who travels down river escaping the trials and tribulations of growing up. Although while down river he makes dozens of moral decisions and gains a friend. Huck is a boy who is fascinated with the life of murdering, and stealing. By lying, and stealing, he rescues a new friend of his. He pretends to be Tom Sawyer and helps Jim escape from slavery because Tom Sawyers Aunt owns Jim. Huck grows up in the south near Missouri in the mid 1800's and he has to face many things such as racism and the controversial issue of slavery. In the end Huck realizes that the most important things in life are caring for friends and knowing that family doesn't always have to be your mother and father. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a book that is filled with sudden excitement."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Adults need to read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer to realize that they should never forget all the trouble they got in when they were young. Young kids should read this book because it shows them what they can only dream about doing when the get older. It is a very interesting book, about two young adolescent kids who are best friends: Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. This book has everything a reader likes: adventure, mystery, and romance.This book has the perfect amount of adventure. In the book, Tom and Huck decide to run away from home and live on an island. It was an adventure to steal all the food they needed, to actually sneak out of the house, and to meet up and sail down to the island. Also, they built a raft to sail down to the island.In the story there is a big mystery. Tom and Huck witness a murder, and they almost get killed for it. Also, they know there is a treasure buried some where near the town. Tom and Huck go around for a couple of days and try to find the treasure.There is a little romance in the plot too. Tom is in love with Becky, a girl that lives down the street. He gets in all kinds of trouble when he is with Becky. Tom and Becky go into a cave to explore with all the other children and somehow they get lost for three days.Tom is a young kid that is confused with the world around him, so he goes off and tries to experience new things. Whenever Tom goes out on an adventure there is always some kind of consequence no matter what he does. Tom learns from his mistakes and learns to deal with all sorts of challenges."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I think the book \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is a very exciting and adventurous story that should be shared with all ages. The story is about a boy named Huck Finn who is kidnapped by his cruel and drunken dad. He escapes his father and then he travels down the Mississippi River and finds his friend, Jim. He comes across two imposters and the story just continues to keep your attention. This book is a real all American story. It is definately a story that you wouldn't want to miss reading."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Do more than read this marvelous book for yourself: read it ALOUD to your kids so you can discuss with them every aspect of its brilliant satire, wounderful use of (local) language and adept characterizations. Even better, read TOM SAWYER to them first--that way they'll be able to see the vast difference between Tom and Huck and which one grows up. . . Oh, and don't be put off by the casual and to our ears very offensive use of the word \\"nigger\\" by the characters--remember that Twain carefully selected every word in his Huck and Tom dialect--use this book to teach more than merely literature to your kids, use this book to teach history and social responsibility. Caveat: Twain's Southern dialect is challenging to read out loud--better practice!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"this book i recomend for standard readers.I liked it alot!Very interesting about curing warts.Loved it alot, hopethe people that read it liked it too.From my rating from 1-10i'll give it a 9.Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The story of Huck Finn starts with him living with a widow as a foster parent becuase his dad is gone and his mom is dead.The widow is raising him as a respectable boy but his dad shows up one day and kidnaps him.

This is a faithful reproduction of a 1948 edition and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the paper, cover, and especially the illustrations. Beautiful color paintings on the cover and some throughout the text as well, with black and white pen and ink drawings at intervals. The illustrations in no way interfere with the reading; this isn't a watered down children's version, rather the presentation is suitable for adults as well."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"and I was somewhat dreading this particular read in the American Literature class in which I'm currently enrolled. HOWEVER, if the reader can put himself in the mindset of pre-civil war America this is a great multi-level story. Obviously many reviewers are going to talk about the theme of slavery contained in the book. I think Samuel Clemens did a fantastic job of portraying his disdain for it. Blacks were considered almost below animals at the time. Consider the portion of the book where Huck is spinning a tale to Tom Sawyer's Aunt Sally and says that his boat was delayed becasue of an engine explosion. When she asks if anyone was hurt, he replies that a \\"nigger was killed\\" to which she responds \\"Well that's good, since sometimes people do get hurt\\" and then goes on to relate a tale of a white engineer that was killed in a similar accident. She didn't think about her response. This was simply the automatic reaction of southern slaveholders of the time. In this environment, in this society for Huck to grow to realize that Jim is a true. loving caring human being is amazing and the heart of the story as far as I'm concerned. Set aside any preconceptions that you may have about the book and give it a try!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book is the American classic. It isn't simply a children's book, or a simple adventure tale, but a vision of a battle between individuality and conformity through the eyes of one of the greatest characters in American literature. The point that this book is racist is absurd. In fact, it is quite the opposite, with Twain indicating that it is more natural for Huck and Jim to be equals. Every time Huck stops along the river and enters a town, Twain satirizes the faults and gullibility of society. The ending is there to provide a sharp contrast between Huck, a strong individual and a realist, and Tom, a total conformist and a romantic. Overall, this book is a pivotal piece in American literature, and most of the points made in the book still hold true today."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book was great i read every one of his adventures.

It would be the best for those people who love adventure books and the sense of escaping pathway. By using vivid descriptive langue, the author successfully guide his readers through some very beautiful landscapes and dangerous situations. Readers not only could see themselves following the two main characters through their difficult journey, but also could move with them toward their destination, Freedom of Slavery.This was a required book in my 11th grade. Just by looking at it, I already felt sleepy. When I began to read the first pages, I felt worse. I did not understand one thing. The reason for it was, I did not read the book &quot;The adventures of Tom Sawyer.&quot; The first couple pages in Huckleberry Finn is like the second part of Tom Sawyer.

That, however, is not what he gets as a feigns his own death in order to escape his drunken old man, and meets up with another disregarded soul, a runaway slave who becomes his only steady friend. Together they high-tail it down the Mississippi river on a make-shift raft, narrowly escaping death, thievery, and capture from a variety of southern folk. Their experiences serve as true examples of adventure, as both discover that there is more to their character and souls that what they had ever imagined. They develop a sense of courage, acceptance, and happiness as they float their way to freedom, knowing that water always finds its way, and by following it they will too.The story of Huck shows the growth and molding of identities of both Huck and his companion Jim, with the use of eloquent diction. Twain writes in the typical language of the time period and exercises the slang and frank use of words that would be ever so appropriate of the homeless waif and runaway slave. This use of the literary device enhances Twain's theme by speaking a pure American dialect in order to paint a picture of one of the most piercing images of the devastation slavery had on those enslaved as well as the society that allowed such an act to take place. The controversial topic and writing technique which Twain uses, succeeds in relaying to the readers what his purpose was in writing the great American novel: that existence and the participation in it is short and measured, sometimes by others, but mostly by actions of the individuals themselves. Therefore, it must be taken as a continual learning process, with which understanding and growth are a byproduct to the daily highs and lows of what is known as life."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book is a great classic. I can definetly see why people would call it racist. However, we have to remember when the book was written and take it for what it is worth. THis is a great adventure story and every body should read it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I had previously read the book \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" during a project in third grade. I grew up very close to St. Petersburg, Missouri, where the story takes place. This made the story more interesting because I know what the area is like. I could not comprehend the story as well then as I now can, and it was fascinating to reread. It was also much better this time because I was not being forced to read it in class.The story held my focus throughout, and I found it hard to put the book down. I loved the constant action of the book. The boys were always coming up with sly or cunning ideas, as they had done in the prequel. It was quite humorous, while still creating a great deal of suspense and drama. It gives people who have grown up in recent years a chance to imagine what it would be like to grow up at the turn of the century. That is probably my favorite aspect of the book. It has an overabundance of action while remaining very believable and somewhat realistic.The main characters are my favorite part of this series of books. Huck is my favorite character because he overcomes so much adversity. He could very easily give up on life after what he put up with against his father, but continued to aspire a good life elsewhere. Also, he acted as an older brother figure for Tom and taught him a lot during their experiences. I also admire Tom because he shares in Huck's action, as well as teaches him to be booksmart. They do well in complimenting each other. They also are very cunning but stay within their morals, and I admire that. Jim is an example of how the boys were far ahead of their time and befriended not only a black man, but a slave. They were very mature, despite ignorance because of their young age. None of the main characters ever seemed to be selfish when it came to helping each other; they would always put their neck on the line for one another.Overall, I loved this book, and would suggest it to anyone. I do think, however, that males would enjoy it more than females simply because the adventures tend more to a male imagination, but it can be enjoyed by all readers."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The novel \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" exposes the reader to many interesting and funny occurrences during the pre-Civil War time. The story is about the dangerous and hazardous adventures that both main characters, Huckleberry Finn and Jim, undertake in order to escape from the problems in their lives.\\"All the best stories in the world but one story in reality- the story of escape. It is the only thing which interests us all and at all times, how to escape.\\", said the author Walter Bagehot.The adventures of Huck and Jim represent escaping from the problems they have. Jim escapes for freedom and Huck for independence. A young teenage boy and an escaped slave travel down the Mississippi River with nothing but a raft and an obscure plan about how to change their lives. I do think that every one who dares to begin reading the book will like it. It will be very difficult for him not to admit that the book is really good.I recommend \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" to someone looking for an exiting read that is hard to put down. It is a book that keeps you late in the evening and reading page after page."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"BOOK REVIEWThe Book The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn it starts off really great and through the whole book it stays great. I enjoyed this book because I really like adventure and this book is filled with adventure and obstacles the characters had to overcome through out the adventures. If you are a person that like going on adventures and like overcoming things in life that are difficult you will really enjoy this novel. Also I like how the main character in the story which is Huck, made his own decision by running away from his abusive father. When Huck decided to run away from his father that was a good decision because I feel you should not stay with someone that abuses you. This book is filled with laughter and sadness but you will be very satisfied at the results. If you don&#65533;t read this book you will never know anything about the wonderful Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. A book that been around for a long time and will be around for long time more.

I came into this book thinking that it was going to be to long and that I would not have time in my busy life to finish it. I began it on a plane ride home and I was enchanted by it. I never thought a book could take a hold of my imagination and heart the way this one did. Huck Finn was a simple young child who had more heart and common sense that I could ever imagine. I was intrigued by the mature relationship that he was able to take up with Jim and how he looked up to Jim as a mentor even though he was brought up to know that Jim was only property and a slave. The dialect that was used made it even more real for me; Mark Twain put me right in with Huck and Jim as though I was floating down that river on the same raft as them. I loved to watch Huck mature as the trip went on, he seemed to understand more and more that his lies could hurt people and some could help. The only part about this book that disappointed me in the slightest bit was when he ended up at Tom Sawyer's aunt's house. It made me feel as though the whole novel was just going around in circles and I secretly in my heart I wished that Huck and Jim would never go back and get away from society and live the carefree life of drifting down the river forever, although I know that this could not happen. All in all this was a perfect book and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This timeless classic by Mark Twain should be a must read for everyone.

You have to have a balance control on your tape player, or no dice. I don't have a balance control, so I had to unplug first the left and then the right speaker to listen to this. That's the only way they could get the entire novel onto four tapes! Mr. Hill reads a lot slower than I do, for effect I guess, so we won't listen to this much. Maybe just when I am sick of reading aloud! But it is nice to have so when I need a substitute, he or she can just pop the tape in and not have to worry about covering the reading for that day."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Don't listen to the naysayers. This is a truly great piece of literature. On the surface, it's a great adventure story in the tradition of &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. But there are deeper issues to be tackled, issues that still can provoke lively discussion more than 100 years after the book was written. In my opinion, the central theme to the story is Huck's development of a moral code. Huck's sense of right and wrong is forged in the furnace of experience and the need for survival. The reader is put in the position of rooting for Huck to escape his abusive father even if it necessitates the use of deception, making people believe that he, Huck, had been killed. In the journey down the Mississippi with escaped slave Jim, Huck survives by use of his wits, pretending to be someone he's not (his attempt to pass himself off as a girl fails miserably), and encountering various interesting characters. For awhile, he stays with a very respectable, upright family who has one problem: they are in a feud with another family, which results in a tragic ending for all concerned. (As a sidenote, I read that section of the book the morning of September 11, before turning on the TV only to be horrified by the events of that day when America and freedom itself was so violently attacked. Why must the world continue partaking of the bitter fruit of violence?) The comic pair of &quot;royal&quot; con men who become traveling companions with Huck and Jim scheme to dupe the unwitting out of money as they travel from town to town, until Huck helps to foil their biggest scheme. Huck's moral code is continually shaped by the extent by which he values people as friends and worthy individuals. Once Jim is recaptured, Huck has to make a decision which becomes the central moral dilemma of the book: should Huck return Jim to Miss Watson, from whom he escaped, because now Huck is having severe misgivings about helping take someone else's &quot;property&quot;, or should he help Jim escape because Jim has become a friend to him? Interestingly, Huck does not debate, in his own mind, the morality or immorality of the slave trade in and of itself, but be makes his decision based on Jim's friendship, which Huck thinks is the wrong decision based on what he was taught. But, of course, Huck basically follows his heart.At this point, the book bogs down a little. There is a contrived situation where Huck reunites with Tom Sawyer, and what should have been a fairly easy escape for Jim is complicated needlessly by Tom's romantic ideals gained by his reading of adventure books. Even though I found this part of the novel frustrating to read, it does point to the difference between Huck's pragmatism and Tom's romanticism. Huck gives in to Tom too easily on this point, and the whole escape plan almost blows up in their faces. Don't allow the rather weak ending (or the liberal use of the n-word) to deter you from reading perhaps the paramount achievement in American literature. Enjoy it for the rousing adventure it is, and think about the deeper moral questions raised by this book. If any novel deserves the label &quot;classic&quot;, it's &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"dventures of Huckleberry Finn By Mark Twain 352 PagesThis book was very well-writen.

For example: He ran in a dark, creepy, scarely, huge mansion. Even though I don't read that much books, I still thinks that Mark Twain books are very exciting and adventureous.

I see why it was banned, since the N-word was used so frequently, but considering the time and place that the story takes place, no one with any kind of common sense should be upset because of it. The book tells the story of Huckleberry Finn, and young boy and the adventures he has when he is travelling down the Mississippi River with a runaway slave, Jim.

Twain in his characteristic satiric fashion constructs an avator for freedom in Huckleberry Finn, and a comment on American society in the 1800s through his beautiful idiomatic prose. As Huck winds down the meandering Mississippi, the reader is wisked away on a page-turning sojourn like no other. However, most readers will make this book more than a sojourn; this book will become a torn and tattered escape that barely rests on their bookshelves before going on another journey with another mind. A 10 out of 10, which symbolizes the beauty of literature, and the real reason why reading a book will exist long after computers become a trite household appliance- this book is transportable and 2 1/2 inches of sure beauty.

That being said, I confess I was almost (but not quite) glad that, after learning too much about the ending, I lowered my expectation to such a level that I was able to successfully suffer through it. Parents of students assigned to read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn should, I believe, preview the book beforehand.

On the same note even today we ignore human right issues and I think this book should be taught at Secondary school level. If people are going to change their attitudes about racism this is the last time that they will do so. But as well as critise society it does look at it from a humourous point of view and will keep you interested.

Though Twain uses the word \\"nigger\\" all too often, we must not forget the fact that the setting of the book takes place at a time where it was normal to use. I am not saying it is right, however, the word usage helps the reader get a sense of the time and place where the story occurs.Throughout the book Jim and Huck are there for each other and they are pretty much the only ones each can count on. At first Huck is reluctant to help Jim and he keeps debating what is right and what is wrong. As the book progresses, Huck learns that Jim is a person and has a heart, despite what many of the time thought about slaves. Jim continually cares for Huck, for instance, when he doesn't let Huck see the dead man, knowing it's his father. Jim also continually lets Huck know that he is his only friend, by saying \\"the only white gentleman that ever kept his promise to old Jim,\\" etc. Huck ultimately decides that he'd rather go to hell than turn Jim in.Even though there may be some questionable occurances in the book, i do not believe Huckleberry Finn is racist. Jim and Huck form a loving friendship in which Huck helps Jim until the end, despite society's discouragement."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"now, before I get flamed for what I put above, let me explain. This certainly is a good book, which a great many people have and do enjoy greatly. I'm not someone who thinks this book is racist, and I understand wholly the reason for twain's use of the n-word. that being said, and maybe it's just me because I have high expectations for everything I read, but I couldn't really get into it. I understand that huck is supposed to be uneducated and maybe a little stupid, but his entire character was completely uninteresting to me. Nothing in this book jumped out and me and grabbed my attention, making me want to read further. Hemingway said that ALL modern american literature comes from this book. Now while this book may have paved the way for such classics as \\"To kill a Mockingbird\\" among others,not to mention influenced a great many writers, I think this is a crock of crap. When I read modern fiction I don't see a whole lot coming from this book. In fact, I'm happy about this. I don't see why twain had to use this book to make political statements, because fiction and politics should have nothing to do with one another. to quote one of my favorite writers, stephen king \\"If fiction and politics ever do become interchangeable, I'm gong to kill myself because I won't know what else to do. You see, politics always change. Stories never do.\\" That being said, I have made my main points for my dissapointment in this book, and maybe I have a lot to learn about literature still, but to think that as some people do, that you can't understand modern literature without liking this book, is bull."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I decided to read this book after my father asked me to. My father was shopping at Costco when he saw a package of Aladdin Classics with books like The Secret Garden, The Wizard of Oz, Wind in the Willows, and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. When he saw that these books were advanced and hard, he requested for me to read it. I knew that I needed more books my level so I agreed. Also, after reading the back of the page, it seemed like a very adventurous and fun book. (The cover seemed a little boring).The main character in this story is Huckleberry Finn. He has a pretty sad life because he doe sn't live with his parents. His father who is abusive beats him up. Although Huckleberry is a troublemaker and a \\"bad boy\\", I think he has a good heart. He is a wreckless boy who seems to like adventure and likes to observe the world. I also think that he lacks good judgements, but he means well.I do not particularly enjoy this book because it is very long and boring. It uses too many confusing words and it is difficult to understand. Although this story is adventurous, it doesn't meet the needs I required for this book. It took me a very long time to understand what was going on in this book. Also, I don't really like stories that revolves around the 1800's. They don't do any interesting things and the way they talk is so vulgar."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I had to read this book for my AP English class. It was alright. I didn't really get into it that much. His adventures WERE worth reading about, but it didn't keep me interested as much as I would have liked to. This is an OK book if your into adventure type stories. Otherwise.....I'd pass."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huck Finn was a pretty average book. All of the slang was hard to read at times and sometimes it was hard to follow the plot line. The ending was also abrupt and kind of jerked you to a stop. I would not reccomend this book to everyone for the word \\"nigger\\" shows up quite a few times. As long as you are not offend then I suggest that you do read it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The quality is really poor, I would clean my hand after reading and I will never eat apple while reading it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"well, reading this book I felt like it was way too long! It was dragged on and on until you got sick of Huck and Jim always escaping and crap. Man, it is a waste of time. I didn't enjoy it. How dumb are the people that they don't find anything suspicious about a slave and little white boy together on a raft. They also fall for some pretty dumb lies!! Don't read it.. unless you have to for a class.. That's what I had to do!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I HATE THIS BOOK! It takes me an hour to get through the first page. Its frustrating to try and read this. It is a great story...very adventurous, but very difficult to read. at least for me..."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I did not like this book when I had to read it for a class a few years ago. It's absolutely one of the most boring books I've ever read. It was too long and too drawn out. I've read other books and stories by Twain and they were so much better than this one. I definitely wouldn't recommend this book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I was forced to read this book for an English class, and it was an extrememly dull read. The extremely exasperating dialect of Jim is difficult to understand, and annoying as hell. Twain once again shows his bitter cynicism towards everything, with his pointless satire. The satire is not funny, how people find it funny, I don't know. It is a dull, boring, pointless,(insert negative adjective here) book, and I stand by my position that Twain was an idiot."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Personaly I didn't like the book whatsoever. I don't see what the big deal about the book is. It's considered one of America's best novels but I just don't see that. It's just a story about a stupid kid that runs away and that uses the \\"n\\" word one too many times.I addition to this i think that the book shows a lot of racism. The \\"n\\" word was used more than 200 times and it's just stupid that the author had to include all this racism in the book just to get the point across to his audience.Some people that have written reviews here might not be offeded by the racism that this book shows and I am surprised about this. It makes me angry to see that there are people out there saying how good of a book this is when there are serious issues with it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I decided to read the original of this book after illustrating a condensed version for grade school children. I was also drawn to it after reading a comparison between it and Harriet Beecher Stowes &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin&quot; in Harper's Magazine. This book definitely has its highlights, mostly the descriptive passages of the trip down the Mississippi. But in general, it does not hang together. As pointed out by another reviewer, the pretense of saving Jim doesnt hold... directly across the river was a free state, whereas downriver the states became more and more racist with worse and worse laws. There is a good reason why the underground railroad helped escaping slaves North, not South. At various times Huck betrays his &quot;friend&quot; Jim, and the ending is deplorable. Completely nonsensical, how Jim is kept locked up while the boys play jail with him. This is not man against society, but thoughtless, racist young men cruelly playing with others' lives. Huckleberry Finn himself is often held up to be the epitomy of the free American boy, escaping from the mores of a repressive society, whereas I find him to be the epitomy of a society that finds &quot;adventure&quot; in &quot;taming&quot;, &quot;saving&quot; and just generally using for its own ends every other society and creature around. I would teach this book in schools, but I am afraid that the lessons learned would differ from the laudatory ones generally assumed to be contained in this book.An interesting fact I learned from the Harper's article was that Mark Twain himself put aside this book several times, unsure of the plot, changing the ending, and was in the end not satisfied with it.For a good book on escaping slaves, complete with realistic escapes and comtemporary language, read Uncle Tom's Cabin. For adventures, read Tom Sawyer. And to shake your head at what is enshrined as great American literature, read Huckleberry Finn."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"If your are one to thoes people who like childish exciment and adventure this book is the one for you. I mean I read Huckleberry Finn in the 6th grade and I liked it. It was exciting and some thing new! I wished that I could be just like Huck, but that was than and this is now. Times have changed I don't need to read about a little boy who run's away form is adopted family, and how he get's stuck on a raft with an Black man (Jim) who belives that he can tell the future from talking to a hair ball. But the adventure is just begining. Huck and Jim float down the river and incounter some pretty strange people, the Duke and the King of England. Both of these men are con-men, theives and not to mention they are just not nice people. If you are someone who likes to be made fun of and constantly told how stupid the human race is than this is the book for you. I give this book a 2 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I am in my junior year of high school and am in the midst of reading this novel. I, along with my classmates, am finding it a very hard book to get into. The character Jim's speech is hard to interpret unless you read aloud and by the time you figure out what he is trying to say, you are very bored. I am told this novel is an American classic. Well, I wonder why I should have to read it then, not only am I Canadian, I also have more interest, being a teenager, in the present. I understand the themes residing in this novel and that they are very important issues and I recognize why it's a classic, but I don't understand why high schoolers should be forced to read it, or any other out-dated classic either."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"the book came in perfest shape. unfortunately for me i didn't look at the size of the book when ordering, wanted a larger book for my grandchild.

I listened to the novel to refresh my memory, as I had assigned it to be read and followed-up by over 45 high school freshmen. Even though I was to have read it in high school and college, I had never read the entire novel from start to finish. That mission is now accomplished!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Great book; everyone should read at least one time. I read this when I was only 15 and had to reread to appreciate it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Wonderful, adventurous, witty and wise old Mark Twain! This book, although not politically correct, is just as much for adults as for young people! He shows us how petty and silly we are about our relationships with others and describes life in that time so well!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a very exciting book. It starts out in Missouri right on the Mississippi River. Huck Finn was a young boy who was adopted and was taught manners and how to live like a proper person. He never like this much and to be quite honest, he hated it. Huck's father was a drunk and one day kidnapped Huck and took him out to his cabin. Whenever Pap would leave, he would lock Huck in the cabin. Huck fakes his own death to get away from his father who abuses him. He hides on an island in the middle of the Mississippi river. While there, Huck meets a kind African American man named Jim. Jim and Huck develop a good relationship and begin on a long adventure together. They come across some tough times when they come across other people because they think Jim is a runaway slave. They encounter some con artists who sell Jim as a runaway slave. Jim was sold to Tom Sawyer's aunt and uncle. Huck and Tom device a plan to get Jim freed. Their plan works to free Jim and they realize later that Jim has already been a free man. The book ends with a good ending and Huck continues his adventurous ambitions by heading out west. I gave this book 4 out of 5 stars. It was a great book but not my perfect book to read. Overall it was great."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"One never tires of Huckleberry. His sense of humor, his care and concern for others, his many adventures appeal to all ages and age groups. Twain had a real knack for entertaining and causing one to think."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"this is a classic book that should be read by everyone. it shows the brilliant side of Mark Twain.the description is so vivid and the adventures take you away to a different world."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Twain's classic story about being a boy and having adventures is as relevant today as in Huck's time. We actually experience Huck's activities through his eyes, with his thoughts and the reasoning behind his actions. Twain captures perfectly the thought process of a (13 year old?) young man. Yes, it takes place during slavery period, and, though some of the language may be objectionable by today's standards, it is a story worth reading and enjoying. There is a lot more than what is ever shown in any of the movies made from this book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I've enjoyed this reading more than my original boyhood reading of the timeless classic. I liked the humor and characters. Huck&#8216;s reasoning and understanding of a racial era, may or may not help us today. Rafting the great river with Huck and Jim and sharing their adventures! What fun!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"An old fashioned tale of marvellous adventure based around the breakdown of a family and a boys efforts to make his own way with his true friends."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book has earned the right to be called the great American novel. It is well writen and has a great plot."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"It's not called \\"the great American novel\\" for nothing.Huck Finn is by far one of the greatest fronteir adventures ever written.Mark Twain is brilliant, witty, and real.There is nothing else like it; it's a must-read."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I read Huckleberry Finn as a young teenager and beyond question this was my favorite piece of fiction (my version is 1985). I will confess I had only a limited scope to compare with as I was not a first-rate bookworm as a child; however, this will not diminish the timeless quality of Twain's work.I remember absorbing myself in this book quite fondly and having difficulty putting it down. At an age when I could closely relate to Huck's level of maturity, Twain presented his novel in such a congenial fashion it was almost as though I remember Huck as a personal friend. This is perhaps the genius of the book, a book I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Once in the Mississippi river, a boy named Tom and his slave friend Jim were going down a stream to go to the Free states to get a fresh start. It was summer time and the two boys were running away from the trouble they left behind their old life. The two boys weren't just going to the Free states to get a fresh start, they were going there, because this way Jim could be free and Tom could stay away from his abusive dad. This is the only way that Jim and Tom could find a resolution to their problems.My favorite part of this book is when Jim and Tom were going down the Mississippi and they were both asleep and a steam boat ran over their raft causing the boy's to separate from each other for a very long time. This event caused the boy's to be more united and to go through a lot more cool adventures.The message that the writer wants to show here is that it is not ok to lie, to face trouble, no mater how bad it is, and to always say the true. The things that I like about this book were that it was really exciting and there were a lot of adventures in the story. But the only thing that I would like to change about this book is that is too much trouble going on, and it makes it really hard to understand. I would recommend every one to read this book because it is really exciting and it paints a picture in your mind making the reading really exciting."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book is hilarious. I laughed all the way through it. It's also very educational as it goes along with the time period of whites/blacks segregation. In this book, you see a world though a little boy's eyes and how he has to deal with many obstacles and help Jim, his slave. In his day, people weren't likely to help blacks so it's a very touching and worthwhile story/novel. I highly recommend this to all of you book-lovers. This is my FAVORITE Mark Twain book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I read Huckleberry Finn just this year! Of course I heard about the book and references to it all my life. I guess I had to take the plunge. And what a joyful ride it was! I liked these two chaps- one white and free another black and slave- on the run so alone under the sun and stars. At the same time they are chasing their own wild dreams and adventures.Humour is spread all over the book and it often takes quirky turns. I can laugh at some very small bits from the beginning of the novel where Tom Sawyer makes an unsuccessful attempt to form a gang of robbers, towards the end of book where impish Tom kisses his own aunt on the lips under disguise of some other boy and Jim being supplied with all sorts of insects and snakes while in captivity.But what makes this story great is the noble theme that runs throughout the book. Society's inhuman and exploitative nature and human heart's own capacity for love, compassion and friendship, above all. As we see in the book human compassion and friendship triumphs over greed, malevolence and injustice of an unjust and small hearted society."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huckleberry Finn, best friend of Tom Sawyer, runs away from his brutal, white-trash father for an easy-going life of floating down the Missisippi river on a raft. But just as he sets out he meets up with runaway slave Jim. Their escape and adventure they have together as with each mooring of the raft they encounter a new problem, friend, fued or foe. Each and every time Huck manages to worm out of the situation by telling huge lies so he can get back to the raft, escaping one fine mess to end up in another.Huckleberry Finn speaks volumes of the era it was written in. There's no such thing as political correctness here as the 'N' word is thrown around so casually and frequently you might have to stop yourself from repeating it after putting the book down. To justify this, one might consider that Huck and Jim are considered to be the most common and ruffian of black and white so would naturally go together like peas in a pod. Jim's role as a surrogate father cements this theory also.The only ongoing plot thread is that of Jim evading his captors. Other characters and story arcs come and go. I do realise that Mark Twain wrote the book over a period of many years so this may account as to why it has a stop/start feel to it. It does seem as meandering as this Missisippi river itself.Some have voiced dismay at the cop-out ending. But you can look at like so many movie plot-holes of today. Without suspension of disbelief or some necessary contrivances there simply wouldn't be a story or, ultimately, any adventures to tell of.It's written in many different dialects and can be a bit tricky to get ahold of. But if you stick with it, the effort will pay off. I don't consider Huckleberry Finn to be a life-changing book but it does deserve its status as a classic and has huge amounts of drama and character.This edition features a lengthy introduction by George Saunders, a lost chapter and critical reviews."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I read this book recently, for my 10th grade American Literature class. I think possibly the most accurate description I can give for it is that it's a sort of pre-Civil War-era 'Catcher in the Rye'--both novels are journeys of adolescent self-discovery, told in an informal, gritty first-person narrative voice. If you liked 'Catcher', chances are, you'll like 'Huck'. ('Huck' is also lacking in most of the teenager-y whining and moaning that put people off 'Catcher').I will admit that the novel has attributes that will make it a boring or valueless read, for some. It's told from the perspective of an semi-literate Southern boy and is filled with digressions and anecdotes. It's very episodic and I can't say it has one centralized plot.Still, I enjoyed the book for the vibrant, colorful portayal of the American South, the dark humor and most of all, for the characters. Jim, the slave man, while often a figure of humor, has quiet dignity and nobility. He provides a father figure for the abandoned and parentless Huck. Huck, himself, is an utterly unforgettable character--the humble country boy with \\"a sound heart and a deformed conscience\\", he is impossible not to like. Seriously. My one complaint with the book are the segments in which Huck goes into dry-exposition and detail-mode and doesn't give his own unique insight into what's going on. Also, the end of the book, when Huck and Jim become secondary characters and the extraordinarily irritating Tom Sawyer dominates, is rather boring.Other than that, this is a solid masterpiece and probably the finest American classic I've ever read."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I thought The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a decent book. I feel that most people who read this book will enjoy and have a great time. This book contains many twists and turns that left me begging for more. Huckleberry Finn is a great character for all young boys to relate too. He is full of adventure and loves to cause trouble.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was overall a very fun and exciting book. The drama was always high and had my blood pulsing. From having an abusive and alcoholic father, to running away from his hometown, and then being captured by the duke and the dauphin, it did not seem like Huck ever got a break nor did he want one. The plot was great because it was always changing from one dramatic experience to the next. Huck never stayed in one place and was always ditching his father or Miss Watson (the widow taking care of him). While both of them care about Huck in a completely different way, he really didn't want to have anything to do with them. Most of the characters were great in the book. Each one had an important part that lead to the next catastrophe. At the end all of the characters seemed to come together and it was interesting how basically everyone met each other. Jim, a slave child, was a very important character. He became a true friend and accomplice throughout the entire book. While most of the characters played an important part, some pieces just didn't fit however and lead to boredom.Although this book was basically very good, I got confused during certain parts. The whole deal with the duke and the dauphin was stupid in my opinion. I feel that they just made the book more puzzling. They were from one town to the next tricking people and using fake names, eventually it got old. Around this time the book started to drag on and the development didn't really go anywhere; it stayed pretty dull. Also the whole deal with Huck's abusive father really didn't have a huge affect in the long run. Huck still ended up with Miss Watson and besides the beginning Huck didn't have to deal with his father.Overall I was very pleased with this book. I am the kind of kid who loves drama and adventure. Even though parts were slow and boring, they picked up. The action is intense and the humor goes very well with it. No matter what type of situation, Huck always seems to make it enjoyable. I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys a fun book about mischief and who enjoys good laugh."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I tried to read this book in high school without much success. The episodic plot and many dialects were too much for me to handle. Now, nearly 10 years later, I find this book an absolute masterpiece.Twain paints 19th century american ideals, themes, and perspectives through the experiences of perhaps the most memorable character in American literature. I found Huck truly innocent and clever, and his episodes with Tom Sawyer in their elaborate rescue attempts were some of the funniest and most touching I have ever read."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Powerful, refreshing, beautifully written and incrediably clever this is a timeless masterwork with well drawn characters. This unforgettable romp makes a superior read aloud."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Many people consider Huckleberry Finn to be a classic children's book about a young boy's adventures on a raft with his befriended slave Jim. The first and last third of the book are exactly that. Huck is up to his trickery in the beginning of the book and resumes his mischevious ways with his cousin Tom at the end of the book. But in the middle, Huck has many realizations that go directly against his Mississippi upbringing. Huck learns the evils of racism and Jim's humanity, along with the value of friendship. In this part of the novel, Huck matures into a free-thinking individual, leading him to his destination as the novel's conclusion."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"Huckleberry Finn\\" reflects very accurately the thinking and culture of the time. I was shook by the part where Huck recognizes that which many adults would not for years to come: that the African American is a human being worthy of that which all humans are entitled. It is a contemporaneous account of history, albeit fictional; it is typical of many accounts of the time, told as only Twain could tell it: so vividly that you feel Huck's adventure is your own.I found this edition very well done. I do admit, however, that I spent most of the book reading \\"chile\\" as \\"chilli\\". P.S. chile = child."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I don't need to tell you what this book is about: everyone is familiar with it. I started reading it for the first time at age 25, fully expecting it to be the greatest novel I've ever read. I was not disappointed. I've never laughed so much with one book. The dialects, the events, the people: they're all so priceless. A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Quote: \\"All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn... All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.\\" -- Ernest HemingwayWhy has 'Huckleberry Finn' been on so many lists of banned books? Because many readers (and many people who never bothered to read it) considered it indecent and racist. Yet, even with its frequent place on the lists of America's most challenged books, it's become a classic. Although many consider that Twain's depiction of the runaway slave, Jim, was demeaning and racist, the story shows the hypocrisy of American society towards slaves and African Americans. The story follows Huck and Jim - both runaways - as they travel down the Mississippi River, with Huck slowly changing his views about blacks and working to help Jim to freedom."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This classic is worth reading several times. We need a book like this for the times we live in now...what Twain could do with politics of today!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"After reading the book after it was written some 120 years before, I enjoyed the historical concept of the book and how America played out with the bigotry and views of slavery of the times. I found the dialects and the manner of speaking in the 19th Century annoying and hard to follow, but again in historical perspective, it was a good read, slow, probably authentic, sometimes annoying, and overall a good review of Huckleberry and his black friend Jim, floating down the river and experiencing endless adventures. The larger print of this edition was great for an older reader with fading eyes. In many ways, Huckleberry is an obnoxious, rebellious character, and probably nowadays would be on medication and maybe visiting the counselors for some behavior modication. Overall, worth the time and effort to read a Twain classic."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This was the least expensive of the available editions. It was excellent as the print was large making it easy to read.It is a classic book and was well presented."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is my favorite novel of all time. Although often assigned to middle school children, this book requires a certain level of maturity to appreciate it fully. At surface level, Twain's novel is engaging. One can't help but laugh and revel vicariously in the adventures that Huck and Jim get into. On a deeper level, this novel explores a more serious theme: the conflict between individual freedom and the corrupting influence of society. Huck resists being \\"civilized\\" by the Widow Jenkins, and readers cheer him on in this regard. He is resisting what many of us would like to resist---the boundaries set by society. To be \\"civilized\\" means to lose one's self in some way; it means to relinquish childhood.This book has always reminded me of J.D. Salinger's THE CATCHER IN THE RYE because of its completely honest first-person narrator and the theme of individual vs. society. So, if you like Salinger's novel, you'll probably enjoy this one."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This one's for Huckleberry Finn. I first read this is high school and forgot everything about it a month later. A while back I read it again and now my memory is much better. This is about the travels of the boy Huck Finn down or up the Mississippi River with a slave named Jim. Huck had previously escaped from his drunkard father and from \\"civilized\\" society as well. The book chronicles their travels and the many adventures that ensue. Mark Twain was a supremely talented writer and uses his skills in an impressive way here. The attention to detail is astonishing and I felt like I was right there with the protagonists every step of the way. There is also a great deal of humor as is to be expected to Twain. And also, there is an uplifting message about the nature of racisim towards the end that could be said to be the cenral theme of the novel. Now that's what was good, so what was bad? Well, Twain goes on and on about boring minutae many times throughout this thing. Two characters named the Duke and King (I think) are introduced and are basically criminals. Almost to a letter they are boring every time mentioned, but I wouldn't call them filler though, I just didn't get into them. They get Huck and Jim into all sorts of trouble and meet their end in time. Other than the long-windedness there isn't much wrong with this novel. Alot of people have said that this is the best ever novel by an American writer, but I don't agree. Oh, one more thing. There is a certain word tossed about quite often here that some people find offensive. I won't mention it here, but most people will be able to guess what it is. Get over it people, It's just the language of the times. I'm someone who could choose to be personally offended by that word in this book but can look past it to see what Twain was doing. If you can't do that then you'll be missing out on the novel's greater message of tolerance and understanding and doing yourself a disservice in the long run. This novel is definitely one of the best ever written and deserves a go by every man woman and child."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Let's begin by noting that this is a remarkable work for two reasons. First, it's written in vernacular, from start to finish. This makes the book raw and lively, humorous, and honest. It has a far truer ring to it than a thousand other books from the 19th century. Second, Huck rises above his pro-slavery upbringing and comes to see Jim as a man and a friend.Both remarkable features guarantee this novel a place in American lore. However, a good deal of its genius is in working against the sentiments of its age. The racial politics of the day are very different, and thus the novel--like Uncle Tom's Cabin--loses much of its traction.With its humor and plain-talk it is superior to almost any American novel from the 18th century. It remains an exceedingly funny novel. Twain is masterful in his depiction of boyhood and the comedies that arise from childish misunderstandings, mischievous shenanigans, and the art of the con. And it is a vital historical document. That will never change.I do think the book has some racist and classist moments. Despite Huck's sympathies with Jim, Jim and other Negroes do not come off as terribly intelligent or well-rounded people. In Huck's eyes, Jim is a man worthy of friendship and freedom, but he is woefully nave and gullible.The lampooning of Blacks and poor Whites takes away from the greatness of this book, even if Twain's political sympathies lay with both groups. And given the changed nature of \\"race\\" in the 21st century, some of what made this book brilliant is only recovered with an effort. These are reasons to phase Huck Finn out of the high school cannon. I say this while hoping that college students, and all adult Americans, will continue to read and love Huck Finn for many more centuries."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book was a very interesting book that l did not want to put down.

I had never read Huck Finn all the way through before (maybe a Great Illustrated Classics version when I was much younger), but I found that I ended up really enjoying the book. Especially discussing it in class and all that, and learning more about the characters than I would have normally.

This includes the controversial use of racial slurs, commonly heard as a part of the daily conversation of the time. This novel is also a window into a slice of American frontier living which no longer exists, and had mostly disappeared when Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was first published in 1885.Huck and Jim's adventures are the most engaging at the beginning and end of the novel. I feel the middle loses focus somewhat as Huck Finn becomes more of a secondary player as he crosses paths in the lives of other characters.If you find the dialogued difficult to read, then I recommend listening to a good audiobook version which will capture the exact flavor of how the speech is supposed to sound."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"As one of the most discussed books in American Literature - and with over 600 reviews on Amazon alone - there isn't much that I could probably add about the virtues (and sporadic vices) of Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. All I can discuss is my own experience with the book.I'd read this book before when I was in high school, when I gave it the \\"high school\\" sort of read: giving it just enough of a superficial read to get by on whatever book report or test was required. Now, years later, I was reading it not because I had to, but because I wanted to. As a follow-up to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, I read the earlier book first.This is a very good book. Coming from an era when much literature is too stuffy and serious for many readers (especially younger readers who can be put off by such works), Huckleberry Finn and Twain's other books are accessible and fun. But is it literature, in the more high-brow sense of the word? Yes. It is very well-written and portrays the antebellum South in both its charm and its savagery. Some scenes are funny, but others are heart-wrenching.He may not have been the first, but Twain's use of dialect in this book was still rather pioneering. This leads to controversy, particularly in the use of a certain racial term, but to ignore or ban this book because of this term is to turn a blind eye to the realities of the period. Twain uses the term not because he is a racist, but to make his book more authentic.In short, this is a great book, worth the reputation it has garnered over the years as a classic."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"While the content of this book has become controversial over the years and it is no longer popular in schools, it remains a personal treasure.I encountered this book many years ago when dealing with my issues as an Adult Child of an Alcoholic. It was pointed out as a book that we might understand and deal with, and even more as one that we could learn from.Any child who has spent time with an alcoholic parent will relate to Huck's decision to go back to his father, his fear of his father, and his final decision to symbolically kill himself so that he could be free of the widow and his father.As you watch the actions of Huck, and as you read his thoughts and feelings, you can deeply connect with your own. His decision not to challenge anyone, his constant blaming himself when things go wrong, and even his subservience to Tom Sawyer when he finally shows up, all speak of a child who has not sorted out what is his fault and what is the fault of someone else.Even though it is written in language that is no longer acceptable, and even though it portrays Jim at times as less than he should be portrayed, it is still a very good case study of its time."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"A classic of American literature. I so enjoyed reading it as an adult, more able to appreciate the quality of the writing, the characterizations, and the abiding themes of this book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The book was interesting, but I only read because my teacher made our whole class read it. But overall it was a pretty good historical-fiction book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"As you might have already known, &quot;The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; is one of Mark Twain's classics. It was written based on Mark Twain's best friend when he was a child. I have written a review on it because I think this book should not be forgotten.Huckleberry Finn is only fourteen when he runs away from his brutal father........Yet another one of Mark Twain's classics, Huckleberry Finn amazed me with its plot. On the previous book about Tom Sawyer, comes Huckleberry Finn; Tom's best friend.Young Huckleberry Finn was adopted by a widow and all was going quite well until the footsteps Huck saw on the snow...... The footsteps on the snow were in the way that his father always leaves behind. So, this means that Huck's cruel father has come back! The six thousand dollars Tom and Huck found in the previous book was safe in the bank but not anymore. Now that Huck's father is back, he wouldn't leave until he got the money.Huck's father has tried many ways to get Huck's money but fails every time. Soon, Huck's father captures Huck and locks him inside a wooden cabin in the woods. Huck's father now wanted both his son and his money.....Luckily, before long Huck plans an outstanding escape to Jackson Island and meets up with an old runaway slave; Jim. There, the two starts an amazing trip down the great Mississippi river. They're destination is freedom, Cairo; where Jim could be free. Unfortunately, while traveling on the river both of them meets many strangers and must outwit them to stay uncaught and alive.This book is highly recommended for those who thirst for excitement, action and adventures. The plot in this story is indescribable; it's full of breath-taking adventures and the way that Mark Twain could describe the feelings of a child is unbelievable.This book would be a perfect book back in the days Mark Twain wrote it; however, the slang in this book might be hard to follow for people nowadays. Even though that the slang he used might confuse us, the writing in this book is still excellent and would be recommended.Even though that I judge this a good book, I do feel that once in a while the book would suddenly skip from one adventure to the other. Overall, I do think that this book is worth reading and I would give this book; five &quot;Stars&quot;. (See the rating chart below for more details)If you compare Mark Twain's previous book; Tom Sawyer with Huckleberry Finn, I would say that Huckleberry Finn contains much more action, adventure and excitement. However, if you like more of psychology and more of a calmer plot, Tom Sawyer would be a better book for you. However, my final recommendation would be for you to read Huckleberry Finn as it is fit for the whole family to read and enjoy.If you have already read this book and liked it, I would also recommend you readingThe author of this book, Mark Twain was a famous writer and had many other jobs as well. Mark Twain was a very superstitious person since that he was born on the day that Halley's Comet was passing the earth and died when it returned. Mark Twain's actual name was Samuel Lang-Horne Clemens, he was born and raised in the state of Missouri. His father died when he was only twelve and so he left school to earn a living. He traveled around America as a journeyman printer. Later, Samuel went back to the Mississippi river to be a steamboat pilot. During the Civil War, steam boating was put to an end forcing Samuel to join the Confederate army. However, he soon extracted himself from it and became an extremely successful journalist.He was sent to the Mediterranean to do a series of articles after the war. This inspired him to be a writer and so he started to write books about his childhood which made him a fortune."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This particular edition does not claim to be abridged, but in relation to the audiobook version available on Audible.Com, there is at least one &quot;adventure&quot; (story) missing from this edition of which I'm aware. Specifically, Huck's visit to the very long raft where he over-hears the ghost barrel story does not seem to be present. Chapter XVI opens with a mention of the long raft, but then the story continues on to the next adventure without Huck visiting it. I'll be ordering a different print edition for cross-checking purposes."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I am a very big fan of Mark Twain and Garrison Keillor but was suprised to learn that the last 1/3 of this American Classic was re=written.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a powerful yet fun book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Reading the classics seems to be going out of style. I know that when I was in high school, I hated having to read classics, and I LOVE to read! However, reading this aloud to my daughter was so much fun for both of us. Huck is such a scamp and gets into so many scrapes, but comes out on top every time. A true work that reflects the time in which it was written."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Lots to think about, I liked it, but sometimes it was hard to get the meaning behind which was the better parts. Interesting to see how life was, if you didn't grow up being taught that way. Makes you watch what is being taught to you and not to believe everything. Society can be wrong, life is a mixture of grays not black and white."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a sequel of sorts. First came The Adventures of Tom Sawyer which Huckleberry Finn was a character in just as Tom Sawyer was in this one. In this adventure Huckleberry runs away from his alcoholic father and along the way runs into a slave Jim, who is trying to gain his freedom. As they stop in towns along the river they always seem to run into trouble.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was more enjoyable to read on my own then it was to read for school. Huck definitely has a original imagination to get them through all the hijinks they go through.I felt that by the Tom Sawyer showed up the book could and probably should have ended. Many of the people in the town were pretty gullible to believe Huck, Tom and other characters like the Duke or King.An Interesting read. Not sure I understand why it is a classic except that is by Mark Twain. I could see the authors humor throughout the book, which he was known for."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book has been reviewed to death: I will only echo Hemingway's criticism that the final few chapters of the story are a bit disappointing. Other than this, it is a wonderful depiction of life in the 1830's Mississippi. A great read!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Wonderful book full of old fashioned humor that is easy to read and understand. Truly a good read anytime anywhere."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Ernest Hemingway has remarked that &#34;All American literature grows out of Huck Finn.&#34; Jane Smiley has said that it was braver for Harriet Beecher Stowe to write Uncle Tom's Cabin in 1850 before the Civil War than it was for Mark Twain to write Huck Finn in 1885, twenty years after the war had ended. Maybe she is right, but Twain treats Jim as a person, while Stowe treated most of the slaves in her novel as a social problem. We all know the story. Jim is a runaway slave; Huck is a runaway teen. Together they raft down the Mississippi. Yadda yadda yadda plot, and Jim is sold back into slavery by two con-men, forcing Huck to choose between what was legal in 1840 (the approximate date of the action) and what was (and is) moral. He has heard the words of religion tolerating and even supporting slavery. He knows the laws support slavery. But Jim is his friend. Jim is not property. He is a man. When Huck Finn finally decides that his only course of action is to free Jim, he signals his determination with the line, &#34;All right, then, I'll go to hell!&#34; &#8212; and thus proves Jim's humanity and his own. In those days, people believed in hell, yet Huck will risk that eternal damnation for a fellow human. It's a great line in a great book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The classic novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, portrays the character of Huck as the average American. He wants to have adventure, live his life to the fullest, and can't seem to stay in one place for too long. The strong ties of family that are shown in the people Huck encounters on his journey and are reflective of the American way of life as well. Along the way in his adventures he comes into contact with a runaway slave, Jim. Huck goes through moral struggles in this book, but decides that Jim is his good friend and that he can't turn him in. The power of friendship and the desire to be on his own propel Huck through his adventures along the Mississippi and he proves to himself that he just can't seem to be \\"sivilized.\\" This novel brings out the adventurer in all of us and proves that Americans just can't be held down without seeing what's out there in the great wild frontiers of our lives."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"If you haven't read Huck Finn in decades (possibly when it was assigned to you in junior high), pick it up again and be amazed. (If you've never read it before, pick it up and be thunderstruck.) Hemingway wasn't wrong when he said that all American literature came from this book. It was the first novel that truly captured one strain of American vernacular (actually, several), and the character of Huck is so quinetssentially American that you're bound to recognize all sorts of American literary first-person characters who have directly followed (Holden Caulfield and Augie March, just to name two). Forget the PC issue -- when you read fiction, judge words in their contexts, not by their politics beyond the page. If you're too young to do that, perhaps you're not ready for it anyway. I was force-fed Huck Finn at 14 and remembered it with only bitterness until I picked it up in my 30s and was amazed (see first sentence)."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Want a book with an adventurous twist? Then Huckleberry Finn is the book for you. Not only is Huckleberry Finn an adventurous book, it is also can be comical and light, though the book has a grave meaning, showing the wrongs in society at the time in the late 19th century.The book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer precedes Huckleberry Finn, where in the beginning of Huckleberry Finn, Huck lives with the widow Douglas, though doesn't like the high class living, and frequently leaves to see his father, who's always drunk, or just hangs out in the woods. While in the woods, Huck meets Jim, a slave who escaped and needs to cross the Mississippi River to the freedom on the other side, in Illinois. Although this book portrays a serious meaning, it can also be funny and witty.I liked this book because it was witty and comical, though it had an important message at the same time. I really liked this book because of this, though the southern accent complicates the understanding of the book. Overall, I thought this book is definitely a classic and a must read for all age levels."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book is very funny, adventurous & creative. Seen as if out of the eyes of the mischievious Huck. Defidentily worth reading. This book is a classic for a reason. A must read for any one looking for a fun read"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was one of the best books that I have read in a long time. The way the Huck lives his life is very interesting in ways that I can relate. Whether Huck is sneaking out of the house or talking to his best friends about big plans they have, it all makes sense to me. Mark Twain did an excelent job with all the characters and how they all have different problems at home or with some of their friends. He also shined in this book when he came up with all the ideas for the kids to get in trouble with, like starting a gang or running away and taking off down the river and getting caught up with con artists. In my opinion the best part of the book is right off the start when the Widow adopts Huck and tries to clean him up and get him to study and learn new things, and huck wants absolutely nothing to do with any of it. Then right when Huck gets to the point of losing it, he runs off until Tom tells him to come back so they can start their new robbery gang, which meant that Huck must return. When Huck returns the Widow Douglass' sister Miss Watson is living their now with Huck and the widow and the head servant Jim. Overall, I would have to say the this book was very well written and explained and I would have to give this book 4 out of 5 possible stars for my grade. So if you like funny books with some action in them, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, is dated back to the pre-civil war era. It is also classic American Literature. The story is about a boy named Huck, whose father is a drunk. Huck lives with a lady who wants to &#65533;sivilize him.&#65533; Eventually, his own father kidnaps him. He then escapes and joins up with Jim, a slave who escaped from Miss Watson. Jim did this after overhearing talk about him being sold. As Jim and Huck take on their journey and float down the river, they have many adventures. Huck, who did not want to help Jim escape at first, slowly realizes that slaves are people. Mark Twain jokes a lot and has funny sequences. This happens a lot during Huck&#65533;s faked death, and also when Huck and Jim cross-dress.Huck impersonates Tom and Tom impersonates Sid. Huck and Jim rescue each other a lot of times through out the story. This book has many plot twists to keep the reader busy while reading this adventure. The word \\"nigger\\" was just a way for Twain to make Jim&#65533;s world come to life. Some people think the usage of this word is crude and racist, but it is requirement while reading this book. It is also used to find out why this book is against slavery so much. Mark Twain also gave each character their own style of speech to fit their individuality and intelligence. Twain uses this voyage of Jim and Huck to emphasize some of his themes and morals that he wanted to teach the readers. Such morals are that of racism and slavery when Huck turns on Jim. Huck lies and cons, which is shown through the characters of Duke and Dauphin. You are sure to like this book if you like pre-civil war era books."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the classic pre-Civil War tale of a young boy, Huck, and a runaway African-American slave named Jim. Huck leaves because of his abusive father, and Jim has escaped his owner to become a free man in the North. On their raft, swiftly traveling down the Mighty Mississippi, Huck and Jim come across many southern towns along the river, bringing them to meet many interesting characters, and many adventures.In this book, many southern dialects are used, and although it may be difficult to read at times, the overall effect created by it makes the story more lifelike. Being pre-Civil War, some of the language is outdated, and it may be difficult to read over some of the terms and ideas used and expressed, but the only reason for their use is to show Mark Twain's overall motive of the book that proves the negative effects of slavery in the United States.If you liked The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you'll love this book, because of their similarities in background, and the fact that they share the same main characters. Both books are Twain's masterpieces, and should both be read by all generations, young, old, and still to come."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Despite the fact that The Adventure of Huckleberry Finn has been the subject of conflict and controversy since its publication over a century ago, it has remained a favorite for a wide range of audiences. Between the rollicking humor and a series of outrageously unexpected adventures, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn could be categorized as a Dennis the Menace style epic. Mark Twain uses local dialects and detailed descriptions to recreate each of Huck's extraordinary experiences. However, beneath the quaint language and good humor that characterize small town life in antebellum Mississippi, Mark Twain reveals the horrors of the slave trade. The book has been banned in a number of schools and libraries on account of Twain's straightforward treatment of such a delicate topic. Huck's growth and development throughout the novel lead him to reject the culturally predominant attitude toward slaves and he eventually embraces Jim not only as person but also as a friend. Though the words Twain uses to refer to slaves are offensive, his portrayal of the deepening relationship between Huck and Jim is a harsh critique of the attitudes and practices of the slaveholding class. Whether it is read as a purely entertaining tale of juvenile mischief or a biting criticism of slavery, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will continue to excite and inspire audiences for decades to come."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I would recommend this book to 15 year olds and up or if you have a good vocabulary. This is a spectacular book. This book kept me in suspense almost the whole book. This book teaches you about slavery. They have a lot of people that think African-Americans should be slaves. It is an adventurous book that takes you along the Mississippi &amp; The Ohio River before the civil war. I liked the book, because most the time when I start a book I get bored with it then I don't finish it. I really recommend that teachers have this book for there students and parents have there children read this book, I hope people wont ever be prejudice."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"With this novel Mark Twain confidently changed the way Americans read as well as viewed literature. Through the careful construction of the two main characters Huck and Jim, Twain explores the questionable moral values and hypocrisy of society. Against all odds Huck and Jim form an honest relationship that rises above race, slavery, and southern society. Twain's story is told through the voice of boy who has not yet been \\"sivilized\\" by society, and is still able to live outside of convention. This novel combines the strong language that Twain has been remembered for, and a message that is as relevant today as it was in the early nineteen hundreds. As a college student who has read this book in middle scool, high school, and college, I can say that The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was written for all ages and is an important and necessary educational tool."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"By reading this book, I understand that Mark Twain was not a racist. He tells the truth about what was going on a long time ago during the time of slavery. This book is anti-slavery because if you really understand Twain's point of view, he wrote this book so that many people would accept each other as equal. The young boy in the book did the unthinkable by becoming a friend with a poor slave. In the book only two people were innocent and the majority of them were lynchers, robbers, murderers,and thieves. Huck and Jim have a great sense of human diginity and sympathy. They fight for their freedom and finally got out of the mess that they were in.This book is one of the American masterpieces. I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain's tale is timless. As a friend remarked, Huckleberry Finn is all things good. Tom Sawyer could grow up to be Donald Trump. John Seelye's introduction is insufferable. If Twain had been exposed to it, Seelye would have joined his hate list. Without the introduction, The book would have received the five stars it deserves."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I had previously only read this novel in a translated version (Norwegian), and after reading it in \\"proper English\\" I am quite amazed about what gets lost in translation... Among the major strengths of this adventure tale is its language, which, I must admit, also made it quite strenuous to read at times. I often had to read out loud various passages in order to understand them. In retrospect, just for this very reason, this might have been a good book to listen to on tape to fully appreciate the proper pronounciations.This classic coming-of-age story is quite good, and the characters stay with you long after the book is finished. I especially enjoyed all the delightful superstitions that Twain weaves into his characters - among the black folks as well as the white. Also, the tender relationship between Huck and Jim is delightful reading.As a sidenote, the version I was reading did not have a map and I quickly came to miss the ability to visualize the locations that were described along the Mississippi. I eventually found a different copy of the book (an abridged version, nonetheless - ugh!) which had a map that clearly showed all the action. Afterwards, I had a much better appreciation for the geographical nuances...I am glad this is a required high school text - its themes are still highly relevant, and it has the potential to start great debates about race relations - then as well as now. I almost wish that I could have read it as part of a class. This is the kind of literature (kind of like Shakespeare) that I would be able to appreciate even more if I could pause at regular intervals with some class-room discussion. However, even if you are battling it alone, it is well worth the effort.Recommended!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I give this book three stars because it really didn't interest me too much. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, and I'm glad that i read it, but sometimes it got really boring. I really think everyone should read this book, though, because of it's impact on American society and because it teaches very good lessons. I would definitely recommend it to those who like historical fiction, you will really like this book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I found this novel to be a great story. It has many ethical values, and is captivating. It shows Huck being torn over hard desisions, and his friendship with a black slave.

After this, the Widow Douglas and Miss Watson took Huck into their home. Huck can't stand how the town is attempting to civilize him, so he ran away. After Tom Sawyer finds him, Tom tells him that he can't join his gang unless he goes back to the Widow's house, so Huck does. Tom's gang meets in a cave at night to plan their next robberies. Many of the members get bored of the fake adventures that Tom makes up off of urban legends, so the gang breaks up.Later on, Huck sees a footprint with a cross in the heel: Pap's. It dawns on Huck that Pap must have come back to take his money, so he runs to Judge Thatcher to \\"sell\\" him his part of the treasure money. In return, Judge Thatcher gives him a dollar. When Huck gets home to the widow's house, Pap is sitting on his bed waiting for him. After being infuriated by the fact that Huck would go to school, and that Judge Thatcher wouldn't give him the money, he takes Huck's dollar, and kidnaps him from the house.Judge Thatcher and the Widow both tried to get custody of Huck, but the new judge in town didn't know about Pap, and didn't want to break up father and son. Back at the log cabin where Pap takes him, Huck enjoys being able to smoke, cuss, and lay around all day again at first, but decides he needs to escape Pap's abuse.The next time Pap goes into town to buy booze, Huck escapes. Killing a pig, he spreads the pig blood around the cabin, then takes an axe and chops through the door and trashes the rest of the cabin, to make people think that robbers came in the cabin and murdered him. Finally, he takes a canoe downstream to Jackson's Island to hide out until the town stopped searching for his body.After a couple of days on the island, he meets up with Jim, who has run away to avoid being sold. Jim, being superstitious thinks that Huck is a ghost, but then Huck convinces him that he's not dead. The two end up traveling together on a raft down the river. Their goal is to reach Cairo, so they can take a steamboat up the Ohio to the free states.After a nightlong storm, an abandon house floats past their camp site. When they climb onto it, they find a dead man. When Jim goes over to see the body, he recognizes Pap; he doesn't tell Huck who it is.Huck and Jim decide that they need to go to town to get news and supplies. Huck dresses as a girl, and goes ashore. He knocks on the nearest house, and meets a woman. While talking to her, he learns that Jim is being accused of Huck's and Pap's deaths since he ran away. Then Huck learns that a search party is going to invade Jackson's Island that night, so he runs off to warn Jim.They continue to float downstream, and during a particularly rough storm, they see an abandoned steamboat. When they go aboard, they soon discover that there are three thieves aboard. Using the thieves' skiff to escape, they watch the boat until it sinks so low the water, that everyone on board would have drowned.After finding their raft, Jim and Huck continue downstream. One night, in a fog, they got separated. During the fog, they pass Cairo.Nights later, a steamboat crashes into the raft, crushing it, and Hunk Huck and Jim to jump off to save their lives. When Huck gets to shore, he is apprehended by search dogs. He is then taken in by the Grangerfords. Huck soon finds out where Jim is hiding. Then a fight between the the Grangerfords and the Shepherdsons, who have been in a 30 year feud, many members of each family are killed. Huck leaves the scene with Jim, and they continue to float on the river.Soon after that happened, two strangers, board Huck and Jim's raft. These partners are a pair of robbers who are escaping from a nearby town. The first man, tells Huck and Jim that he is the \\"dauphin,\\" (the son of King Louis XVI- heir to the French throne). The second man says that he is the \\"usurped Duke of Bridgewater.\\" Since Huck is supposed to be dead, and Jim is a runaway slave, they are forced to deal with the two intruders, in fear of being turned out. The two men invent many scams, one of them being \\"the Royal Nonesuch\\" which earns them tons of money. Then the duke and the dauphin overhear about the death of a man named Peter Wilks, who has left his fortune to his two brothers. They get the man drunk, and he gives them so much information, they are able to pretend to be the two brothers. The Wilks sisters welcome the two men into their home as they present the inheritance as they are in mourning, never suspecting the hoax. The two spend their time selling all the girls' property for even more money. Later, Huck confesses to the oldest of the sisters the entire situation. Later, the real brothers show up, but lost the proof of their identity. After a spout, the townspeople decide to dig up the body to determine who the liars are.Huck runs to the raft and Jim to push off into the river, but the Duke and King are able to get on. Later, the King and Duke sell Jim.When Huck decides to rescue Jim, he goes to the house where Jim is, but the house belongs to Tom Sawyer's Aunt Sally! Huck is then mistaken for Tom. Huck then sees Tom on his way there, and explains the situation. Tom pretends to be his younger brother Sid, and together they decide how to help Jim escape.The two boys then tell the town that a group of thieves is going to attack where Jim is being held. As they run away with Jim, Tom gets shot in the calf. Huck goes to town to tell a doctor, and the doctor returns with Tom on an old mattress, and Jim in chains. When Tom awakens, he demands that they let Jim go free.Aunt Polly came to see them when her sister, Sally, told her that Tom and Sid were there. Aunt Polly informs everyone that Jim is actually free, and tells everyone That Tom is really Huck, that Sid is really Tom, and that Pap is dead."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I think this book did average for me. I wasn't really all into the book because I guess it wasn't my type. I know that's pretty selfish but other than that, the plot and everything else was great. It really is a great book. I love how Huck was always getting himself out of trouble that he started on his own. it was pretty cool how Jim got involved in the situation with the town thinking he killed Huck. I mean that was such a coincidence how Jim ended up at the same hideout as Huck. I didn't like how the book was so descriptive. That's why I thought that some parts were pretty boring because Huck would just talk about the same thing over and over until the readers get a clear picture of what he was trying to describe. This book was really challenging and funny."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain's masterpiece has withstood the test of time and has remained one of America's finest pieces of literature. I find it ironic that this book was supposed to be nothing more than a follow-up to Tom Sawyer. Huckleberry Finn definitely stands on it's own, as it's themes are much deeper and more mature than it's predecessor. I'm glad I waited \`til I was a little older when I tackled this story. As everyone knows, the southern language in the book is at times difficult and much of Twain's humor might have been lost on me had I read it earlier. For these reasons I have a hard time calling this book a children's classic.The story is simple enough. A boy in his young teens decides to run away from his drunken father and the people bent on \\"sivilizing\\" him. On his adventures he meets up with Jim, a runaway slave seeking freedom. The book follows their escapades as they raft down the Mississippi river.There are frequent racial references that may be offensive to the modern reader, but people need to be aware that Mark Twain's original intention was one of irony. Jim, the runaway at who the slurs are often directed, is depicted as an intelligent and noble man. Twain is making fun of the superstitions, customs, and racist attitudes of the south of that time."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"In this story there is a parentless child named Huck Finn. Huck lives with a lady named Mrs. Watson, and his best friend is Tom Sawyer. One day Huck figured out that he had lots of inheritance money, and his alchoholic father came to claim it. So Huck meets his father, who took him and locked him in a cabin. Huck escaped after a couple of weeks and fakes he was murdered. So Huck took off in a canoe. While hiding, he ran into Jim, Mrs. Watson's slave that had ran away, and Huck was mighty happy. Together they boated down south until they met these two cut throat rapscalions. Huck & Jim were then forced to work for them. They found out Jim was a run away slave and sold him to Tom's aunt and uncle. Huck escaped from the cutthroats, and found Jim at Tom's aunt and uncle's house. They believe Huck is Tom. Eventually Tom and Huck meet and convince the aunt and uncle that Tom is his brother, Sid Sawyer. So Huck & Tom live together, and try to break Jim out. When they get Jim out the gaurds fire and hit Tom in the calf. Tom and Huck boat to an island, but Huck goes to get a doctor and runs into the uncle of Tom. Then Tom gets back and is sick and tells his aunt everything and they adopt Huck, and that is how it ends.I gave this book a four because it's a great book. This book is sort of hard to understand with the southern slang, and accents. This book is great for kids who like adventures. Also it is just the book to learn what it was like in the south in the 1800's. I loved this book because of the characters and the way they acted. Also if you like books with deceiving and conning you'll love this one. so overall this is a great book. This book is a should read book, so get it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I enjoyed reading this classic very much. The characters definitely made it a funny, interesting, and exciting book to read. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a worthy read. This is a book I'm proud to have finished and be able to say I have read. I honestly enjoyed it. On a scale from 1-10 I would have to give it a 8.5. Mark Twain really paints a clear picture of the two main characters and how they come to be throughout the book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a classic read, full of adventure, and a real true friendship lesson. This was a very challenging book but all the worthwhile. This is a book that has made me interested in experimenting other Mark Twain books. I truly think this book should have never been banned; it only prevented children from a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn is not only Twain's best work, but is considered by some, one of the greatest novels ever written. Episodic in form (as Twain warns, \\"persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot\\"), Huckleberry Finn is clearly, along with Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter and Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, one of the three most ambitious and artistically successful novels of America's 19th century.But what is it about Huckleberry Finn that makes it stand out? Most young people reading it will declare that they thought Tom Sawyer was better, and for them, they would be right. It is a difficult novel to teach. The dialect is actually difficult for some inexperienced readers. The satire and ironies are often lost on some readers, and some minorities are offended by what they think is its racist tone. That, however, is an historical irony if ever there was one. Twain's intent was to belittle and make fun of the racist attitudes of most Americans. The very fact that Jim and Huck were able to achieve a fast friendship and to negotiate together the epic journey down the Mississippi with Jim often showing superior wisdom and a right smart common sense did not sit well with some prejudicial mind sets. Today what offends is the language, in particular the use of the \\"n\\" word.But what makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel is first and foremost the indelible character of the often self-effacing Huck Finn himself and his compelling, lyrical, and ever so beautifully observed narrative. There is only one other novel in American literature that can be considered in the same league as far as first person narratives go, and that is Nabokov's Lolita. Strange to say Humbert Humbert and Huck Finn have one thing in common, an uncommon ability to make their differing worlds extraordinarily vivid through painstakingly clever and absolutely authentic voices. Both Twain and Nabokov achieved this rare veracity because of their command of language, their sense of character, and their fine ear for the nuances of speech.Sense of character is also what makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel. The characters are so real they practically jump off the page. Even the minor characters are Shakespearean in their psychological verity. It is not exactly a co-incidence that the Duke of \\"Bilgewater\\" and the \\"King of France,\\" those ornery rascals rescued by Huck and Jim, were experts in ersatz Shakespeare and various dodges. Twain knew people, and he knew them well. Too well, one might say, considering his low opinion of humankind.The effective--even rhapsodic--use of dialect is another thing that makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel. Writing a novel in dialect is a difficult thing to do well. Many have tried it and many have failed. Most writers are well advised to limit their use of dialect to the speech of their characters. But Twain was a master of dialect of many sorts, and was able to have Huck Finn narrate the entire novel in his voice while at the same time employ the various dialects of the other characters. Nabokov--although I don't think he ever acknowledged this--was undoubtedly influenced by Twain's authentic use of dialect; but because his narrator was a transplanted European professor of literature, he had to narrate in standard English; indeed a most eloquent standard English. Yet, one notices that Nabokov through Humbert took some delight in reproducing Lolita's authentic speech, her mid-twentieth century, New England, urban teenaged dialect.Finally, what makes Huckleberry Finn a great novel is its humor. Twain was a master of all sorts of humor. (He was a great public speaker and story teller.) The language of the novel itself is replete with \\"malapropisms, puns, misquotations, understatement, exaggeration, incongruities, illiteracies, and absurd spellings,\\" to quote from Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia of American Literature, p. 259--most done for comedic effect. Additionally, the yarns themselves, the \\"stretchers,\\" as Huck has it, are wondrous funny, and Huck's commonsensical take on life often contrasted humorously with what he actually saw and experienced.Here's one of my favorite passages from the book to illustrate the master's humorous style. The ragged \\"King\\" is about to divulge \\"the secret of\\" his \\"being\\" to the supposed Duke of Bridgewater and to Huck and Jim. He says, doing the \\"Duke\\" one better:\\"Bilgewater, I am the late Dauphin!\\"Huck writes, \\"You bet you Jim and me stared, this time. Then the duke says:'You are what?''Yes, my friend, it is too true--your eyes is lookin' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin, Looy the Seventeen, son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette.''You! At your age? No! You mean you're the late Charlemagne; you must be six or seven hundred years old, at the very least.''Trouble has done it, Bilgewater, trouble has done it; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude. Yes, gentlemen, you see before you, in blue jeans and misery, the wanderin', exiled, trampled-on and sufferin' rightful King of France.'\\"It is the sheer density of Twain's artistry that most impresses me. I wish I had room to quote the rest of the page as Huck goes on to describe how they \\"majestying\\" him so that it \\"done him heaps of good.\\" There is so much on practically every page. I know of no other writer except Shakespeare who can reveal so much in so few words, and who could use words so creatively.This is a great novel and anyone who cares about American literature has read it or will."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"If at some point in your life you haven't read this book then you must have come from another planet. I've personally read it as both a child, a teen & as an adult and it still has lost none of it's punch. The witty narration of Huck and Jim's adventures are truly a timeless tale. Twain is not only making fun of Huck and himself, but also the reader. After all, how many 12 year old boys in literature have captured the imaginations of so many worldwide over a span of more than one hundred years...? The charges by some libraries and school districts over the years of racism is itself ludicrous and narrow-minded. Twain is merely using the dialect and voice of his times rather than making harsh judgements about blacks. None of his other works come anywhere close to the scope and entertainment value of this one, but we as readers are fortunate to have it. Huck and Jim's journey down the mighty Mississippi river is no less than a metaphor for the journey of the U.S., it's changing culture, and it's indigenous people at large. T.A.O.H.F is especially fun as a summer read. The overall development of characters (and there are many here) also strikes me as exceptional. The beauty and lasting value of this work will surely last far into generations yet to come. More than being a simple work for the young, this book reaches out to the big kid in all of us."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I can honestly say that this was a great book. I strongly advise that if you are into adventurous books then you should give this book a try. Just the idea of running away from your old life to make a new one is so appealing to me. Sorry I'm getting ahead of myself here. You see Huck was living in a foster home, because his deadbeat dad abandoned him. I guess that you could say that it was a comfortable life, but it wasn't quite comfortable by Huck's standards (I think there was too much bathing involved). Then along comes his dad and suddenly he's living with him again. That wasn't very fun at all because Huck's father is a bit insane so Huck just up and leaves one day. He ends up traveling down the Mississippi. That's when the adventures start. He meets up with a couple of con artists, two feuding families, and travels the whole way with a runaway slave who becomes his best friend. Believe me this book is great stuff. Give it a try, even if you only read the first five or ten pages, I have a feeling you'll like it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a GREAT novel by Mark Twain. It's about a boy, \\"Huck\\" living in the deep south in the 1800's during the time of slavery. Huck does not fit into the life that is aunt or father or anyone else imagines for him. Instead, he lives a life based upon his everyday adventures. During some parts of this book, I was so excited, I couldn't put it down. During some other parts, I just wanted to fall asleep. The slow parts do pass by quickly and the book is worth your time. This book does contain some politically-incorrect language, but I still highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Ernest Hemingway once said &#65533;All American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn. All American writing comes from that. There was nothing before. There has been nothing as good since.&#65533; When I first read this on the back of my book, I thought to myself, yeah right, this book is going to be the biggest snore fest, and that I&#65533;d be needing a dictionary to get through it. However, once I got into it, Ernest proved me wrong. I found the novel to be filled with just the right touch of humor that offered perspective into what life used to be like. I also felt that this novel was also a bit controversial with its dealing with such topics as racism, slavery, cruelty and injustice. Twain then balanced the controversy with the perfect dosages of friendship and loyalty. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a timeless classic, everyone should read this novel if given the opportunity."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel written for enjoyment, the adventures that Huck has are somewhat comical and enjoyable for everyone. There is also a more serious side to the novel where Twain uses Huck to learn the evils of society that the story takes place in. Through Huck, Twain tells his opinion of slavery and shares his own moral values. Because this is a realistic book, Twain can convey his thoughts and morals to readers of every level, not just highly educated scholars. Using realism, Twain lets people know how he thinks and shows that people can change. Realism is utilized to allow all people to be able to relate and understand what is going on in the novel. I believe everyone at one point in their life should read this novel."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the classic pre-Civil War tale of a young boy, Huck, and a runaway African-American slave named Jim. Huck leaves because of his abusive father, and Jim has escaped his owner to become a free man in the North. On their raft, swiftly traveling down the Mighty Mississippi, Huck and Jim come across many southern towns along the river, bringing them to meet many interesting characters, and many adventures.In this book, many southern dialects are used, and although it may be difficult to read at times, the overall effect created by it makes the story more lifelike. Being pre-Civil War, some of the language is outdated, and it may be difficult to read over some of the terms and ideas used and expressed, but the only reason for their use is to show Mark Twain's overall motive of the book that proves the negative effects of slavery in the United States.If you liked The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, you'll love this book, because of their similarities in background, and the fact that they share the same main characters. Both books are Twain's masterpieces, and should both be read by all generations, young, old, and still to come."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn is darker and more serious than Tom Sawyer, and also, I think, better. Many people, after reading Tom Sawyer, seem to think of Huck as Tom's little sidekick. This book shows that Huck is very much his own man. After hanging around on the streets for most of his life, Huck is adopted by the well-intentioned but way too overprotective Widow Douglas(needless to say, Huck is none too pleased with the widow's attempts to turn him into an upstanding citizen). Eventually, Huck is kidnapped by his own father, a drunk and negligent man. Huck escapes and joins up with Jim, a slave who escaped after overhearing that his owners were planning to sell him.As Jim and Huck float down the river, they have many adventures. Huck, who at first was very much against aiding Jim's escape, slowly comes to realize that slaves are people.Huck's comments about how Jim seems to be just like him or any other white person are not dumb or rascist, they are part of Huck's relearning, and breaking of the stereotypes he has grown up with.That is not to say this book is only an exploration of serious matters. It has Mark Twain's usual jokes and funny sequences, during which Huck fakes his own death, Huck and Jim cross-dress,Huck impersonates Tom and Tom impersonates Sid, and Huck and Jim rescue each other many, many times and become friends, something that Huck didn't think was possible."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Civilry\\"The Old Southern Code\\"Organized SocietyAnd ReligionAll of these are cast down and demolished by America's greatest humorist ever Mark Twain. This book primarily follows the adventures of one Huckleverry Finn as he escapes his home, his father and reality on a raft floating down the Mississippi River. On these journeys he is in the company of Jim, a house slave who at first appears to be an ignorent slave. Then we find out that this guy has a wife and a family and that he also has his own personal demons to settle just like Huck. Jim can sometimes be a bit steriotypical but even that serves its purpose in the end. In the process they discover things about each other, Jim discovers that not all white people are bad, Huck discoverers that Black people aren't stupid and savage as has been taught to him since birth. This book is a perfect example of society(and Twain in particular) triyng to come to terms with himself in the latter half of the 19th century. All this is done in the vernacular and with great humor. It is a great bookNow, this book has taken a lot of heat over the last few years for a few words that some people have deemed offensive. Well yes I agree that the word is very offensive when taken in a negative contex, however that is not what Twain wanted to exhibit. Do not draw the conclusion that since the word is in the book that automatically makes Twain a racist. If you do your research you will see that Twain was probably the most non-racist person of his era. He only included the word because he wanted hwat people would have said to be as accurate as possible. This book should not be taken off of selves just because that one word of because of the way a certain character is portrayedOverall-Great book, the only thing I never liked was the last chapter, I mean what the heck?

Twain has a good old time mocking social conventions, and the novel is gripping almost all the way through. Hemingway was right: the end of Huck Finn is poor.

On the whole, this works, although it gets tiresome to read Huck's dialect sometimes. Twain-as-narrator is definitely missed here. Nobody could write a clever sentence like Twain, and most of that is lost here, although occasionally Huck will turn one (and by doing so break character, but that's the price you pay).Huck Finn has been exceedingly controversial because of the extensive use of the n-word.

They lived off very well without him; Huck went to school, learned to read and write and was overall happy. Then out of nowhere Huck's father returned and took Huck away. His father was a drunk and treated Huck very badly, and he had to get out. Huck faked his own death and was ready to leave his life behind in order to start over. He builds a canoe and paddled to the island on the other side of the river. There he found Jim a run away slave. They became friends and traveled up north to get a new life for Huck and freedom for Jim. Huck and Jim traveled at night on the raft and slept and hid during the day. Along the way they met up with frauds and learned many things good and bad from them. The frauds were convinced they were royalties, even though they know it wasn't true. After they stole a large amount of money from very good people Huck and Jim knew they should not associate them. They were final caught but then got away and met up with Jim and Huck down the river. From there to make some more money one of the frauds they took Jim and sold him back into slavery. Huck was furious because he had befriended Jim and saw him as a regular person, not as a slave. He went to the home where Jim was being held and had a plan for escape. While he was there Huck met up with an old friend of his Tom Sawyer. Together they came up with a plan to free Jim. Does this plan work for them? Or does it backfire in their faces? To find out read the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.This was a good book, it covered an abundant amount of topics that interest me. Some quotes that give the book a good feel as are follows, also these quotes gives you some sort of inside look to the book.\\"The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.\\" This was Huck talking about this first family.\\"It was a close place. I took . . . up [the letter I'd written to Miss Watson], and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: \\"All right then, I'll go to hell\\"-and tore it up. It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming.\\" This was Huck thinking about his friendship with Jim and whether he was doing the right thing or not.These quotes can give a feel for what the book is about and an idea if you would like some of the thing that are discussed in the book.I would recommend this book to a large group of different people. It contains a lot of material that will appeal to many different people making it easy for more people to enjoy it. It has everything from adventure, human suffering, family problems, to robbers and much more.

People who want to bann the book just because it uses the \\"n\\" word are ignorant an do not want to see that slavery really did happen. It has become one of the most evil and hated words in the english language, but during the time Twain wrote this book the word was very commonly used,;it is in the book to show the reader the how black people were treated. Although it may be a sensitive issue, people need to talk about slavery and their ideas on slavery and not supress them. If we refuse to teach the book just because of this then we are trying to ignore our history. It should be veiwewed as a chance to realize that people were wrong and their mistakes are still trying to be fixed today. Should we not teach American history of the 19th century just because there was slavery? No we must learn from our past and make sure history does not repeat itself. It is very important for people when they read this book to seperate the ideas of the author with the ideas of the characters, because these are two totally diffrent veiws.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is about events that happened a long time ago, and I really enjoyed reading this book because I like history.This book is about a boy named Huckleberry Finn, as you might have guessed. Huck lives with a widow who had adopted him after he and Tom Sawyer, his best friend, caught two murderers and found six thousand dollars. Huck Finn did not like living all fine and dandy, so he was always breaking the rules. ...Huck would live with his dad, but his dad is always drunk and can not get settled in one place. BR> There are so many more adventures that Huck and Jim encounter, but I do not want to give away the ending, Please read it; it has a great twist at the end. On a scale of 1-5 stars, I would give it a 3 because I really enjoyed this magnificent book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Never mind 'It's a classic'. It's downright funny.

You don't understand how amazingly intelligent this book is. The entire thing rips on pre civil war south with subtle but but genious comments about the way things were. Only one thing wrong This book is an example of realism and all through twain rips on romanticism. But is the ending truly realism. If a slave was to run away wouldn't he be hanged. If they would of hung him I think the ending would have been better. Not because I hated jim, in fact he was the best character, but because it fits better with the way twain was writing his story. I also think it would have been the ultimate lesson on how if you believe romanticism sometimes reality can be devastating. But the story is wonderful anyway. Go ahead and buy about ten copies and give them to everyone you know. they'll apreciate it and if they don't its there loss."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huckleberry Finn, as told by Garrison Keillor, was a profound disappointment for me, a fan of all things Wobegone. As a faithful version of THE American Classic, this telling takes jarring liberities (such as changing the ending!) and leaves loose ends (Huck posing as Tom at the aunt's home is suddenly just Huck again without explanation). As a good audio narrative, forget it: Garrison's sonorous delivery doesn't make it. Very frustrating listening while driving - every word is a moan or whisper with consonants that crack and pop, so no volume is comfortable. His character voices meld together in places, making it difficult to follow the give and take between the Duke and the King. And in one spot on the river, it sounds like Guy Noir quizzing Huck! Yuck. I'd advise: pick another version, and you'll like Huck Finn and Garrison Keillor better."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I am enjoying reading this classic to my son. I read it years ago. By reading this story to him, I am finding myself excited and ready to take on a new adventure. The price is unbelievable, too."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Maybe this book should not, as one reviewer noted, be assigned in high school. But then maybe no books should be assigned to people who are quicker to judge than to understand. Stupid, boring, difficult...hardly.Well--of course it's difficult (like everything that's good), for some good reasons. First of all, it's an illiterate white boy from the deep South--of course he speaks dialect (which is not the same as &quot;he cain't spell&quot;). Second, it's tough subject matter Twain tackles. What would you do in this situation? The right thing, which is what you've been told to do--turn Jim in? Or should you follow your heart, as Huck finally does, thinking it'll send him straight to hell? What would Jesus do?I find this book a rollercoaster ride, one adventure after another. Like many other readers, I am disturbed by the last couple of chapters, but given how Huck is under the influence of Tom Sawyer, it's not unintelligible.However, I have a bone to pick with this particular edition, by the Oxford UP. The introduction by Emory Elliot is less than satifying. For instance, he claims Twain was highly original in making this illiterate character the narrator of his novel, when of course there was a plethora of for instance slave narratives, often told by semi-literate narrators. He goes on to state that Twain was the first American author to explore &quot;divorce, social strife, and violence&quot;--seemingly forgetting all about, for instance, &quot;Uncle Tom's Cabin,&quot; written well before &quot;Huck,&quot; where all these issues are discussed.That said, I am happy to see that this edition features as an appendix the infamous &quot;Raftmen's Passage,&quot; essential to the plot but excised by Twain (really, by his editor), and this restores the &quot;original&quot; structure of the novel, making the turn downstream, down South, acceptable. Also, the explanatory notes are quite good. Finally, this OUP edition is worth buying for the cover alone, which has a detail from a gorgeous Homer-painting."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I can never understand why some people consider &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; to be a racist novel. It had the exact opposite effect on me.I read this book when I was about 13 years old. Being brought up in a lilly-white suburb, I was a blatant racist. I had no direct contact with black people; I only knew what I heard from friends. Reading &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; made me understand the historical prejudices that people had against black people and how it held them back. It turned my views on blacks completely around, and I still vividly remember the arguments I had with my friends about race after I read this book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"There is a reason the paperback Dover edition is $3 (green and black line drawing of a steamboat on cover) The font is way too small and the spacing between lines is non existent.

Hard to believe it took me until now (age 48) to read it! I have heard many say that they believe it is a racist book but I disagree. Yes, there are slaves in the book and they are referred to with the \\"N\\" word. That is just the way it was back then and it was common to speak that way and refer to slaves that way. Throughout the book, however, they were not referred to in a disparaging way and the friendship and even love between Huck and Jim is evident throughout the book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I must start by saying that although I do have a passionate love for literature, I am much more in tune with modern day epics than classics. I have recently finished Huck Fin for the second time, the first being my freshman year of college. This time around however, I enjoyed and understood it much more. I believe that although the language is a little rough around the edges, and at times slightly distracting to me, this book is an amazing tale of friendship and growth. The two boys go through a tremendous amount of change and learning experiences that most people can only hope to endure in a lifetime. I think that the first time I read this I was put off by the excessive use of the \\"N\\" word and couldn't see through to how, in spite of a few 'stereotypical' images that twain paints of Jim, wise and mature he really was. All in all I think it's a good read and Twain is an amazing Arthur if you simply open your mind to what he's trying to do with this novel!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I understand people views of the book being racist. There are moments reading it that it can be interpreted as racism. However it is Twain trying to authenticate the story. Sadly a boy during that time would talk about slaves the way he did or for people to think the way they did in the story. Putting all these things aside the book is interesting. It takes the reader on an adventure they never would have thought about before. Twain does a good job of bringing the characters to life. At the same time he brings up social issues that were going on during that time. It opens people eyes while entertaining them. Twain does a good job of making characters that are appealing to read. Huck is funny and adventurous."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is arguably one of the most significant pieces in American Literature. Twain, in this masterpiece, highlights sensitive issues through the eyes of Huch Finn and Jim who is a run away slave. This controversy has caused many schools to ban this piece from its curriculum and has been reviewed by many as one of the most racist books of its time.Mark Twain cleverly takes us on a run-away adventure and in doing so helps us understand the exceptence of slavery in Missouri in the 1830's. Ironically, Twain depicts American Society through the scope of Hucks care giver Mrs. Watson. Mrs. Watson is religious God seeking lady who illustrates lack of sympathy for the colored race. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an important piece of literature which should be read with an open mind."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Wonderful book. Everybody should read it.

Reading this book for the first time was a delight. Though I was thoroughly familiar with most of the story, I still found the book to be a page turner. The character of Huck, the manchild, has to be one of the most fascinating in all of literature."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was a great piece of satire, that is, all the parts I understood. This book is incredibly difficult to understand. For those of us that are literary scholars, feel free to purchase and dig away at the complex plot that at times seemed to go absolutely nowhere. Be prepared, because this story is not as fast paced and exciting as Tom Sawyer. Unlike Tom, this is an adult book that wrestles with themes of prejudice and severe elitism that plagued the antebellum south and was Mark Twain's response to the lynchings and other cruel acts committed against African Americans. So while it deals with serious issues concerning Americans even to this day, it contains half the excitement. If you're going to buy this book, devote every iota of your concentration power to it. The seemingly pointless tangents in the plot ultimately come back to enforce Twain's more important themes. The plot focuses on Huck's desire to escape civilization and eventually is accompanied by Jim, the runaway slave accused of murder. Jim has been the subject of intense controversy. I was completely turned off by his representation as a complete idiot who completely depended on his white master. Some may argue that it was in the best interest of the slave to appear ignorant so their masters would never grow suspicious of them. Yet considering that Twain once owned slaves and was a southerner himself, I have my doubts. I guess that's part of the enjoyment provided in the novel; we'll never be completely sure what Twain thought of blacks and social equality. Modern readers beware of the n-word, as it is used quite frequently. But also pay attention to the way Twain criticizes the south's complete support for slavery when in fact it was an institution that hurt the majority of southerners. I recommend the book, but devote a lot of time to it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"this book can be enjoyed by all ages. children can read it as an adventure story, and adults can read it as critizism on the south/mankind. provides insight on issues such as slavery, morality, religion. twain really focuses on the idea of blindly following what you have been told or making decisions on your own. an easy and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" by Mark Twain is an absolute Must Read. Twain masterfully creates an interesting storyline while staying true to the times, setting, and language. Huck's tale of his adventure down the Mississippi will keep you turning the pages.Not only does it have a well written plot, but it creates quite a controversy. Over the years it has raised discussion of its themes: racism, slavery, morality, and society's hypocrisy. Young Huck finds himself struggling as to whether help his friend Jim, a run-away slave. His recent education and civilizing has taught him that it would be wrong to help him and he'd surely be eternally punished. However, his conscience tells him that it's the right thing to help Jim and that society is wrong.Overall this book brilliantly balances story and meaning, something which can seem rare of literature at times. This book is completly recommended for all readers itching to take in an awesome adventure and open controversial discussion."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Being probably one of the relatively few people who has grown up in present-day America without having read either of Twain's famous novels, \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" or \\"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,\\" I found myself astonished at how I could have missed the opportunity to read such a wonderful story as that led by Huck and Jim in their journey down the Mississippi River. So vivid were the settings and so well-liked (or, in some cases, well-disliked) were the characters that the story pulled me forward almost effortlessly.At nearly every bend of the river, I found myself marveling at what it must have been like to have lived in such an era, in so different a world. The loss of such an idyllic world is now near total, and perhaps a foretelling aspect of this loss may have been one of the intentions Twain had in his realistic upheavals into this otherwise romantic tale. Yet by providing aspects of both romanticism and realism he has allowed us to enjoy the heart of this \\"innocent\\" era and feel the jolts of connecting it to our real world (or rather, the real world at the time of its publication, but still felt today).I was truly touched by Huck's friendship and loyalty toward Jim, and found myself turning page after page in fear of Huck's giving in to societal pressures and doing what was viewed as the \\"right\\" thing to do-to turn Jim in as a runaway slave. And yet, as broken or uneducated as Huck's upbringing may have been, he triumphs in the true test of human spirit and honest, unbiased friendship.What a remarkable story!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a very interesring book.

But, they also have some fun.I really loved The Adventure of Huckleberry Finn because it showed the unity between two people from different races and backgrounds.

I think this is a very good book and I give it 4 stars because it is a classical, however, there are some parts that I don't understand. - P,Tran, Kearny High School (SCT Division)"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huck Finn is a delightful tale that parts the curtains of time and describes the culture of the pre-Civil War Mississippi River towns. I don't imagine anyone can find much fault in the story of a man's efforts to achieve his liberation from slavery in the company of a colorful wild boy, nor can anyone but a mental clod fail to find Twain's keen prose masterful, so I will take a stab here and cite the frequent use within the text of what we in our time define as a racist word as the cause of so much of the puzzling backlash against this American classic.I'd suggest that anyone who cannot understand CONTEXT needs to better his or her education, and anyone who does grasp a word's use within a context should comprehend the placement of offensive word in question. Secondly, I would point out that we cannot sanitize the past or impose the fluid morals of our own age on it: at best we can only censor what we find objectionable in ages that came before our own, and in that we begin a descent down a slippery slope of lies. Consider this: in a future age words we use daily and without an implication of cruelty or slight might come to be viewed as indecent. Suppose the word \\"dude\\" were to take on an obscene tone in the lexicon of the 22nd century. Funny, sure, but it's a good example of how times change and so do mores. Twain was not trying to demean a race by use of an epithet.So I hope this wonderful novel by one of America's brightest literary giants stands uncensored and available in libraries across our nation for many lifetimes to come. To lose sight of the brilliance of this fun, transporting book over a word we see now as derogatory is to cheat ourselves and our progeny of a fine literary adventure."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"&iexcl;mThe adventure of Huckleberry Finn &iexcl;n is a book whick follows &iexcl;m The adventure of Tom Sawyer &iexcl;n&iexcl;AI have seen &iexcl;m The adventure of Tom Sawyer &iexcl;nbefore &iexcl;A so&iexcl;AI think it is an interesting book.If you didn't read &iexcl;m The adventure of Tom Sawyer &iexcl;n&iexcl;A you may feel that it is quite difficult to catch up with what the story goes on ."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is one of my very favorite American classics. Billed as the sequel toThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer, this book at first appears to be another innocent and light-hearted children's book. Around a fourth of the way through it, however, you start to realize that you're reading a mature and very serious social commentary that would have been especially relevant at the time of its publication. Exploring themes of slavery, poverty, ignorance, and religion, THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN is certainly no children's book (though it would be entertaining to a child).The entire story is told through the honest and innocent eyes of Huckleberry Finn, and Twain accomplished an incredible feat in telling such a complicated and serious story using a believable and childlike perspective. While at times a bit inconsistent, the entire book is written as though by a semi-literate tween, giving the tale authenticity and really making the story come to life. As Huck and Jim (two of the most loveable characters in any book I've ever read) make their way down the Mississippi, encountering very real dangers but keeping remarkably positive attitudes, the reader is treated to a fascinating glimpse of American Midwest circa 1850. Twain's ability to describe a scene to make it really come off the pages is in full effect here, another big reason this is commonly promoted as his best, most complete, book.The frequent use of the N-word, while obviously offensive today, reflects the apparently common parlance of the time, and wasn't such a shocker 130 years ago. It also served as a useful tool for Twain to make his primary point of the story, pointing out the unfairness, bigotry, and illogic of racism and slavery. And there is no doubt that this books' main focus is on issues of race, and that the moral of the story is decidedly anti-slavery and anti bigotry. Those that fight against this book, saying it is racist or anti-black, are sadly mistaken, being blinded by the use of the N-word and by the representation of uneducated and ignorant black characters. If the N-word has become so offensive that we can't stand its use, maybe we could justify replacing it with another word that carries the same meaning, but changing other aspects of the content of this book to more easily mesh with current-day sensibilities is just plain wrong. Re-writing the classics should be avoided.One of the most enjoyable reads you'll ever find. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Although Twain's repeated use of the \\"N\\" word and resort to racially-tinged humor is jarring to the 21st Century reader, this is one of only a handful of books that can be called \\"The Great American Novel.\\" Apart from capturing the spirit of the times -- of 1880s as well as of the Antebellum setting of the book via the ironic way in which Twain tells his tale to his own post-civil-war readers through Huck Finn -- Twain is absolutely brilliant in spinning a great moral drama. The inner voice of Huck Finn's good nature and of the good nature he sees in others is pitted against the moral code imposed by society. Huck's conscience mirrors society's voice, and he feels great guilt about doing something as \\"low\\" as helping a runaway slave escape. I can't think of a book that makes a better case against the hypocrisy and evil done in the name of society -- as contrasted to the grace enjoyed by man in the state of nature as embodied by the adolescent hero Huck who resists being \\"civilized.\\"The best passages of the book are where Twain delights in exploring the moral dilemmas and choices faced by Huck -- his ability to rationalize theft as \\"borrowing\\" (on the basis of his father's lessons); his guilt over helping Jim; his complicity with but ultimate rebellion against the scams of the \\"Duke\\" and the \\"King\\"; and his acquiescence with the shenanigans of Tom Sawyer by reason of his own sense of inferiority.As for the humor of the book, it is true that Twain lampoons the ignorance and buffoonery of whites and blacks alike. Nobody is spared his acid tongue. But the easy jokes about the ignorance and superstitions of Jim and the other blacks in the book does leave the modern reader feeling queasy. It's not fair to dismiss Twain's book as racist. It is disappointing that Twain is so comfortable with the racial humor of his time, but, overall, his portrait of Jim and the other slaves celebrates their basic humanity. Twain was much like Lincoln in this respect. Lincoln too has left some embarassing writings opposing full citizenship for blacks and suggesting that they be boated back to Africa. But in the end, Lincoln's insistence on accepting the humanity of blacks and the principle that all men are created equal is what put the country on the path to what it is today. To dismiss the likes of Twain and Lincoln as racists just because they are the products of their times is to ignore how truly difficult -- and heroic -- it was for them to rise above their own prejudices. One should approach the past with a better sense of empathy -- as well as with the humbling sense that 125 years from now (hopefully) our own ignorance and mistakes will be dissected by our descendants.The book is also significant for being written in the vernacular -- which is masterfully done.My only criticism of the book is the final sections, when it assumes a more farcical tone with the appearance of Tom Sawyer. This detracts from the book's previously gripping portrayal of the true horror of Jim's situation and of Huck's moral conflicts. I would have preferred to have seen Huck deliver Jim to the freedom of the North before learning of the deus ex machina of Jim's manumission in the Widow's will. The book would have been better with only a limited appearance by Tom Sawyer -- or by none at all.A great book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This version is beautiful, with lots of original pictures in it, you can really see that the publisher did not just want to create a cheap copy of the book, this one is really a success!

Eventually, he meets up with Jim, a runaway slave, and they decide to go down the Mississippi River together.

However, I feel like I ve already found the love for the written word that I felt I may aquire after reading perhaps a dozen or so of the worlds finest.To the novella: He tells the tale with such heart, such character, such life that I will attest that I dont think I ve ever felt so strongly for a character as I do for Huck Finn. He is so vivid and alive and real; its absurd.Yes, it is quite racist on the surface, and during the 250 odd pages of the story you might read more racial slurs and statements than you have in your life, but in the heart there is nothing racist about this story. I ve heard it defended because thats just how it was in Twains time, and alas, that is how it was then, and the reason it is all so blatant, but there is really nothing racist about the portrayal of Jim. He is so loving and deep and pure. Surely one of the sweetest people you could ever want to meet.The charm of this story, the unending humor and delight of all the dialects and wordage, the manner of conversation and the subjects....my loves for this story are unending.

But the last pages, where Huck poses as Tom Sawyer and Tom as Sid, and they hatch plans, or rather Tom does, to free Jim from the Phelps, is flat-out hilarious. I laughed out loud so many times. Tom has read far too many swashbuckling adventures for his own (and Jim's) good. Twain has amazing command of all the southern dialects, including the slave Jim's speech. Jim may be free at the end, but sadly, his wife and children are not. A wonderful story all around. How much Twain loved the Missisippi is so evident in many beautiful and haunting passages of river life. A word of advice: you do need to read \\"Tom Sawyer\\" first. \\"Huck Finn\\" is really a sequel, and many characters in the first book are referred to in the second. As The Great American Novel, I still think that nothing surpasses \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\", but \\"Huck Finn\\" comes in at a close second."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This Great American Novel combines escapist adventure, humor, and biting social commentary. Author Mark Twain (1835-1910) places us squarely on the raft with Huck and Jim as they float down the Mississippi River seeking separate escapes from an abusive father (Huck) and slavery (Jim). The two form a remarkable friendship despite differences in age, race, and upbringing. That bond helps them to survive unforeseen perils and unwanted companions. Huck also secretly wrestles with his Southern-bred conscience about the morality of helping a slave escape. The book's only weakness comes in the last chapters, when the common-sense Huck reluctantly agrees to a foolhardy scheme to free Jim.Censors have tried to ban this novel since it first appeared in 1885. Some disdain Huck's skepticism towards religious and middle class values; others dislike the raw use of a racial slur - ignoring the author's indictment of racism. Please. Translated into 65 languages, HUCKLEBERRY FINN invigorates with escapism, adventure, humor and humanity."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"As the many erudite scholars and their students tell us, Huckleberry Finn is representative of the sweeping influence Mark Twain has had on American literature, form and style. The Mississippi River boyhood adventure story is required reading for any 10-year old who can pull himself away from Game Cube and other modern distractions to wade into Twain's \\"life on the river.\\" Too, adult readers will gain from Twain's insight into human nature with its honesty and cruelty, ideals and reality, innocence and cynicism.I find the everlasting worth of the book to be Twain's underlying social commentary and his capturing of an era of changing values (Civil War slavery issue, in particular) in mid-19th century America. Purely as a work of literature, though, the book falls short of my (perhaps inflated or too modern?) expectations. The plot is sometimes choppy and contrived (e.g., when Tom Sawyer coincidentally reappears late in the book) and the events often too exaggerated (e.g., the many escapades of the notorious king and duke)--however superb Twain's storytelling and final wrap-up may be. Also, Twain's painstaking effort to have all characters speak in their vernacular dialects, while interesting for some adults and linguists, unfortunately poses a barrier for the younger reader, who ironically stands to benefit most from early exposure to the classic.Unlike in other well-known tales, no character in this adventure story qualifies as an all-American hero. Huck is understanding, compassionate and quite the realist, but too much of a follower to be truly a hero. Jim is a good-hearted, well-behaved \\"nigger\\" (controversial language from the text), largely a product of his lifelong enslavement, but nevertheless he seems too simple in outlook and possibly too concerned with money like many other adults we meet along the river (\\"en I tole you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter be rich ag'n\\"). Tom, while a fun-loving, determined and imaginative leader, is too concerned with sophomoric protocol and principles to embrace the broader perspective a hero should.Ultimately, by the author's design I suspect, the book leaves us with an unresolved restlessness. As Huck says at the end of the book: \\"But I reckon I got to light out for the territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she's going to adopt me and civilize me, and I can't stand it. I been there before.\\" This quintessentially American, youthful \\"spark\\" is what still breathes life into Huckleberry Finn today after more than a century in our libraries."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This coming of age novel boldly criticizes slavery in America in the nineteenth century. Mark Twain brilliantly voices his opinions of slavery through the characters of Huckleberry Finn. Set in the south, this novel gives clear insight into the consuming racism and discrimination that raged throughout America in the 1800's. Twain masterfully fights for the abolition of slavery through his characters Huck and Jim. Huck, a white child is raised exposed to the ignorance and injustices of the south. Jim, an African American, is separated from his family and is forced to lead the life of a slave. Huck is greatly influenced by the racism of the south. Both embark on a journey as Tom runs from the violence of his home life while Jim escapes the cruelties of slavery in search of his family and freedom. Through Jim's kindness, wittiness, and patience Huck's views on slavery, African Americans and ultimately Jim change. It is the innocence of childhood that allows Huck's views on African Americans to change, allowing him to become a young man. Through their comedic adventures readers are kept turning page after page, but it is through their friendship that gives America a chance for a new beginning. Together Jim and Huck break down racial barriers proving that change is never too late. Together they discover the depth of humanity and the potential for self-growth through others.

First of all the book clearly shows the reader what is taking place in the U.S. at this time and it helps set the plot of the story. The second reason I gave it this rank is because throughout the whole book there is always something exciting taking place and plenty of action. This helps keep the reader focused and into the book. Another reason for my ranking is because even though the book is mostly serious, Mark Twain adds some comedy into the book to help reveal some of the more serious times in the book. The length of the book is just about perfect, because the author doesn't try and drag on a certain part of the story. This makes the book more interesting. Finally, the reason I didn't give this book a perfect five out of five is because of the ending. I feel that the ending doesn't fit the book. This is cause throughout the whole book there is always action taking place, and then at the ending of the book it kind of stops at a dull point. I think the ending could have been changed or something a little more exciting could have took place."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a novel written for enjoyment, the adventures that Huck has are somewhat comical and enjoyable for everyone. There is also a more serious side to the novel where Twain uses Huck to learn the evils of society that the story takes place in. Through Huck, Twain tells his opinion of slavery and shares his own moral values. Because this is a realistic book, Twain can convey his thoughts and morals to readers of every level, not just highly educated scholars. Using realism, Twain lets people know how he thinks and shows that people can change. Realism is utilized to allow all people to be able to relate and understand what is going on in the novel. I believe everyone at one point in their life should read this novel."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"... The main character in this story is Huckleberry Finn. He has a pretty sad life because he doesn't live with his parents. His father who is abusive beats him up. Although Huckleberry is a troublemaker and a \\"bad boy\\", I think he has a good heart. He is a wreckless boy who seems to like adventure and likes to observe the world. I also think that he lacks good judgements, but he means well.I do not particularly enjoy this book because it is very long and boring. It uses too many confusing words and it is difficult to understand. Although this story is adventurous, it doesn't meet the needs I required for this book. It took me a very long time to understand what was going on in this book. Also, I don't really like stories that revolves around the 1800's. They don't do any interesting things and the way they talk is so vulgar."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I liked the beginning and the end, but the middle was dull"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The low rating refers to the Collector's Library format, not the books contents. The letters in hardcover edition from colector's library are way too small and hard to read. I bought the book for my daughter, and find it impossible to read and not to get eye strain. I have to return it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Okay, we all know the plot, so there's no sense in rehashing it; but this book has generated a great deal of heat and very little light lately, it's been banned in some school districts and attacked as racist garbage, so this review will address the question: Is &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, in fact, a racist book?The charge of racism stems from the liberal use of the N word in describing Jim. Some black parents and students have charged that the book is humiliating and demeaning to African-Americans and therefore is unfit to be taught in school. If there has been a racist backlash in the classroom, I think it is the fault of the readers rather than the book.&quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is set in Missouri in the 1830's and it is true to its time. The narrator is a 13 year old, semi-literate boy who refers to blacks by the N-word because he has never heard them called anything else. He's been brought up to see blacks as slaves, as property, as something less than human. He gets to know Jim on their flight to freedom (Jim escaping slavery and Huck escaping his drunken, abusive father), and is transformed. Huck realizes that Jim is just as human as he is, a loving father who misses his children, a warm, sensitive, generous, compassionate individual. Huck's epiphany arrives when he has to make a decision whether or not to rescue Jim when he is captured and held for return to slavery. In the culture he was born into, stealing a slave is the lowest of crimes and the perpetrator is condemned to eternal damnation. By his decision to risk hell to save Jim, he saves his own soul. Huck has risen above his upbringing to see Jim as a friend, a man, and a fellow human being.Another charge of racism is based on Twain's supposed stereotyping of Jim. As portrayed by Twain, Jim is hardly the ignorant, shuffling Uncle Tom that was so prevalent in &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (a book that abundantly deserves the charge of racism). Jim may be uneducated, but he is nobody's fool; and his dignity and nobility in the face of adversity is evident throughout the book.So -- is &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; a racist book? No. It's of its time and for its time and ours as well, portraying a black man with sensitivity, dignity, and sympathy. If shallow, ignorant readers see Jim as a caricature and an object of derision, that's their problem. Hopefully they may mature enough in their lifetime to appreciate this book as one of the greatest classics of American literature.And for those who might be wondering -- this reviewer is black."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Back during my school days this was still not a book that was considered to be politically incorrect and so I was supposed to read it. As was far too often the case, I got by on little more than watching the movie version and never bothered to read this masterpiece. A few months ago I picked up a copy to put in my library for my grandson to use when he got old enough to go to school. Unfortunately this has been classified as a children's book and so I had little intention of reading it when I bought it.After discussing a book about President Grant and Mark Twain with a friend I decided that I should read this book and I soon found out just how much of an adventure I had been missing. Twain's well deserved reputation as a storyteller is on clear display in this book from cover to cover. The reader is drawn into the lives of the characters to the point of being really disturbed when something bad happens to them. Sure, they steal and they lie but you will love them in spite of everything.The story basically follows the adventures of young Huckleberry Finn and a runaway slave named Jim. Finn is trying to escape has father and the efforts of the townspeople to civilize him while Jim is trying to escape slavery. More to the point, Jim is trying to escape being sold down the river, which was always a worry for slaves in the upper south.There is a strong moral point to this book as Huck slowly learns to love Jim as a friend and not think of his skin color. Early on Huck is worried about helping a runaway slave and isn't sure what to do. Having been raised in Missouri, Huck has been taught that helping a slave run away is one of the worst sins imaginable and that African-Americans are pretty much worthless except as slaves. It takes a while for the truth to come to Huck but he finds that he is determined to help his friend get his freedom, no matter what. Huck ends up risking his own life to do just that.This book is a pure joy to read and I suggest you read it without looking for a political agenda. Just let the story flow and enjoy each word. The dialects used may slow you down a bit at first but they add so much to the flow of the book that they are quite indispensable. This is a wonderful story, full of youthful innocence and backwoods charm. Just one little warning though, once you start reading you won't be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Finally, a reading of a classic that is worth the money.This story's narration covers a total of 9 Cds, and each disc has about 97 tracks (each track is only about 30 to 45 seconds). The good aspect of this is that it is quite easy to find your spot and, then pick up where you left off, if you happen to stop reading in the middle of a chapter. The negative aspect of short tracks is that it is difficult to skip around to particular chapters without \\"guessing\\" where a chapter might end (because there is no insert to tell which chapters are contained in each disc).Overall, Dick Hill does a superb job of reading in this unabridged version of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. Hill's voice personifies Huck's narrative, and he keeps the Southern flavor of Twain's novel intact. What makes this reading particularly great is that Hill has a great ability to not only take on Huck, but other characters as well. Hill changes his voice for other characters such as Tom Sawyer, Jim, the Duke and the king, Pap and others. For this reason, this CD is a great tool for the reluctant readers in classes, and serves as a great supplement for the study of this novel.I have found that buying audios to classic to be a gamble because you never really know what you are getting, but this is one of the best I've gotten."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Not only is The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn a brilliant and funny story of an adolescent boy, it is the story of an adolescent nation: the United States circa 1885. It raises broad, moral questions whose answers still elude us today, as it addresses the question of slavery in terms that are deeply personal, moral, political, social and economic.Through Huck and the fugitive slave Jim, Twain looks at important issues of marginality, not just for people of color, but for people of all sorts who live outside of social norms, either by accident of race and class, by virtue of fate, or by a choice they have made. Some are outlaws and con men. Others are honest souls whose luck just ran out. Still others are merely independent-minded people who refuse to bend to stereotypes of race, class and gender. All share circumstances that put them outside of the societal norm and onto the road less traveled.The first great novel that was written in the vernacular, this novel has been criticized for its use of slang and pejoratives, especially for its liberal use of \\"the n word.\\" For me, it's important to remember that Twain was reflecting the language of the times and of the social class that Huck came from, as it is he who narrates the story. While I understand the objections, in the end, for me, they do not hold up if the choice is between reading or not reading this great American classic.I adored this book at age 7 and again at age 19 when I read it in college. And I continue to adore it as an adult, for each time I read Huck Finn something different and important is revealed to me. I can't recommend this book highly enough and think that there is no better time to (re)read it than on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of its publication."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"When I first read this book, I was so taken with it, that I read from chapter 18 through the end of the book in one night. I was up until 3:30 in the morning, reading ahead of my 11th grade assignment, and loving every minute along the way. later in college, when I studied the book more, closer, and with a more educated eye (whatever that means) my love for the book increased. Now, as a teacher myself, I look forward to having my students read this book and discussing it in class.But now as for the title of my review:I can't help feeling bad for people who think that this is not a good novel because &quot;we don't talk like that anymore.&quot; Are we to abandon books that are no longer contemporary to ourselves? I also take issue with people who claim that this book is a racist tirade based upon the use of the word &quot;nigger,&quot; or because the escape route Jim took was down the Mississippi instead of up river. While currently offensive, Mark Twain used the term as a literary fact that most, if not all young boys of the south spoke in such a manner. Once more, Jim explained why he was going South before he headed north. the simple fact is that if you are going to criticize a book, then you should read it. mark Twain said as much in his essay, &quot;Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses.&quot;From reading a number of the reviews of this book, I have come to the opinion that while many read the book, more than a few are refusing to give Twain credit for subtext and the use of allegory. One reviewer down the line says that the book is racist because Twain makes a young boy to be twice as smart as Jim. Upon closer reading, Twain is showing what Huck feels to be true. Huck only thinks that he is smarter. The reader should pick up on the fact that Twain writes Jim as an intuitive father figure for Huck, one who teaches a true morality as opposed to the morality of the South.Simply put, you get what you put in to the reading of this book. If you think is is going to be a boring read because you &quot;have to&quot; read it for a summer reading list or school assignment, then that's what it will be. If you think it will be a difficult read because you don't want to try and read in dialects other than your own, it will be a hard read. If you are looking to justify the book as racist because of a single word that presentism doesn't excuse, then have at it. This book can be all of those things. However, this book also has the potential to enlighten the reader, give something wonderful to the reader, and teach about the human condition."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"It's shameful and pathetic that any publisher would presume to censor Mark Twain by sanitizing Huckleberry Finn as Barron's has done. I urge anyone who loves literature to boycott this travesty of an edition."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"It amuses me no end to see so many irate reviews, obviously written by spoiled schoolkids resenting their stoopid 'ol teacher making them read this stoopid 'ol book by some stoopid 'ol dead guy.There's rich material there for a cynic like Twain, or even more for one the likes of Ambrose Bierce or H. L. Mencken. Tiny, immature, ill formed minds incapable of grasping a truth deeper than Nintendo or Playstation lash out in outrage at a genius who holds up a mirror to expose their ignorance.The fact is, this is THE American experience of the 19th century, a microcosm of the defining characteristic of our country's beginning and of our national shame and curse. How did a nation, conceived in liberty, holding self evident so many truths about Man's rights, institutionalize the degredation of Black Americans, the utter denial of their very humanity? How could the noble idealistic American eagle ever swallow such a poisonous pill?Huck's bitter determination to &quot;go to hell&quot; in order to save his friend Jim is to me the most moving and courageous moment in all literature. Huck &quot;knows&quot; that Jim is not really human, that he is mere property, that he has no rights and deserves no consideration, and that Huck's social duty is to return the slave owner's lost property. Yet he knows even more deeply that Jim is his friend, mentor, companion, and in not saving him he will lose his own soul, regardless of what his society holds to be true. Thus Huck makes himself an outcast and outlaw in civilized society, and thus he prefigures the cataclysm of the Civil War, in which this vile contradiction nearly destroyed our nation. All the blood spilled during that war, however, has not expunged our Original Sin, and we have been paying for it ever since, and perhaps always shall.So try to expand your mind, at least accept the concept that the past is not a Real World episode in period costume, that people of another time did think and talk and act differently, that what &quot;everybody knows&quot; today will surely be as ludicrous a century hence as slavery may seem to us now. Reflect, also, on the courage of those who recognized evil ahead of their time and stood up to it, even though in this case such a hero is a fictionalized semi-literate boy."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Look Inside for Collector's Library Adventures of Huckleberry Finn promised an illustrated book. We have a case of a misleading Look Inside: in reality no illustrations; very small format; awful choice of typeface. My impression that Look Inside was made from a different edition.Another thing: it's a little strange when Amazon customers review Mark Twain. Mark Twain does not need it. What is needed are reviews of different editions (quality, illustrations, scholarly or nor, paper, cover and typeface. So one star is, of course not for Huck Finn (100 stars for that boy), but for the awful edition. and misleading Look Inside.Finally, let me repeat it again: the more I read reviews on Huck Finn, the more I am convinced, they have to be separated by editions. If I am looking for a scholarly edition with illustration and a decent cover and typeface, how, in a world, can it be helpful, if someone writes: \\"Mark Twain is not for me.\\" Serious readers will seek opinions on classics from other sources, for example, from Hemingway who said, that the whole American literature had come out of Huck Finn. OK, if Amazon thinks that \\"Mark Twain is not for me\\" phrase is protected by First Amendment, and any football and beer lover has a right to put it here as an opinion, I agree. In this case, still, I think these ones have to be separated from opinions of serious book readers and collectors who are interested in differences of certain editions of classics."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Whole pieces of the text are missing from the free Kindle edition (this one:Adventures of Huckleberry Finn). So far I've noticed that Hamlet's soliloquy and the end of chapter 23 are missing."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This review isn't to give a review of one of the most studied works of the English language, but rather to detail what makes this edition special and worthy of purchase.At the most superficial level Huck is the sequel to The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, which had introduced us to these two icons of the printed word. After Tom Sawyer was a big hit the publisher, perhaps understandably, wanted not only a sequel, but one which logically followed Tom Sawyer. They specifically desired for the two works to sit comfortably on a shelf together. Perhaps there was a time when Mark Twain desired the same thing - more of the same crowd pleasing story telling. But I think that perhaps from the beginning he recognized that he now had the audience that he wanted for his masterpiece, so he began writing it.Even in the form which was familiar for 100 years Huckleberry Finn was widely hailed as the centerpiece of American Literature. THIS edition reveals that the masterpiece as originally conceived was even more masterly.Clemens wrote the original manuscript and submitted it to the publisher. I don't know what they thought of the book as it was, but one thing was clear: it was a good deal longer than Tom Sawyer and sitting side by side with Tom Sawyer the two books looked less like a \\"pair\\".So.... the editorial pruning process began and enough was removed from the originally conceived Huckleberry Finn to create both the originally published versions of Huck as well as \\"Life on the Mississippi\\".Now we finally get to see the \\"complete Huck\\". The missing text flows along with the \\"original Huck\\" as mightily as the Mississippi that Huck and Jim ride along in the book of our dreams.As if that weren't enough, we also are treated to original illustrations and facsimile reproductions of several of Twain's original text. I found these pages among the most enlightening of all. Almost as if he knew his handwritten pages would be looked at by posterity, Twain used a unique revision technique. Rather than erasing a word or passage he wishes to replace, he would instead line through the words in a single line, leaving the replaced word legible along with the words which would replace the revised word. By examining these hand-written lines we can see how meticulous Twain was in his word selection. In several of the passages he made slight corrections which were plainly intended to make the runaway slave, Jim, as noble as possible. It has long been a curiosity to me that this book, frequently criticized as \\"racist\\", has as it's two central characters a runaway slave and the \\"poor white trash\\" boy who decides to help him. At one point Huck is memorably torn between what the Southern Society he has been raised in says is right and what gnaws at his conscience. It is obviously an unqualified truth to Huck that Jim is uneducated and so poor that he doesn't even own himself, yet Jim possesses more humanity than any of the \\"civilized\\" southerners Huck meets. Seeing Clemens' own scrawl lets us see how diligently Clemens worked to make that distinction clear - that Jim is easily the most noble adult in the book.I agree with Mr. Hemingway - Huckleberry Finn IS America's greatest novel. Thanks to rediscovering Twain's original text (and an entertaining sequence of events which is detailed in the introduction to this edition) we finally get to read America's greatest Novel the way that the author originally intended.I cannot recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The most well known parts of this book are the parts where Huck and Jim are journeying down the river on their big raft, but as a Criminal Justice major I have to say one of my favorite parts of this books happened at the begging when Huck fakes his own death. I think this part really shows how smart Huck is for his age and how well he is able to come up with an elaborate, workable plan with the few items he had on hand to use. He showed amazing perseverance and dedication to hard work in cutting out a hole big enough to squeeze through with the small rusted saw blade. He showed clear thinking when after making it out of the house he did not just run off into the woods where he knew he would soon be followed probably caught. After deciding to fake his own death he paid great attention to detail in not only covering the hole in the wall back up, hacking the door to pieces, and adding the pigs blood but also in thinking to drag a bag of rocks all the way to river to help explain what happened to the \\"body\\". Then to top it all off he throws the dead pig in a different part of the river so it's not found by mistake.

The book was a great classic, the only reason that I did read it is because we have to read a classic for school, however, now that I have read it I realize that it was a great book. I would read this book two or three times, and I do not like reading books again. The book was really able to portray the idea of childhood innocence and foolishness in the book, especially the end. I thought that this book was really an eye opener for people who may think that life is not worth living or maybe derpessed. Because, as you can see, Huck was a young boy who had an alcoholic father who beat him all the time, even kidnapped him after he was adopted by other people. Huck even decided to run away from his father, yet he is still a young, fun loving kid in the end, especially when Tom reveals to him how the whole trip was just a game. The only thing I have to say against the book is that it did seem a little racist with its words, however maybe this is just how they talked in that time period? Overall a great read that I highly reccomend."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"fun stories and exciting adventures that bring up rather complex issues of abuse, poverty, slavery, loyalty, friendships and basic human integrity. Not my personal favorite, but a definite masterpiece of American literature."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I will begin by saying that I loved reading \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" also by Mark Twain. I think it is an inspired work of genius and I thoroughly enjoyed it (see my review on that book). Even the introduction to Tom Sawyer, however, describes Huckleberry Finn as \\"Twain's masterpiece, perhaps his only great novel, morally and stylistically above the somewhat fragmentary and anecdotal Tom Sawyer.\\"I cannot agree with this assessment. I had numerous problems with this work which detracted from my full enjoyment of its many positives.First, the outline - This is the story of Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer's colorful outcast friend introduced and developed in that first book. This book recaptures his association with Tom, but very quickly Huck breaks off on his own - he runs away to get away from his drunk and abusive father who has imprisoned him in a desolate cottage. He will not meet Tom again until the final chapters of the book. He picks up on his flight down the Mississipi the runaway slave Jim, and they quickly develop a mutual bond of love, respect and friendship that transcends the social barriers between them. The rest of the book is the story of their many adventures as they raft down the Mississipi river. Central to the saga are Jim's struggle to find freedom and Huck's struggle with his conscience torn between the 'civilized' ideas he recieves during his brief time with the well-meaning widow Douglas and his own previously uncontaminated sense of right and wrong.Using the first person narration in the voice of Huck Finn is a stroke of genius, giving the story a freshness and authenticity that make even the simplest passages a pleasure to read. Each character is given a distinct local accent. The author is obviously proud of this achievement; he specifically describes his linguistic efforts thus in the preface, \\"The shadings have not been done in a hap-hazard fashion, or by guess-work; but pains-takingly, and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech.\\"Moreover, despite the limitations on vocabulary forced by this decision, he manages to create eloquent and evocative descriptions of life on and along the Mississipi river. In fact, the Mississipi, in all its majesty and beauty and power runs through the entire narrative holding it together and effectively becoming a third major character in the story.Now for the negatives. The first is technical, and takes off where the last paragraph left off. Even for a genius like Mark Twain, it is apparently difficult to consistently maintain the speech cadences of an uneducated boy who can barely read, through the entire course of a full-length novel. And the inconsistencies show through. Frequently. This acts to intermittently spoil the very effect he is trying to create. Also, it can be a little annoying, like the voice of an American imitating a British accent that frequently and unintentionally falls back to American. I will illustrate with two passages. First, the opening lines of the book,\\"You don't know about me, without you have read a book by the name of \\"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,\\" but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied, one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary.\\"Quaint. Honest. Beautiful.Now contrast this speech peppered with grammatical flaws with the following lines from chapter 9 -\\"The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in, and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a good place to build a fire on. So we built it there and cooked dinner.\\"Or these from chapter 12 (except for the colloquial word ain't) -\\"I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look, but if there was a boat around I couldn't see it, for stars and shadows ain't good to see by. Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade, past the foot of the island dead still, never saying a word.\\"And so on. Maybe a small quibble, but noticeable.Secondly, because the story assumes quite early on a clear moral position (unlike Tom Sawyer), one begins to expect a certain degree of realism and believability in the plotline itself (which is not the case with Tom Sawyer). In Huck Finn, the childlike pranks of Tom Sawyer are replaced by elaborate and convoluted plots spanning many chapters and frequent twists that rely all too much on coincidence. The stories are funny but not convincing. This detracts from the credibility of the underlying message. Crystals of wisdom do not dissolve well in a broth of farce, and they stand out like sunburnt trees on a savannah, somehow diminished, desolate and out of place.The weight of this contradiction becomes particularly telling in the final chapters which stretch credibility to its limit and become tedious to the point of exasperation. This fact was apparently also pointed out by Ernest Hemmingway in his famous critique of the novel. He had high praise for it but urged readers to stop reading at the final third of the book, although he still mostly canonized it as a ground-breaking work of American Literature. (This last bit I obtained from a commentary on Hemmingway's review, so I cannot claim first-hand knowledge of it).Other critics have proposed that the painful slowness of the latter part of the book is a deliberate attempt to reflect the lackadaisical attitude of white people and law makers toward social change during the period. But I cannot accept that to describe a sense of boredom a book must itself be made boring - at least not in the hands of a skilled writer like Mark Twain. Therefore I see it as a shortcoming.Another inexplicable (and in my opinion, unforgivable) anomaly is that Tom Sawyer is used in the story only as a trickster and a foil to contrast with the innocent and innate honesty of Huckleberry Finn. The lovable social rebel of the first novel now takes on a darker character and in fact becomes the embodiment of a fickle and foolish system of social values. His childlike imagination is transformed into a penchant for lying and the erstwhile lighthearted pranks take on a grotesque and somber dimension. In his self-centered desire for fame and glory, Tom Sawyer is willing to put his friends at great risk and comes up with hare-brained schemes and ridiculous ideas to further his ends. I don't see why such a rare and wonderful literary character must be sacrificed at the altar of another in this wasteful manner.As to the more usual criticism of the book for its abundant use of the racially abrasive term \\"nig**r\\", I feel the author has used it for authenticity in the speech of the day rather than with any intent to denigrate. The spirit of his book is squarely anti-slavery. Still, it would probably be painful for an African American to digest the repeated use of the word.Also, the consistent portrayal of slaves as simple-minded and superstitious is hard to accept. Even Jim's character could not be fully developed because of these limitations.Yet, despite my reservations, I am happy to have finally read this great American classic, that I have long wished to tackle. Its positives still make it a worthy read."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I may be only 11, but I know a good book when I see one and this is one of them!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I just finished reading The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. The book has many controversial aspects, especially on racism. The use of the N word is expressed throughout the novel and is probably the most protested piece of the book But since the action of the book takes place in the south many years before the Civil War, it would be prodigious if they didn't use the word. For example, in one scene Aunt Sally understands that a steamboat had exploded,\\"Good gracious! anybody hurt?\\" she asks.\\"No'm,\\" comes the answer. \\"Killed a nigger.\\"Huck was brought up to know that slavery is natural, but soon realizes that slavery in not natural, but is wrong. Throughout the novel he wonders whether helping Jim escape is the right thing to do. He later understands Jim is just like him.

I remember when I first read it in 8th grade at High School. I was amazed then only by the adventures of the little boy and nothing else. However, when we discussed it again this semester in the college, I realized the plot of the book and its representation of the harsh reality during the slavery period in USA.In \\"Huck Finn\\", Mark Twain satirizes a society, which has no moral issues and which is trapped between its obdurate way of thinking and the rapidly changing reality. He also exposes very important problem as showing us the way for reaching independence as a constant struggle between freedom and slavery. This struggle exists for both Jim and Huck. For Jim this is more physical struggle than mental, while for Huck it is based on mentality and experience. Jim fears the physical slavery of that period in USA and Huck does not want to be \\"civilized\\" by a society without any moral values and chooses to live his own life free and independent.Having read \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" twice, I strongly recommend it to everyone interested not only in risky and funny adventures, but also to those who think that morality is important in the humans' relationship."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This was a good book it had its dull parts like when Jim and Huck were going down the river.

I personally think Mark Twain did a better job on this than he did on Tom Sawyer. It got very ineresting in the middle of the book. I just have to say it had very poor grammer. I know it is supposed to be that way, but it took awhile to get through it because I had to sort it out."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, a sequel to Mark Twain's other famous novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, is a classic American Literature that is dated back during the pre-civil war era. This book is about a young boy named Jim. This book has many plot twists to keep the reader busy while unfolding Twain's real motives through this book. The word \\"nigger\\" was just a way for Twain to make his world come to life. Although people think the usage of this word is vulgar and racist, it is a must to read this book and to find it for yourself why this book is highly against slavery. Mark Twain also gave each character their own style of speech to fit there characteristics and intellect. Mark uses this journey of Jim and Huck to emphasize some of his themes and morals that he wanted to teach the readers. Such morals are that of racism and slavery when Huck befriends Jim, a slave, and lies and cons, which is shown through the characters of Duke and Dauphin. If you like The Adventures of Tom Sawyer or any other pre-civil war era books, than you are sure to like this great adventure. I personally give this book a four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I had just finished reading the new biographical book \\"Grant and Twain\\" by Mark Perry, in which Perry claims that Twain put his unfinished masterpiece on the shelf for years because he was trapped by the logic of what he had written. Perry claims that Twain was stumped at the point in his story (at the end of Chapter 16) when Huck and escaped slave Jim had missed in the night their connection north, via the Ohio River at Cairo, and were forced to continue south on the Mississippi River. Twain's conundrum: Why would Jim go south to get free? According to Perry, it was Twain's friendship with the former Union General and President that solved this writer's block and led to the creation of America's greatest work of fiction. Perry tells us that it was because Ulysses Grant went south to win the Civil War, that Twain determined it would be possible for Jim to go south to win his freedom. It's impossible to tell from the book that such a problem existed for Twain. The book is seamless in it's beatiful telling of remarkable adventures. \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" a gift to me when I was eight, was the first book I ever owned. I read it then and again when it was required in school (Lake Placid, New York, where the \\"n\\" word didn't make this literary classic verboten). I am glad I revisited it a third time, not only for the humor but for the beauty of the language Twain so perfectly captured. True, it was written to be a \\"boy's book,\\" but it's at a level to appeal to adults as well. If you have read it in the past, maybe it is time for a revisit."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Okay. Time to admit something: I never read Huckleberry Finn in school. I'm not sure whether or not we had to, but I never experienced this book until now, in my twenties. What a trip! I had no idea. I was prepared for a \\"racist\\" book, and it wasn't. The \\"N\\" word was used, but not in a hateful way; only as a way that people spoke long ago. Not that that makes it right, but I didn't see what all the hoopla was/is about. And there are so many books that owe a debt to Twain for so many reasons: The use of child narrator voice; coming of age; humor. CATCHER IN THE RYE, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, and McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD are just a few that come to mind. Whatever you do, give FINN a chance. This is a great American classic. No, it's not a short book, but it is fascinating."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an exciting novel. It begins with the narrator (Huckleberry Finn) explaining that he and some friends (along with Tom Sawyer) are in a &quot;Robber's Gang.&quot; Huck wishes to remain a part of this new gang but Tom Sawyer, who is a life long friend forces him to be respectable and stay in school in order to stay in the gang.The Novel is set in St. Petersburg, Missouri. All is well, Huck Finn has money saved in the bank from treasures he and his friend Tom found. Unfortunately, Huck's father, who is a money hungry drunk, comes back to town and demands Huck's money. Huck was adopted by a lady named Widow Douglas. Huck's dad tries to fight for custody once he comes back to town but fails in his attempts. He then hangs around town and harrasses his son. Finally he kidnaps Huckand takes him to his cabin. In this part of the story the reader feels for Huck. His father locks him in their cabin when he leaves and when he returns home drunk, he beats him. The reader wants to see Huck stand up to his father and do something. Then, the reader gets what they want. Huck escapes from his father by faking his own death. He then sneaks off to an island in the Mississippi while the townspeople search the river for his body.While he's living on the island he encounters another boy. His name is Jim. Huck and Jim become friends and live on the island together. Unfortunately, some townspeople saw smoke coming from the island so the boys are forced to leave. The novel goes on to follow Huckleberry Finn in his wild journey's across the Mississippi.I thought that the book was a wonderful exciting tale of companionship and adventure. I would not hesitate to read this book again. Although the time period and the setting set me off from reading this novel before, when I finally read it I was pleasently suprised. I really liked how Huck Finn tells the story and the humor that is put into it. Mark Twain does a great job of making you feel like you are a part of the story as well. However, Mark Twain sometimes used racism that could be offensive to some. In my opinion, this book wouldn't have a clear setting of time period if he had left it out.My favorite thing about this novel is that it is a story about a young boy and what he overcomes in life. I loved the friend ships and the childhood fasination of the outdoors. I would recommend this book to anyone who read the novel preceding it, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and also to anyone who enjoys a good adventure themselves."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an adventure book written by Mark Twain.

The story states Huck's struggles like living with the widow, problems with all of his money and being civilized. He runs away from his home from the widow and then rethinks his situation. Huck soon reconsiders his first choice of running away and soon returns to the widows where he is home again. Soon Huck finds out that his \\"pap\\" is back in town and Huck gives all his money to Judge Thatcher and tells him to keep it, for Huck is afraid that his pap will find out about his money and want to have it.

Huck soon is captured by his dad and kidnapped to a small cabin in the forest. Huck is a prisoner of the cabin; the only time he is let out is when pap is home.

Huck finally devises a plan that will free him to travel down the Mississippi River to the south.One night when Huck's dad was out getting drunk in town Huck snuck out of the cave and sets up a fake death of himself so that pap will believe that he was murdered. Huck takes a raft that he had found down the river to the abandoned Jackson's Island. He soon encounters Jim, one of Miss Watson's slaves. Jim soon tells Huck of how he had escaped from Miss Watson because he had overheard her talking about selling him down in the south.

Huck Finn, the narrator and main character of the book, constantly rejects society and all attempts by other people to take care of him. He wants nothing more than to leave society behind and live by his own rules. Mark Twain portrays the young boy's adventures exceptionally well and the reader will feel connected to the characters.While the novel may not be a page turner from start to finish, conflicts in Huck's path call to question moral beliefs in today's world. With each new paragraph comes a greater desire for the reader to search for their own adventure. The book can be read straight through solely for entertainment or it can be picked apart and assessed time and again by anyone searching for deeper meaning in the words.I would recommend this novel to any person in search of a vicarious journey. The classic depiction of the \\"hero's journey\\" is what kept my interest. Mark Twain's work should be purchased by people interested in the time period, realistic, epic journeys, or English students looking for writing to delve deeper into."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book is a must-have for serious readers of Twain's greatest novel, one well worth the expense. Based on his original manuscript, it provides the ur-text of this wonderful work (including the original illustrations), giving readers the opportunity to appreciate and enjoy the full subtlety of the author's labors.Enhancing the experience is the excellent annotations that the editors provided. While a bit difficult to trace (the editors preferred page-line cites to footnotes, which leaves the text free of supertext clutter), they provide first-rate insight into the details of Clemens's writing and the minutiae of Huck's world. This, along with Clemens's original notes, list of revisions, fascimilies of the original manuscript, and a number of maps of Clemens's Mississippi, make this book an essential addition to the library of any student of this great writer."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The novel \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" exposes the reader to many interesting and funny occurrences during the pre-Civil War time.

I remember when I first read it in 8th grade at High School. I was amazed then only by the adventures of the little boy and nothing else. However, when we discussed it again this semester in the college, I realized the plot of the book and its representation of the harsh reality during the slavery period in USA.In \\"Huck Finn\\", Mark Twain satirizes a society, which has no moral issues and which is trapped between its obdurate way of thinking and the rapidly changing reality. He also exposes very important problem as showing us the way for reaching independence as a constant struggle between freedom and slavery. This struggle exists for both Jim and Huck. For Jim this is more physical struggle than mental, while for Huck it is based on mentality and experience. Jim fears the physical slavery of that period in USA and Huck does not want to be \\"civilized\\" by a society without any moral values and chooses to live his own life free and independent.Having read \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" twice, I strongly recommend it to everyone interested not only in risky and funny adventures, but also to those who think that morality is important in the humans' relationship."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn will always be a classic piece of American literature because it embodies an adventure of immense scale.

Huck meets a upscale Southern family, the Shepherdsons, who have been embattled in a feud for decades. Many are killed, young and old, on both sides and few can even remember exactly how the feud got started to begin with.

This book should be required reading for every American schoolboy and girl. An uproarious account of Huck and Jim's adventures as they travel by raft down the Mississippi river. Jim is a runaway slave, Huck the delinquent teenage child of an alcoholic father. Although outrageously funny, Twain's work is a scathing indictment of statutory slavery. Some will be offended by the casual use of the work \\"nigger\\", but at the time this story was written the term was in widespread usage. Incredible as it may seem, people of African descent were owned by their white masters in the same way as they might own livestock. In this context, saying that one owned five or six \\"niggers\\" would have drawn no more attention than stating the same of five or six chickens."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book proved to me its title of \\"Great American Classic\\" the first time I read it. It is an American story full of adventure, good laughs, and excellent social views. Combined with a tough, yet relevant writing style that is fun to read, this novel is very enjoyable. It starts off where Tom Sawyer's story left off, and moves quickly to the huge Mississippi River, where Huck teams with runaway slave Jim to escape his abusive father. As they ride their raft down the current, they encounter many challenges that steathily frame what America has dealt with as it grew as a country. Huck must overcome moral issues of slavery, lying, deception, his misunderstanding of religion, and the fact that his new best friend is black. Despite these challenges, Huck and Jim form an amazing friendship in which they would do anything for one another. Mark Twain keeps the story exciting by continuously giving Huck and Jim new adventures and problems they must deal with. Huck grows to have a greater sense of himself and ultimately must decide between following the norm, or helping the person who needs him the most."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huck escapes town and goes to a cabin and takes an axe and smashes the door down.

He ran down the river and threw the pig into the river. Then he gets in his canoe and goes to Jackson's Island. Huck and Jim find a dead person in a boat.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn takes place on the Mississippi river and begins when Huck Finn runs away from home and ends up meeting the Widow Douglas's slave Jim. Huck finds out that Jim was running away, too, so Huck helps Jim get to the free states. One of the adventures that this book includes is when Huck Finn and Jim pick up these two men that were kicked off a steamboat. Huck and Jim didn't know these two guys were con men until they start robbing different towns money. Read the book to find out all the different adventures Huck and Jim have to over come.I was surprised how great this book was because I didn't think it would be nearly as good as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but it ended up being the best book I've ever read and enjoyed. I could even imagine myself on the raft with Huck and Jim traveling down the Mississippi. This book is a little difficult because it uses country accent. I would recommend this book that likes an adventure, but can handle a challenge.-Andrew"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"(sorry if i mispelled your name). At first i found this book somewhat hard to understand given the very nature of the writing style i could easily imagine a southerner sitting on a porch with a pipe telling this story to his grand kids or something word for word. Asides from this though i was quickly taken with the characters and the subtle yet distinct philosophies and suggestions that the book is filled with behind the guise of an entertaining tail of a boy's adventures down the Mississippi River. I don't understand how any critic could call this book trash or see any reason to ban it in some school libraries. Both the book and the author are very insightful into not only human nature but also into humor as demonstrated again and again by the Duke and the King. Sam Clemens also expresses his low opinion of frontiers folk who just as readily want to lynch someone as they are drinking at a pub. Overall, if you can get past the way it was written, this is a very insightful book and i reccomend it to anyone who enjoy sa good story or to someone who can read between the lines."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Adventures of Huckleberry FinnHuckleberry Finn is an entertaining but dark epic, considered a masterpiece by some and offensive by others.This novel is set in the deep South during the antebellum period. Huckleberry Finn is a boy who, after being subjected to attempts to be \\"sivilized\\" by the Widow Douglas and after being kidnapped and detained by his alcoholic, abusive father, finally sets off down the Mississippi River with Jim, a runaway slave. They strike up an unlikely friendship. When Huck was at home, he and Tom Sawyer pulled a few pranks on Jim, like taking his hat and making him believe that witches flew him around the country while he was sleeping. Now that he is spending more time with Jim, he starts to have a growing respect for him. During the entire journey, Jim treats Huck with respect, almost mothering him. Huck would later remember this, which will affect some of his decisions.While floating down river, they encounter a drifting house with a dead man inside; they came very close to being caught by a dangerous gang, and nearly being run over by a steamboat. Two men who claim to have royal blood in them join Huck and Jim downstream. These men will unwittingly test the loyalty of Huck's friendship with Jim.My opinion of this book is on the fence. I certainly am not fond of it. The dialog can be confusing at times, especially when Jim starts talking. Everyone, including black slaves and white Southerners, use the word nigger frequently. One issue with this is that Huck calls every black person he sees a nigger; is he being a racial bigot or is he just repeating what he has heard all his life? Is he wrong for saying that or can he be excused for it because that's the common word back then for a black slave.Though this book is not one that I would pick up again and again to read, I do not have a passionate hatred for it either. I find certain parts humorous. For example: to find out information from the townspeople, Huck disguises himself in a dress and a sunbonnet. Or when the old man's claim to royalty was that he was the son of Louis the XVI and Marie Antoinette. This book also brings to light how cruel human beings can be to one another. For example: When his friend Buck Grangerford and the male side of his family are killed in a feud with the Shepherdson family: They shoot Buck without a care. Huck would remember that all his life.This is definitely not a children's book. TheAdventures of Huckleberry Finn moves away from the child-like innocence Mark Twain used for Tom Sawyer. Mark Twain instead replaces it with a darker plot, with deeper characters, all the while taking a stab at slavery and the underlying flaws in human nature."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an amazing piece American literature. This book helps you to get in the frame of mind of an American living in the Pre-Civil War era. This book depicts a journey of a young boy traveling down the mighty Mississippi helping Jim, a slave, enter freedom. They met interesting characters such as the duke and the king. These characters distract Huck and Jim from their mission but do help them to realize life lessons. You can really feel for Huck and you see the progression he makes through out the book. He starts off as a very racist boy but turns into a sympathetic young man.Although this book uses words that, by some, are considered vulgar and inappropriate, this is not true at all. They truly help you to understand Huck's and many other's mindset. Mark Twain uses these words but they don't represent Mark Twain's personal opinions. Another thing I like about this book are the messages it tries to teach. Mark Twain is trying to show American's that sometimes the laws of the state and country can greatly differ from the \\"right\\" thing to do. He shows this over a period of time as Jim and Huck's relationship begins to advance. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, even though highly debated, can teach us many things about life and morals."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn is an all around good book. It keeps you wondering what might happen next. There is a lot of excitement and the book rarely gets boring. The book and the story lines are also fairly easy to follow so that one understands what is going on.One of the things I really enjoyed in this book was the way Huck acted. He looked at everything very simply. Huck was also pretty funny; like when he would talk about stuff that widow Douglus would tell him to do. Huck's practical and often socially naive views and perceptions also provide much of the satirical humor in this novel. Huck didn't like to be held down by rules. He wanted to be free to do whatever he wanted when he wanted. The only reason he stayed in school and kept going to church like widow Douglus wanted him to was to spite his Pap. In this book all the friends, Huck, Tom, and Jim all had a very good friendship with one another and they were very loyal to each other during everything they went through.The only thing that some people might not like about this novel is that it is pretty long. The book has 42 chapters, so you should know this book will take you a while to read. I also didn't enjoy the part of the book when Huck is working with the scam artists that are trying to act like there Peter Wilks brothers so they can get the inheritance money from his death. I just thought that part of the story was a little to long and wasn't too realistic.Overall I think that this was a good book. I would suggest reading it if you had enough free time to read a fairly long novel. It will make you laugh and always be guessing and wondering what might happen next."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huckleberry Fin Book ReviewHuckleberry Fin was an exciting and adventurous book.

However he did care for his friends."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain is an enjoyable book that deals with many powerful themes. The novel is set in the pre-civil war era of the south. Through the eyes of main character, Huck, the reader is able to see how Twain is satirizing this society. Characters such as Pa demonstrate the ignorant \\"white trash\\" in the society, and the widows Douglas and Stevens are examples of the Christian women in the society. Through Huck's thoughts, the reader is able to find the irony that Huck the \\"uncivilized\\" character in the book, may have the most civilized attitude and ideas of all the characters in the story. Twain uses Huck's friendship with Jim, the runaway slave, to deal with the issue of slavery and suggest that slavery is wrong. Twain's strong take on issues in the story are evident and create a powerful novel told in an innocent manner through the eyes of a boy."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"When I read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain in high school, it was possibly the first book I enjoyed that was assigned by a teacher. Twain's imagery puts the reader right beside Huck while he escapes &#65533;sivilization&#65533; and floats down the Mississippi river with his slave-gone-fugitive friend Jim. Huck&#65533;s innocent outlook on the world is both humorous and adorable. Huck&#65533;s respect for Jim is admirable. Even though Huck was brought up with Jim being a inferior slave, he still looks up to Jim. Also, I think that although Jim&#65533;s dialect adds to the effectiveness of the book, it is very difficult to understand. I think Twain writes it a little too much how the dialect sounds. I would recommend this book to anyone. It offers plenty of excitement and surprises."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"As a child I always dreamed of going on adventures to new places. In some ways these dreams were realized while reading this book. I was swept into Huck's life and became a part of his adventures throughout the story. For such a young boy, Huck has many experiences that most of us will only encounter in our dreams, and this is why the book is appealing to me and people of all ages. Everyone at one point or another in their lives has longed to go on an adventure, and this book satisfies that longing. Mark Twain is an amazing writer who is able to spur your imagination, because his choice of dialect and visuals make everything seem real. At times it was a little hard to understand what was going on when Jim (Miss Watson's slave) was talking because of his strong southern vernacular, but I know that if I was there I would have a hard time understanding what he was saying. This book grabbed my attention from the moment I picked it up. I read it for the first time in eleventh grade and now as a college freshman I was required to read it again. Unlike many books that I have had to read over the years, this book was not a chore, because I fell in love with the story all over again. I recommend this book for people of all ages. If you're just looking for a good book to read for yourself or maybe even to a child, I definitely recommend Huck Finn.

The speech used however may slow your reading down a little in attempt to understand Jim's lingo.Although (because of Jim's dialog) I found some portions of this book hard to read and comprehend, I found the adventures to be riveting.

When I was a junior in high school, I had to get signed permission to read this novel. I never thought a book could be so controversial that something like that would be necessary. I am so glad that I read it then, and again during my freshman year of college, because I think it sends a powerful message. Written in the dialect of the deep south, Twain successfully gets the reader involved in the book. When I read this novel for the first time, I did not want to put it down. The character of Huck intrigued me. Though a young boy, he had more common sense than many people years older than him. He knew what he wanted and was smart enough to know how to go about getting it. When he befriends a runaway slave named Jim, social issues are brought up and Huck is forced to follow what his heart says, instead of what society says is morally acceptable. I enjoyed how Twain portrayed Huck and Jim's journey down the river and the adventures they shared. It was a symbol of their need for freedom. By sharing the same goals, Huck and Jim become true friends. They are beyond the color barrier and realize that a person is a person, regardless of what they look like or who they are. I think much of today's society could benefit from reading this book. It helps you put things in perspective and think about what is really important in life; what others think versus how you feel. If anyone is looking for a good novel to read, one that captures interest and provokes thought, Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I thought that this was an exciting book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure. Southern dialect is used throughout the entire novel, and it was difficult to understand at first, but once I had read a little ways into it, the language added tremendous reality to the story. This book is about a young boy who runs away from his dad, the town drunk, and is later joined by a slave, Jim, who is running aways at an attempt for freedom. It questions a lot of the values that Americans had when it was written (before the Civil War), and it's message is timeless. It was an awesome book, and you should definitely check it out!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huckleberry Finn, a boy in the Deep South, is living with the Widow Douglas and is finally becoming civilized, when all of the sudden, Huck's father comes back to town. He decides to take Huck back into the wilderness to live with him. He keeps Huck under lock and key, so Huck decides to escape. Huck plans his own \\"murder\\" and takes a raft down to Jackson's Island, where he meets Jim, Miss Watson's slave who ran away. Jim and Huck head up north, where they will both be free. Once there, they begin to get homesick and head back down south. On the way down, they meet two bums who think of themselves as a duke and as a king. The foursome continue down while the bums trick all the towns along the way out of their money. Eventually, being broke, the bums sold Jim without Huck's knowledge. Huck finds out, and goes to find Jim at the Phelps' farm. Sally Phelps mistakes Huck to be her nephew, Tom Sawyer. Tom later arrives and Huck convinces him to help him steal Jim back and to play the part of Sid. The two of them work out a plan to get Jim out and cause one very large headache for Aunt Sally. In the middle of freeing Jim, Aunt Polly comes and Tom gets shot in the leg. At the end, Jim is set free under the orders of his owner in her will, Tom recovers and Aunt Sally threatens to take in Huck and civilize him.I thought this book was very funny, though a little hard to get into during the first 49 pages, and some parts must be read aloud in order to understand the dialect. I recommend that this be read by everyone ages ten and up."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"As I read Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, I was in love with Mark Twain once again, because this is such a literary wonder. The protagonist, Huck, has to face many issues in his life. He has many adventures and many moral problems to face. He has to go through \\"Rights of passages\\" throughout this story, which give children great morals to follow. He is a great role model in my opinion (but not his shenanigans...). Find out about Jim, the black slave, who is caught between the social choice of Huck or Huck's individual decision on setting him free or turning him in. You just have to read this book. Many others have. Will you?"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"Come here, Huck,\\" Aunt Polly called from the front porch where she was washing the clothes, \\" Don't you dare talk to that nigger again, you hear me, Huck, never!\\"\\"Alright, I am coming I was just making a bargain,\\" Huck yelled back as he slipped the money in his pocket.My essay is on the book Huckleberry Finn. I read this book and loved it. I think this book shows a friendship between a black slave and a white boy during a time when that was considered an unusual thing.This book takes place during a time when blacks were not treated equal. Blacks were thought of as property not as humans. An example of this takes place in the down town slave market.\\" Cheap niggers, get your cheap niggers,\\" a slave driver called out from on top of the stage. Families are being separated and children are crying while they are standing in shackles and cuffs. This is hatred.In this book, there is a lot of action. Every time you turn the page somebody is getting into trouble. It even goes as far as to put on a play to rip people off.\\" Come see the Play of Nonsense, the best in the world,\\" the duke yelled to the listeners. The duke and so called king are going to put on a play. Their idea is to rip people off and run with their money. It is a smart idea but later on they pay for it. The next night the play starts. Hundreds of people walk in and hand their money to the duke. Right when the play starts, the duke comes out and announces that there have been some misunderstandings and rushes off withthe money he collected from the audience. This book's plot is awesome.In this story the main characters are laid back and have a great sense of humor. An example this happens when Huck and Jim, a runaway slave, are rafting down the huge river. Jim is in great danger, but they always have time to play tricks on other people.Also, there is a lot of dirty tricks and cheating. All four characters have a good sense of humor and a mind that is made to get into trouble. An example of this takes place when Huck fakes his own death and fools everybody while he lives on a raft for two years. He left his Aunt Polly behind to mourn about him and fooled everybody else. For a while he stayed on a little island but then decided to raft down a river. He made his own camps and caught his own food. All this to him was a fun vacation. He loved it!In conclusion, this book is awesome! My four beliefs are: there is a hatred toward blacks in this story; the plot is filled with all kinds of action; the characters are happy, laid back, and have a great humor; and there is a lot of bad trick playing and a whole bunch of cheating in this story. I think Twain was trying to show us an ideal example of friendship."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book is about a boy who was taken in by a nice widow to be protected by his drunken father. The father got custody of him again. Huck was abused and chased around the house with a knife being called, \\"The Angel of Death.\\" Huck stages his own death and runs away. While he's running away he meets up with a runaway slave named Jim. Huck and Jim then start to have weird adventures.This is one of the funniest books ever. It totally portrays the South as it was 150 years ago. It also portrays the innocence of children and their ability to make change. The book also has good morals which preach against the evils of slavery.If you're looking for a hillarious read, then buy this. If you're looking for an intellectual read, then buy this. If you're looking for just a great way to pass time, then read this. I give this masterpiece five stars."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is a great book and deserves the place it has as a literary classic. The audio version was very good with the narrator using very different voices for the various characters so there is no confusion about who is speaking - a weakness with less talented narrators. The reason that I gave this product 4 and not 5 stars was the packaging - which I found to be inadequate - the case is cardboard and each CD comes in a paper envelope - not good for storage over the years, especially if it is used on a consistent basis by multiple persons. But the actual narration was first class and brought the well known book to life."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huckleberry Finn is truly a classic, and an indispensable part of the American literary canon. I put off reading the book for many years because I had - a many of you may have - an inaccurate preconception of the book: i.e., \\"I don't like that kind of country humor\\", or \\"I don't like those old-fashioned novel\\", or \\"I just don't like that kind of book.\\" If you yourself have this kind of feeling about the book - let me assure you, friends, you should READ THIS BOOK. It is much, much more than that. It is a rich, stunningly accurate portrayal of the pre-Civil War South. It is also an enduring portrait of childhood. It is, quite simply, a masterpiece. Huck Finn is a character that, no matter who we are or how far removed from him we are, we can all relate to. It is also, in its use of particular American dialect, a very influential book. A quote you often see is the one Ernest Hemingway himself made about this book being the very archetype of the American novel. And it is true. Tom Sawyer was the first step, but this book is the culmination - it is the masterpiece. It is here that American literature found its voice, and stepped out from under the shadow of its neglected step-child relationship with English literature. It has a voice distinctly its own - distinctly American, and couldn't have come from anywhere else - and its immense influence on subsequent American lit is enormous, and cannot be overestimated. It is an absolutely archetypal novel. Also, its heroic portrayal of slavery was a very immediate thing as well. Its influence on such writers as Alice Walker and John Steinbeck - as well as, in some form, literally all great literature to come out America since - is profound. For this reason, and for its sheer adventure and narrative drive, it is an essential read for simply everybody."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Looking for a good book to read? Well, just pick this one up, because The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain is a great book. This is a very interesting piece of literature and is not like anything else I have ever read. Listen and you'll see why. This book is written in first person, and the story is told from the view of Huck Finn, a twelve or thirteen year old child of St. Petersburg, Missouri. The English used by Mr. Twain does not seem very good. He meant to write in this way, though, to give it a little more southern flavor and sound like a young teenager. The language itself makes the story interesting, and somewhat of a challenge to try and figure out what the characters are saying. Some words used, even in the first couple of pages, are \\"whippowill\\", \\"didn'\\", \\"gwyne\\", and \\"sumf'n\\". As you can see, Twain is very good at speaking in old American and southern talk. Another aspect of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the satire Twain uses. This helps us learn about the people of the time, as well as add to the entertainment value of the book by showing things that we find ignorant, which can be funny. Twain also uses satire to show weaknesses in society and look to make a point. Twain criticizes how gullible people are, how you can't trust everyone, and how some things that could be easily done are overdone. The gullibility of people keeps coming up in the book. First, they don't see the capability of everyone, especially the young. This can be seen on page 33 where Huck portrays himself as dead after using an ax and a pig to put the cabin in ruins with blood and his hair. Another instance is in Chapter 21. Huck dresses up as a girl and goes into a cabin to get some things for Jim and him. He calls himself \\"Sarah Williams\\", and even when he slips and calls himself \\"Mary\\", the lady still has no clue. Finally, she figures it out, but it takes her a while. A third and the most noticeable instance of how people are gullible is on page 132. The duke and the king, two people that come along with Huck and Jim, hold a play of Shakespeare. \\"To be, or not to be; that is the bare bodkin, That makes calamity of so long life....\\" The audience was wowed by these words, and have no idea that they aren't really reading Shakespeare except a little here and there. This also shows that you can't trust everyone you come in contact with. The last aspect that makes this story interesting is all the motifs in it. A motif is an idea, phrase, object, or element that keeps appearing in a story. In Huck Finn, the motifs are money, superstition, trust, and freedom. Money keeps occurring in the story. There is a reward for Jim and Pap, Huck's dad, Huck and Tom Sawyer find $6,000, he goes and sees a couple of wealthy families, and the foursome, with the duke and the king, try to raise money. Superstition happens with Jim. Huck goes to Jim to hear about his dad, Huck and Tom play superstitious tricks on Jim, and there are a number of other occurrences. Huck wants to have freedom from everyone and the town and Jim wants to be free from slavery. Trust, as I already mentioned, is a big motif. Characters find that they can't trust each other. These motifs are interesting because we all want money and want to see how people earn it, superstition is interesting to see if it is right, and we would like to know what kind of people we can trust. Also, the motifs keep us interested in the story by seeing if we can understand what they are talking about and by them giving clues to help us read the book, while at the same time keeping it challenging. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a good, well thought out, and plot-filled book. It is as good as anything I've ever read and you will have fun reading it. If you don't read anything else, read this because it is worth it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain- The Adventures of Huckleberry FinnThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was first published in 1884 .

I mean, a kid might enjoy Huck and Jim's mischief, but they wouldn't really appreciate the quality and wittiness of this book. I also can't understand why some people say this is a racist book; the impression I got is that Twain was actually mocking the narrow-mindedness and prejudice of white society at that time. Anyway, I think this book is funny and satirical, and the characters are very well defined and charismatic; their combination of naivete and wisdom is really endearing. Okay, some of the situations are quite absurd, and sometimes Huck's penchant for criticizing everything that doesn't sit well with him are somewhat tiring, but on the whole this is a great story, and I reccommend it to everyone that can keep an open mind while reading, because I believe this book is definitely not an easy read, despite what others say, or at least not as easy as it seems on the surface."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"What I appreciate most from this book is its ability to create rollercoaster sensation, in which the reader participates aside with the characters within the novel. The life seems unimagineable but it's that very reason that makes it memorable.Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn explores the human flaws of an American society through the eyes of Huck Finn, who ultimately triumphs over societal expectations; Twain argues that in order for one to genuinely perceive flaws of a body of people, one has to be truly detached and thus objective of that group. Huck Finn is the epitome of an intrepid individual, who ignores societal expectations, when he learns that it is not he that is abnormal, but the others that are unusual. It is not until then that he truly assumes an objective stance and investigates and analyzes the slave-oriented society. Able to prevail against the initial despairs of isolation, Huck Finn ultimately overcomes through his eventual apathy towards the people's views. He does exactly what the others do not expect him to do so. Instead of diminishing, Finn firmly stands even stronger than before, an attitude that irate the rest. It is then that the individual truly undermines the established norm and understands societal flaws. Following one's moral compass, anyone can rise against and unjust conformity, upholding one's genuine beliefs.The reason you should read this book is that it becomes good source, as it is cited and referred to in allusions."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"What Ernest Hemingway called, \\"the best book we've had,\\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is written in a southern slang that is initially difficult to follow, yet, once you learn to follow Huck's voice, it becomes a revelation of the human spirit. Huck Finn is a derelict boy on the run from his drunken, abusive father in the late 19th century. Along with his friend, Jim-a runaway slave-Huck travels down the Mississippi on a raft and learns about the ironies of life in a pious yet oppressive society. Twain uses Huck's ignorance to reveal the truths that were tearing America apart, and he does so with such grace and flare that I found myself indignant with laughter at the follies of a national doctrine. Even though slavery has been abolished, the book is still relevant today, describing a boy's awakening to the world around him, and how he-morals, judgement, and upbringing-fits into that world. A moving, fun, and insightful read, I found some of the most impressive moments in literature within the covers of this book; I hope you will too."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The book is well laid out and organized, but there are around 3 pages missing from Chapter 21.

As a kid I thought their little plots were merely amusing, but after getting out into the world and encountering the sorts of folks who make their living by ripping other people off, I could understand how any citizens of that era would have had no qualms whatever about dipping such a duo in hot tar and then feathers. The young American West must have been rife with such con artists, and their ilk was marvelously presented in \\"Huckleberry Finn.\\"And as for the word we're not allowed to say, it's amazing that \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is banned in many places for its literary use of that word in a serious work of social satire/commentary -- while a film like \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" with its own liberal use of that word, and no serious purpose beyond entertainment via plot and violence, is roundly praised.

Jim and Huck haves lots of fun.It's really exciting for the younger generation due to how they are just boys and they have these great adventures.

It contains good literal context of what is happening around the late 1880's, which was around the time the book was published. At that time, slavery was not completely abolished and the author, Mark Twain had made a great illustration by having to hide Jim, who was a slave, when he and Huck were on their adventure. Where they had travel through the heart of America. Mark Twain also makes good little adventures that Jim and Huck run into. They go through the story going from one adventure after another, in the same time they also learn to bond as friends depsite the color of their skin. This is interesting for readers because it was rare to see blacks and whites talk to one another or let alone to even do things together. Though this book uses a derogatory word for African American, I do not find this inappropriate because during the time this book was written, this word was how people looked at African Americans. Mark Twain seems to display the social injustices that were happening America, and instead of following them he turned them around and made the bad seem good. I would recommend this book because a lot of children and maybe even adults could learn how life was like in the past and how there were social injustices. It can also show the meaning of how people can bond, regardless of his or her race, sex, or age. I think highly of this book even though it used to be banned in educational systems because of it's context and I think that this is one of the best books I have read in my life."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I think that this book is exciting but is too long.

It was required of me to read this book for my AP English 11 class during the summer and I found it to be the most classic book ever written. I say this because it showed me the different events that young Huck experienced. Through his adventures, he was able to understand himself and where he belongs in world full of discrimination and prejudice. Mark Twain does an outstanding job in constructing the sequence of events in this book. The adventures that Huck encounters happens almost immediately after the preceding adventure. This type of plot allows the reader to stay interested in the feelings and trials that the characters had to endure. Mark Twain also related situatins that were currnet in his time and applied them to this book. After reading it, I saw how ignorant the people were and how they made such arbitrary decisions in there time. Overall, this book is highly recommendable. It will give readers a broader sense of understanding of Mark Twain's society.

While the main characters, Huck and Jim goes further and further away, they realize that their's more to friendship than their eyes see.Huck and Jim became close friends eventhough society permits it. It talks about the bad thing African-Americans went through. It thought me that it's ok to lie to protect a friend. You have to follow your heart because most of the time, your brains tells you what others want you to do, while your heart tells you want you want to do.

Its a fine read for all."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain's &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; holds a rightful place as one of the enduring monuments of United States literature. It's also a book that continues to be both entertaining and controversial (two qualities that not all &quot;classics&quot; have). I must admit: as much as I admire and am enriched by this novel, I also find its final chapters to be not wholly satisfying.Twain is brilliant in that the heroes of this book, set in the pre-Civil War American South, are two of the most marginalized members of that society: Huck, a poor white boy whose single parent is an abusive alcoholic father; and Jim, an escaped African-American slave. Their relationship is beautifully written; Twain's vision of an interracial friendship is a significant milestone in U.S. literature, and is comparable to such relationships in Cooper's &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; and Melville's &quot;Moby Dick.&quot; Twain depicts Jim as a master of African-American folk traditions.Twain evokes the vernacular speech of the American south; this literary technique has been continued by generations of U.S. writers, both black and white. Twain's merry riffs on Shakespeare are also worthy of note. I also continue to be fascinated by Twain's analysis of the twisted interrelationship among racism, institutional Christianity, and oppressive biblical interpretation.In my opinion, the novel's weak link is the plot material revolving around Huck's pal Tom Sawyer. Tom is a wonderful character, but his antics seem out of place in the structure of the narrative, and ultimately cheapen the arc of the story. Despite its problematic aspects, however, &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; is one of the truly indispensable classics of the American canon. It is a crucial junction in a literary tapestry that immediately encompasses such works as &quot;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,&quot; Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple,&quot; and many other great books. If you haven't yet read Huck Finn, put aside any preconceptions you might have and discover the book for yourself; if you've already read it, read it again."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a really interesting book about a boy and his adventures. The main character, Huck, narrates it. This gives it a certain amount of intimacy that it would not otherwise have. One of the things I found most interesting about this book is that Huck befriends a slave, Jim and helps him escape to freedom. This presents a large moral dilemma for him, because he does not want to be considered an abolitionist, but Jim is his friend. In the end he decides to help Jim and they raft down the Mississippi together. The description of their friendship is the best description I have ever read. Another aspect of the book that makes it all the more interesting to read is the colorful characters they meet along the way. Mark Twain has an incredible imagination and you then find yourself becoming attached to the characters as you move through the book. This is one of Mark Twain's greatest strengths. In the end I would recommend this book to readers of all ages because I think someone of any age could get something from it. Whether you read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn as a means of entertainment, to gain a life lesson, or to understand the social pressure associated with befriending a black man prior to the Civil War, you will definitely be able to gain something from reading this novel."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I thought it was an exciting story.

However, that's not saying much since Twain is one of the most overrated authors of all time. Anyway, the story is good and the friendship between Jim and Huck is very interesting. The thing that REALLY is the most entertaining about the book is the way many PC-nuts go into fits over the use of the dreaded &quot;N&quot; word. (GROW UP! The book was set in the 1800's!) If you want to read the best Twain book, this is it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"All right, this is a rather subjective viewpoint. I could say, IN MY OPINION--but what's the purpose. Surely one of the best known and most readily acknowledged American classics, there is more to this book than all the tame discriptions and virulent hate mail imply. It is a rather bleak, desolate tail about two people running away from the world. The only problem is, they have no where to go. Let's ignore the so-called contoversy surrounding this book. It is idiotic, as nowhere in this book is it implied that the racist attitudes of some of the characters is a good thing. Twain was a master of dialect and speech patterns and this was, ultimately, a story about the evils of slavery and the hopelessness of many who tried to run away. Huck grows to truly love Jim. In the end, he is his only friend, the only person he trusts, the only person who has ever been good to him. Cherished characters like Tom Sawyer are distorted into manifest destiny oriented monsters, politicians of the day always trying to trick people and bend them into their will for a laugh or a selfish end. Yet Huck remains a conscientous person, seeing the evils of slavery, the cruelty of Tom's behavior, the ills of the world, the pointlessness of what his own life has thus far amounted to. A word can be used with many meanings. The controversy of this book, raging since its publication, is based solely on the USE of this word, not its context, not its implications within the narrative. This book is one of the most savage indictments of institutional racism one could ever hope to come across, yet people who refuse to read it out of fear of getting their feelings hurt or their political agendas ruffled, are missing out on this point. Twain suffered through this book. He set it aside for several years after a certain point, not knowing how to end it, getting more and more unhappy with the state of the Reconsruction. There is a rather bleak punch-line at the end of the book. Huck still wants to live his brief happiness w! ith Jim, run away again to escape society's expectations of how people are supposed to be. He thinks about &quot;light(ing) out for the territory ahead of the rest&quot;. Twain knew, by the time he wrote the book, the territory was no more, already plundered by the government and the corporate interests. Huck's next journey would be just as pointless, just as ultimately meaningless as this river ride down the Ole Miss."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I have probably read this book 10 times, but this time was different. i'm older and can easier appreciate the social commentary twain made than i could when i was a child.This book is a classic, and if you haven't read it, you should."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This novel is mainly based on a character named Tom Sawyer, who is living in St. Petersburg, after two decades before the Civil War.

Two weeks later Tom is appalled to hear that Judge Thatcher who is one of the local judges in town, has had the mouth of the McDougal's cave sealed and later on in the novel they found Tom's good friend Joe, dead in the cave. The story ends with Tom later going back to the cave and recovering $12,000 worth of treasure. &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; is a great book, with a adventureous meaning behind it. The author of this book was Mark Twain, he is one of the greatest writers in my opinion, his style of writing is really interesting, he uses alot of satires and he tries to make the reader interested in reading his novels, by being humorous. i highly recommend people to read this novel, it is a story to really know about."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Have you ever faked your death to get out of doing something? Huck Finn has. His dad was very mean and his mom was dead, so he pretended he got murdered. He took a raft and rafted down the river to an island called Jackson Island. When he got there, he found a black person named Jim. Jim ran away because his master was going to sell him for $800.The main characters are Huckleberry Finn, a teenage boy, and Jim. Their story takes place in the South, in the days of slavery. The conflict of the story is getting Jim free from slavery.I think the book is really good for people that like adventure stories. It's about life's adventures and helping friends. It is good for readers age 9 and older.Mark Twain wrote this story. He was considered a humorist of his time because his books had a sense of humor even though they were about serious things."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"&#65533;Come here, Huck,&#65533; Aunt Polly called from the front porch where she was washing the clothes, &#65533; Don&#65533;t you dare talk to that nigger again, you hear me, Huck, never!&#65533;&#65533;Alright, I am coming I was just making a bargain,&#65533; Huck yelled back as he slipped the money in his pocket.My essay is on the book Huckleberry Finn. I read this book and loved it. I think this book shows a friendship between a black slave and a white boy during a time when that was considered an unusual thing.This book takes place during a time when blacks were not treated equal.

An example of this takes place in the down town slave market.&#65533; Cheap niggers, get your cheap niggers,&#65533; a slave driver called out from on top of the stage.

Jim is in great danger, but they always have time to play tricks on other people.Also, there is a lot of dirty tricks and cheating. All four characters have a good sense of humor and a mind that is made to get into trouble. An example of this takes place when Huck fakes his own death and fools everybody while he lives on a raft for two years. He left his Aunt Polly behind to mourn about him and fooled everybody else. For a while he stayed on a little island but then decided to raft down a river. He made his own camps and caught his own food. All this to him was a fun vacation. He loved it!In conclusion, this book is awesome! My four beliefs are: there is a hatred toward blacks in this story; the plot is filled with all kinds of action; the characters are happy, laid back, and have a great humor; and there is a lot of bad trick playing and a whole bunch of cheating in this story. I think Twain was trying to show us an ideal example of friendship."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I am very happy with PlumCircle, LLC.

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is the companion piece to Mark Twain's classic Tom Sawyer. If you liked that book, you may like this one even better.It is filled with humor, adventure, and suspense. After being rescued from his abusive father, Tom and Huck take off on a rafting adventure down the mighty Mississippi. The book will keep you turning one satisfying page after the other until you reach the exciting end.As an author, I have been influenced by the humorous aspect of the writing of Mark Twain. While my outrageously funny novel, \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" is not a classic, this book surely is. Although it speaks of a lost time, it speaks to the indomitable spirit of the human experience. Get ready for an adventure and have fun, fun, fun!Davis Aujourd'hui, author"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a classic American novel because it encompasses many topics, and still manages to say something significant about all of them. Huck Finn is a young American growing up without a family and a home. He runs away from home to find happiness somewhere else where nobody knows him. This emphasizes the importance of going on the frontier, which in many respects is at the backbone of American society. Along the way, Huckleberry meets Jim, a runaway slave. The moral dilemmas that the main character faces concerning Jim are symbolic of the struggle between the social norm and inborn human kindness and represent Mark Twain's criticism of society at the time. All of these ideas are wrapped up in an exciting, funny plot that's guaranteed to keep you reading. Overall, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a must for anyone living or interested in American culture."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The novel of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain is the epitome of the American novel. The main character, which is the title's namesake, takes literal and symbolic journey down the Mississippi River in order to find his place in the hypocritical and stifling nature of civilization.It is out on the river that through the escapades of witnessing a murder, dressing up like a girl, aiding a runaway slave, and engaging in fraud, (to name a few) that Huck is able to establish his own moral values and code. This is embodied in Huck's decision to help his friend Jim, a slave, escape to freedom even though the code of his \\"civilization\\" would require that he turn Jim in or risk damnation. It is ironic that this sense of self and ethical standards is found outside the boundaraies of the society.Through Huck, America is personified. America is young; it is a dichotomy between the institution of the past (slavery) and the ideals of the future (equality). Hopefully, our moral code will follow in the mavericks of our literature, which challenge the current system and find our own truth down the river."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I thought that this was an exciting book, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure. Southern dialect is used throughout the entire novel, and it was difficult to understand at first, but once I had read a little ways into it, the language added tremendous reality to the story. This book is about a young boy who runs away from his dad, the town drunk, and is later joined by a slave, Jim, who is running aways at an attempt for freedom. It questions a lot of the values that Americans had when it was written (before the Civil War), and it's message is timeless. It was an awesome book, and you should definitely check it out!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book is the American classic. It isn't simply a children's book, or a simple adventure tale, but a vision of a battle between individuality and conformity through the eyes of one of the greatest characters in American literature. The point that this book is racist is absurd. In fact, it is quite the opposite, with Twain indicating that it is more natural for Huck and Jim to be equals. Every time Huck stops along the river and enters a town, Twain satirizes the faults and gullibility of society. The ending is there to provide a sharp contrast between Huck, a strong individual and a realist, and Tom, a total conformist and a romantic. Overall, this book is a pivotal piece in American literature, and most of the points made in the book still hold true today."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is truly one of the great American novels, but not only is it popular with critics and academics, it is a great story for the everyday reader. I was originally assigned to read this book over the summer before eigth grade and thought it was a terrifically fun story about a young boy on an adventure down the Mississippi River, but now several years later I can still relate to it, but on a new level. This book contains fabulous social satire, excellent use of the vernacular, wonderful characters such as the Duke and Dauphin, and several lessons in morality presented by a savvy young boy who doess not realize how intelligent are his instincts. Mark Twain is a marvelous author, this being only one of his fine novels and short stories, and I envy his ability to get in touch with his childhood and create such a genuine and accurate character as Huck Finn. This is a terrific book, and I feel that anyone who has not had the privilege of reading it is missing out on something wonderful."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The book, The Advenures of Huckleberry Finn, written by Mark Twain in 1834 is said by many to be the closest and most realalistic discription of what the banks of the Mississsipppi were like at that time in history. The words Twain uses came across strongly to me, but the strength of the words is what kept me reading because it made me feel like I was a shadow of Huck, along with him every step of the way. The two main characters in this book are Jim, who is a black slave who has escaped from his owner to find family and freedom, and Huck, a thirteen year old boy who is running away from the burden of his abusive and drunken father so he dosen't have to worry what might happen when his dad comes home from the bar. Huck and Jim come across each other on a island outside of town where they become friends. Huck and Jim run all along the banks of the Mississsipppi where they are wittnesses to murder, thievery, and more. They put themselves at risk and danger so they won't be caught, My favorite part of the story is when Huck steals his dad's canoe and runs off. The next day the whole town is out on searching boats looking for Huck. Huck watches from a distance as he laughs away knowing that he put the whole town in an uproar. I believe Mark Twain wrote this book for people like us today to be able to get a little taste of how things were back then. I also believe he wrote this to make you feel like your on an adventure of your own ecscaping into a fun adventurous world where things don't matter what you do as long as you keep on reading. This book reminds me of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,&quot; also written by Mark Twain, but still has the same feeling of going out on a ride for an adventure. I think its a pretty darn good book."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book is my very favourite of all time. I find it a rich, warm story with incredible characterization. It is THE BEST coming of age novel ever written as far as I'm concerned. I have read the story about 10 times in my lifetime, and I find now that I have to reread it about every five years or so just to set a benchmark in my mind as to what superb writing is. It's not just for kids that's for sure. It's rich, warm, complex and just simply wonderful!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"Huckleberry Finn\\" by Mark Twain is the greatest American novel. Because it is our greatest novel it has been reviewed, analyzed, admired and vilified probably more than any book in American literary history.Everyone knows the story. Huckleberry Finn is a character introduced in \\"Tom Sawyer\\". He's the neglected son of the town drunk. After discovering a small fortune with Tom at the end of Tom Sawyer, Huck is given a home with spinsters. The idea is to \`civilize' Huck. That means bathing regularly, going to school, church in order to elevate him above the level of poor white trash.(Forgive me for using the term. But author is unsparing in his use of language considered to today to be politically incorrect. We'll discuss this more later.)Huck's father's paternal instincts are stimulated by the smell of money. He wants custody of his son. Unfortunately the law is on his side. Huck decides to run away. Inadvertently he takes one of the household slaves with him a runaway named Jim. They ride down the Mississippi River on a raft and sail into the annals of literature.The single largest misconception about \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" is this is a children's novel. It is often given to children as a gift or taught in junior high English class. Twain was master of American dialects. His characters speak as they should for their time and place. Consequently, the n-word is used extensively. If you're the only black kid in the class, constant use of this word could make things uncomfortable.This one of the reasons this book this book keeps winding up on the banned lists. But to put this book on the banned list in the name of political correctness is short-sighted and ignorant.Another reason this is not a kids book is it tackles issues and situations far beyond the junior high level. The average 13 year old simply does not have the life experience to fully appreciate the book.Huck and Jim represent the dregs of pre-Civil War southern society. All their lives they've been reminded of this. They must always listen to the counsel of their \`betters', be it con men, childless old ladies or noble families hunting each other to extinction. Most of their \`adventures' are because they yield their better judgment to idiots.But there is a notable exception. Jim ran away rather than be sold away from his children forever. He's not as interested in freedom as much as he is in taking care of his family. Huck is conflicted because he's stealing an old woman's property. However he begins to see this \`property' as a human being.The point where Huck decides he will go to hell before he returns Jim to an uncertain future is one of the greatest moments in the history of American letters.Huck and Jim may not be the smartest people in the world. But they both show presence of mind, loyalty, devotion and love in abundance.In short, they represent the best of humanity."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I got this book for my 8 year old because he's been bored with the reading materials given to him at school.

While traveling they had many and hardships, dealing with con-men, rednecks, heavy fogs, big ships, and dressing up like a girl, typical day down in Missouri.This book is in a more classic American literature novel genre. One thing I can say is that it is accurate to that time. The characters true to their own culture. The N word is used through out so I'm pretty sure the dialog was also accurate. There were a lot of things that happen yet I was still pretty bored reading it. It was slow and when it did pick up not much happen.So even though this book is an American classic I would have to say I didn't like it much.

This was for the student who would have trouble reading on his on or for the class to listen to certain parts of the book read to them."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I can't say more on the plot because it's quite obvious what the plot is just from illustrations of the novel. But on the \\"controversial\\" aspect of the novel involving the excessive use of the N word, people have to think of the time period that Twain is writing about and when the novel was published.The novel takes place in Missouri (a slave border state) in the 1830s. We use the term African-American or black now. Before that it was Afro-Americans, coloreds, Negr--s. The list goes on and on. The overall attitude was that as the terms changed the previous one was seen as more offensive than the progressive current one. Yes, that meant there was a time when the word \\"colored\\" was used by people who considered themselves progressive in terms of racial attitudes. But in the Antebellum South the use of the N word was thrown around quite easily. And persons added positive as well as negative adjectives to it. It's strange to imagine that. We today only think of it in a totally negative way. But even when Twain published the novel in the 1880s the word was unfortunately not yet out of fashion.Also consider the way Twain writes of Jim, the runaway slave. While the knee-jerk reaction is that Jim is a total vaudevillian caricature of what the perception was of blacks in the Antebellum South, his relationship with Huck Finn was something to be viewed as progressive. Remember that a decade before the novel came out; Reconstruction was over and left things a mess in terms of race relations. There was a lot of bitterness in the South over the Civil War (probably the most destructive war at the time until WWI), and a whole generation of southern white men took it personally when they were expected to be on the same level in terms of voting rights and other things with men that was formerly human property. For us today \\"all men are created equal\\" is a statement of truth provided we all have a level playing field. But for many southern whites at the time this was hard to swallow. In an aristocratic agrarian society, some men are just superior to others. And in the Antebellum South, just below poor whites were blacks. This was the way things were in their society for over two hundred years and the Civil War didn't suddenly end that sentiment among the many. But for Twain to write of a kind of comradeship between a slave and a young white boy was definitely progressive.Maybe Twain was hoping to reach a young generation raised by their bitter parents and discover that they could have friendships with blacks and not succumb to an entrenching separatist animosity that developed into the Jim Crow Era. Huck and Jim work together in schemes and have fun. This friendship (which is why Huck decides to do what he does on the journey) is what Twain emphasized in the journey down river. This was counter to the way whites were acting with and around blacks at the time (1880s).I think it's clear based on a certain reading of the novel that Twain believed whites and blacks could and should get along. While today it may not be seen as \\"progressive\\", it was when it was first published."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Everyone should read or re-read this classic. Most of us read it in school, probabaly not in its entirety. Schools struggled then and now with the use of the N word, although teenage boys in the 1830's clearly would never have heard a synonym.These adventures are a classic. The royals were a hoot, how many failed fraudulent enterprises could they invent before the inevitable tar and feathering. Huck and Jim are on the run from an abusive father and the law, respectively, and Twain shows all people have a great deal in common, in spite of theories prevalent in the antebellum era.I'm not sure why Tom Sawyer needs to show up to conclude this thing. The ending could work without him, maybe Twain not sure that Finn could carry the book or film alone."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huckleberry Finn is a classic. Simple as that. It provides a look into what life was probably like for a 19th century boy. It was different than the life of children today, because today life centers around education. Back then, it was a regular thing to play hooky, even though they got in trouble for it when they were caught. And when they were punished, usually it was with a beating instead of \`You're Grounded!'.The book shows us how badly slaves were treated. They weren't even considered humans! It was like they didn't have feelings, and didn't see things the same way white people did. They way the slaves actually did think was odd. It was sad to see that they could slap a slave for no reason, and the slave would accept it either because they were used to it or they thought that whites were better than them.Huck Finn is rather unrealistic in the aspect of adventure. I'm guessing most boys back then didn't run off with an escaped slave to Cairo. The way that Mark Twain wrote the book was different than other first/second person books I've seen. The dialogue was very much like the 19th century southern Mississippi talk. Sometimes it got hard to decipher what a paragraph in slave-speak meant because it was so obscure.All in all, Mark Twain's writing style is different than the traditional Southern book, but that doesn't detract at all from the story. I liked it!"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is an excellent, easy read that shows the adventures of a young southern boy running away from home and learning a little about himself in the process. Huck, adopted by two widows who try to \\"civilize\\" him, does not like it and runs away with Jim, one of the widows' slave. They escape and travel up the Mississippi river to the \\"free state\\", encountering many adventures along the way. Huck realizes more and more along the way that Jim is \\"white\\" on the inside.I enjoyed this book because it shows Huck, who is being forced to be civilized by society, rebelling because he finds that society has some moral imperfections that are being forced upon him. Jim becomes a father figure to Huck throughout the adventures and is not a servant, which is what society has taught Huck. For example, when Jim doesn't let Huck see the dead man's face in the house floating down the river, it shows us that Jim really cares for Huck and takes responsibility for his protection. In turn to Jim's father-like figure to Huck, Huck takes responsibility to make sure Jim becomes a free man because Huck knows how good of a person Jim really is.This book is a must read for anybody and can teach everyone a little bit about learning who a person really is and not listening to what society has prejudged someone to be. I really enjoyed the gripping adventures Huck goes through and the revelations he has about the prejudiced ways of society."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I was disappointed after reading this story. Of course the message is important and Mark Twain is a talented writer, no one can deny that. However I found it difficult to read this book with the dialoge and the plot wasn't really holding my attention."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is about a boy named Huck who lives in Missouri in the 1930's where and when slavery is allowed. He has been brought up around slaves and sees slavery as being an acceptable practice because he has never really seen what goes on behind the scenes and how blacks are really treated in the United State at the time. One day Huck decides to escape from the madness of his family and abusive father, fakes his own death, and runs away. Jim, a slave friend of Huck's is blamed for the murder and runs away from the chaos of the town's reaction. Jim and Huck run into each other while being on the run early on and decided to stick together and go down the river together. A part of the reason why they decide to stick together is because Huck decides he wants to free Jim. They encounter different obstacles and adventures along the way. Through their friendship they hope to make it down the river safely together and in one piece in hopes of giving Jim the freedom he deserves and Huck is just in it for the independence and the love of being on his own with no worries or people not letting him do what he wants to do. Huck and Jim also experience many things along the way down the river and run into other people who help them with their journey and other who try to stop it. They get a better picture of how slaves are actually treated in the south and both are shocked by the mistreatment. Seeing this mistreatment of slaves and talking to a few slaves about their situations pushes Huck and Jim to try even harder at making it down the river safely and freeing Jim once and for all.The main theme of this book is friendship and compassion. Through friendship and compassion Huck and Jim go on this incredible adventure together and with compassion and care for one another they look after each other and both want the best possible outcome and result for each other. Major issues in the book include seeing slaves being mistreated, death of friends, and evading capture by the people after Huck and Jim. The style of writing is certainly an interesting one and at times I got frustrated with the way the author presented the story and how Huck and Jim talk. Both are semi-illiterate and say things in a different way then one would say things now and how one would say things correctly at the time. The \`N\\" word is used constantly throughout the book but it makes sense because it was used commonly and throughout the nation by many at this time. While it's not acceptable to be used nowadays, it was more acceptable back then. The author's description of the characters and the south makes the story an excellent one. The detail and description the author provides and even how he present the dialogue makes you feel like you are right there alongside Huck and Jim on a raft sailing down the Mississippi River. I personally think that anyone would enjoy this book and it's definitely a true American classic. Twain is a genius and this story certainly proves that. The man knows how to write ad good story that will make people think and feel for the characters and situations in the book.JLind555 says this book is a controversial masterpiece and I would have to agree with them because while it is in fact controversial with the subject matter of the book it is a masterpiece because of the overall story and how everyone who reads it gets something out of it. Justin Evans claims the book is one that is not meant for everyone, but that everybody should read it. I have to agree with this point too because it certainly isn't for everybody. Some people may not be able to handle some parts of this book, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't read it because they will learn many things from this book. Tessa says this book is dragged out and boring and while it wasn't the most exciting book in the world the entire time, it wasn't boring at all. This book is full of constant action and adventure and I don't see how anybody can claim a book like this is boring. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and could see myself reading it over and over because of it's positive message and story. I give this book five stars."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" by Mark Twain is an absolute must read.

This is an amazing story full of adventure and fun.But of course, you will find the way the characters speak is either annoying or downright confusing. But remember this takes place in the past! It was normal for people to talk like that. Also you think this book is not good because the use of the N word in describing Jim. Although use of that word is offensive and insensitive now, it was not like that in those days. And most of the young boys of the south spoke in such a manner then.

Neither of those choices sounds very appealing but Huck didn't have any choice except to run away.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a fictional story by Mark Twain. Twain also wrote The Adventures of Tom Sawyer which I recommend that you read before reading this because you wouldn't understand some of the parts if you didn't read it.Huck is not exactly a normal kid, sometimes he goes to school but sometimes he doesn't. He lives with either his father or Widow Douglas. He is not school smart but when it comes to survival he knows exactly how to stay alive when he is alone with no food or anything. He knows how to fish, makes rafts, start fires and can hunt fairly well. His father abuses him often but Huck seems to stay with him until he couldn't stand it anymore.Huck was living with Widow Douglas when his father took (it seemed like kidnapped) him away to an island where there was no one there. His father takes Huck's money and buys whiskey or other alcoholic beverages and gets drunk and beats Huck for no reason. Huck couldn't stand it anymore so one night when his father went to town and got drunk he sawed his way out of the cabin(which he was locked in) and then the real adventure began. I would definitely recommend this book. Its fun to read and nearly impossible to put down. If you like adventurous books about kids our age than you would probably enjoy reading this book.I had read a couple of Mark Twain's books and I have enjoyed each one. Reading this book made me want to read even more books from this talented author."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This book has been called racist from the very begining and still is banned in many schools today for it's \\"racist\\" content. My school system believes that to. So I went to get a copy because everyone said it was so better than Tom Sawyer which was what I was reading at the time.It really, truly is.This is agreat book not only for it's numerous metaphors, but for it's evolution of it's characters. Huck and Jim are extremly passionate about their beliefs and grow on eachother so much that Huck would rather \\"go to hell\\" than see Jim back in slavery. Even though that is the main plot, two other characters play a pivitol part in the story. The are the king and the duke. At first they seem like greedy but harmless con-men but as they stay whith Huck and Jim for a while we see from Huck's view how evil and greedy people can be. It is sort of sad to see this plotline not really remembered well, becaus it is very interesting.So who is the main villian in the story? Not the king and the duke, but the system of slavery. And because of that Huck and every other white person in the book calls slaves \\"niggers\\" without any thought of remorse. Is this a racist book that uses terrible language and metaphors that try to make black people look ignorant and evil?No.This book shows a point of view in a time that we can somewhat relate to. It's unfortunate that this book is pushed away by hasty critism and is not allowed to be read is some public schools because this doesn't only make observe an age in time. It Makes You Live It."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I agree with the reviewers who say that this is the best of American literature. This is the only book that I read from cover to cover when I was in high school. I'd start all the other required classics and would just get bored out of my mind. I was supposed to read it again in college, and I did read it again, even though I knew I could've passed the test without doing so. Huckleberry Finn was different because it was about a kid who thought more the way I did and acted the way I would have liked to, most of the time anyway. That's what made it great for me. Most of the characters and thinking described in this book are timeless, for good and bad reasons, and that goes a long way in making the book great literature.If you want to read more by Mark Twain, I recommend checking out A Conneticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, and Roughing It."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it's one of the few that we've read in english class that has intrigued me to keep reading and find out what happens next. I really thought it lived up to it's classic stature and deserves to be hailed as one of the best. I think that it is going overboard to have ever banned this book, and was almost an unintelligent move. In the book Mark Twain shows how rediculous the prejudices and racism was and how a young boy is able to see through it, while the use of the word nigger is simply added for accuracy, not vulgarity."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This was an Excellent story of heroism and courage.

Yeah sure, Huck's best friend is a runaway slave, but what are we to make of the fact that Jim is given virtually no voice in the novel? There's something unmistakably childlike (and I don't mean that positively) about Jim; he is hardly a fully-drawn adult character. Twain's views on race are defined in part by the time in which he wrote, but then isn't that true for all of us? The last time I discussed this book in a group, it provoked such debate the person across the room threw his copy at me. Maybe that alone is reason enough to read it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Reading this book makes you feel like your floating all the days by, down the Mississippi. Twain is amazing as he paints such a great picture of the time and life of Huck Finn. Even when Huck was one of the richest kids in town it didn't matter. Money wasn't an issue. Freedom was. It was everything. He hated having to have manners and having to comb his hair in the morning. His new found life bored him.

(The cover seemed a little boring).The main character in this story is Huckleberry Finn. He has a pretty sad life because he doesn't live with his parents. His father who is abusive beats him up. Although Huckleberry is a troublemaker and a \\"bad boy\\", I think he has a good heart. He is a wreckless boy who seems to like adventure and likes to observe the world. I also think that he lacks good judgements, but he means well.I do not particularly enjoy this book because it is very long and boring. It uses too many confusing words and it is difficult to understand. Although this story is adventurous, it doesn't meet the needs I required for this book. It took me a very long time to understand what was going on in this book. Also, I don't really like stories that revolves around the 1800's. They don't do any interesting things and the way they talk is so vulgar."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mr.poppers penguins is a very good book. It is very funny.

Huck is a horrible character and is emotionally mute, except for the occasional \\"doing something good for someone else\\", he has opinions, they're just not strong. Compared to Holden from Catcher in the Rye, Huck is a character who lacks substance. Huck's adventures along the Mississippi River with an escape slave Jim are very unbelievable. On these adventures Huck encounters many people that Mark Twain wants the reader to see how awful these people are, leaving Huck Finn at the end of the book not liking people. The characters are occasionally funny and thought provoking. Mark Twain uses this book to look at human nature unlike Tom Sayer which is a children's book. Mark Twain also uses alot of symbolism in the book, so half of the book is understanding and noticing the symbolism."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"An American classic, a literary work of art, these are just a couple of things that you hear about, Mark Twain's; The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This novel takes place in the late 1800's on the Mississippi river, with a young run away boy, Huckleberry Finn, and his runaway slave friend Jim. The novel takes you on their journey down the Mississippi, where the two endure many triumphs and tribulations. In the midst of Huck and Jim's struggles, a friendship between them develops. At the end Huck and Jim are caught, only to find that Jim was set free months earlier by his owner. Before this happens though Tom Sawyer comes back into the picture and Huckleberry Finn once again follows Tom into a dangerous scheme that almost gets them killed and puts Jim through hell.In my opinion I would not call this novel a work of art, for sure! It is a fantastic story and really keeps the reader's attention. Then it ends, and sucks! The whole last three chapters of this book had me so angry. Jim gets caught and Huck is going to try to get him free but in the process meets up with his very self involved, immature friend, Tom. Tom then comes up with this outrageous scheme to brake Jim out. Instead of putting his foot down and freeing Jim, Huck goes along with Tom's plan. The plan not only makes a total fool of Jim, but almost gets both the boys killed. The novel takes you through this journey and you see Huck and Jim becoming friends, maturing with each other and learning acceptance. Then comes the ending where Huck morphs back into this careless boy who is trying to JUST free a slave for fun. Twain shows you how Huck matures throughout the book, just for him regress back to a follower. It makes no sense to me. How can a person go through this wonderful journey with another and form this bond just to throw it away in an instant. It's like Twain just gave up at the end, like he took the easy way out. Maybe he had writer's cramp, I really don't know. I do know that in my opinion this book gets huge thumbs down.Anita"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Mark Twain's &quot;Adventures of Huck Finn&quot; is a series of scathing social commentaries about America of the mid-nineteenth century, barely covered with a minimalist plot. The reader must be forewarned that this Twain's work is drastically different from the high adventure of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;. The reader must also be ready to grapple with the Huck's bad spelling (since the entire book is narrated from his naive perspective) and the partway-comprehensible colloquial of the dialog. In my personal experience, the book ranges from mildly engaging during the cynical criticisms, to slow as tar during the &quot;action sequences&quot; (although the action sequences are in themselves criticisms, but the humor factor isn't sufficient to overshadow the action).The plot is paper-thin, and on its own leads virtually nowhere. It mostly consists of Huck and Jim ( a runaway slave) floating down the Mississippi on a raft. This journey quickly loses its point - the pair floats past the free states and just keeps going on. Nevertheless, this premise manages to propel the reader from one parody to the next with a measure of success. The social commentaries themselves are fairly original in content and in that they fit the situations well, but the reader does eventually tire of stupid, drunken, and easily-fooled villagers and the monotonous charlatans and vigilantes that populate the book's pages. An unexciting, although insightful read."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Though it may be considered a classic novel, timeless and forever enchanting, I found myself angered as I was forced to read this book for my english class. I can understand why many rave about Twain...he captured a popular American literature style for the time period. I, however, am not a supporter of his simple vocabulary and sentence structure. Twain avoided \\"flowery\\" words, instead using words that an elementary student would use. I also understood how he wrote using a character's dialogue,but I still detested every moment of it. Reading Jim's part was like wading through quicksand, and sometimes I found myself sinking to a point I never thought I would get out of.Also, I found myself disliking the popular character Tom Sawyer. I didn't find him the least bit charming, and I really felt that he was quite the illogical, egotistical little prat. I can say that I did quite like Huck Finn, even if reading his narration was barely short of torture.I often enjoy classic novels, but I can assure you that I will never read a Twain novel again. The only reason I gave this book as much as two stars was simply because I almost enjoyed hating it, because some of it humored me so."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"There were a lot of weird mistakes/typos in the publication.

As I fisrt opened up the book I was so so curious about reading the novel because it had so many interesting things that appeared on the front cover of the book. The cover of the book seemed to be a catching title so I decided to read the book and check it out becausse mostly all my friends have read this book and asked them what the book was about they said it was a cool book so now I decided to read it.The first chapter was interesting it was about Mark he found six thousand dollars a piece in a cave and he gave the money to judge Thatcher and so the judge gave him back n his friend a dollar piece everyday for interest. Tom and his friend seemed trouble for towards this. Tom and Mark seemed to be very enthusiastic about hanging around together.I thought the first few chapters were very catching and appealing towards others. But asI kept at it reading the book I found a lot bias surrounding the book. I couldn't believe this there was so much hate and foul language in the book. My thoughts towards the book began to dread away.A book title can describe a thousand words but when siting down and reading the book I found that the book was totaly out of my league to read I was so astonished by the language that was being used and expressed at others. I hope that I will never ever find a book this upseting and full of rubbish language."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This classic was truly a disappointment in my eyes, because not only was the storyline chopped up and completely random, Twain's writing style made me put my book down at numeriosu times throughout the book, unable to fathom why anyone would want to go through the same pain and suffering as i did.The first thing you notice about the novel is that loosely related events follow one after another, in such randomness that I spent half the time not reading, but deciphering the \\"code\\". set in the late 1800s, this book does give a somewhat accurate view of southern society and segregation, as portrayed by Jim. That's where the good stuff ends, i'm afraid. Twain's writing style makes this almost impossible to read, by including either an overabundance of detailed description or none at all, thereby making this almost like a fun puzzle, in which you try to piece the different parts together without any instruction. Twain surely does not assist the reader in understanding what he has to say, but instead, makes everything utterly unfathomable."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I dont really like this book because lets face it, it needs some more spice.

This book is a big waste of time, it should be out-lawed from our schools, because Twain likes to use the &quot;N&quot; word a lot.

There is more to this book than than a simple story of a boy and a man floating down the river in a raft.What I loved about this reading of Huck Finn is that we were also to read Toni Morrison's Introduction to it. It was through this Introduction that I was able to see the story in a completely new light - and to understand just what was so \\"wonderfully troubling\\" about it.Morrison talks a lot about silence in the book - the silence in those moments of floating down the river, the silence with regard to learning much of anything about Jim's family, the silence with which Huck treats his friendship with Tom. Then there's the silence of Jim toward Huck - why did he fail to disclose who that man was under the cloth?This is an extraordinarily troubling book, but yes.. a wonderful one as well. It's enlightening - it shows how hard the struggle was to accept the idea that a human is a human, no matter his or her skin color. It's educational, it reminds us of where we've come from in an effort to remind us of where we should not return. It's captured history through the dialect of Jim. It's a look at two individuals escaping slavery - Jim the actual slavery, and Huck, escaping abuse at the hand of his father.I always recommend these books. Tom Sawyer is more suited to younger audiences (although I personally find Tom to be a scoundrel), but Huck Finn is a must read for teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is one of the best books of its epoch!

Huck escapes from his fathers iron grip into the woods where he is faced with the difficult choice of befriending a slave or turning him in. The two traveling mates go down the river and work together to survive and they become extremely close. The relationship that grows throught the novel between Huck and Jim stands out in my mind. I like the part where Huck realises how much Jim means tohim and even if it means he may go to jail he will do it to save Jim. This reminds me of ignorance and how people teach their kids ignorance, but that child can still rise above and make better judgments on their own. I think that the moral is important. The fact that a child can realise and judge right from wrong better than their parents with their pure mind shows that ignorance can be stopped and racial equality can be spread. I did not like the part where \\"the king\\" sells Jim so that he can have money for alcohol. The author's message is that racism is cruel and unjust and everyone deserves a clean slate to be judged on personal qualities and actions not skin tone.

The original text and word choice remain intact; Twain's masterpiece hasn't been altered in this version. The layout is also excellent, you won't find the strange spacing or distortion of alignment that you find in some of the Kindle versions of classics. The price is perfect and the product is fantastic.As for the book, I find the novel to be extremely well written, but also a little dated. Twain is most definitely hilarious, and his characterization is top notch. His control of local dialect, and his ability to portray this effectively on the page, is without any peers. Huck's examination of his surroundings and his own thoughts on everything that happens to him is interesting and heartwarming. However, I feel that a lot of the satire is no longer as powerful as it was when the novel was written. Satire works best when the general population is \\"in the moment\\" of whatever the subject matter may be. Huck's struggle to follow his heart, while his understanding of morality in his pre-Civil War society tells him it would be immoral, is a little harder to relate to in this day and age. Twain was a master, but I feel that a novel like \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" holds up a little better.

Those who made said decisions clearly strained at a gnat and choked on twelve camels.A favorite quote of mine comes from dear Huck:\\"And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me, all the time, in the day, and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a floating along, talking, and singing, and laughing. But somehow I couldn't seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I'd see him standing my watch on top of hisn, stead of calling me -- so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me, and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the only one he's got now; and then I happened to look around, and see that paper.It was a close place. I took [the letter:] up, and held it in my hand. I was a trembling, because I'd got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it.

But, I dare say we have to give Twain credit for the time period he was writing in and just what things were like back then. Essentially, he was making a political statement by writing this book. Whether we agree with him or not, we have to agree this novel is a piece of art. The way he uses literary style such as dialect and tone is just amazing. He also gives us a far deeper understanding and grasp of African American culture at this time, furthermore allowing us to appreciate what they endured. Twain brilliantly wrote about a boy who saw the world through non-racial eyes, he was not partial to whites or blacks, he associated with everyone. This concept is one I believe everyone should value because it is still something our society struggles with today. Twain had a grasp on what it means to love your neighbor, no matter what color they are. This book is amazing and brilliantly written, full of values that should be passed on for a long time. Although Twain is long gone, his essence and understanding of how the world should be is still very much alive."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"In this follow up to his classic about Tom Sawyer, Mark Twain focuses on Huckleberry Finn. The book has only the loosest of plots. The beginning follows Huck as he tries to adjust to being \\"civilized\\" and then tricks his abusive pappy into think he's dead.The book really gets rolling when Huck and runaway slave Jim take to the raft down the Mississippi River. Even then, it's episodic in nature as they get caught up in a feud and harbor two conmen, the King and the Duke. In the final part of the novel, Tom Sawyer makes a reappearance and helps Huck free Jim, who is being held as a runaway slave.Honestly, that last \\"episode\\" is my favorite in the book. It's so funny watching Tom make things ten times as complicated as needed since he wants to make this a grand adventure. I love it.This book has always captured my imagination more than the first with these characters, probably because I love the idea of rafting down the Mississippi. It's a classic adventure that appeals to the boy in me. I freely admit the episodic nature of the plot makes for an uneven read.Also problematic is the dialect writing. Huck narrates this book first person, and his schooling isn't the best, so the grammar reflects that. It's nothing compared to the poor grammar and written accents of some of the other characters, most noticeably Jim. There are times it's almost impossible to understand what is being \\"said.\\"This book often gets challenged and even banned because Twain uses the \\"N\\" word to talk about Jim and the other slaves. Considering when the book was set (before the Civil War) and written (1870's), that was the \\"correct\\" term to use. I challenge you to read beyond that because what you'll find is that Twain was trying to challenge the views of his day. Jim is the best character, and Huck's growth as a character comes from recognizing Jim as a fellow human being.This is still a fun read that holds a place as a classic of American literature. It's not often you find that combination."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I'm sure you all remember from your youthful days of yore (always wanted to say that) the colorful story of Mark Twain's, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. I thought I remembered it, albeit I was a bit rusty on the story. My current memories mostly brought on by the clips in Easy A where Olive discusses how it's not truly relevant to our time period because she can't remember any white guy running off with some \\"huge honking black guy\\". However, at the end of said movie, Olive apologizes to our dearest Mark Twain because that is precisely what happens which is where I laughed hysterically.Now, although this really has nothing to do with my review, I still found it funny. However, to get back on topic, I was asked to review this audiobook in exchange for my honest review, so here is what I've got.I loved it. I'm not much of an audiobook fan because I feel that it renders the speaking narrator as the permanent voice in my head for the written narrator of the book. This becomes annoying because much of the time I find audiobook narrators to definitely NOT fit the character they are portraying. My first introduction to audiobookism would be my mother playing Twilight in the car as we drove to Las Vegas to see my sister. I must say, that I found the narrator chosen for that book horribly dull and bland with no inflections that gave Bella Swan any good characterization, as in my head, she had always had. Many of you may debate this, as I know so many people to feel Bella is as bland as the chosen narrator made her.Nonetheless, Elijah Wood, has given me no such qualms, in fact he has done an amazing job at giving credibility to audiobooks everywhere. I do not say this lightly. But, with Elijah Wood at the helm of Mark Twain's adventurous masterpiece, I felt like I was really listening to Huck Finn tell me the story of his exploratory travels on the Mississippi River. Not only did he hit Huck Finn's voice on the dot he also was amazing when it came to Jim, the runaway slave. I really believed there were two different voices participating in the mesmerizing tale.It made me fall for the characters in an entirely different way than if I would have read it. Mark Twain's English isn't quite the English of today and I felt that Wood gave it a feeling and a loveliness that my own brain probably wouldn't have.The only complaint I have with the audiobook is not against this audiobook in particular, but the same complaint I have for all audiobooks everywhere...they take so much time to listen to. A book that would normally take me five hours to read (or less) takes a good ten to listen to on audio. However, the magnificence of technology today allowed me to download, from audible.com, directly onto my Kindle. How freaking awesome is that!!!!!!!!! (It needs more exclamation points still!!!)So, in conclusion, I recommend this audiobook to anyone who wants to feel like they are traveling along the Mississippi with Huckleberry Finn and Jim. The experience for me was overly enjoyable. Elijah Wood definitely gives it the feel it deserves and makes me believe in Huck's antic's over and over again."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Huckleberry Finn was a great literary work published in 1885 and written by Mark Twain. One of the most positive things about the book would be that the reading level is not very advanced and that it shows us a glimpse of the past. Along with the reading level not being very advanced, the book itself is extremely well thought out, and brings the stories, characters, and imagery to life. One of the negatives is the amount of cursing that takes place throughout the book. This is a negative because it is at a children's reading level and it does not add any literary value to the book as a piece of history. The ugly but I believe necessary part of the book is the use of the n-word. This is a necessary part of the book because it shows to our children and everyone the meaning behind the word. If anything it makes the reader more understanding of the troubles that the slaves when though and understand the meaning of the word a little more deeply."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"My intent was to purchase this book for my daughter. HA! When it came in, I read it, again. Maybe 3 times in my life so far. It majestically captures the way it really was on the grand ol' Mississippi River in the mid 19th century. The writing is aimed at an audience more experienced than say Tom Sawyer. We claim to have not found yet the great American novel, but, this comes close. This ought to be in every reader's library, school and public libraries, and, I'd argue, it ought to be considered an essential element in American English Literature classes. I give everything a grade, which is a solid, \\"A\\". It is controversial for many folks who read it. It is, however, accurate in its portrayal of life at that time."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"There is nothing like a great narator, and Tom Parker is one, to tell this great tale.Mr. Parker's voice sounds just the way I believe Mark Twain would have told it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Can't believe it took me so long to get around to reading this book, because it's fantastic, and one of the best summer reads. It's very deep - exploring the old American west (now known as the American south, along the Mississipi River valley), and the people, places, and goings-ons, through the brave eyes of a young (essentially) innocent - while being just plain fun. It is dated, but that's part of its charm - the language is rustic, the children are freer, the people more trustworthy, and the river was a little wider, the heat a little hotter. A real piece of old Americana."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"My 7 year old grandson loves this book, he and his parents are reading a chapter every night. The old-timey language is making it slightly harder for him to get through the story line with ease, however he is fascinated with the story of Huckleberry Finn. I am sure others his age will enjoy this book as well.Reviewed by a loyal Amazon customer."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Monumental and fluid, Mark Twain offers this first-person narrative through a young American boy named Huckleberry Finn whose epic journey down the Mississippi River during the slavery era of the south leads him to a greater understanding of human nature and of the blinding misconceptions of prejudice in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Running Press, 238 pages). The escapade takes Huck through a compelling series of events which relentlessly test his will, morals and conviction. Ravaged by inner-turmoil, he is constantly battling with himself over what his heart tells him to do versus what society tells him to do. The recurring theme of right versus wrong in Huck's eyes is evident with almost all of the acquaintances and relationships he has in this captivating, revealing classic.When encountering a novel it usually takes the reader a few chapters to get into the flow of the book; this is not the case in Twain's artful masterpiece. From the first chapter to the last, the novel keeps its momentum and Twain never bores the reader by slowing down the pace of the story. The plot does not become bogged-down or dull, like so many pieces of literature tend to. Huck's revelations as the story progresses regarding the black race are inspiring and even his view of the white race after spending an extended period of time with the dauphin and the duke show a side of Huck which society did not breed. Twain uses slavery, education and the hypocrisy of society as clear themes which illuminate Huck's true feelings. His intellectual state at the conclusion of the novel is far superior to what it was at the beginning and it serves to demonstrate the profound impact the voyage had on his attitude toward the human race."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is possibly the best book ever written by an American author. I enjoy reading on the computer monitor so this is a joy."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"Believe it or not, I had actually never read The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn before. I'd obviously read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, but not this sequel, narrated from Huck's point of view. Much of the book deals with a trip that Huck and Jim take down the Mississippi River. It's interesting, because they're bound for the North, but they end up going into the Deep South, the heart of slave country. Along the way, they meet with all sorts of people and encounter all sorts of mishaps.Huck narrates in his own voice, so it's very ungrammatical. But he's surprisingly smart; he learns how to read at the beginning of the book, and he has a lot more sense than Jim does in certain areas. And even though he is pretty uneducated, he's street smart (or shall we say river smart?) It's kind of funny, because a lot of times Huck misunderstands things. Like, at one point he says \\"I had learned all of my times tables to six times seven is thirty-five\\". Another time, he thinks the dauphin is the \\"dolphin\\", and that valet is \\"valley\\".At first, the life the two of them lead seems idyllic: floating down the river in a raft, doing whatever they want, frying fish for dinner. But it's not really. They encounter all sorts of strange things.I liked the section where they meet up with two con men, who claim to be an exiled duke and the exiled dauphin of France. They pull off all sorts of cons, and make a whole bunch of money. It was amusing, though obviously the men are criminals, and do a lot of shady things, and are eventually revealed to be pretty nasty people.The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has a lot of humor in it and a great narrative voice. It is an interesting classic, though not one of my favorites, and (at least for me), not quite as good as The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.[...]"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"You know the story and the reader of this does a very nice job.

I found it to be interesting and hard to lay down.

Thanks for making it available for Kendle."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"\\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" is a piece of classic literature about a misbehaved twelve year old boy who fakes his own murder in order to get away from his town as well as his abusive father. He meets up with a runaway slave named Jim and they travel down the Mississippi river on a raft. Along the way, they stop at numerous towns and get into difficult situations but always end up alright in the end.I liked this book because it was never dull and always had something new to keep me interested. There were so many different stories within the book that I was never bored. I didn't like how whenever an uneducated person would speak in the story, the words would be written as they were supposed to speak them. This made the text difficult to read and I think Mark Twain could have used this method less if not at all.One major message in this book was loyalty. The dedication Huckleberry and Jim had for each other was a huge part of the story. Early in the book Huck has problems with the \\"immorality\\" of stealing a slave form a poor old widow . However, as time passes Huckleberry says that he would rather go to hell than return Jim to slavery. They never left each other even though there were many times when it would have been easy to do so. When Jim was captured, Huck stayed in the town, lying about his identity until he could find a way to free Jim once more. Jim gave up his own freedom at one point to help Huck. They really cared for each other in this book.People should read this book because it was entertaining and fun. It was a really cute story I would definitely recommend it. It gives perspective on what life was like in the south during this time as well. It had historical facts and displayed the attitudes of the people who lived there.If someone liked this book, they might also like Tom Sawyer or any other book Mark Twain wrote. Overall, I would rate this book as being an eight out of ten. It was very good and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is Mark Twain's masterpiece.

These stories inspired me to writeChase The Wild Pigeons: A novel of the Civil War."},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"This is not a review of Mark Twain's classic American novel. Rather, it is a review of the Dover Publications hardcover edition.After years of buying copies of the Bantam Classic paperback edition for use in the classroom, and then buying new copies every few years to replace them; it made sense to upgrade to a hardcover edition.While Dover Publications is known for it's economically priced paperbacks, this is a durable hardcover alternative. The binding is stitched and glued. A heavy binders board is used with a clothbound cover. It uses a heavy stock paper. All 174 of E.W. Kemble's original illustrations are reproduced. And an easy to read 12 point serif type is used.This is an unabridged republication of the 1885 edition published by Charles L. Webster and Co. (The publishing house founded by Mark Twain in 1884.) When I first purchased these five years ago, I paid only ten dollars per copy. (The current Bantam paperback is $5.95.) While this was several times what the Bantam paperback cost at the time, it more than makes up for it in endurance. Five years on, my copies are still in near mint condition.This is a novel that every student should read before graduating from high school, and this edition makes an excellent version to choose. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Huckleberry Finn,","review":"I am not reviewing Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn.I am reviewing this version: The Modern Library Classics with an introduction by George Saunders.I really appreciated both Mr. Saunders introduction as well as the excerpts from several different commentaries at the end. I am not reading this book with a reading group or with a class; I read it on my own for the first time as an adult. And I really enjoyed interacting with the introduction and the commentaries after I had read it. It helped me sort through some of my own mixed feelings about what I had just read/experienced.The introduction is a spoiler (a pet peeve of mine!) so don't read it if you haven't read the novel before.I think it is unabridged but I do not see that word anywhere and I have not checked it with any other versions.There are no text notes. I'm not sure if other versions have text notes. Sometimes I had to look things up online to figure out what Twain/Huck was meaning (ex: wigwam, tow-head, etc.). This novel is getting far enough removed from the current day that before too long text notes will become essential...perhaps other versions already have them. But not this one.So, if you're trying to decide what version to buy, I would recommend this one because of the scholarship that is included with it.

An adventure story, it also deals (usually obliquely) with a lot of social, moral, and cultural issues, including (most obviously) issues of race. Twain's use of the \\"N\\" word is startling and disturbing to modern ears, but it is essential to convey the import.I remember that when I first read it, I didn't like the last few chapters very much...and I still don't. Quite unlike the first 2/3s of the book, they seem to me to be a cop-out on Twain's part.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"From reading the readers' responses, I believe that this classic is still too subtle and complex to be appreciated by most. I consider myself an expert on the subject, having read and reread literally everything Chopin wrote. The most common misconception is that Chopin is holding up Edna as some kind of role model, when it's clear that, although she has many redeemable attributes, Edna is self-absorbed and blinded by her Romanticism. As a sociable widow who by all accounts was a devoted wife and mother, Chopin is a woman who found happiness in her art and in her family--as do Mlle. Reisz and Mme. Ratingolle, respectively.Chopin is not a moralistic writer; thus, her great novel defies easy categorization. It is a mistake to read the novel as a feminist manifesto. It's an exquisite local color tale that tackles the big questions, without ever being preachy."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"I read The Awakening in college for the first time. It changed the way I looked at things, the way I judged people. It is a deeply moving book, fascinating and engulfing the reader with every line. Some may find it disturbing, but reality is just that. I lived Edna's experiences in real life: my own. I got married at far too young an age, met another man, divorced my husband, and left my three children (all under 7 years of age at the time) with her ex-husband (an wonderful, loving father), moved out of state, and barely spoke to my children for 7 years. I often considered suicide. The depth of sadness I reached is not easily related to anyone who hasn't felt it. So you see this story is just a reflection of a real possibility in life. This is the story of a woman who made those life choices which are so different from those made by most women in our society. Usually it's the men who zip their pants up and leave. It's just a slice of reality that some people accept and others don't. By the grace of God, I am now reunited via phone, letters, email, and yearly trips visiting with my three beautiful children, now 18, 16 and 14. I remarried and had a precious baby who is now almost 6 years old. Thank God that all my children and I can heal together now. Through all this, I can see and feel how real the character and emotional qualities and depth of Edna are in Chopin's book. Kate Chopin opened up the world of Edna Pontellier to us with such adeptness and grace, that I am in awe of her. Such amazing skill is required to portray and communicate something so real."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

The opening description of the resort and Loisiana were wonderfully lush - beautiful simple language.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"This was beautiful; the kind of book that makes you realize just how much more powerful fiction is when there is so much you cannot say and have to use every creative fiber to express yourself. I'd heard all kinds of things about The Awakening before reading it, since it was controversial at the time of publication in 1899 and has been elevated to a cult classic of sorts. It's even more stunning when you realize WHY it was so controversial. Since the synopsis indicates that it's about a married woman who desires another, younger man she meets at a summer resort, I thought it would be along the lines of Lawrence - and The Awakening is often spoken of in the same breath as Lady Chatterley's Lover - and there would be all the imagery and language issues you'd assume would come with a story like this and that association, but that's not it at all. There's not a single forbidden word or scandalous passage. It's more like a long dream sequence or a Bronte poem, so beautifully told it's like music for the heart and eyes. That sounds trite but I truly was moved by Chopin's sparing and lyrical use of language. That kind of artistry is a reminder of why I love reading. There are so many poor and mediocre books out there that I almost forget sometimes what it's like to experience the joy of truly brilliant writing.Edna's attraction to Robert may be the catalyst - the \`awakening' of the title - but actually just marks the dawning of a new overall awareness in herself, and it becomes much more complex than the mere appeal of another man. Rather, she comes to realize that she is not fully living life; that she's not entirely sure who she is, and feels stifled by society and its expectations. She has an intense, painful longing to free herself. The fact that the discontent of a fictional female character was such a topic of scandal is, to me, the most telling. Obviously nobody in those days wanted to hear, even in fiction, that a privileged wife and mother might be dissatisfied with her life and want more; that she might harbor passions and undercurrents of feeling not befitting a proper lady of society, and that she might actually attempt to discard what is false or unsatisfying and be true to herself.I disliked the way it ended, which I won't give away. I see why the author took it there, I suppose. It's worth noting, too, that Kate Chopin had up to that point been a fairly distinguished writer in American literary circles, but was figuratively cast out after the publication of this book and died in near-poverty and obscurity. It was apparently a topic the masses just weren't ready for at the time."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"I'd never read Kate Chopin before, but The Awakening seemed like a good place to start. The premise of this book seemed interesting. Set in turn-of-the-century New Orleans, this classic tale tells the story of Edna Pontellier, a proper wife and mother who lives a rather passionless life with her husband in a cottage near the beach. She becomes rather aware of herself and that there has to be more to life than what she has experienced. And so, she experiences a sexual awakening when she has an affair with a younger, unmarried man. And that is just the beginning of her journey, which includes getting rid of her husband and children to continue on her route to self-discovery. But will she find happiness in a world where women are oppressed and an uninhibited nature is considered wrong?The most interesting part about this novel is that life sort of imitated art. Edna has a sort of tragic ending in this novel, and so does Chopin in some way. I read in the foreword that this book was banned when it was first published in 1899 and that Chopin's reputation was ruined as a result of writing this. She was ostracized and her writing career came to a screeching halt. Little did Chopin and others know that this would become a classic, a prime example of the beginning of the women's movement and the beginning of literature in the form of women's erotica, which is now so popular there are several imprints devoted to sensual stories written by women for women. I loved reading this book because Edna's transition is slow and realistic, no abrupt changes here, and the sexual tension is almost palpable. This novel sort of reminds me of D.H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover and it also has some similarities with Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary. But The Awakening is a classic in its own right and I'm glad I gave it a whirl. I've been rereading classics like crazy as of late and it was refreshing to read this one for the first time. I recommend it to fans of unique Victorian literature."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"We read this book for high school english class. Although it was written beautifully, and at times i could sympathize with Edna's character, i could not help but think she was a bad person by the end of the book. Although she did reach self-actualization, she did so without any responsibility shown towards the people close to her. She cheated on her husband, and then cheated on the man that she was having an affair with with someone else, hardly feeling any guilt for any of it. She also neglected her children, and treated them as if they were antagonists. Although I can understand her plight to become an independant woman and go beyond her society, the way that she attempted this made her a bad person, and she (arguably) failed at her task anyway. Her life, even though she said she was independent, ended when the man she was having an affair with left her. After that, she kills herself. Had she had the courage to separate from her husband (despite her society) and pursue Robert, or even if she didn't get him at the end, but still lived on just as much a woman then before rejection, THEN this book would be feminist. Otherwise its simply immorality disguised as feminism. If a man had done all the things she has in this novel, no one would be arguing whether the character was good or not.besides the problem i had with the themes and plot, it was a very well written book, and i don't agree with it being censored.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"A still timely and enormously important tale of the price a woman pays when she &quot;awakens&quot; to her own authentic voice and finds her only place in society on the fringe, lonely and rejected. While reading this story I have considered that women are still today at great risk when we awaken to our true voices; our thoughts and desires. Perhaps our entire identity and sense of self-worth as a dutiful daughter of patriarchy are at stake, as it was for Chopin's Edna Pontellier the upstanding wife and mother who gave up mainstream approval and respect when she we gave up the things society promised her would make her happy but didn't. This bold step from Edna, plus the rejection of her only lifeline at the time, her lover, cost her her life.Edna Pontellier awoke from the myth that a marriage to a &quot;good&quot; man and 2.5 children would fulfill her. The painful reality she awoke to was that her life was without meaning and integrity. The unfortunate ending of this story magnifies the limited options for &quot;awakened&quot; women in the 19th century. I have read this story many times. It is still my favorite, because one, it is beautifully written but two and most importantly, it inspires me to try to choose a life of personal integrity and authenticity, as Kate Chopin did when she dared to publish this story.

The story concerns 28yo Edna Pontellier, a well-to-do wife and mother in New Orleans' Creole society. Her frustration with the limits placed on her sexual, creative, and artistic leanings lead her to rebel in a way society cannot understand or condone.The writing style, popular when the book was written a century ago, is more 'telling' than 'showing,' and modern readers may find the reading a bit of a slog these days.

Is this a feminist manifesto, or something about a certain kind of person? What is solitude, and what happens when a woman has only so many choices?This text is probably one of the first of the Women's Studies &quot;awakenings&quot; and as such, is itself an important artifact of feminist theory. The story itself is sometimes rich and poetic and sometimes frustrating as you can get. Why does a woman's choice (in the Victorian setting) only amount to such limited options?

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Thank you to all my reading friends who suggested The Awakening as one of their favorite classic novels! I have been trying to branch out into new literary worlds, and the classics is one genre that I hadn't yet touched. Still a novice, but my journey has been so profitable thus far. The Awakening was one novel that is incredibly easy to read and holds such powerful prose in so few pages.A taboo subject back in its day, The Awakening tells the story of one woman's emotional journey from a stifled, miserable marriage to a spirited and lusty freedom. Young Edna Pontellier feels trapped in a loveless, although pampered, life with husband, Leonce. Stirrings of independence begin one summer while resorting in Grand Isle, an island off the coast of Louisiana. These new feelings have begun a profound change in Edna, liberating her beyond belief. Thus ensues an infidelity that dreams are made of, although at the expense of her marriage and motherhood.Hardly shocking in this day and age, The Awakening's subject of marital infidelity and physical lust for another is always a pageturner. The theme of the novel -- Edna's torment at the chains that bind her and the flutterings of an unbridled passion -- is brought to life with beautiful writing in simple, elegant words. I am surprised to find such a passionate and provocative story within its pages. Short but penetrating, The Awakening will move you."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Note: I do not believe that The Awakening is the sort of novel that relies on plot twists and surprises. It's *how* the story unfolds rather than *what happens* that is important. However, several folks have claimed that they needed a spoiler warning, so here it is: You have been warned.Kate Chopin wrote this story of female self-actualization back in the late 19th century, but it's as applicable today as it was then. I think we all feel trapped by decisions we've made capriciously or because we've been told they are correct, and we all consider, even briefly, escape. The main character in this novel not only realizes that she has trapped herself, but she actively seeks to free herself. Her action, rather than just emotion and despair (a la Goethe), is what separates her from the herd.Here's the low-down: Edna is a woman, probably in her 30s or so, married to a successful financier and mother to two charming children. She summers on an island, probably to escape summer diseases in the city, New Orleans. One summer she acquires a friend, Robert. Although married women in this society frequently have male friends, Edna is an outsider, and she takes Robert's attentions far too seriously. Apparently, he is similarly infatuated. Basking in Robert's attention, Edna understands at last that she has discarded her youthful dreams and hopes and that her current life is unfulfilling. She takes small steps toward freeing herself, and Robert seems a willing accomplice for a while.During the course of the novel, Edna relearns who she is, reclaims the dreams of her youth, and abandons her husband and children. The author is careful with this last, making it seem tragic and irresponsible, yet ultimately unavoidable. By the last 20 pages, Edna is free.There are, in my opinion, two weakness in the book. The first may be considered a spoiler: toward the end, Edna tells Robert that she is an independent woman now who is not the property of any other person. But she's lying. Her actions show that she is dependent on Robert, needy for his love and attention. I still can't decide if the author created this break between words and behavior on purpose, or if she really intended us to believe that Edna was wholly independent.The other weakness, riding on the coattails of the first, is that Edna does not take responsibility for her own awakening. She claims that Robert \\"awoke\\" her.Edna does in the end devise a solution that proves her ultimate freedom and independence, and it is the only solution that works. But I won't spoil it by writing it here.The thing that makes this book so lovely is that it isn't preachy. So many modern girl-power novels just sort of slam you over the head with the girls-first-and-men-suck mantra. This book is about Edna; it doesn't purport to be about all women. It's a very personal work, and the narrative hand is light. It leaves us, the readers, free to recognize the little bits of Edna in us all, and although the rest of us may not ultimately choose Edna's course, it gives us hope that such freedom is possible, even after the fact."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening&quot; is the classic novel about women that &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; purports to be but isn't. It's not just a &quot;woman's&quot; novel, though, it perfectly (and poetically) captures the inner life of a solitary person who is forced to live for the sake of others. And while this has been a distinctly female position for a large part of Western history, it is a position that can be identified with by just about anyone in our current age of employee internet-use monitoring. This is a twentieth-century tale of discomfort with and reaction to antagonistic surroundings. For those of us who don't feel the need to procreate in an overpopulated world, Edna's (and presumably Chopin's) discomfort with children will make sense. For those of us who may not always know exactly what we want out of life, this story will strike a chord.Kate Chopin's writing is deliberate but not labored. She is particularly successful at depicting ambiguity in a way which is highly descriptive and communicative. This is a skill which I can't praise highly enough, and it culminates in an ending which is absolutely perfect. While criticism could be raised against &quot;The Awakening&quot; as another apology for the suicidal artist, Edna's literal and symbolic escape is less pretentious than Harry's in &quot;Steppenwolfe,&quot; nor as indecipherable as that of any of Joyce's creations. Kate Chopin's novel is truly a classic in the sense that it should be a part of any survey of American literature. The Norton Critical edition is the best way to go, too, with helpful biographical information and literary criticism. If you want a more enriching experience with this novel, I'd highly recommend this version."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Though at one time I, too, would have rated &quot;The Awakening&quot; one of the worst reads of a lifetime--for its predictability in the context of a woman oppressed by Victorian society, and the most undeveloped, unsympathetic heroine for whom I was unable to muster the slightest emotional investment--a nagging, relentless undercurrent of something I couldn't quite identify festered long inside me regarding this novel until the story, and author, were at last redeemed upon my third reading, in a literature course that finally ended this internal struggle.Having much faith in Kate Chopin as a writer, I never felt 'the awakening' was about sex. This was too easy, even for a book set in Victorian Society. Further, it occurred to me that although women were limited beyond the domestic sphere in this era, suicide was not particular to the phenomenology of Victorian women (as it was, say, to Wall Street brokers at the onset of the Great Depression).&quot;The Awakening,&quot; in title and content, is irony. Edna Pontellier's awakening is about who she perceives herself to be, and who she actually is. She dreams of passion and romance and embarks on a summer affair, yet she married Leonce simply to spite her parents, who don't like him. She moves out of the family home to live on her own--with the permission, and resources, of Leonce--hardly independent. She claims to crave intimacy, yet she fails horribly at every intimate relationship in her life: she is detached with her children, indifferent to her husband, leery of her artist friend, and can hardly stand another minute at the bedside of her warm, maternal friend, Mrs. Ratignolle, to assist her in childbirth. (Ratignolle was my favorite character of all, read after read, simply because she was so content with herself.)The Awakening? The surprise is on Edna, who is not the person she imagines herself to be. The irony? Edna Pontellier is never awakened to this, even at the bitter end. Feminists have adopted this book as their siren song...embarrassing at least! A feminist reading would, predictably, indict Victorian society as oppressive to women. Yawn...So that's new?!! Tell us something we don't know! I can tell you that concept wouldn't be enough to keep a book around for a hundred years.But the concept that has sustained this novel over a century's time is its irony. And it is superbly subtle. I believe Chopin deliberately set up Victorian society as her backdrop to cleverly mask this irony...'the awakening' is not something good (a daring sexual awakening in a dark era for women): it is something horrible that evolves and is apparent to everyone except the person experiencing it. This reading makes Edna's character worth hating! Chopin herself hated Edna Pontellier and called her a liar through her imagined conversation with her artist friend at the end of the novel.Chopin also cleverly tips the scales in Edna's favor in the first half of the novel, but a careful read reveals those scales weighed against her in the second half. I give the novel 5 stars because it took me three readings and help from a PhD lit professor to figure out this book. And I'm proud to say that I am, at last, awakened."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"This book was one of the best novels I have ever read in my life. There are many biblical allusions and hidden messages behind the authors words. I strongly disagree with the comments of the people that said it was boring...they didn't understand the book. In the beginning of the novel Kate Chopin starts with the parrot in the cage and Mr. Pontellier. Why did she start her novel like that-did you ever wonder? Kate Chopin mentions the parrot in the cage to symbolize Edna's entrappment and wanting her freedom. Mr. Pontellier wears glasses because he is blind to see how society works in the Victorian era. The lady in black and the lovers in the novel are the two different decisions that Edna has to make. The lady in black represents the spiritual love (marriage)and she is blind to everything that surrounds her-she is only concerned with her love for Christ. The lovers represent the individuality and concern only for themselves-they represent sin. Edna needs to make a decision between following the society's acceptance of her marriage or become an outcast and having an affair that can ruin Mr. Pontellier's reputation and her children's. A biblical allusion that Kate Chopin states is when Edna is having her dinner party. That party represents The Last Supper in where she is giving her good-bye to the old Edna and saying hello to the new Edna. She invites 12 guests just like the 12 disciples. She is dressed like a goddess and says &quot;drink to my health&quot;-'This is my blood'Jesus says. Robert, the man she plans on having the affair with is exactly like Mr. Pontellier. Edna is going through the same cycle and her only escape is death. The novel is very interesting and you just have to use your brains a little harder and ask &quot;Why did the author write this? What was the purpose behind it? What meaning does it have?&quot; If you ask these questions to every book you read you as a reader will understand and enjoy the book you are reading. By doing this your horizons will expand and you will be a better reader and writer which will make you a better thinker! I hope you agree with me."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Saralee saysThe Awakening is a part of many required reading lists and is also a fashionable choice for book club discussions. Why is this novel that was written more than 100 years ago relevant today?During the 1890s, if you were a part of the well to do Creoles of New Orleans you spent your summers at Grand Isle - a resort for those who could afford it. Edna Pontellier is there with her husband, their children and their servants. As the story opens, Pontellier is on the beach with Robert Lebrun and her husband is deciding whether to dine with his family or if it would be more socially beneficial for him to spend the evening at his club. We soon learn that appearances and social position are what matters most to Pontellier's husband and as long as she abides by those rules, she will get along just fine. When she decides not to abide by the rules, the story becomes interesting and the book significant.Kate Chopin was one of the first to write about women outside of their mandated roles as satisfied domestic companions. She boldly wrote about what a woman feels like who discovers sexuality and independence and it was courageous for her to write this book. Pontellier was raised as a Presbyterian in Kentucky and it was on a whim that she married her husband who was part of the Creole Catholic establishment. Her character enjoyed taking risks but was heartbroken with the consequences.What did you think about Pontellier's relationship with her children? Was she selfish or bold by putting her needs first? What do you think she did that offended society most? At what age should someone read this book? How did you feel about Pontellier's last act of defiance? Did her character win or lose? Why did this book end Chopin's promising career as a writer? I recommend reading a text of The Awakening that includes both the context and criticism. The context will help you understand what all of the French phrases mean and also explain Creole society and the background in which the story takes place.Larry's languageThe Awakening is all about Edna Pontellier and her moral, sensual and personal growth and development. This 1899 novel by Kate Chopin is very modern in its tone and in its honest treatment of human feelings and emotions. While proper society in the 1890s was still very Victorian in its outlook and pronouncements, its citizens were human to the core, as Pontellier demonstrates.She is trapped in a dull marriage in New Orleans in a social climbing, status seeking family where - instead of summering in the Hamptons or a mountain retreat - she and her husband and their servants vacation at Grand Isle. Like a good husband in that society, he leaves Pontellier each week to return to the city to make money. While he is gone, she enjoys the company of the other families in a social setting where rigid rules govern the proper behavior and emotions that may be expressed regardless of true feelings.Pontellier's social rules instead are far more like a modern country club environment where certain manners are demanded, at least in public, until the lights are low, drinks are flowing or the spouses are absent. For Pontellier, these rules rapidly give way to her expression of her inner desires and thoughts.What are the boundaries for an individual and for a society in the expression of personal desires? Was Pontellier only lusting in her heart or did she actually sin? Morally, is there a difference? Do you think modern authors like Erica Jong or John Updike treat sensuality and marital rules differently than Chopin?This was a shocking novel in 1899 but today Pontellier's turmoil and dilemma would be neither unusual nor frightening and perhaps that is why modern man and woman usually succeed in handling these situations in a far better way than Pontellier."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Kate Chopin's controversial novel The Awakening was greeted with immediate attack by critics who believed it to be too provocative and questioned her motives and morals. Set in Louisiana, the protagonist Edna Pontellier, struggles to reach her awakening through her journeys and experiences in New Orleans and the Grand Isle. The Awakening is filled with symbols and different themes which reveal Edna as a complicated and intricate character. Throughout the novel, there is a constant dualism between Edna Pontellier's outward existence and her inner self. Her outward existence conforms to society and her duties as a wife and mother, and in contrast, her inner self is represented through her dreams. Her dreams are to be free and to no longer be viewed as an ornament hanging off of her husband. Symbolized by the parrots who are tamed and domesticated in the gilded cage, she feels restricted by her current life and desires to escape. The birds also foreshadow her departure by their cries of &quot;Allez vous-en!&quot; (Get out!) and reveals the theme of escape from maternal and matrimonial bondage. When she moves out of her husband's house, her new home is known as &quot;the pigeon house.&quot; This is significant because pigeons are not caged and therefore, able to roam free. The dualism between New Orleans and the Grand Isle symbolizes constraint and freedom. New Orleans is proper society and extremely hectic, whereas Grand Isle possess more of an relaxed atmosphere and is much like the Garden of Eden. It is in Grand Isle where she meets and falls in love with Robert Lebrun. Edna faces a dilemma of choosing between her husband and children or Robert Lebrun. She believes that in Robert she has found her true self and identity, but later realizes that her infatuation with Robert is only a sexual desire and can be satisfied by any other man. It is ironic that in the end Mr. Pontellier and Robert Lebrun turn out to be the same-a common man. Like Hester Prynne in The Scarlet Letter, Edna becomes alienated from society. Her final dinner party parallels the Last Supper where she invites 12 guests symbolizing the 12 disciples. After the conclusion of her party, she returned to Grand Isle where the voice of the sea &quot;speaks to the soul&quot; and attracted Edna for a spiritual and emotional cleansing. Kate Chopin's novel with its simple short sentences and chapters is actually not simple at all. The Awakening is filled with many symbols and themes, all of which helps increase the readers understanding of Edna Pontellier. It must be read with close attention to detail. Although the ending was some what disappointing, it is still worth reading. This book about feminism that shocked the literary world over a hundred years ago will still shock readers today."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"I was told that after reading much of Emily Dickinson's work and Madame Bovary that I would find great delight in Kate Chopin's final attempt at novel writing, The Awakening. I was struck first reading it that the novel is written almost without feeling at first, and then unfolds to be what is surprisingly rich and complex in terms of one woman's journey into personal freedom. I won't call Chopin's work a femenist statement, no, in fact, in reading The Awakening I found that the character of Edna is not really a representation of feminism, but what the title simply suggests...an awakening. Edna is trapped in complacency of the times and has never established herself for her. I think that this is a novel where anyone who seems to be craving a change or is beginning to establish themselves will relate too, because in our own little way, we are all Edna's, people who want something more. The difference between this and what Madame Bovary suggests about women is that Chopin's work in my opinion is not really about sex at all, it's about transitions of the spirit. Unlike Bovary, Edna is not a bad mother, she does not wish for the world at all and everything inside of it...she just wishes to be alive. In the end, she fails, but there is something that is found beneath the subtle words of Kate Chopin that seems to suggest, like Edna, we too are all doomed to fail as well.In terms of the author's ability, she is a simple writer without much emotion, far from anything gothic or of that style. She didnt strike me as amazingly romantic either, and I have read that Chopin was known for being a short story writer. I could see that, because the way she choses to write is very short story esque. Still, somehow, Chopin is able to bring out the emotions in the reader with her limited style. After reading her work, I found myself amazed and completly blown away, because you will find as the book unfolds there are lots of symbols and deeper meanings. It's a beautiful work, one of my personal favorites. Highly reccomnded."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"At a time when a woman's roles in society were the doting wife and devoted mother, Edna Pontellier becomes more and more aware of her distaste for these responsibilities. Kate Chopin's heroine embodies the theme of escapism and the view of marriage and motherhood as traps. During the summer at Grand Isle, Edna becomes more apathetic towards her devoted, providing husband (whom she never loved, but was &quot;fond&quot; of) and vague, nondescript children (who symbolize children as burdens rather than blessings). As she distances herself from her family, Edna grows closer to a dear acquaintance and the object of her romantic desire, Robert Lebrum. Once Edna and her family return to New Orleans, she shirks her former duties, such as being a hostess on Tuesdays, and instead focuses on her artistic talents. When her husband goes on a business trip and her children stay with their grandmother, Edna becomes more bold and independent, finding pleasure in a man who satisfies her physical desire, Alcee Arobin. As her senses awake, she allows herself to become receptive to personal pleasures as a way to discover her true self and what she really seeks: freedom. The novel provides excellent psychological insights and guides the reader through Edna's mind as she begins the journey towards self-fulfillment and independence. The novel is also filled with symbols and motifs such as birds (symbolic of Edna), music (passion), the sea (escape), the young lovers (Edna and Robert), and the lady in black (always seen following the lovers as a symbol of their fate). Nearly every sentence bears a deeper, symbolic meaning. Through the vivid characterizations and descriptions of emotions and psychological drives, the reader is pulled through the novel with a passionate sympathy and understanding of Edna's motives. As the chapters come to an end, Edna presents her realization about her desires and takes the only path that can give her what she seeks. Though one may not agree with her choices, one can see her reasons. For that, Chopin establishes herself as a master of the portrayal of the female psyche and a phenomenal writer."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"When The Awakening was published at the end of the XIX century, the novel was not well received. The protagonist, Edna Pontellier, was accussed of being a bad wife, a bad mother, a bad person... a bad example to women. Ms. Chopin died a couple of years later without publishing another book. Less than 100 years later, The Awakening has been rescued and it is considered one of the milestones in women's literature. Edna lives a comfortable, pleasant, wealthy life in New Orleans. Edna, like all other women in her same social-economic status, is expected to conform to the images that society and literature has created and perpetuated about them: those of the angel-woman, the mother-woman, the perfect-woman. Edna's friend, Adele Ratignolle, is precisely the embodiment of all these virtues, and is against Adele that Edna measures herself and begins to question her place in the world. When seeing the Ratignolles acting at unison, Edna feels depressed rather than soothed and this picture of perfect married life left Edna with a sense of \\"pity for that colorless existence which never uplifted its possessor beyond the region of blind contentment.\\" Edna begins to search for her own identity, very much like a man would, the difference is that because of her gender, Edna is not allowed to explore and grow as an individual. Edna begins gradually to awaken not only to her own independence but to her sexuality, as well. She leaves the comfort of her husband's home and moves into her own small place, she begins to paint for a living and she takes a lover. Yet she soon realizes that no matter how hard she tries to be a person, she (and all women by extension) will always be perceived as someone's appendage and never her own person. There are metaphors throughout the book that evoke Edna's increasing awareness: she goes through periods of deep sleep and she swims, which is also a metaphor for her progressive awakening. Overall The Awakening is one of those books that is still pertinent today, for although women are allowed to have careers and speak their own minds, women are still expected to be above all mothers and wives. This dichotomy between being a wife/mother-woman and a woman-woman - still sparks today - 100 years later - controversy."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

She wasn't being unfaithful to her husband, because he betrayed her long ago by thinking of her simply as an object. The key concept I think most people miss, however, is the reason she kills herself instead of running away with Robert. Robert is just like Leonce, and Edna realizes it. He talks of her being set free and given to him. Edna realizes that he, too, views women as possessions. Granted, he loves her, but his mentality is still governed by his society. She realizes her life with Robert, while filled with passion and love, would still be a repressed one. She said she would give up the unessential for her children, and she did. To have lived would have been to raise her children in the midst of pain and absence of truth. To have lived and given up the essential, herself, would be robbing them of their own personal freedom and expression. Edna is a well thought-out and inspiring character.

So it gets major kudos for that, for being a fresh voice a hundred years ago and still having some relevance today. Few books can do that.But as literature, it's problematic. The spirituality of Edna's awakening is often way heavy-handed. The journey of discovery she takes is simple -- maybe oversimple(Her husband and children conveniently go away at just the appropriate moment for her continued growth.) And philosophically, it throws grand hints at things without ever coming down on anything. The ending, besides being just plain too fast, is either poignant or disappointing.

She is on autopilot, never coloring outside of his clearly marked lines.Let me give you an example of how insufferable Leonce is: So, Edna wants some time alone and is relaxing in a hammock outside, when her husband walks up and says are you coming in to bed. And she's all no thanks I'm gonna chill here. And he's like ok and sits by her drinking and smoking a cigar. He gets another drink, lights another cigar.

When Robert realizes that he is in love with a married woman, he packs up and abruptly moves to Mexico.After he is gone, Edna's awakening is still developing. She learns that she doesn't ever want to sacrifice herself for anyone, including her husband and children. Edna would give her life for her children, but herself is a sacred thing that she seeks to protect. She begins to shed her old nature and embodies the New Woman. Edna moves out of her husband's house, has an purely physical affair (while Robert is in Mexico), and takes up painting, which she used to do before she got married.This novel was revolutionary for its time. Chopin overturned Victorian era novels by really focusing on a woman's inner life, her sexuality, her rationale, and her yearning for independence. A woman sleeps with a man she doesn't love! *Gasp* A woman wants five minutes to herself! Well, I never.A lot of folks think Edna is selfish and I would agree to some extent; but, who isn't selfish? For Edna, the only way out, the only way to fight is to make herself the top priority. Anyone with an ounce of intelligence would try to escape a loveless marriage and an unproductive life like Edna's. Plus, I refuse to buy into the idea that when a woman has children her life must be forfeited. And I'm stepping off the soap box...As much as I liked this book and recommend it to everyone, all I could think at the end was, thank God that was over 110 years ago."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"It's hard to believe that The Awakening and Other Selected Stories was written in the 1880s. Not only is the story still incredibly relevant, but Ms. Chopin's writing has a bite to it that I haven't seen in the majority of her male contemporaries - let alone the women.The Awakening is a ~100 page novella which takes up about half of this collection. It's the story of a woman slowly realizing that she doesn't particularly care for being defined as a wife and mother. She'd rather have her own time, her own adventures and create her own heartbreaks. Which is exactly what she does.Chopin's stories are well known for being very controversial at the time they were published (and in fact many of them were not published until the '60s - not because they wouldn't have sold but because they were simply too racy) and it's not hard to see why. She writes about women who enjoy sex, women who cheat on their husbands and women who are generally bull-headed and willful.I enjoyed this collection not just because it was one of the first feminist texts, but because the writing was solid. I've read plenty of literature from the turn of the century and certainly it typically sounds like it. Aside from some interesting swear words, the writing in this collection was fresh enough that it could have been written much more recently."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

However; when I read the first chapter I couldn't put it down and I had the book completely read in 3 days.The story is revolved around a woman named Edna in the mid to late 1800's and her inner thoughts and struggles. While reading the novel I was able to acquire an inside look into how women struggled with their identity and purpose in a society that was about \\"the man\\". Being a woman in a male dominated career (Computer Networking) I was able to relate to her lashing out to gain independence and wanting to be known as Edna and not Mrs. Pontellier. The novel affected me in such a way that I had all the women in my immediate family read it, which had a chain reaction to even having my father read it. The universal theme about an individual going through an identity crisis can definitely be related by everyone."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The lot of women in the 19th century wasn't a terribly impressive one -- many of them had been reduced to babymakers and inoffensive \\"property\\" for the men.And Kate Chopin caused a massive scandal when she wrote about one woman who drifted from societal normal in \\"The Awakening,\\" leading to a world of exploration, love, and ultimately tragedy. Her misty, vaguely dreamlike writing can pull a reader into the world of 1900s New Orleans and its society, but her heroine sometimes feels more like a vessel than a fully-realized person.Edna Pontellier is the wife of successful New Orleans businessman L&eacute;once, and mother of two lovely young boys. Yet she is dissatisfied by her life, and feels no connection to the other wives and mothers, who idolize their motherhood and subservience. And when she encounters handsome young Creole Robert Lebrun while on vacation, she begins to \\"awake\\" to the feelings she has left behind during her marriage.Distancing herself from Leonce and her sons, Edna begins exploring art and emotions that have been denied her by the strictures of her society -- as well as an affair with the flirtatious Alc&eacute;e Arobin. She even moves out into a cottage of her own, much to the horror of those who thought they knew her. Her romantic feelings have not moved on from Robert, but his return makes her realize how different she has become...Kate Chopin's most famous work is often cited as a sort of proto-feminist work, with a woman rebelling against the male-dominated role she has been given. The fact that a story about a woman abandoning her husband and kids caused such a scandal only adds to that belief.But that's a rather restricted label to give such a versatile author, and \\"Awakening\\" is a book with too many facets to be so restrained. In many ways Chopin resembles a Southern version of Edith Wharton, exploring the stultifying society that she once dwelled in, and the often-tragic consequences of people -- particularly women -- who dared to step outside those unforgiving boundaries.Chopin's lush writing elevates this story even further, weaving an atmospheric, vaguely dreamlike web around everyday New Orleans. She makes readers feel the heat of a summer's day, the remote beauty of a party, the eerie majesty of an empty sea. And though \\"The Awakening\\" is infused by a feeling of languid dreaminess, Chopin creates a feeling of tension and inevitability that grows as the book goes on. It's almost a shock at the book's finale, when that tension releases in a quiet burst of poetic language.And to her credit, Chopin is able to make her points about women and society without setting up straw-men. Such characters as \\"angel of the house\\" Ad&egrave;le Ratignolle and the stuffy Leonce (who sees Edna as his personal property and expects her to obey) are examples of the usual society of the time, yet Leonce is a fully realized character who loves -- but can never understand -- his wife.Perhaps the biggest problem is that Edna herself is at times rather thin as a character. While she has many conflicting desires, she sometimes seems like a mere vessel for all those desires to be displayed over time. But there are some scenes where she does seem like a fully realized person, such as when she meditates on her lack of housewifely virtues, is struck by wild mood swings around her sons, and befriends Mademoiselle Reisz.\\"The Awakening\\" is more than just an early feminist novel -- it's an exquisitely written story about the roads that our own desires can take us down, and the tragedies that can come from it. A must-read, if nothing else for Kate Chopin's powerful writing."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

To say that's due to it's being great literature which &quot;always provokes a powerful response&quot; is ridiculous. This book hardly provoked any response. The whole story rambles along, as one artificial plot device follows another, and our heroine reacts, until she takes the easy route out -- coincidentally, the same route many would take if all &quot;classics&quot; were as limited in insight and quality prose as this thing. Sadly, it's easy to see why this story is so popular for some people -- it's plot is simple, generally inoffensive in this day and age, formulaic, and reinforces the values and beliefs of a lot of people who are generally inoffensive and formulaic.

Fortunately for her, she has the financial means to do so and her husband takes off on business and his mom takes the kids. How nice to be so unencumbered!I can't really tell how I feel about this book. On the one hand I think it's completely lame for this woman to have just drifted along in life with her focus only becoming clear when presented with some man or other (not her husband) to amuse and divert her. On the other hand, I feel sorry for her. I think today's young women are encouraged to \\"find themselves\\" much sooner than waking up at 28 and realizing you're trapped in a situation you don't much care for. (At least I hope they are).I know this book is considered a \\"classic\\" and there is much commentary to be found on the internet and scholarly journals about how it was considered shocking and a precursor to feminism, but to think of it like that is depressing. Edna is fickle, unfaithful, capricious and vain and to think that she was held out as an example of what really goes on in women's heads makes me irritated.

To me she doesn't represent a &quot;feminist&quot; or a woman well ahead of her time, she just reminds me of a selfish, arrogant woman who cared little about anything except for her own-well being. I thought that Edna disregarded everyone in her life, and pushed away everyone who cared about her, and concerned herself only with her own problems.In the end I think Edna realized the truth about herslef too late: she should never have been married, because she was not suited to it. What I did find admirable in this novel is that Chopin was able to portray the ambiguous feeling Edna encounters as she realizes she hates her station in life. The intensity with which Chopin describes those emotions overtakies the reader, maybe because modern female readers today can ralize how lucky they are to have options outside of marriage, while Edna had none. We feel her despair as she sinks into depression. I appreciated knowing how far social expectations have come (though still not being totally equal).I think Madamoiselle Reisz was an example of the life Edna should have led. I think that Chopin's descriptive narrative gives the book an edge and saves the novel from the unoriginal and predictable plot. I also wondered why she picked drowning as a means of a way to die. My conclusion was that in the book I noticed part of her &quot;awakening&quot; comes from the sensation she recieves by swinning in the ocean by herself. she feels liveration and freedom out there, and in life she tried to find those things as well, but with little succcess. So in the end she gave herself back to the only place where she felt the joy and secret of life.All in all, a interesting read, with good literary comparisons and symbolism."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

What do you mean by \\"awakened\\"?is it to leave your husband, to abandon your children, and to have affairs with other men...?this is totally irresponsible and inconsiderate!!!if Edna likes drawing, she can draw whatever she wants after she has finished the housework and looked after the kids.It's her job and she has to take this responsibility, furthermore, it's she who bore the kids,she chose to do this but not the kids and again,she should take responisibility for her decision.She can fall in love with Robert and even marry him but please do it after getting divorced with her husband,this is her legal responsibility.You may dislike my comment based on responsibility but this is very true that we all live in the same society,it is inevitable that we have to be cooperate with others and abide by the rules of our society.If everyone acts like Edna, how many broken family and orphans will there be?it's not a matter of gender but for everyone of us.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"\\"A Creole Bovary,\\" is how Willa Cather described Edna Pontellier, the restless female protagonist in Awakening, a book that shocked and scandalized genteel folk when it appeared in 1899. No one has adequately explained then, why Madame Bovary's name (which appeared in 1856) rolls off tongues easily today. Not so that of Mrs P, whose disdain for marriage and explicit reluctance to give herself to her children were too close to reality. Some things had best remain in the shadows even in fiction.Flaubert's Mme Bovary has adulterous affairs at a level that makes Edna's discreet dalliance seem negligible (by today's standards). Although, played out with different details, both adulteresses, ultimately overwhelmed by despair, submit to forms of self destruction.In Flaubert's time, critics acclaimed him and his masterpiece. Kate Chopin, dutiful mother of six children and widowed young, never knew that her novel would survive to this day. Kate died depressed of a brain hemorrhage five years after the Awakening drew such ostracism. She never wrote again. Why, in the hands of a man (a Frenchman) did this nearly identical archetype of a character draw acclaim? In the hands of a woman, it was labeled \\"moral poison.\\"I find it hard to believe that the criticism was due to Chopin's too explicit depiction of adultery. I think what disgusted the genteel reader was the even more explicit denial of marital bliss. And that having children does not a fulfilled woman make. Edna Pontellier, in her late twenties, is married to a Creole stockbroker and mother of two young children. Early on in the novel, we witness her awaken sensually. She loves her in-the-body experience of learning to overcome her fear of open water, thanks to the would-be lover who awakens her to the freedom that lurks beneath the surface of fear and other constraints. Unlike Emma Bovary, Edna is driven as much by libido as by a clear and demonstrated artistic impulse. She draws---people and scenes. The more her body awakens, the more her muse awakens, and the more she yearns for time alone to create. She craves the company of the man who awakened her sexually. The plot is simple. The crux of the matter is explained when Edna tells her friend and alter ego, Mrs. Ratignolle, the devoted wife, that she would never sacrifice herself for her children, or for any one. \\"I would give up the unessential; I would give my money, I would give my life for my children; but I wouldn't give myself.\\" Mrs. R lives in a \\"padded cell\\" (my words) of her lush body and has no idea what Edna is talking about.Like Mme Bovary, Edna must get her comeuppance. You would think that a punitive ending would satisfy the polite society. But it doesn't because Edna never repents of abandoning her children and boorish husband. Some of her last words are, \\" . . . perhaps it is better to wake up after all, even to suffer, rather than to remain a dupe to illusions all one's life.\\"Notwithstanding that passage, the language and syntax of Chopin's novel are somewhat dated and quaint.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The protagonist of this excellent novel is commonly seen as a victim of the repression and hopelessness of women's desires for autonomy in middle-class American society around the end of the 19th century. This view is easily justifiable, and Chopin does give the reader plenty of pointers toward this interpretation.But a different and also arguable view is that Edna Pontellier is not so much a victim, but rather a failure. Just what is her problem? Her husband is well off and considerate. He married her for love, and now finds himself with a wife whom he \\"meet[s] in the morning at the breakfast table.\\" He tells her about his day and she doesn't listen. She's popular among her social set. She has plenty of servants. Even when she unilaterally declares her independence, dropping her social life, neglecting the children and the household, brusquely telling her husband \\"Let me alone, you bother me\\" and apparently denying him the pleasures of the marriage bed, he tolerates and indulges her in an even-tempered manner, merely asking for but not even insisting that she manage the household better. She then moves into her own house, leaving her husband behind, and he tolerates that too.Whatever her problems, what is her program? She lives on fantasies of unrequited love; she lacks empathy for others (including her children); she's egoistic to a fine point. She acts on impulse; her desires are vague. She comes to know what she does not want - to belong to any man - but cannot formulate or pursue what she does want beyond incoherent, fanciful and impractical fragments. She won't pay her dues as wife and mother - even though those dues are very light. She realizes that she doesn't want to belong to any man, and she hasn't the courage to be alone. She takes some steps to change her life, has some partial success, but when she's rejected by Lebrun, the younger man who is too honorable to have an affair with a married woman (whom she has already realized she doesn't want either) she just quits. She's a malcontent without much of a program or much of a spine. The novel's title suggests an irony: Edna wakes up but doesn't know what to do in the world to which she awakens.Edna's vague desires seem to be for a kind of de-humanized autonomy. Husband, children, friends, society - she experiences all these as constraints. She yearns to re-invent herself, but in a world with no attachments at all. This doesn't exist in life, and so - again without really realizing it - she chooses the only option that will free her from all those clingy attachments - death. At age 28, she gives up. Unable to do anything positive, she commits an act of complete rejection - of everything she has and anything to which she might aspire.What's going on? If Chopin had wanted to write a simple expos&eacute; of woman as victim - the impossibility of a woman's desire for autonomy -- she could have made Edna a bit more gutsy, a bit less dreamy, a bit more positively purposeful. The literature of the time was full of women as victims - Emma Bovary, Anna Karenina, Manon Lescaut, Marguerite Gautier/Violetta Val&eacute;ry, etc. etc. etc. None of them were half as sappy as Edna Pontellier. Has Chopin deliberately crafted something deeper and more sophisticated than just a screed about how tough it was to be a woman?And there are still other possible interpretations - for example the very common one of the woman who acts immorally and is punished for it (see most of the heroines mentioned earlier in this note). Chopin has written a complex and ultimately ambiguous story. Is Edna a victim or is she a failure? Is she justly punished or unjustly repressed? Chopin has given us a game of reader's choice, including the richer appreciation that Edna is both a victim and a failure, both repressed by social norms and punished for violating them. Let the reader enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"It's important to know before reading this book that Kate Chopin belonged to a no longer used genre called \\"Creole Writer\\". The Awakening is very much set in New Orleans and there is frequent use of French or it's Creole equivalents. Fortunately, this Norton Critical Edition provided translations and other explanatory information as footnotes to the text. These aids were much appreciated.Chopin is not a great American writer. However, she is very good. The plot makes for a compelling read and the ending is a delightful surprise. But what really struck me about this book was how modern, how relevant the story is. Edna's identity crisis, if you'll allow me to call it that, reminded me of very much of Saul Bellow's novella, The Dangling Man.Bottomline: This book isn't for everyone, but the discerning reader will enjoy it immensely."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Kate Chopin: \\"The Awakening\\"\\"Awakening\\" (In Chopin C. \\"Awakening and Other Stories\\" Random House, New York, NY: 2000) involves issues of feminism whereby Edna Pontellier, the center of the American Creole/New Orleans story, often and perplexingly reflects on her role of mother-of-two who is married to a well-off and often traveling (for business or pleasure) brokerage-business husband (Leonce Pontellier). The community views Leonce as the epitome of the ideal husband, for Leonce greatly adores and provides for wife and children, he is quite consistently concerned about the welfare and happiness of his household. Yet Edna does not look at Leonce as her choice of husband, she says their marriage was accidental, that as she was growing up there are particular men that came around her that she would have wished to take her hand. Leonce is disciplined, insistent and low-toned, often dissatisfied about Edna's attention to the children and other household issues, more so because he is often away on business and Edna has a lot of help, Leonce sometimes causes Edna to walk off and cry. Perhaps Edna was the precursor of the modern era American woman...one who is prevalently independent (or at least longs to be), one who has more power in making decisions about what she prefers, one whose identity is not predominantly defined by wealth, looks, family, husband, or children. In her state of psychological disillusionment (\\"An indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with vague anguish\\" [179]), Edna's love for the two boys she gave birth to is uncharacteristically distant, the mother's instinct seemingly weak, the kids have more fondness for their father. \\"If one of the little Pontellier boys took a tumble whilst at play, he was not apt to rush crying to his mother's arms for comfort....Mrs. Pontellier was not a mother-woman...\\" (181). The author Chopin hence paints a picture of a soul plagued by a mixture of feminist and psychological issues. It is to be remembered, that even in this age of feminist liberation, providing men who love and care for their wives and children are still held in high esteem and are still in high demand. Chopin implicitly displays that female emancipation and longing can be of numerous forms. Further, Chopin often compares and contrasts main characters in terms of their beauty and body textures/ forms, illustrating that this issue has been strong in the United States for centuries. \\"[Edna] was rather handsome than beautiful...face...captivating by reason of a certain frankness of expression and a contradictory subtle play of features\\" (174). Chopin writes of Edna's companion and friend Adele Rattignolle (as somewhat contrasted with Edna) that, \\"...her beauty was all there, flaming and apparent...two lips that pouted...the grace of every step, pose, gesture... (182). Many writers have noted that Kate Chopin was not a suffragist and did not join any feminist movements; and indeed, many feminist writers reduce the value of the esthetic features and comparisons of women, aspects that can remind of Hollywood vagueness.Eventually, Edna wants to leave her family big house and settle \\"...in a four-room house along the corner\\" (294). A woman who had great difficulty at learning how to swim, one who is still sophomoric at it, Edna will ultimately find disturbing comfort in introspectively walking alone to the sea, in taking off all her clothing, reflecting on her life and swim into and allow herself to be swallowed by the sea, a fatal blow to the self-possession and psychological emancipation that she sought. Edna was born a reserved child, she was miserable and felt stifled, her marriage and sketches did not reach the standards she wanted them, there was something lacking in her \\"ideal, loving family; her comfort and big house,\\" the lustful affair with the lad Robert the conspicuous and philandering son of Madame Lebrun the property owner was full of gaping holes and would not last. Edna did not fit in the conventional mode of the beginning of the 20th Century American dream woman. She instead provides a window into what the woman, over the numerous decades to come, would perhaps evolve into as the individualist and the emancipated female.In \\"Awakening,\\" Edna Pontellier is supposed to be one of the most fortunate women in the world. She has a present, fidel, hardworking and earning, capable, loving husband, who sired with her two male kids, she does not have to go outside of home to work. Yet, she is dissatisfied with her status quo, a rich homely situation that many women crave to be in. The narrator is telling us that women are complex persons, each of individual personality, one size does not fit all; needs and interests, and ambitions of each woman vary. Edna is horrifyingly distant from the two boys she gave birth to. \\"If one of the little Pontellier boys took a tumble whilst at play, he was not apt to rush crying to his mother's arms for comfort....Mrs. Pontellier was not a mother-woman...\\" (181). But indeed women (and female animals) have been known to neglect and even kill their children, reasons for which vary from psychological to dislike for tending to offspring. Women have been known to chase down and drown their children in bathtubs (Andrea PiaYates, in 2002, drowned all five offspring in a bathtub; she has had a history of post-partum depression and psychosis), or let a car-ful of their children roll into a river and get them drowned (Susan Smith, in 1994 did this to her two sons). Edna Pontellier had two sons, she drowns herself in the end. Women have been known to leave their enviable husbands and children in a comfortable life, and fall for a top-notch criminal who is locked up in prison. Edna mentions wanting to leave her comfortable home and enviable family, and living in a smaller habitation down the street \\"...in a four-room house along the corner\\" (294). Post-partum depression has been mentioned about women, and in Edna's case it seems to have become indefinite. Many women, even in the contemporary times long for biological or at least adoptive motherhood. Still, there are those who opine their biologically begeting children as one of the most unfair ways a woman is exploited as a painstaking residence of a baby during gestation. Human gestation is a trying experience, compared to that of most other species (consider squirrels and rabbits). Human fetuses comparaatively have many defects, miscarriages are common. At the same time it is a man who shoots the fertilizing sperm into the woman; he acheives orgasm easily and does not have the burden of carrying the child to chilbirth and keeping a sleep-ridden eye on the child. The fathers of the child sometimes wander away, abandoning their offspring. Edna portrays that a woman can want much more than a family of children and a husband, perhaps she was a lesbian who had not discovered herself as one. She was at least discontented with her husband Leonce who comes off as conventional, disciplined, and inflexible. This dicontentment is understandable...it happens. But why the distance from her offspring, and then the lustful interest in the young man Robert, eventually adultery? Edna will always be an enigma! Perhaps Edna suffered from multiple-personality disorder, something psychological irked her. Perhaps she longed to be the independent free woman, one who had the freedom to love or have sex with her choice of person, the precursor of the 20th and 21st Century independent and upstanding woman free to express her sexuality and stick to her preferences. Edna, many times in subtle ways, brings forth into question, feminism in the context of individuality, sexuality, marriage, freedom and choice, reproduction and child-rearing, spousal attachment and power, and the context and role of marriage in a woman's life. Edna brings it out that each female is of unique individuality, of personal talent and likes that beg to be fully uncovered so she need not be comfortable with how society compartmentalizes women, more so as wives, mothers, home-makers, and as cherished articles of beauty and ownership."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"\\"I love you. Good-by because I love you\\" said by Robert to Enda in a note that he left for her just after she went to help deliever the baby Madame Ratignolle was having. This novel, The Awakening , was deemed obscene and immoral when it was first published in 1899 because it depicted stories about having sexual intercourse with someone other than a woman's husband or having immoral thoughts about it. To give a brief plot summary, it is about finding your true self when no one around you is willing to help, defying everything that women stood for back then (which was to be a housewife, a good mother, and basically a slave) and being a \\"one of a kind\\" person. Kate Chopin herself was a very capricious person and did not like to be told what to do and how to do it. I believe that The Awakening was written to show people exactly how she felt like being a woman in such a high society and pressure that it bares down upon you. Even the language used in the book shows how high society expected you to speak. Kate Chopin's style of writting is truly superb. The way she hints at things, for example. Page 67, \\"I will, thank you. Good-by\\" said by Robert again to Enda before he leaves for Mexico. By this time in the book we already know that they have feelings for each other, although she is married she still cares deeply for him and deep down urnes for him to not to leave. However being married forbides that she do that. The passion and tension between the two just creates a sense of overwhelming love that Kate never really comes out and says \\"I love you but I must go because you have a husband and I can't have you\\" just shows how the book always has on this emotional roller coaster. The end of book depicts how love is and how it can have an awful ending or a really tremendous ending. I believe that The Awakening had a tremendous ending, however I'll let you decide for yourself. Read it, it'll have you crying, laughing, and jumping up in your seat screaming at Enda to do the right thing."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

She lives there with her husband and children, in a dull existence with no identity of her own. But something happens to Edna one summer. She grows tired. She practically burst with the feeling that she must live before she dies and that she has yet to really lived at all! She emerges into vibrancy and womanhood only to do the unthinkable in the end.The story begins with Edna on the beach while her husband, Robert Lebrun, contemplates whether he should spend the evening at his club, which would benefit them socially, or dine with his family. This is the reader's first insight to the importance Mr. LaBrun places on his social standing. It is quickly understood that Edna does not share her husband need for societal gains. The book grows more intriguing as the tension mounts between Edna and her husband. As long as she takes her social duties seriously, he is happy. It is when she chooses to ignore her social obligations, however, that their relationship and the story takes its most interesting turn.In writing The Awakening, Kate Chopin was well ahead of her time. The novel was met with a great deal of controversy. Even fans of her work prior to this novel, shunned her. She was a pioneer creating women characters beyond the role of wife and mother. She wrote about women's feelings, sexuality, and independence. It took America decades to catch up with Kate Chopin. It is important to add that Chopin used a lot of symbols in all of her work and that The Awakening is full of them. These symbols serve to add meaning to the text and to underline some subtle points. Understanding the meaning of these symbols is vital to a full appreciation of the story. Some of the major symbols include birds, art, sleep, piano playing, the gulf, the moon, and learning to swim.For information about Kate Chopin's life and other book reviews of southern authors visit www.southernlitreview.com"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The Awakening is a short, well-written novel by Kate Chopin that delves into the &quot;oh my G-d! I'm married! I have kids! Now how did THAT happen?!?!&quot;-type of trauma many women probably feel from time to time. By today's standard the story isn't terribly original, and the subject matter has been better addressed in more current novels. But The Awakening was the first.While Kate Chopin handles the subject matter with sensitivity, her writing style is a bit ... prosaic. I can understand why other reviewers feel The Awakening is only useful as a sedative, which is unfortunate. Sticking with this (brief) novel through its mid-point is rewarding; the last half, while still slow paced, is quite interesting as our poor housewife tries to come to terms with her mid-life crisis. And The Awakening has a most surprising and moving conclusion.So The Awakening has aged rather well these past 100 years. And even a guy (like me) can appreciate the somewhat feminist subject matter. Worth a look."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Through her works she was able to live out her destiny. &quot;Awakening&quot; closed her off from the literary world at large, but it &quot;awakened&quot; her spirit and let it sore. I've enjoyed opening up the world of 1800s' female writers. Others I've enjoyed are Kathryn Bonner or Sherwood Bonner (her writing name) from Holly Springs, MS who in the 1800's married, had a child and left them to live in Boston and make her dreams come true. The story of her life is an interesting one and one you'd enjoy reading about. I've also found Louisa May Alcott's story of her life interesting as well. Her father was I guess one of the first to drop out of society. Louisa's tough spirit rode her through hard times being a woman. Anyway, female writers in the 1800's had a very hard time with acceptance and being unique was quite a stand to make. Kate was definitely one of the few to dare to be different.

Unlike most other fictional heroines of the day, Edna isn't rescued by a handsome stranger; instead, she virtually abandons husband and children to seek her own bliss. Sure, there's another man in the picture--men actually, but Chopin's startlingly vivid prose is not employed for pat endings. Carried away by her own internal music and by the sea itself, Edna begins to live life on her own terms.The book was squashed by male critics of the time because of its positively racy subject matter. A St. Louis reviewer even went so far as to label it unhealthy. Sadly, the infamy marked the end of the author's brief career. Rediscovered only in the last twenty or thirty years, Chopin's brand of vivid lyricism and captivating imagery is not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"I believe Kate Chopin's &quot;Awakening&quot; is a masterpiece. The way in which Chopin depicts the life of women strikes upon the ideals of women being an equal to men in a time period when women living their own lives wasn't acceptable. This book portrays life through a woman's point of view, which in my opinion should set an example for all women. Edna Poniteller, the main character, begins to realize the way the world worked and with this she found herself not just as a woman but a human being with rights and equality.Her newfound self came due to simple boredom. She feels as though her life has no meaning and she can only hope that there is more to life than what she has experienced thus far. She is no longer interested in the \\"high-class\\" business life of her husband Leonce.Throughout the French New Orleans setting of life Edna compares herself to two women in hopes to find her place in the world. One of the women is Madame Ratignolle who is the perfect motherly housewife. The other woman is Mademoiselle Reisz who is the free-spirited type who can and will do what she pleases. Edna finds herself idealizing Reisz for her domineering ways rather than a simple housekeeper.All though this book does not keep you on the edge of your seat , it is written in a way that really keeps your attention. The book has many details in it regarding Edna's life and her different relationships. The book also comes to an extremely ironic end where Edna Poniteller ends up drowning herself, which goes to show how people will go to great lengths for what they believe in. All Edna really wanted in life was love through equality and when that didn't come to be she felt as though her life as she knew and wanted, was over."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Kate Chopin's ideas about feminism were new and fresh, although not always popular in 1899. The book is about Edna Pontelliers life. She is trying to find herself. She begins to notice changes in Grand Isle during the summer. She went with her husband and two children. By observation she sees she isn't like the other dedicated wives. She craves her own identity. She begins to fall for a younger man by the name of Robert. He announces that he is unexpectedly going to Mexico. She begins to realize just how much he means to her. Soon she finds herself back at New Orleans. Changes begin to take place. She is not the mother that she once was. Her top priority is herself now. When her husband leaves for a long trip to New York her strange behavior increases. She really gets into art and loves to paint. She leaves randomly at times. Her husband was worried and tried to help with a doctor, he just assumed it was a passing mood. She soon moves out of her large home, to a very small home. She has an affair with a man of the name of Alcee Arobin. She feels sorry though because she knows that she truly loves Robert. While going to a friends home she discovered Robert. They confessed their love for each other. One day after returning from her dying friends home, she finds a letter from Robert that tells her he loves her but he unexpectedly went away again. She was completely devastated. The next day after a night of shock, she walked into the ocean and toward her death.This book was enjoyable. Edna in some ways had reached some success. The end result was her death which was a tragedy. There was no place in this world for her to belong and be happy. Her awakenings are enlightening and at the same time painful realizations. I like the idea of her becoming a deeper thinker and more independent, but I didn't like her ending her life. I think she could have done something about her life and try to find happiness in different forms. I guess that's why it's a tragedy though. Overall, the book is very entertaining and thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

She has so many fears and uncertainties, and these are manifested through her moods and her attachment to a man from the Isle and again to a man who lives in the same city as she. It was sad to see Edna drowning under the pressures of her life.However, I felt at times it was lacking and somewhat contrived. In the beginning, I thought Edna to be stronger than she really is, but later in the book I thought Edna to be trite. She made her choices. No one made her marry or have children. She chose to do so, and then she chose to ignore these duties, lavishing her affections on Robert and Alcee.I think this is supposed to be one of the 500 great books written by women. I agree and disagree with that decision. I'm sure during the time this was written (1889) it was a great scandal, and it was probably one of the first books to be written about a married woman who felt trapped. However, I don't see much great about it other than being a founding mother (or should that founding mother) for other books about the same subject.This is a beautiful story, but contrived at times.

Wife of a successful businessman and mother of two young children, she feels as though she is losing sight of herself and is suddenly possessed with a desperate desire to become her own woman.Because of this, the annual summer family jaunt from New Orleans to Grande Isle takes a different turn from past years as Edna, yearning for something new and different, becomes attached to the resort owner's handsome young son.Lost and bewildered Edna cannot decide what to do; stay with the man she married, go with the man she loves, or make a new life for herself on her own.What worked for me:I can see why this story is used in women's studies classes to get a better understanding of life in the middle and upper classes of Victorian society, as well as cultural differences as far as racial and religious background. \\"The Awakening\\" vividly paints the Deep South's social structure during that era.Size-wise Edna sounded to be slim to average. Her very good friend Adele was quite plump however, and the author frequently lauded her soft beauty. (However then as now there was still a sense that \\"big is beautiful\\" only extends so far, as was underscored by a particular passage with a very abundant woman being physically described in less-than-glowing terms.)What didn't work for me:Edna was the only character who seemed real to me; the rest were cardboard cut-outs. However this may not be a lack of writing proficiency on Ms. Chopin's part, but rather a way to illustrate how cut off Edna was from others. People who seemed unreal to the reader may have also seemed that way to Edna.Personally, I feel ambivalent about the ending. From an artistic point of view it was quite valid, and perhaps it was socially valid in that day and age as well. But I couldn't help but be frustrated with Edna for not finding another way to resolve her situation.Overall:An interesting book for anyone who wants to better understand a well-heeled woman's place in Victorian society, but as a pleasure read this novella might be a bit dry and the ending somewhat unsatisfying."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"To say Kate Chopin's \\"The Awakening\\" is a tragic novel about an unhappily married woman who liberates -- or attempts to liberate -- herself through an extramarital affair would invite an inevitable comparison to \\"Madame Bovary,\\" so let's get this out of the way first: Like Flaubert's antiheroine, Chopin's Edna Pontellier is selfish and puts her own needs ahead of those of her husband and her two little sons; but she is a more sympathetic character because she is more deserving of her desire, which is true love rather than a romantic and materialistic fantasy world.The story begins on Grand Isle, off the Louisiana coast in the Gulf of Mexico, where the Pontelliers are spending the summer at a pension run by a woman named Madame Lebrun. Mr. Pontellier, a successful New Orleans businessman, is thoroughly devoted to his wife Edna and sons, provides for them a high standard of living, and is generous with gifts; but he is a snob who likes to be assured that his wife isn't associating with anyone commonplace or doing anything that would lower their esteemed social status or compromise their \\"financial integrity.\\" Edna, annoyed and estranged by his attitude, seeks solace with Madame Lebrun's good-looking but slacking son Robert; but before their relationship has a chance to turn into a full-fledged fling, he impetuously runs off to Mexico to seek some kind of employment.Later, languishing at her regular residence in New Orleans, Edna socializes with her friends Madame Ratignolle and the wizened Mademoiselle Reisz while her dutiful husband is off somewhere making money. The Reisz lady has been getting a steady stream of letters from Robert, and Edna naturally wonders with chagrin why he hasn't been writing her. Robert does return eventually, however, and his presence now, near the end of the novel, establishes his true significance in her life: the love that \\"awakened\\" her out of a lifelong dream, a love that her husband, with all his riches, could not offer her.On the surface this may sound like trite romantic fluff that, if written today, would barely raise an eyebrow; but taken in the context of the 1890's when a woman was considered to be nothing other than a wife or a potential wife, it has very deep implications about sexual revolution and the propriety of marriage as an institution. Most appealing to me about this novel, though, is its style, which combines keen psychological insight with a sort of impressionism that anticipates Virginia Woolf. Augmented by the steamy, swampy, Creole-spiced southern Louisiana setting, the novel achieves a fever pitch of eroticism."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The Awakening is a novel about independence, understanding, and the personal freedom received concerning love. The basic plot is that of a woman, Edna Pontellier, falling in love with a man other than her husband. She abandons all duties to her family and society. Through out her scandalous love for this man, Robert, Edna begins to find herself and becomes more independent. Realizing that she had fallen in love with Robert is what caused her \\"awakening.\\"The book was first published in 1899, a time when many people found it offending. Some felt it criticized women and their role in society during the late 1800's. The fact that Edna abandoned her role as a wife and mother made male critics angry. I did not find the book offensive at all. There are endless possibilities of what the situation could have led up to. Edna was not treated like a person by her husband, but as a piece of property. This gives her a good reason to search for love elsewhere. The Awakening is an accurate portrayal of life, and also provides entertainment for the reader.Kate Chopin is a skilled author, and her work with The Awakening shows women's need for independence. The Awakening is a tragic love story that makes readers want to fall in love themselves. Many say Chopin's career ended with the publishing of this book, but I feel it is an excellent example of an author telling the truth in a time when it wasn't accepted. Many people strive to tell the truth and that is exactly what Kate Chopin did."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

I thoroughly enjoyed this novel for the quality of the writing, the excellent characterization, the period and the setting. However I found myself impatient at the slow pace of the heroines activity or should I say inactivity in moving toward her goals. To me this is the tale of someone who for the times in which she lived had everthing that was available to her but was unable to achieve satisfaction. In the story the heroine wants to reject even her children to achieve another life she is unable to define, she is confused and frustrated with tragic consequences. To my mind her sex is not the crux of the novel, the complexities of life and how individuals achieve or cannot achieve self fulfillment regardless of gender are the subject explored. Well worth reading regardless of your interpretation."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Chopin shows the transofmation of Edna Ponterllier, a young wife and mother who-with tragic consequence-refuses to be caged by married and domestic life and claims for herself moral and erotic freedom. I very much enjoyed this book, because it intends to show that a twenty-eight year-old woman's desire to break herself free from societal confinements, with little experience, is possible."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Kate Chopin's highly renowned novel, The Awakening, is rightfully awarded such praise. Chopin's style of writing is eloquent, graceful and captivating. Her intense detail and careful chronicle of Edna's thoughts give the piece an impeccable sense of reality. For this reason, I feel that readers can easily relate to Edna's character and sympathize with her struggle. In order to relay many underlying themes, Chopin uses a significant number of enigmatic metaphors and vivid symbols. Although this adds to the novel's intrigue, it contributes to its complexity. If the reader is not astute and analytical, I question whether they will grasp the true meaning of the work.I believe that although The Awakening was published more than 100 years ago, it has tremendous relevance for modern society. Regardless of the era, readers will always be able to relate to one woman's triumph over hardship and her decision to follow her heart. Chopin writes her novel in a manner that leaves the reader with many unanswered questions regarding the morality and integrity of many of the characters. I think this is important to the appeal of the novel because it encourages the reader to reassess their opinion of certain actions and makes this an excellent choice for group discussion.The Awakening is above all, a powerful piece of literature. Kate Chopin's ability to touch the human heart in such a delicate manner is commendable. I felt enriched after reading this novel because it not only supplemented my skill as an astute reader, but it taught me valuable lessons about living life in respect to oneself and not society's demands. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who desires not only a captivating story, but one with meaning as well."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

At the beginning the novel takes place in Grand Isle, an island off the coast of Louisiana. Edna Pontellier meets a young gallant named Robert Lebrun, the two spend almost all their time together, and Edna greatly enjoys his company, especially when her husband was normally preoccupied with business. When he realizes that him and Edna are becoming too close, he suddenly departs the island and goes to Vera Cruz for business reasons. He left and didn't want to be with her because he wasn't alike to her economically and couldn't make her happy. At the end Edna returns to Grand Isle. She walks down to the beach and stands naked in the sun without thinking, than begins to swim out into the ocean. She thinks gloriously about how she has escaped her children and their claim on her and continues to swim until she is tired.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"When my friend and I ran across a list of 101 books that were recommended to be read before college, we realized we had only read a small percentage of the books and made a vow to read more. One of the books on the list was &quot;The Awakening,&quot; and as we had studied Kate Chopin in school and it was readily available online, we decided to both read it. Both of us had read it by the next day, and we both reached the same conclusion: Chopin's protagonist, Edna, was a selfish woman who was not strong at all, as a truly strong woman would have continued on even after the man she loved left her.The book is written beautifully, hence the two stars. But Edna is completely unidentifiable. She is twenty-eight, yet she seems to do everything on impulse. Yes, maybe she did rush irrationally into an ultimately loveless marriage -- but her husband is not a monster, so doesn't she at least owe him some consideration? Not to mention her children -- she seems to not have the slightest regard for them, only showing affection in fits and starts.This book should be read, if only to show what strength is not -- strength is not what Edna does in the end of this story. However, you may find yourself struggling to get through it, as Edna is often very frustrating. In conclusion -- this is NOT feminism. In fact, before reading this story I had immense respect for Kate Chopin, respect gained from reading her short stories. I lost some of that respect after seeing what she apparently believed was the solution for Edna's problems."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

The language and imagery of the book was decent enough.But Edna did not supply the book with the heroine it needed. She considered only herself, ironically accusing Robert of selfishness. In her &quot;awakening&quot; she was totally self-absorbed. If this book is meant to empower women what is it meant to drive then towards? Suicide? She gave up on life and love.

I was absolutely shocked when I saw that it had gotten an average review of 4 stars. (...) This is about as far from the truth as could possibly be.This book is slow, it is boring, it is pointless, it is plotless, it is depressing, it is absurd, and it is most certainly not well written. Of course, all of those things alone would have just made me dislike and then forget about the book. What really made me hate it, truly hate it, was its use of the single most utterly detestable and unsympathetic main charachter that I have ever encountered. Edna was as idiotic, ungrateful, selfish, whiney, over-emotional, neglectful, and vile a person as has ever been described in the role of protaganist. Hell, I've never even run across a villain that I liked less.Edna had a loving husband, and what did she do? She treated him like dirt and did her best to ruin his reputation. He never asked her to do anything other than entertain some guests one afternoon a week, and she goes on about being stifled, oppressed and (God forbid) unfulfilled. She doesn't have to cook, she doesn't have to clean, she doesn't have to sew, she doesn't have to work, she doesn't even have to take care of her own children. Her husband provides everything for her, and we're supposed to think that he's the bad guy? Why? Just because he yelled at her (...)? I bet the vast majority of men wouldn't have been as kind and patient as he was. Oh, and Edna's mistreatment of her husband didn't stop at being stupid, petty, lazy, contrary, and mean. No, she also had to go out and cheat on him with the local playboy. I don't know how any self-respecting feminist (if there is such a thing) could endorse such a book such a character or such behavior. Since when is adultery high on the feminist platform?Well, I could go on all day about how much I hate this book, but I don't really want to offend any more people. It's just that (...) it stands for everything that could conceivably be wrong with society.

Granted, I am male, with which come natural bias.I thought the book was fairly well written. Though shallow in literary devices, it had an eloquent flow to it. The plot itself was somewhat dull, as most (all?) of the book consists of Edna, the protagonist (I guess), moping around and doing nothing. While this book was supposed to be feminist and thus supporting the idea that women need more freedom in a male dominated society (I agree), the main character will win zero sympathy from men and from the small sample size (24ish) of my college class, zero sympathy from about 2/3 of women. The following is why:Imagine that Edna was a man. He quits his job, abandons his kids, complains about how much his life sucks despite being extravagantly wealthy, is extremely selfish, does nothing all day long, and cheats on his wife with two mistresses. I'm fairly sure everyone, male or female, would agree that this guy is a despicable person. The problem I have with this book is that because Edna is a woman, feminism says her actions are okay.

I really like the confusion Edna had. She had always loved Robert and she first realised it when he went to Mexico. This is a typical situation, when you loose something or someone, you start wanting it more. Another thing that is important to mention, is the fact that \\"The awakening\\" was writing in 1899. When it was published, people said it was immoral. It was censured, because of its hard criticism to the Creoles. But today you can learn from this book, you can see how strong love is. Edna was one of the most beautiful and charming ladies of her circle, she had an amazing family and a husband that apparently cared about her. That was what people saw, but she wasn't happy. She had never really kissed a man until she met Arobin. When she kissed Robert, she felt in love for the first time in her life. I've always like love stories, but this one is much more than that.

Few books more accurately describe the reality of life, how it ebbs and flows. Chopin created a set of highly-believable, rounded characters who live and breathe, who are full of contradictions and sometimes act impulsively and irrationally, just as we do. Edna Pontellier, the protagonist, is one of literature's great female characters: complex, multi-faceted, and, above all, believable. This novel is much more, and also much less, than the feminists who point to it as their Bible make it out to be. The ending is one of literature's great ambiguities. Is Chopin advocating female independence? Condemning Victorian domesticity? We'll never know, of course, which is a large part of the reason this book continues to fascinate. On top of all this, the novel is beautifully written. Chopin writes spellbinding, poetic prose that stirs and enlivens the soul. Her descriptions of the New Orleans area are breathtaking. A short, but captivating read, this can be plowed through fairly quickly, but it is highly-enjoyable and leaves the reader with a lot to think about for a book so short.

While I can clearly see why this book fell into this category (it deals with the liberation of women from male-dominated society), I was not greatly impressed by it.While Chopin does a fair job of giving details of the thought processes of Edna, one does not become as enlightened or &quot;awakened&quot; as one would hope upon reading this book. The book's ending leads one to feel that there really is no awakening or escape for women from the traps of the rules imposed by the male-dominated society.Overall, I felt this book was not terrible, but certainly was not remarkable either."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The Awakening is indeed one of the best books I have ever read. Kate Chopin did a wonderful job of presenting Edna Pontellier, the main character, as a woman who struggles in a society where women are the property of men. Her love for art and music enabled her to gain a form of independence that only she and an older lady named Mademoiselle Reisz can understand. Mademoiselle Reisz is not necessarily an attractive woman, but she is the kind of idol that Edna adores. Reisz was very knowledgeable in both music and art. Having never been married and have children, Reisz was in independent woman making a living all by herself. Edna, coming from a family of Presbyterians, purposely married a Catholic named Leonce Pontellier to get back at her father, The Colonel, and Margaret, her older sister. Edna constantly faces many awakenings throughout her life as she struggles for independence from control of men. She defies her husband and lets him know that she is not his property. This leads to a conflict between the two. Leonce believes that Edna is not a good mother and cares little for both her children and him [Leonce]. Edna, on the other hand, believes that it is Leonce who cares little for his family and more about his wealth, property, and popularity. As Edna spends more time with Robert, her attitude towards Leonce begins to get stranger and stranger. This enabled Chopin to introduce a middleman between the Edna and Leonce; a physician named Doctor Mandelet. Mandelet met with the two on separate occasions and formulates a diagnosis to cure Edna from such strange behavior. Days before Leonce leaves for a business trip, Edna began having feelings for a young carefree man named Robert Lebrun. There is a hidden love between the two. They do not admit to each other's love, but can sense it through their emotional side. Trying to avoid falling in love with a married woman, Robert leaves town and heads for Mexico, trying to clear his head from thinking about Edna. Robert, While Robert is away, Edna begins to feel an even stronger love for Robert. Kate Chopin developed a wonderful plot in which the story constantly circles around Edna. While Edna has Robert on her mind, the author did an incredibly brilliant choice by introducing another character by the name of Alcee Robin. Alcee enjoys making conquests of married women and eventually goes for Edna. After meeting Alcee through the horseracing games, Edna begins to get intimate with Alcee. Not feeling enough independence from her husband Leonce, Edna decides to move into a tiny birdcage-like house where she buys all the necessities to make a decent living with the money she made from winning races. The climax began to increase when Robert finally came back from Mexico. This is where Edna began playing mind-games with Robert by seeing him less and less. Days later, Edna decided to go to the beach to take a stroll along the coast. Having a deep sensation for swimming, she undressed herself and slowly began swimming away from the shore. She regards her sons as the chain that binds her to a form of slavery that she detested. Moments later after extreme exhaustion, Edna drowns and dies.

This book could have been so much more had Edna been granted more time to work through her confusion and draw upon her own not insubstantial inner resources.

It was bad seen and was forbiden for more than 50 years. The idea that a woman, a married woman, would laeve her husband and her children, to live with another man,wasnt allowed in her society. Im not saying that nowdays such a thing is allowed, but in those earlies days, this thing wasnt even thought, thats why this book can not have a happy end for Edna, because in no way her dream would have been come true. Personally Y think Robert loved Edna vey much, but he knew, he never could have been with the woman he loved. Her friend Madmoisselle Reisz, told her she needed to be strong to face her feelings and let Robert by side, because he finally would destroy her life. At the end that was what finally happened, Ednas complete life turned around Robert until that point, in the absence of her husband, she left home with the only purpuse of beeing alone until Roberts return.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"On the cover page the following sentence caught my eye: \\"Written nearly one hundred years ago, THE AWAKENING is the compelling story of an extraordinary modern woman struggling against the constraints of marriage and motherhood, and slowly discovering the power of her own sexuality\\" (Avon Books). And truthfully, yes, that does sum everything up into a nice tidy bow. The novel is primarily about Edna Pontellier a woman in a loveless marriage. Edna wakes up from her half dead sleep once she embraces the emotions she didn't know she could even express. Edna embodies the classic tale of Phoenix: she is completely reborn.The courage Chopin possessed to write this one hundred years ago is extraordinary. This is a feminist novel without being negative towards men. More than that, she explores feminine psyche in such a way that this novel could have been written in our time. But clearly, as the introductory page indicates, it was written nearly (now over) one hundred years ago. I can see why it was banned from libraries and schools. Edna, our protagonist, stands out from the rest of the Creole characters. Unlike the other women, she is not particularly attached to her children. She loves them of course, but she doesn't dote on them as the mothers (like Madame Ratignolle), nor does she seem to believe that the world revolves around her husband. On the contrary, Edna feels a longing she cannot explain. A belief that there is something more out there than just this. Psychologically this reminds me extensively of \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Everyone else is so quick to diagnose her without even wanting to listen to what she wants! Though we cannot be for certain (since it is merely implied but not stated), it appears that Edna also displays symptoms of depression.Edna goes through a complete metamorphosis with her character. Her deconstruction begins by getting over her fear of swimming. There is such a beautiful scene with her swimming in the ocean after a party in the evening, with other people swimming and watching her. She keeps swimming until it frightens her how far she has ventured and she returns elated to her husband (who of course only says she didn't really go that far out). The turning point happens later when Robert (another man) returns with her and wishes her a good night and for the first time in YEARS she \\"felt pregnant with the first-felt throbbings of desire\\" (51). It is here that Edna AWAKENS from her half awake-half dead going-through-the-motions life. It is after this scene that her husband and people begin to notice a difference within her.There are so many memorable scenes in this novel. What I enjoyed the most was seeing Edna's growth as an individual. Instead of doing wifely duties of visiting with her husbands' client's wives, she chose to go to the horse races and gamble (and win). She painted and committed herself to reading more and educating herself. She sold her paintings for money. She bought her own small abode (the pigeon house). She firmly established herself as an independent, career-oriented full person. She loved her children, but felt more at peace when they were gone. There is something to be said about that; not all women, Ms. Chopin may have been saying, should aspire to only be mothers. Why can't women enjoy themselves?I won't spoil the ending but let me just say that it is very fitting. Even though it is the end of the novel Chopin leaves the readers thinking that Edna's life is just now beginning. Some will disagree, and that's what makes it so powerful. There is an implied ending, but truly we - as only students of literature - will never know for sure."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Kate Chopin's The Awakening, opens in the late 1800s in Grand Isle, a summer resort very popular with the wealthy inhabitants of New Orleans. Edna Pontellier is vacationing with her husband, L&eacute;once, and their two sons at the cottages of Madame Lebrun. Edna spends most of her time with her friend Ad&egrave;le Ratignolle, because her husband is constantly engulfed with his career. Being a woman of elegance and charisma, Edna's relationship with Ad&egrave;le, helps her learn and explore freedom of expression. Suppressed for much of her life, Edna begins to leave her sheltered world and delves into what life really constitutes, with the help of Ad&egrave;le.Although many themes and motifs are evident, the repressed emotions and desires run wild within this novel. A lesson learned in this novel is about the freedom of expression for women. For the protagonist of The Awakening, independence and solitude are almost inseparable. With the demanding expectations of tradition, coupled with the restrictions of the law, women in the late 1800's had minimal opportunities for individual expression. Thus, the novel uses Edna and her place on the societal ladder to create a gradual awakening, in which she soon will discover her own identity and acknowledge her emotional and sexual desires. I found this novel to be a very thought-provoking and stimulating piece of literature that really analyzed the imperfections of society, especially when they passed harsh judgment on the individuals, particularly women. I found it interesting as to how much the main character needed to become independent and seek to find her true self. I found it quite powerful as to how all of the motifs, themes, and symbols were correlated, as each one had a role in leading to the awakening of the main character, Edna Pontellier.For me, the usage of symbols stood out the most. I believe it was a very important tool that was used to help the reader see Edna's progression of an awakening. Symbols are portrayed through objects, characters, figures, and even colors. They represent very complex or abstract concepts. Thus, I found this novel to be filled with many of these. For example, the images of children correlate with Edna, as she is trying to undergo a form of rebirth. In the novel, she gradually discovers a world coupled with her fresh and childlike perspectives. However, as a child, Edna becomes self-absorbed, tending to ignore others around her and fails to think of the consequences that will follow her actions and poor judgment.In another example of how symbolism is so evident, in The Awakening, the sea essentially symbolizes the yearning for freedom and escape. The correlation with water in the novel is used because it is associated with the cleansing and rebirth of an individual. It is much like a fresh start. Edna's gradual awakening is a rebirth in many aspects. The sea constitutes Edna's realization of how much depth there is in the world, along with the many depths of humans as well. This vast expansion serves as a both a symbol of peace, yet can also be the tool that leads to the destruction of an individual because of how it beckons and entices Edna throughout the novel.It is evident that the main character, Edna, was truly alone in a world in which she found no comfort nor acceptance by society. The inescapable scorns of society were forever embedded within her heart. Therefore, in reference to what I stated in the previous paragraph, as I read the ending of the novel, it was written that Edna had returned to Grand Idle, being the place of her sexual, emotional, and intellectual awareness. Unfortunately, that once seemingly peaceful space that was so evident earlier on, turned and enticed Edna to merge with it, being her final escape.Edna's suicide to me was surprising. However, it raises the question of whether it was the prudent action to take. It leaves the reader to ponder and explore whether Edna's suicidal thoughts and actions really constituted a surrender to society and the suppression of one's true self. Or, it can be argued that her actions were merely upon reaching her awakening, a means to finally be set free. I've read that critics who argue that Edna's suicide marks defeat, are supported by the symbolism of the bird imagery found in the novel. \\"A bird with a broken wing was beating the air above, reeling, fluttering, circling disabled down, down to the water.\\" Once again, the powerful symbolism ties in the novel, as it helps the reader see how Edna was arriving to an awakening. Therefore, I see that Edna was the bird whom finally, after all of her struggles, fell to the mercy of the water. Whether this was the right choice, however, is open for discussion and can be interpreted in many ways. Thus, the novel ends with this scenario, constituting a reason for discussion regarding the reasons behind why Edna gave up her wings to the vast and never-ending sea."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

The book was even taken off some library shelves and the author was barred from the prominent literary club of which she was a member. All of this caused her humiliation. Unfortunately, author Kate Chopin lived to write only one other novel, and died a few years later.By today's standard, \\"Awakening\\" is a tame portrayal of the \\"new woman\\" who struggles to be free of traditional fetters, traditional roles, to be her own individual, a woman longing to satisfy her hidden dreams and forbidden romantic passions.David Rehakauthor of \\"Love and Madness\\""},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

While emotional and sexual liberation have inspired some great artistic works in the last century, Chopin here is refreshing precisely because Edna Pontellier's \\"awakening\\" is portrayed as nebulous, ethereal, and above all, inarticulate. Edna is not sure what she is feeling. She knows only that her new feelings of love have no place in her society. Indeed, Chopin shows that for a woman to be awake emotionally at this time in history is to be psychologically isolated and socially estranged.

The language, although somewhat arcane, is straightforward, the characters are fairly flat and unchanging, and even Chopin's style clearly displays her lack of training in the art of writing great literature. However, it seems to me that if the reader allows himself or herself to judge the novel solely on this basis, he or she has fallen for the facade of The Awakening. For, despite her style, Chopin has created a masterpiece with this story. In my opinion, its significance is not in its strikingly feminist view of the constraints of the world on women, but rather in its personalized impact on the reader. Not to think, &quot;why do I understand Edna's plight?&quot; is to miss the point. This novel is meant to make the reader place Edna as sort of a parallel figure to his or her own life, to help us realize our own worldly constraints, to &quot;Awaken&quot; us to another option, a different path that we did not even realize was there. By doing this, the novel transcends its simplicity and appears as the beautiful work it really is.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Nearly one- hundred years old, The Awakening is a book that goes into great detail about a remarkable woman, Edna Pontellier, who discovers her own sexuality at a slow rate, after having to overcome hardships and tragedies within her family and marriage.When Edna was twenty-eight years old, she spent the summer in the Grand Isle with her children, which was a prime coastal community that was on the Gulf of Mexico. Eventually she is away from her husband, Leonce Pontellier, and releases her own self to her deepest desires. This enflames her heart and eventually blinds her to all else.Of course, Edna is the protagonist, along with Robert Lebrun. Kate Chopin uses her brilliance to create unpleasant, yet interesting conflicts in the book. For instance, Leonce Pontellier, the antagonist, complained to Edna, his wife, about her duties as a mother. He believed her not to be a good mother when she arrived late coming home one night. This hurts her, but she soon believes she can earn the respect she need form Robert.Kate Chopin wanted to convey the fact that sometimes you have to look deep within one self to discover who you are and what your limits are. Kate uses Edna as symbolism to most women. Sometimes women, even today, have a hard time understanding their own sexuality.I really enjoyed this book, and it even had me wondering about myself. I don't think I would include anything else to this book, but I do think that Kate Chopin could have gonad into more detail about Edna's specific thoughts.

I think this book was really ahead of its time. The concept of a woman realizing her true potential, or reconsidering major decisions she'd made in her life is, I believe, something that happens to many women today. In many cases, only until a woman has accomplished all of her goals, or attained everything she ever wanted, will she then start to reassess her life and ask herself some difficult questions, like how did she get to where she is today, or did she make the right decisions in her life, or is this the life really what she wanted, or is this all there is for her? I've read some pretty harsh reviews of this book and I don't really know what the intentions of the author were, but I still think that this is a very important novel, especially for any woman who is struggling with balancing the responsibilities she has towards her family, and redifining herself as an individual, or part of the rest of the world. Personally, it comforts me to know that women were facing these very same issues such a long time ago.The book was a fast read, but in all its simplicity, the main character spoke to me deeply. I gave it only four stars however, because the resolution of the story was pretty depressing. Although, in Victorian times, divorce wasn't an option and people weren't as forgiving as they are today, so I can see how the protagonist saw no other way."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The Awakening by Kate Chopin is the story of a woman who is not enjoying her married life. The story begins with the narrator telling us quite a bit of detail about the characters. We learn about Mr. L&eacute;once Pontellier, and his wife, Mrs. Edna Pontellier, the character who will be \\"awakened\\" in the story. It is important to know that she is the only person in the story who is not a Creole. The Pontiellier's spend their summer on an island off of New Orleans called Grand Isle with their children. We later find out that Edna is not enjoying her husband, but all her friends think L&eacute;once is a perfect husband.When they later go back to New Orleans for the winter, Mr. Pontellier has to go to New York for business purposes and the children go away with his mother. Mrs. Pontellier does not want to go. During this time, Edna moves to another house without her husband's approval. She begins to \\"awaken\\" and see other men, but her first love has always been Robert, a man she met on Grand Isle last summer. But Robert went to Mexico for a job, but probably he goes because he loves Edna but does not want to enter into an affair with her. Later, Alc&eacute;e Arobin is another man whom Edna flirts with.Mrs. Pontellier also has a couple woman friends. One of those friends is Ad&egrave;le Ratignolle, who is a married Creole woman with many children. She is quite different from Edna because she enjoys her married life. She also knows Madamoiselle Reisz, an unmarried musician who Edna likes to visit and to listen to her play the piano. Mrs. Pontellier gets the idea about doing some painting from her. These fine friends of her guide her to her \\"awakening\\" which changes her life.Throughout the story, things are going on in Mrs. Pontellier's mind. She's constantly evaluating her married life with L&eacute;once and the children. Although she loves the children, Edna is unable to commit her life to them. The main theme of this story is that she is struggling within her own boundaries trying to awaken herself. She is married to a Creole, but not one herself, which adds to her life trouble of being with an incompatible husband. Perhaps some women around the turn of twentieth century were coping with similar struggles, but with no feasible solution."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

The complexity of every person that the reader meets is stunning. I found myself imagining where these people lived and how they spent their weekends. When relationships began to develop they had a quality of realism that I had never experienced before.

It is thus easy to overlook how revolutionary and shocking the events and ideas of this story must have seemed at the time. Then, the book was banned from public libraries; now, it is required reading in public schools.In many ways, both in theme and treatment, it resembles \\"Madame Bovary\\". Although Chopin lacks Flaubert's scope and breadth of vision, she reaches deeper into the soul of her heroine. Her style is restrained and elegant and some modern readers, accustomed to a pacier and more explicit treatment, may grow impatient at times.

Almost an American &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, &quot; The Awakening&quot; sets the plight of Chopin's hapless heroine against the colorful details of late 19th Century New Orleans, skillfully interweaving Chopin's recurring theme of the tensions between the traditional Creole way of life and the more aggressive American culture. The author's themes of boredom, lack of fulfillment, and our often slow realization of our own personalities and limitations are touching and effective in their presentation. All in all, a moving and undervalued work by a significant American Woman author. (Those who seek to draw moral judgments on plot ideas such as adultery, lying, etc. probably shouldn't be reading fiction anyway.

Sad because of the conflict Mrs. Pontellier is having. Sad because of her lonliness. Yet it is also alluring because Edna _does_ eventually break away from her pre-determined role; because she finally _does_ awaken--and she is free.One can easily relate to Edna Pontellier and her internal struggle with society and her Self, whether one is male or female.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"A good friend recommended this book to me. She found the book highly entertaining and inspirational. I found it very depressing and \\"uninspirational\\". If this book is supposed to influence women to find and assert themselves, then I think it falls far short. Edna is a selfish, spoiled young wife and mother who in my opinion became bored with her life. She was unappreciative and she was not brave enough to do something constructive about it. IF she had chosen to walk away from her home and family and pursue something that would fulfill her solitary life or help others I would have at least tried to understand her way of thinking. She did not \\"free\\" herself as so many commentaries will lead readers to believe. She simply made a dismal prison for herself. If she had at the very least dedicated herself to becoming the artist she could have and showed the world she could support herself without the aid of her husband, then I would have grudgingly admired her even though her selfish decisions affected her children and her husband. We are supposed to think that by her suicide she freed her soul to become one with the solitary sea. What rubbish....she let her emotions rule her thinking. The doctor was right. She was going through a spell of some sort. She was obviously sick in some way. I did not feel sorry for her; I felt sorry for her husband who tried to give her space to find herself. And her poor children. They did not ask to come into the world and of course they needed their mother. If this book is supposed to help women understand that their roles are just as important as men's roles and that they are not second class citizens, then it has failed miserably. I would NOT recommend this book for young women who are looking for inspiration to become all they can be. Unfortunately, all it proves is what some men would have us believe....we let our emotions rule us and that in a moment of intense weakness we are not strong enough to face the world and carry on. Edna let her love for a man, Robert, define who she was. By all means read this book if you are down on men and the wonderfully fulfilling traditional role of wife and motherhood, but don't expect to be uplifted or inspired by it. It aggravated me more than anything. I would like to add this...Chopin's writing is beautifully descriptive. She did make me see, smell, and even hear the setting of her story. Very few writers have been able to do this. I would certainly read more stories by the author although I have a feeling I will not agree with her view points. She did have a great talent."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The Awakening disputes the double-standard put on women. Why is it fair for men to have different standards than women? Men are allowed to be themselves and rarely be ridiculed. Kate Chopin, the author, explores the ideas unfairly put upon women. After reading The Awakening, many feelings toward society may be altered.Edna Pontellier, was an enlightening main character who struggled with creating herself. She was stuck between who she was expected to be, and who she was really. Especially in the early 1900s, women were expected to follow a certain standard. Edna neither felt close to her children nor her husband though she was expected to be a good mother and wife. What is a women supposed to do?Because of the conflicts women face, Kate Chopin explored the possibility that women should be happy, rather than just follow the norm. Women need to follow their hearts and passions, no matter what society thinks.As the story unfolds, each character helps readers identify a different type of person in society. Mr. Pontellier is so concerned with what everyone thinks that he looks past the pain his wife is experiencing. He would rather make everything look okay on the outside, than to explore the problems on the inside. This is very true in everyday life.The Awakening has survived the test of time because it portrays society very accurately. All women unanimously can agree to the fact that there is a double-standard placed between men and women. Edna is a strong woman who faces society to even the ranks between men and women. The struggle to be satisfied, although, leaves Edna with a very changing decision."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Even my literature professor (in another of my short and aborted seasons in the academy), who was given to short bursts of impassioned homily about the universal sacrifice of women and the universal culpability of men, etc. admitted that the book was weak, but she was also teaching women's studies, so The Awakening was going to stay.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"In Kate Chopin's social critique, The Awakening, the author addresses issues of womanly status in daily society. Chopin's protagonist Edna Pontellier, whose life is somewhat less than perfect, faces these \\"issues\\". After marrying a man whom she says was \\"purely an accident\\" (23), and mothering two children for whom she feels indifferent about, she finds herself longing for adventure, passion, true love and for freedom from the prison that she allows herself to succumb to. Through a series of events, Edna is \`awakened' to a new outlook on life. Through love, scandal, betrayal, and death Chopin demonstrates the power of female sexuality versus the oppressive society \\"as an individual to the world within and about her\\" (18).This story tells the tale of a woman searching for happiness. Edna Pontellier does find it. She finds fulfillment in the country where she vacations to visit a friend. In this place she is introduced to a new, more liberal, way of living: the kind of living where there is no one to please other than ones self. It is here that Edna is content. But when Edna finally returns to her home in New Orleans, she is overwhelmed by the sudden domination society places on her newfound liberation. The only thing that is questionable about this story, is the question, is Edna liberated at the end? Or not? In my opinion I believe she liberates herself by committing suicide: she gave up entirely.Although Edna may seem that gives up, it is apparent that she did feel unshackled from much of her previous entrapments, she states here, while speaking to her lover Robert, \\"I am no longer one of Mr. Pontellier's possessions to dispose of or not. I give myself where I choose\\" (133). In saying this, she demonstrates an attitude of overwhelming liberalism, unlike that of the women of her time, raising another good argument: Kate Chopin wrote this novel in 1899. In this era, women were not supposed to think this way about their own lives; they weren't supposed to think of themselves, the ultimate needs of the family were meant to be the only concern of theirs. But Chopin's view of the treatment of women, though criticized by many, is a timely argument. The Awakening pinpoints this impairment to women, \\"'you are burnt beyond recognition', he added, \`looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of personal property that has suffered some damage'\\" (4). Here, demonstrates how women are treated as objects-no wonder Edna felt so strongly about her discontent in her marriage, it was never a team effort.As Edna first begins to have her awakening, she says, \\"A certain light was beginning to dawn dimly within her-the light which, showing the way, forbids it\\" (18). It is almost as if she must repel her newfound liberation in order to appeal to society as a good mother-but this is all a faade, Edna realizes that her ways are false and instead she decides to live according to her own rules.Although Edna may seem like a great candidate for a women's rights campaign, it is easy to think differently of her when she speaks of her family. Selfishness exudes from her every word, \\"They were apart of her life. But they need not have thought that they could possess her, body and soul\\" (143). The fact that she is so inwardly focused, was enough for me as a reader to lose my compassion for her. I feel that a wife, and certainly a mother, should most definitely express an undeniable strong devotion for one's family.Right after stating this, Edna drowns herself in the sea, ending her internal struggle once and for all. This ending feels utterly incomplete, I felt as a reader that there was no closer, or cultivating, intellectually challenging ended. It literally just ended, which led me to the conclusion that I believe this book is very controversial and there are many different interpretations of what is right or wrong. But I came to realize that it does make you think twice about life in general, but it left me pondering a question: \\"Am I content with my life, or do I constantly long for more?\\".The Awakening is a classic novel, which tells the tale of how one woman overcame conformity by liberating herself from society's oppressiveness, and instead following her own dreams, desires, and passion for the feeling of happiness. Although there are a few lingering questions and some loose ends toward the end, it is ultimately a good read, even if your view of life does not drastically change, if you enjoy a twisted love story, this would be an enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

One summer while her husband is out of town, Edna takes steps to mold her own sexual identity by having an affair with a younger man.Readers need to look at this book in the context of its time. In this day and age, there's nothing remarkable about an unhappy housewife who seeks comfort in the arms of another man. However, back when this book was written, it created a major scandal: writing so candidly about women's sexual urges and marital infidelity was very taboo. I personally don't think that Kate Chopin's novel is one of the best written books of its age, but it's a landmark novel because it was the first book to ever tackle such \\"forbidden\\" subjects, and you have to give it a lot of credit.This is a very short book divided into extremely brief chapters, which makes it a pretty quick read. Although it's easy to sympathize with Edna's situation, she strikes me as being a very selfish character, and I think that put a major damper on the story for me. I thought that the resolution of Edna and Robert's affair was a bit anticlimactic, but what Edna chooses to do on the very last page is pretty shocking.Overall, I recommend this book, but I think many people will find that it doesn't live up to their expectations."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

The book especially looked bad in contrast to the 2 read right before (Jane Eyre and Little Women) and the Handmaid's Tale that followed it. All three show the sheer power of a novel written by an intelligent woman with a wonderful story to tell. Looking at some of the other reviews, I see a depiction of this novel as the story of the &quot; emancipation of women&quot; and &quot;female independence&quot;. There are many novels that express this theme with good prose, though, and without utterly boring the reader to death.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Both negative and positive \\"customer critics\\" of Kate Chopin's The Awakening are partly right. Ms. Pontellier, as a sensitive, thinking human being, chafes under the restraints of a male dominated world. She longs for the sexual and emotional freedom of men and her frustration ultimately leads her to make an extreme decision(I am vague here out of consideration for those who do not want the plot given away.) She is also partly frustrated however by the often transitory and impermanent nature of love itself--her condition is thus partly a human condition, not just an oppressed woman's condition. I believe Kate Chopin is aware of both those factors. This awareness is part of what makes this a work of literature rather than a mere propaganda piece or mere pulp entertainment. However, there is yet another factor that Chopin is only partly aware of and that is the oppressive nature of class society. Edna Pontellier is a pampered bourgeois woman who realizes her own \\"comfortable\\" enslavement but habits of selfishness due to her class upbringing leave her unappreciative of the proper social perspective that would make her more cognizant of a proper balance of one's rights and responsibilities as a member of society. I mean society in general, not high society. She is not fully aware of the fact that her leisure is contingent on the exploited labor of others and that she does have responsibility to her children if not her husband. All of these contradictory factors are swirled together and and some readers will fail to appreciate how entangled they are, choosing instead to pick one piece of the puzzle and ignore the rest. The result is a black or white view of the book and/or its main character. Chopin is ahead of her time (1890s)in some ways and rather typical of it in other ways. The swimming metaphor is well-developed, complex and ultimately tragic and ironic. There are also many insightful descriptions of emotional states. The Awakening certainly broke some new ground in exploring feminist themes but it is hardly a model for enlightened feminist conduct. This book is recommended with reservations."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Edna becoming independent from her chauvenistic husband begins to understand the true meaning to life. It is in this true meaning of life that she learns how to live. Only through experience and hardships can one become truly free. I rated this novel by giving it 5 stars. I would recommend this novel to a reader that likes to read about someone overcoming weaknesses.

THE AWAKENING is perfect for a classroom discussion on emerging Feminism or for Women's Studies in general. One hundred years later this book still promotes heated debate among readers, for it can be considered on various levels. Chopin's style is deliberately ambiguous at times--leaving readers with many unanswered questions.Set in Creole America (New Orleans and the steamy Gulf Coast waters), this tale appears simplistic on the surface, dabbling along with little discernable advancement of plot. But do not be deceived by the apparently calm surface, for beneath the lazy days and lifestyle of the idle rich lurk hidden currents of treacherous temptation, as a young woman comes of Emotional age and resents her caged existence.While vacationing with other members of New Orleans Society on Grand Isle, Enda Pontellier feels the faint stirrings of her own sexuality, chafing in her prescribed role as obedient wife and devoted mother. There must be more to life than just this vaapid stagnation of the soul. Her attraction for a perennial beach beau--assumed harmless by all husbands--leads her to desire more from life. The men may be portrayed as stereotypes, but Edna emerges as a sensuous and intelligent young woman who attemps to deal with her frustrations. Yet as she struggles to become a woman, she often surrenders her will, seemingly content to float with the fluctuating tides of fate and chance. No longer satisfied to serve as a mere ornament in a casual marriage, Edna sacrifices her reputation, her family and even more--to prove to herself and one other that she does possess the courage to be an &quot;artist.&quot; But does the cost prove too great?"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Edna Pontellier, the protagonist of Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening,&quot; lives in New Orleans in the 1890's. She seems to have it all--two lovely children, physical beauty, an extremely comfortable lifestyle, and good social standing. However, one summer, Edna experiences the aforementioned &quot;awakening,&quot; and she realizes that her life is vapid and devoid of meaning. She is a trophy wife who has no real connection to her husband. She loves her children, but she is not extremely involved with them. Who is Edna? What does she want? She wants to experience life to the fullest, without constraint. She wants personal freedom, without the need to conform to the social mores of her day. However, she does not want to harm her children while seeking her own personal fulfillment. Edna's torment leads to a deep depression. The reason that this book has attracted so much attention is that it was written a century ago, long before women had heard of &quot;liberation&quot;. Chopin's writing is eloquent and moving. She describes Edna's agony in a way that is surprisingly modern. Although it is difficult to sympathize with a woman who is not mired in poverty and who has a great deal to be thankful for, I understand that she feels stifled by a lifestyle that does not suit her. It is astonishing that a woman, writing in the 1890's, would articulate this radical viewpoint. She must have received a great deal of criticism at the time. This book does have some flaws. Some of the key characters are not fully fleshed out. Robert, Edna's close friend, is a handsome and affectionate companion, but little more. Mr. Pontellier, Edna's husband, is an insensitive lout, who treats his wife in the way that he would treat a pet. These caricatures weaken the book. I get the feeling that Chopin is so anxious to convey her &quot;message&quot; that she feels the need to stereotype the men in Edna's life. However, &quot;The Awakening&quot; is a book that articulates a viewpoint that is way ahead of its time, and for that alone, it is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

The characters are very well done -- not all of them are deep, but for good reason. Chopin's writing style never ceases to amaze. I've read this book three or four times, and it never loses its power, its impact. There are themes throughout that give the story a deeper meaning. When you read it, think about the elderly widow and what she represents, and the young lovers. Everything means something, and it is all tied together very well. It's the best book I've ever read. I simply love it."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"When THE AWAKENING was first published at the end of the 19th century, Kate Chopin was roundly criticized for what her critics saw as her attempts to subvert the \\"normal\\" order of the male superiority to women. She found it difficult to find a publisher for her future works, and it took a very long time before this book was resurrected by a growing feminist movement that saw in Edna Pontellier a potent symbol of a woman who was willing to pay the ultimate penalty to shed the patriarchal shackles that bound American women.Edna is a twenty-nine year old woman, married, has children, and in thoroughly conventional, at least at the start. But Chopin uses foreshadowing to indicate that all is not well in the Pontellier household. Her husband is a much older stuffy bear of a man who thinks in a stereotypical fashion that today's feminists would term male chauvinist. When Edna comes in with a sunburn, he looks at her \\"as one looks at a valuable piece of property.\\" As long as Edna remains valuable in the sense that she maintains her status of subservience, then as far as he is concerned, all is well with her, and by extension, their relationship. As Edna begins to show slight but measurable changes in her personality, it becomes clear that when he married Edna, he married a woman who was normalized to function only in the narrow confines of her immediate surroundings. But change she does in a way that Chopin ironically notes: \\"He thought it very discouraging that his wife, who was the sole object of his existence, evinced so little interest in things which concerned him and valued so little his conversation.\\" Not only does Chopin indicate that Edna is drifting away from her husband but also toward a state of depressive non-existence: \\"An indescribable oppression, which seemed to generate in some unfamiliar part of her consciousness, filled her whole being with a vague anguish.\\" This anguish becomes increasingly pronounced as she attempts to fill the void with an affair with Robert Lebrun, who says that he has fallen in love with her, but he soon enough takes off to Mexico. When she later questions him why he left and why she was the one to contact him, he replied that he loved her too much to maintain contact with a married woman.The pivotal point occurs at the end when Edna takes off her clothes and strolls out into the sea and drowns. Her motivation is not clear, possibly because Kate Chopin takes the actions of a woman who had been portrayed as strong-willed enough to leave her husband and children, find suitable accommodations for herself, and aggressively pursue the object of her affections. True, he dumps her with a note, which she uses as the reason for her suicide. Was her death wish the result of a woman who has suddenly turned weak-willed enough to allow her depression to overwhelm her or was Chopin using Edna To Make A Statement about the rights of an oppressed gender? No one has yet devised a suitable motivation but her closing call of death serves to warn us that the complexities of an unfulfilled life, when unaddressed, can lead to tragedy. Edna's exit certainly attests to that."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"It was hard to read this book at first because of Kate Chopin's style of writing. But once I got used to it after a few pages, I really got into the book. The reader really comes to feel Edna's pain and want for freedom. I must give Chopin tons of props for having enough courage to write a strong female character and daring to use sensuality and lust in her book, even though it was written in the late 1800s (a time that even mentioning a passionate kiss on the lips in literature was forbidden). I got so into the book that I felt as if I were Edna living in a opressed world. Read this book to learn or get more knowledge on how women were treated during the Victorian Era...it is a must read!"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"...but many reviewers, especially those who do hail it as the great 19th Feminist work, miss some glaring problems with the text. Before I get into that, let's go ahead and satisfy the skimmers: This book's only mildly entertaining by today's standards, though quite rebellious, and has a nice little argument to offer on what it means to be, not just a woman, but an artist (something, though, that the main character is unable to do). It's set down in Louisiana, so as a piece of the local color movement it also has quite a bit of appeal. Assuming you can find the style interesting (hopefully if you've ended up here on this book, you can), Chopin very skillfully captures the dialect and social dynamic of the region.K, that done...problem number one: Many servants (and, by extension, African-American) characters are almost deliberately marginalized. For well over half of the book they are all (with the small exception of Joe) refered to by either their job (cook, maid, etc.) or racial heritage (\\"the quadroon,\\" \\"the mulatto,\\" etc.). Now, other white characters are similarly treated, but in each case they are also dignified with heavy symbolic weight (\\"the lady in black\\" and \\"lovers on the beach\\" best represent this). Why? I don't argue that Chopin herself is racist--far from it--but there is no doubt that her main character is, at least to some extent, and as a feminist heroine, she is weakened by it.Second (and probably most obvious): The ending. Don't worry, I'm not going to give it away (though if you've read \\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\" by Goethe, then you'll see it coming). Regardless, you'll know it when you get to it. It's a big, big problem when your protagonist is supposed to be a model of heroism.There are other problems with this as a purely feminist text, but they are either minor, or related to the two above. At any point, I'm not going to get into them. However, all these problems may be resolved. To this point, a lot of weight has been attached to this book both because of Chopin's overt feminism in her other works (the \\"Story of an Hour\\" comes to mind) and because feminists in the 60's and 70's just seemed to want to rally around it, and as a result many of these problems have just been glossed over. They are resolvable, even from a feminist perspective, but only by rejecting most of the weight that has already been thrust upon it and wholly re-evaluating the book; pay attention to Madameiselle Reisz, though--she helps in these resolution. I only point these inconsistencies out so that hopefully you might read more critically, and not be overwhelmed by the blind vigor that many proponents scream over it with. Four stars for its depth of feminism, not for it's blunt force."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

And it still has the power to make its readers eyes grow wide.My only complaints are that the ending was unrealistic. (Of course, it fit the BOOK completely---it just wasn't practical.) I also think the portrayal of Edna as a nonchalant mother (as opposed to a nurturing mother) was unfair. Chopin wanted readers to view Edna as a victim, and when Edna turned around and neglected her own children...that didn't help our sympathy for her. ...Yet surely we readers realized this was a woman who was too oppressed and stifled to know what to do with herself.Anyway, before I forget, a word of caution: HAVE A DICTIONARY NEARBY!! WHOA! Chopin was obviously VERY intelligent, along with being ahead of her time. Vocab. word after vocab. word, I tell ya.Overall, the reader feels pity for practically every character. But it's not such a melancholy atmosphere that would make one want to stop reading it; it's merely proof that Chopin can weave a web of believable characters struggling with believable circumstances.I would voice one more disappointment, though, if it wouldn't serve as a spoiler. ...Um, I think I was hoping that Edna would betray her husband a little more than she did...succumb to temptation a bit more...because I was rooting for her! I was sympathizing with her, and I thought she should get what she has longed for. But no such luck. Her conscience probably prevented something from going too far.

I feel this book is an extremely valuable illustration of a woman's attempt to define who she is. In doing this, Edna realized that she had no identity of her own. Even though it took an affair to do this, her discovery was still valid. I also think that criticism of this book for this reason is completely off base. For centuries, people have turned their head the other way when men have struggled with affairs. Edna wouldn't have killed herself or maybe even have had these troubles in the first place if her husband had been at all supportive in her endeavors to discover who she was, and to help her out of her depression. By ignoring her needs, he asked for the consequences. Edna's final thoughts were about her children, and they were her main regret for doing what she felt she had to do. All in all, The Awakening is a wonderful piece of work that shows the struggle of both female authors and women alike to take a step out of the kitchen."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

I can see why it is popular with the self-centered culture of today. Just because a woman can write a book doesn't mean it is the greatest book ever written on the female psyche or female self-discovery. The Peter Pan principle keeps jumping into my mind.Edna never did a meaningful thing for anyone including herself. She just became more and more self-induldgent without ever considering the consequences of her disconnect from her family and society. Occasionally, she would feel a pang of guilt regarding the abandonment of her children and proceed to send them a box of bon-bons or indulge in some over-the-top emotional scene. If the children had been girls would she have treated the same? The men in her book were cardboard characters who either provided for her monetarily or emotionally depending on her whim. She couldn't understand why her lover Robert left her. He was doing the honorable thing, she was a married woman with two children. Her husband did not know how to deal with her - he left her to her own devices (with a bank account and servants, mind you).She considered no one except herself and feels no guilt about it. She comes back to this theme over and over again.

Unfortunately, the book doesn't make much sense. When Edna, the protagonist, casts away her public self to become her true self, we might suppose that her quality of life would improve. Instead she exercises poorer and poorer judgment, ultimately destroying herself. Edna is not a likeable or even an authentic character, and the supporting cast is almost as unattractive.

Written in archaic English, sprinkled with French words left undefined, the reader must have on hand a translating dictionary to understand anything at all. The tone was dry and uninteresting, displaying the life of a very lucky woman as a painstaking monotony. The reader had to figure out the character's actions since the story merely implied situations and intentions. The ending was pathetic. The character ruined her life, but she commited suicide because she felt sorry for herself, instead of repenting and facing the consequences. Regreting that she could not reinstitute her first flame, she walked out into the sea, abandoning her innocent children and husband. This character was a coward, not the heroine some claim her to be. The world's view of morality may have changed, but when this book was first published it shocked unsuspecting readers. The book was banned shortly after its release, and in my opinion, should have been burned. It is not worth the paper it is written on. I rated this novel with one star, simply because there was not a lower rating available. I am grateful for the short length of the novel since I was required to finish reading it for a class assignment. If I had been given a choice, I would have closed the book after page one.

It's set in New Orleans and its environs and begins at the Grand Isle resort where wealthy Creole families spend their summers. Edna Pontellier is 28 years old, has two young sons and a distinguished husband who expects her to follow all the conventions of the time. But Edna, who the author always refers to as \\"Mrs. Pontellier\\" is restless and befriends the son of the proprietor of the resort, Robert Lebrun. They are soon mutually attracted to each other and the seeds of a romance are sown. But the summer ends, Robert leaves for Mexico on business and Edna returns to New Orleans with her family.Edna tries hard to live the life arranged for her which consists of staying home in the afternoons and entertaining her women friends. But she is not happy and shockingly leaves her house to visit the home of a piano teacher she met during the summer who sometimes receives letters from Robert. She also goes to horse races with friends where she is thrown into contact with a man who starts to romance her. When her husband leaves town for an extended business venture, Edna starts to break free from the constraints of her life, leading to tragedy.The book is short, a mere 190 pages, but it has a tremendous impact.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The lot of women in the 19th century wasn't a terribly impressive one -- many of them had been reduced to babymakers and inoffensive \\"property\\" for the men.And Kate Chopin caused a massive scandal when she wrote about one woman who drifted from societal normal in \\"The Awakening,\\" leading to a world of exploration, love, and ultimately tragedy. Her misty, vaguely dreamlike writing can pull a reader into the world of 1900s New Orleans and its society, but her heroine sometimes feels more like a vessel than a fully-realized person.Edna Pontellier is the wife of successful New Orleans businessman L&eacute;once, and mother of two lovely young boys. Yet she is dissatisfied by her life, and feels no connection to the other wives and mothers, who idolize their motherhood and subservience. And when she encounters handsome young Creole Robert Lebrun while on vacation, she begins to \\"awake\\" to the feelings she has left behind during her marriage.Distancing herself from Leonce and her sons, Edna begins exploring art and emotions that have been denied her by the strictures of her society -- as well as an affair with the flirtatious Alc&eacute;e Arobin. She even moves out into a cottage of her own, much to the horror of those who thought they knew her. Her romantic feelings have not moved on from Robert, but his return makes her realize how different she has become...Kate Chopin's most famous work is often cited as a sort of proto-feminist work, with a woman rebelling against the male-dominated role she has been given. The fact that a story about a woman abandoning her husband and kids caused such a scandal only adds to that belief.But that's a rather restricted label to give such a versatile author, and \\"Awakening\\" is a book with too many facets to be so restrained. In many ways Chopin resembles a Southern version of Edith Wharton, exploring the stultifying society that she once dwelled in, and the often-tragic consequences of people -- particularly women -- who dared to step outside those unforgiving boundaries.Chopin's lush writing elevates this story even further, weaving an atmospheric, vaguely dreamlike web around everyday New Orleans. She makes readers feel the heat of a summer's day, the remote beauty of a party, the eerie majesty of an empty sea. And though \\"The Awakening\\" is infused by a feeling of languid dreaminess, Chopin creates a feeling of tension and inevitability that grows as the book goes on. It's almost a shock at the book's finale, when that tension releases in a quiet burst of poetic language.And to her credit, Chopin is able to make her points about women and society without setting up straw-men. Such characters as \\"angel of the house\\" Ad&egrave;le Ratignolle and the stuffy Leonce (who sees Edna as his personal property and expects her to obey) are examples of the usual society of the time, yet Leonce is a fully realized character who loves -- but can never understand -- his wife.Perhaps the biggest problem is that Edna herself is at times rather thin as a character. While she has many conflicting desires, she sometimes seems like a mere vessel for all those desires to be displayed over time. But there are some scenes where she does seem like a fully realized person, such as when she meditates on her lack of housewifely virtues, is struck by wild mood swings around her sons, and befriends Mademoiselle Reisz.\\"The Awakening\\" is more than just an early feminist novel -- it's an exquisitely written story about the roads that our own desires can take us down, and the tragedies that can come from it. A must-read, if nothing else for Kate Chopin's powerful writing."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

As I became acquainted with Edna and the awakening she goes through, I found that I could identify with her on a deeply personal level. Many of us have felt that we are living our lives in a false way, as if we have put up a facade to show to the world. Edna desperately wants to be free of her loveless marriage, but even the man with whom she is in love, and who loves her, will not permit her to break her vows to her husband; she belongs to him. To a modern reader, the story is even more of a tragedy, as her unhappiness seems needless.This is a short novel, but doesn't suffer from it's length, or lack thereof. There are several fascinating characters, besides Edna and her lover, Robert. There is also the alluring setting of 1890's New Orleans and its Creole community.

Chopin however draws the story from social struggles of that era. Feminism is a part of the book, but not the reason it's written. Written in the late 19th century, this highly controversial book was banned from bookshelves, although it's hard to see what all the fuss was about today.The main character of the story is Edna Pontellier, and the antagonist is society itself. Edna begins the book as a nave, complacent girl. She conforms to social teachings of how a woman should act and react in certain situations, but something with her doesn't sit quite right; she begins to feel an unconscious desire for independence.Throughout the novel Edna has a series of \\"awakenings\\" (hence the title) which are moments when she becomes a bit more self-reliant. She begins by doing something small, learning how to swim, until her \\"ultimate awakening\\" at the end of the book.I would give this novel 5 out of 5. Not only is this book well written and thought out. But it has a depth to it which compels you to continue reading until the end.

She loves her children, but not always...possibly postpartum depression that is continually getting worse. I believe the things Edna questions are not limited to women. I imagine many men of that time and now get married because it is the thing to do. Pursue jobs they do not like, but must take. Have children because that is what is expected. I believe Chopin is questioning societal expections of her time for both men and women. Clearly Leonce is floundering. The rug has been pulled out from under him. He was following the plan and now it has changed. No, this is NOT a book about feminism. This is about an individuals struggle to find him or herself. About accepting responsibility or being selfish.

Anyone could identify with her situation if they concentrate on the book with an open mind, and it is basically a look at the thoughts/emotions of a Creole woman who finds herself in an affair, but the book has many more elements to it that make it mean much more than a typical love &amp; infidelity story.

First published at the end of the 1890s, depicts the life of an American woman named Edna married and socialized among a circle of Creoles (immigrants of the French ancestry). Every summer, her family and the Creoles go on vacation to an island. This one particular summer, Edna falls in love with a young creole named Robert. This agonizing love affair between a married woman and a younger man propelled Edna to a series of self liberation. Kate Chopin throws in the idea of &quot;the desire of the unabtainable&quot;, such as a nun would be a subject of desire, namely the more unreachable the more desirable. Edna, a married woman, is in this book, the unabtainable. Another issue about this book, which Chopin was very severly criticized (well.. it was the 1890s afterall, but the book was revived with acclaim in the 1950s during the woman's movement) was feminism. Edna says in the book the she will do anything for her children but she will not sacrifice herself...However, the biggest controversy is the ending.

Independence is very prevalent in this book. It is expressed in way that makes it quite desirable, and even when she has obstacles she always seems to avoid the consequences.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Mrs. Chopin's book definitely still deserves to be called a classic. The protagonist, Edna Pontellier, is female and is complex, which is honestly still rare. In most media, the female characters are more shallow than the males. Chopin is also a master of establishing setting; the way she describes places and how she blends French words into the dialogue and narration really give the reader a sense of place.However, there are problems.Edna may be complex, but she is despicable. Mainly, the novel is about Edna rebelling against society and connecting with her inner sexuality. What does it mean to rebel against society and find your sexuality in Edna's time? To be a total jerk to your husband and cheat on him with a male model and a boy who helps at your vacation home, of course! I know that women were oppressed in the time this novel was set (1899), but Edna's husband, Leonce Pontellier, is a really nice guy. Sure, he does treat her like a child sometimes, but Edna acts childlike in most of their interactions. Example: Leonce says one of the kids look sick, and, because Edna spends more time with them, he says that she might know a way to make him feel better. Edna's response: Tell her husband he's wrong and cry on the porch.Chopin makes it hard for us to care about the romance part of the novel because Edna is not only untrue to Leonce by cheating on him with a hotel hand named Robert, she is untrue to Robert by cheating on him with a male model named Arobin. This makes the reader unsure about who Edna really cares about and makes us question if she really cares at all. For the sake of being spoiler-free, I won't tell you who Edna is really in love with, but I will tell you that you will have trouble caring when you find out.Casual readers may have problems with the writing style---it's not something you'd find in \\"Harry Potter\\" or \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\\" Chopin uses negative sentences that make the book longer than it should be (instead of \\"That's impossible,\\" think \\"That was not of possible occurrence\\"). Chopin also uses the passive voice a lot. If you do not read this style often, you will be confused at first.Is it worth it? Yes. It most certainly isn't the best classic book, but it is still very good. You can find it at the top of this page, and there are free editions elsewhere on the site if you're willing to do a bit of searching."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"This book reminds me of American horror films in which naughty girls are cruelly killed: the frame about sin und punishment serves as a pretext for the movies to show nudity, sex, violence, blood etc.In this book with the pretentious title Awakening, a married woman who rejects all her social responsibilities, wants open relationships and enjoys extramarital sex without love is punished by periods of depression, deteriorating mental health, and worse. Into this frame the author introduces some sensual stories, feministic ideas, rejection of conventional morals etc. As for the carnal side, the heroine Edna might be called a diluted version of Emmanuelle, the well known star of erotic fiction, comics and movies. Edna's erotic awakening starts when she feels desire toward a voluptuous female friend. She also is the target of advances from another woman. Exactly after she gets the news, that the man she loves, and who has been absent for a long time, will be back in a few days, she succumbs to a local Casanova, who means absolutely nothing to her. She enjoys the experience and feels no guilt or shame, just \\"a little regret\\". In the aftermath, she naively asks herself: What would he (not her husband, but her great love) think about that?She also states that she will not be a slave to her children. This is irrational, even ridiculous, as it is stated at the time her children have long been with their grandmother and Edna visited them just once in many months. She moves away from her husband, but accepts and wears a diamond tiara he gives to her. All these inconsistencies and moral hazards are probably attractive for interpretations by some people in Literary, Social and Gender Studies. It might be argued that expressing feministic ideas as coming from an irrational person was probably the only way at that time. In that case, was it worth it - portraying emancipated women as slightly demented? I would find it self defeating and repugnant. It might be nearer to the truth that the author wanted to write down her sensual projections and/or attract attention by introducing controversial themes, and then protected herself in the aforementioned way.The (modest) literary value of the book is in depictions of the French speaking New Orleans society, their vacations outside the city, and their life in the city. The author is a keen observer and most likely many of the scenes are real experiences. There are two mature women teasing a handsome teenage boy at a dinner. The book presents the interesting contrast between easygoing, flirting Creole society, which knows when not to take things seriously, and the puritanically raised Edna, who jumps from one extreme into another. (She is not one of us, as states her friend.) However, the author was not always able to forge these snapshots together into a smooth narrative. Some characters appear only once. The episode of Edna's father visiting the city seems to serve nothing, except giving a hint that father and daughter are equally obstinate.I will not dwell on the condescending treatment of African Americans in this novel - probably common in the U.S. at the time, but not present in the work of some other American writers from the same epoch.As the story became less and less convincing and interesting, I decided first to quit. Then I finished the book, although the only thing of value at the end for me was the description of a childbirth.P.S. Chopin's short story A PAIR OF SILK STOCKINGS also offers a strange portrait of a thrifty hard working housewife, who suddenly, on a whim, spends her considerable savings on trifling luxuries that make her forget her drudgery for a few hours. The story is hardly believable and suggests that even the most virtuous and industrious women cannot be trusted. The ending sentences sounded so damning that, had they been written by a man, he would probably be labeled a misogynist. When I listened to the story on Librivox, I did not pay attention to the name of the author and was indeed sure he was a man from the Victorian era. Then I discovered it was by the same writer as Awakening."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"This is one of those books that benefits from a second read at a more mature age. In my case, this book was required reading when I was in high school, and it left a strong impression on me--though at the time there was much in the novel that I simply was not capable of understanding. I remember as a youth feeling deeply disappointed in the Robert character and feeling so sad for Edna. Now, I am 35 years old and married with 2 boys. At this time in my life, I have a lot in my world that makes me better able to relate to Edna. Edna feels trapped and stifled by a family life that was ill-chosen by her younger self. She finds difficulty reconciling her lack of motherly warmth to what is expected of her as a good Creole wife. On the one hand, she is awakening to herself and her passions. On the other hand, it is too late. Edna has not been given the capacity to make good choices for herself to positively direct those passions, because she was raised in a time when passion and feminine longing were considered taboo or symptoms of insanity (sadly, for many in our society, this taboo remains). Divorce was not a viable option in this time and place for a woman like Edna. This book captures a time that was--Edna awakens to her passion, herself, and the world as it is, and realizes that she has no logical place in it. It is a world that provides only one option for feminine happiness, the sort that Adele Ratignole has obtained--which (it should be noted) holds no appeal to Edna. The value of reading this novel in our modern age is that we can appreciate that our society, with its many flaws, at least holds options for women who do not aspire to the role of mother or wife. For me, my youthful disappointment in Robert was completely unfounded. He is, in fact, the only character who sees the world as it is and realizes that he will further damage Edna by staying. He is, sadly, also too late; she is already irreparably damaged. This topic is one that should continue to be explored by women writers, lest we further isolate women with unbalanced illusions of idyllic connubial bliss. It is one that I will continue to explore in my writing."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

I found this book and the characters very interesting. There are traits about Mr. and Mrs. Pontellier I enjoyed, but at the same time, they lack things as well. Edna was a very individual character that wanted to feel individual for her own needs. Edna was admirable in her individuality and desire for independence, but in the same respect, her independence can be a bit selfish at the cost of her children. Her children should have been her first priority, and then her search for individuality. As for Mr. Pontellier, I believe that he truly does love Edna, but there are times when he does not treat her as if he loves her. &quot; . . . looking at his wife as one looks at a valuable piece of property.&quot; (Pg. 2) Even though he was a rich man in those times he should have shown more respect for his wife, so she didn't feel as if she needed find her own path to follow. This was an excellent book for anybody to read, but I thought that the author could have thought of a better ending. If there was anything, wrong with this book it had to be that the author seemed to just want to finish the book. It really just seemed as though the book came to an abrupt end.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The first time I began reading The Awakening (for my 11th grade honors English class), I was not particularly taken in by the actual story; instead I noticed how quickly I finished the assigned pages. The prose was breezily written, and I enjoyed Chopin's description of the setting.In class the next day, students were commenting on how dull and somewhat confusing the book seemed. Even my teacher admitted that the story was hard to understand. At first, I did not agree with my teacher's or classmates' opinions, but as their dissatisfaction with the book increased -- eventually, so did mine.The highly-descriptive prose began to wear on me at about the same time I began to dislike Edna Pontellier. In class discussions, various students -- both male and female -- noted how irresponsible she acted towards her children. One example I remember my teacher pointing out is the part that Edna's husband Leonce remarks on the low quality of the dinner one evening. Had Edna prepared the meal herself, any frustration with her husband would have been more justified. Unfortunately, she and Leonce are wealthy enough to have a cook who goes through the work of making dinner each night. In fact, they have servants to take care of all domestic chores.In a way, I can see her feeling put upon when she has to take care of her husband's clients and can understand that a mother is not always thrilled about her children. But to say she is highly oppressed is pushing it. Leonce is described as a monster of a person, but his words and actions come across as relatively tame. Even as he wonders what's \\"wrong\\" with Edna when he visits the Doctor, he comments that he is wary of confronting her.Throughout the story, Edna does not grow very much as an individual. The fact that she found love with Robert was touching, but the fact that she abandoned her husband without so much as a word that she was feeling stifled by the relationship was disrespectful. As I said before, Leonce was not abusive and controlling. I wish Mrs. Pontellier had learned that finding oneself does not require avoiding current responsibilities, no matter how hastily acquired. The ending was unfortunate, but did not change my opinions about Edna.Overall, this isn't a terrible book. I just don't consider it a work of great depth and meaning. I give this book three stars because there are a couple of memorable scenes.I would suggest this book for anyone looking for a quick, occasionally enjoyable read. The story will seem better if one does not expect to finish the book with heightened self-awareness or a radically altered view of society."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

I liked this book because I think it can relate to married couples who are having problems. This book is very dramatic, it really makes you feel like you are one of the charecters if you can relate to any of the problems. Even if you cannot relate to any of the problems it is still a good book to read just so you will know what is capable when you are married.

However from the moment I started reading it I could not believe they had thought it was anything near good. It was boring right from the beginning. Edna, the main character, was dim, had no pose or moral values. I say this because she goes and on and on about how much she is in love with Robert and that she wants to leave her husband for him. There is a passage in the book that says something like that Edna would be willing to leave her husband and her two children to run away with Robert. This shows that she has no moral values and cares of nothing more than her own happiness even if that my meant hurting other people in the way to reaching it. Edna waits and waits for Robert to be \\"hers\\". During this time he is off in Mexico working and so on. Finally he comes back to the city where she lives and they \\"get together\\". During that time, Edna's husband and children and both away. Finally, after a long drown out one hundred and ninety pages she leaves with Robert to a beach house, where they have dinner. She decides to go walk along the beach and there she randomly stripes runs into the ocean and kills herself.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Please tell me this: what sort of feminist commits suicide after losing the man she loves? Now I know that Edna mentions that Robert was merely symbolic of her freedom, rather than someone she cared about, but consider it my way. Her rejection of her love for Robert lasted for a small paragraph, and seems especially ridiculous when compared to her time spent mooning over him--roughly seven-eights of the book. When taken into consideration the fact that she commits suicide right after he leaves her, one is forced to conclude that her short rejection of her feelings is nothing more than denial.While I must admit that her lack of love for her children turned her into a character I could never like, she's not even a well composed character in her unlikeableness. Near the end, before committing suicide, she claims that her reason for such a dramatic act is to escape the control her husband and children have upon her. The question I found myself pondering was: is she ****ing delusional? She hasn't seen her husband for months, has moved out of his house, has taken a new lover, hasn't seen her children for weeks, didn't even have to see her children when they lived together since she had a nursemaid, and clearly isn't only selfish, but is also mentally ill. When she began to describe her children as demons possessing her soul, I came to the obvious conclusion that illness Edna suffered from was Paranoid Schizophrenia. Since there was no knowledge of such a disease in Chopin's time, it makes sense that she might have created this character and thought her to be rational, if she based the character off of someone she had met. However, since we are aware of the disease today, readers should avoid admiring Edna's behavior and concern receiving mental help if they find their thought processes mirroring hers.I am not going to criticize the book for being boring or the protagonist for being immoral, but I would like it if readers would note that the true awakening of Edna involved her death and avoid from recommending it to their friends as a good example of a woman learning how to live her life. In some cases, espousing suicide is illegal and I would hate for anyone on here to be arrested for encouraging someone to commit suicide."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Kate Chopin was a 48-year-old newspaper woman from St. Louis, Missouri, when she wrote this lovely idyllic evocation of New Orleans and a nearby Gulf Coast summer resort for Creoles a century ago. &quot;Creole&quot; is a word with several different meanings, but Chopin uses the word to refer to the French-speaking population of New Orleans (except for the French-speaking descendants of the Acadians, whom she refers to as Cajuns). But the heroine of the piece, Edna, is unfortunately a bit of a dullard - pretentious, vain, unpleasantly coy - and a bit intolerant too. It is very difficult to warm up to her. The author has not a smidgen of critical detachment from Edna, in fact she dotes on her embarrassingly, and even though the book is written in the third person it's painfully autobiographical. It's hard to see how this book could have created so much widespread and continuing academic interest, even if it was touted as a feminist classic, at a time when the feminist movement was badly in need of classics. When The Awakening was published (in 1899), Chopin was vilified for having written a scandalous, amoral book, sales were abysmal, and she apparently restricted herself to little stories from the newspaper from then on. The Awakening is the only work for which she is remembered. &quot;Miss Highcamp played some selections from Grieg upon the piano. She seemed to have apprehended all of the composer's coldness and none of his poetry. While Edna listened she could not help wondering if she had lost her taste for music.&quot; &quot;...Life appeared to her like a grotesque pandemonium and humanity like worms struggling blindly toward inevitable annihilation.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

This is not a fast moving book, so if you sre looking for an action packed thrill ride this book is not for you.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The novel, The Awakening, by Kate Chopin, takes place in Grand Isle, Louisiana and portrays the Creole culture in vivid detail. The protagonist, Edna Pontellier, is a strong and beautiful character who believes that she is equal to a man and does not have to go around taking orders from her husband, which was almost unheard of at that point in time. The thought that a woman would ever think of such a thing was considered morally wrong which gives this charater the excitment that would have been greatly missed if she had been left out. The main antagonists are Edna's husband, Leonce Pontellier and a friend who visits the Grand Isle in summers, Robert Lebrun. The struggle over Edna and her feelings are between these two charaters. Either Leonce is treating his wife with great disrespect or Robeart is messing with Edna's feelings, which causes conflict betweeen Enda and her husband. Kate Chopin uses a lot of foreshadowing, using an array of things, from the weather to the background to the tone of voice used. Chopin gives hints throughout the book to what could be approaching in the future. This novel is not a book that you can sit down and read for just a few minutes at a time. It is a book that to be able to get into, you have to relax and take your time and spend good amounts of time on reading. If you do it any other way your won't enjot it as much.If you enjoy reading about women activisits you will enjoy reading The Awakening because within the story that is what it is really about, a women who is trying to live her own, independent life through an environment which is made up of men and their thoughts which, at that time in history, made up the bulk and greatly overruled women."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Kate Chopin's \\"The Awakening\\" has led to many different response since 1989. Some think this is great and, even, inspirational, others point out that it is silly and meaningless. In my opinion, this is a masterpiece. To truly understand this book, we must look back to when it was first published. Not only was the novel a shock, but also very inspirational throught the years. Many women have done like the protagonist, Edna, and taken their chace to live a better and independent life.The books tells the story of a repressed woman, who lives under the husband opression. She is bored and feels that she has to do something meaningfull with her life. Surrounded by snobish people, Edna feels alone, despite all the \`friends' she has. During one summer she is taken aback when she realizes she is in love with one of this people. It takes her a time to come to terms with this, but once she does, her life has a completely new breath. Robert, the man, seems to be more afraid than Edna, and runs away. Edna's solitude only increases her desire of changing her life. Robert's returm may be the event she has always expected.The characters are quite strong and well written, even the supporting ones. Of course Edna is the most developed one, and she faces the same fears of any other human being in any time or place. Perhaps, the men are a bit silly and confused, novertheless realistic. Robert and Mr Pontelier -- the ones who surround Edna most of the time-- are particularly intriguing: they love her, but can't tell why.All in all, this is a very interesting novel: both as a character study, and also as a portrait of a period of time. However, women's condition haven't changed so much as one could expect it to. Many women nowadays face the same feelings, and the conditions that Edna did."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Kate Chopin's The Awakening, published in 1899, is not a typical literature book from this time period. Even though it was published 100 years ago, it is still relevant in this era today. Although in that time period, it appeared rebellious and was banned. Long before the women's rights movement Kate Chopin gave us Edna Pontellier, a woman who feels life is passing her by. She was the pampered wife of a wealthy man, the mother of two sons, and the mistress of a New Orleans mansion on the coast of Louisiana that left her unfulfilled.Edna, the protagonist, learns to think for herself as an independent woman and defies the norm by leaving her husband Leonce and having a love affair. She meets a young man named Robert Lebrun, the two spend almost all their time together and Edna greatly enjoys his company, especially when her husband was normally preoccupied with business. Over a period of time, Robert realizes that he and Edna are becoming too close; he suddenly departs the island and goes to Mexico for business reasons. He left and didn't want to be with her because he wasn't alike to her economically and couldn't make her happy. At the end of the story, Edna swims out into the ocean thinks gloriously about how she has escaped her children, their claim on her and continues to swim until she is dead tired. Memories of her childhood flash before her eyes as she gradually drowns. Edna's \\"awakening&quot; one fateful summer, her quest for independence and refusal to sacrifice her individual existence is the basis of this novel. Her relations with other men, her friendships with women, and her ultimate fate, all of this made this a daring novel in 1899 and a startling reminder in 2001 of how far women have come. I personally feel this is a book everyone can relate to at one point or another and is a classic."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The John Goodman character in \\"Treme,\\" a university professor despairing at the irreparable damage Katrina has done to the delicate web of New Orleans culture, talks at some length in a classroom scene about Kate Chopin's novel, emphasizing, if memory serves me, the impact of The Awakening on contemporary readers.The novel's theme of an individual woman's, or person's, \\"awakening\\" and self-realization are timeless. That its consequences in terms of her behavior were scandalous at the turn of the 20th century is interesting for the student of literature, but for us simple readers it is really more a question of how Edna Pontellier's change in attitude made it, in the end, impossible for her to live in the bourgeois society of New Orleans' upper class.I had gathered from the Goodman character's remarks in Treme that she was ostracized from society for her behavior, but it never comes to that. Her departure precedes a full-blown scandal.Even with this dark, brooding side, the novel is completely charming for the contemporary reader. The view of an exotic Creole society -- apparently Chopin's stock in trade for her contemporary readers -- is as enchanting now as then, perhaps more so because it has truly vanished.The vivid and lovely descriptions of summer on the Grand Isle and much of the life back in the city do transport the reader to another time and place. The author exploits her lush setting to the hilt: \\"She went and stood at an open window and looked out upon the deep tangle of the garden below. All the mystery and witchery of the night seemed to have gathered there amid the perfumes and the dusky and tortuous outlines of flowers and foliage.\\"The view of Edna's inner life, the struggle there, are lyrically described: \\"There were days when she was very happy without knowing why. She was happy to be alive and breathing, when her whole being seemed to be one with the sunlight, the color, the odors, the luxuriant warmth of some perfect Southern day. She liked then to wander alone into strange and unfamiliar places. She discovered many a sunny, sleepy corner, fashioned to dream in. And she found it good to dream and to be alone and unmolested.\\"Edna's husband is cold and detached, but not unsympathetic. When Edna, in an early sign of rebellion, refuses to come to bed but remains outside one evening, he plants himself possessively near her and smokes cigars until the chill drives her in. When she takes advantage of his extended business trip to move out of their house into a place of her own nearby, he immediately sends workmen into the abandoned house to begin a major renovation that offers an explanation for her move that avoids scandal.Edna's would-be lovers, Robert and Alcee, are young and callow. Her women friends reflect each one the complex motives roiling her soul -- except none betray the passion that Edna feels rising in her.A wry humor and gentle irony also ripple through the narrative. Mademoiselle Reisz, a spinster pianist with an enigmatic connection to Edna, is also a figure of fun with a bouquet of violets in her hair and a pile of cushions on her dinner seat.Edna's yearning for freedom is poignant. Other characters point out its childish and selfish nature, but that makes Edna no less sympathetic to the reader. In the end, her inability to reconcile her awakening with her society is immeasurably sad."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"As The Awakening opens during the languid days of summer we find Edna Pontellier, Kate Chopin's main character, drifting aimlessly as if through a wide expanse of ocean or a great field of grain. Edna is on vacation at Grand Isle with her husband and two young sons. She often feels the weight of her responsibilities and the casual cruelty of her husband and becomes disconsolate, but she has attracted the attention of Robert Lebron who becomes her constant companion. Edna has a tendency towards infatuation and becomes quite smitten with Robert. She makes friends with others vacationing on the island while her husband returns to New Orleans during the week and begins her metamorphosis.She tells her friend Adele that while she would give her life for her children, she would never give up her own self.As Edna returns to New Orleans she begins to spread her wings and to cast of responsibilities like the shell or casing of her chrysalis and flit about on her own selfish quest.Critics of Kate Chopin's time were aghast at the book and called it \\"sordid\\" and \\"unhealthy,\\" but modern day critics see the beginnings of feminist thought in the book and laud it as an early feminist novel. This modern reader wonders if it is more of a parable of sorts.Kate Chopin is a thoughtful novelist who slowly develops her characters and stories and is gifted at developing the scene as the following illustrates:\\"The walk to the beach was no inconsiderable one, consisting as it did of a long, sandy path, upon which a sporadic and tangled growth that bordered it on either side made frequent and unexpected inroads. There were acres of yellow camomile reaching out on either hand. Further away still, vegetable gardens abounded, with frequent small plantations of orange or lemon trees intervening. the dark green clusters glistened from afar in the sun.\\"In many ways The Awakening is truly a lovely read, but its main strength is its ability to provoke thought and discussion and that is why I would recommend it."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Edna Pontellier is, by no means, a perfect woman. She acts out: promiscuously, scandalously, inappropriately.But that's okay, because Edna is not supposed to be the epitome of female independence. I think that's what a lot of people miss: she's not meant to be perfect. Her actions are not meant to be idealized. The Awakening is simply a story of a woman journeying through life while realizing her independence.Her mistakes or perhaps less-than-noble or irrational actions are not meant to be taken as what independent women should do. Chopin is not saying, \\"if you are an emancipated woman, feel free to sleep around.\\" Rather, Edna is simply lashing out as she truly feels how oppressed she is by society. Edna is human, she is not perfect. As such, she acts imperfectly and \\"tests the borders,\\" so to speak, in her quest for freedom. I believe that she eventually realizes that independence and freedom cannot be found in a man's pants, and that is when she truly 'awakens.' But she can't realize that's not where freedom is until she looks there, right?I didn't like this book when I first read it. I thought it was boring and dull.

This book is heralded as a classic, and I can see why it is. I just didn't like it - at all.Kate Chopin's story revolves around Edna Pontellier, a young wife and mother who, along with her husband and children, spends her summer at Grand Isle, a small island off the coast of New Orleans. While there she befriends several other women and attracts the attention of Robert, the son of the owner. Robert awakens (pun intended) feelings in her she has not felt before; though her husband is a good man, she does not love him. After spending the summer with Robert, living leisurely, she begins to take her life into her own hands. Upon her return to New Orleans, Edna becomes more and more distant from her husband, eventually having an affair and moving out of her mansion, only to find herself less and less satisfied. As other reviewers have said, the ending is quite abrupt, and made me wonder what the point of the book was.I understand that \\"The Awakening\\" is a masterpiece of feminist literature, but I'm not quite sure why. Yes, Edna took charge of her life and her destiny, and at the end of the nineteenth century, that was something unusual. She refused to bow to her husband's whims and set out to live her life on her terms. But - and this is why I'm questioning why the book is so popular in feminist circles - she isn't happy. The more she awakens to life, the less satisfied she is in it, leading her to drastic action. And while the character herself is brilliantly flawed, I found myself having to search for any redeeming qualities in her.I usually have a pretty positive reaction to classic works, but this one fell completely flat to me, and despite its brevity, was one of the most excruciating reads I've had in years.

The principal characters are evolved with sufficient complexity for us to understand their motivations and sympathize with their actions.

This book shows that people put themselves in situations that they think will make them secure in life and insure happiness. Edna proves that the most &quot;secure&quot; route isn't always the best and won't always lead to contentment with one's self.

She is a powerful writer who really knows how to work her novels into the inner thoughts and minds of her characters. Rather then focusing on a specific adventure for her plot, she puts her characters into real life situations to show the reader exactly who they are. In this particular book, however, we learn about a married woman whose feelings for her life thus far is boring her, as she desires change. Edna Pontellier becomes torn when her feelings for a young boy named Robert Lebrun become a powerful and overtaking affair. I really enjoyed reading this book because it interested me to hear the feelings of a twenty-eight year old married woman, and her experiences of hopelessness and solitude.

Edna decides to find freedom from her male chauvenist husband by leaving him and living and making decisions on her own free will. In fact there is one such line in the novel &quot;I know I shall like it, like the feeling of freedom and independence&quot;,that the author uses to sum up the theme of the book in one sentence. Throughout this novel Edna begins to find herself, and grow into the independent woman that she has always wanted to be. It is in finding this new lifestyle full of freedom and independence that the main character begins to understand the true meaning of life. To successfully understand this meaning you have to endure and overcome many hardships and stuggles along the way. This is how Edna finally becomes free. I rated this novel with 5 stars. I would recommend this novel to anyone who has, or has been through a personal struggle. You will be able to relate well with the main character. If the reader is one who enjoys romance novels, this novel would be a good choice for you.

The story was in third person and we rarely heard dialogue from the characters so the story was built on paper by the character's actions. However, I formulated in my mind all of the feelings of the characters based on these actions. It was like there were two separate stories going on, the literal one and the emotional one. All in all, it made you think a little more in that you had to fill in the blanks much like a Hemingway novel. So why is this story so revolutionary? Edna is one of the few women who are glorified in their time in literature. She knows what she wants and she sticks by it. Though some may call her selfish, she is so overwhelmed with her responsibilities versus what she really wanted, that she does what she thinks she needs to do in the end. In our day and age, she probably would have had more options, but in hers, she does not. Her story is quite similar to both Medea in Euripides' Medea and Nora in Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House. If you like either one of these stories, you will probably also like The Awakening."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

The book shows the struggles of a woman trying to make it in a world set with standards. She finds it hard to grow and expand her happiness and destiny in life. After everything she puts her family through, she manages to think of the wellness of her soul and mind. She breaks off from her family, friends, and society enabling herself to feel completly free. Chopin challenges society's standards through an imprisoned woman in her own world. The struggles the character faces depicts strength and courage from influential people and standards. It shows a beautiful transition of servitude to tranquillity. &quot;The Awakening&quot;, also, opened doors for feminsim and women's rights. It set a mental precedent into society's conscience. &quot;Awakening&quot; is one of the greatest works that inspires people to break away from imprisonment of society's principles."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"I thought that &quot;The Awakening&quot; was a beautiful story. For those readers who find the ending to be a cop-out, I think that you should reconsider your opinion in the light of a conversation that occurs between Edna, the heroine, and Adele Ratignolle early in the story. Adele, the ideal wife and mother, declares that she would give everything up for her children, even her life. Edna responds that although she would give up her life for her children, she would not give up &quot;her self.&quot; In short, when Edna swims out to her death, she is doing this with her children in mind. Yes, it would be the best thing for her sons if she could make herself be a &quot;mother-woman&quot; like Adele, but that would be a denial of her true self. Something really selfish would have been to have left her husband to be with Robert and allow her sons to grow up with the terrible stigma of having such a scandalous background. Although she admits that she would not make the supreme sacrifice of self for her children, her suicide is a reinforcement of her responsibility to them, not an escape. Furthermore, I think it would help readers to consider how divorce was viewed during Kate Chopin's time. Edna would have been a true social outcast, having denied the sanctity of marriage. She could not have divorced her husband easily, or possibly at all. She had no viable options for happiness. This would have meant a life devoid of hope. Edna was not merely unhappy and undersexed. She was trapped, and many people who have considered suicide have described their state of mind as hopeless or trapped. Although a disfunctional marriage may today be something that can be dealt with through a number of channels, Edna was not so lucky."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Interestingly, I have a male friend who has read it an equal number of times and we revisit this story quite often as if it were an anchor to our awareness (awakening?) of female sensuality in a restrictive role-oriented society. I highly recommend locating the critics' edition as it comes with sketches of turn-of-the-century etiquette, courtship rules and fashion worn by women of Edna's social class.

Although they pale in comparison to the novel, these stories, which comprise Chopin's third and last short-fiction collection, serve to flesh out the Chopin oeuvre and deserve a place on women's studies syllabi.

A women escapes \`\`the incessant chatter'' of other females at a party and retires to the male domain of the smoking room, where she puffs on hashish and dreams of a love affair torn asunder. The perverse Mrs. Mallard revels in her newfound freedom when informed that her husband is a casualty of a train accident and dies of a heart attack when he shows up alive. Her fiance is wasted by illness and reeks death, and a repulsed Dorothea bolts; elsewhere, a monk is lured by the voice of a woman, a former intimate.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"That something is wrong with the Pontellier marriage is self-evident, especially when one compares the dinner between the Pontelliers in Chapter 17 with that of the Ratignolles in Chapter 18. The Pontelliers may share a house, but do not seem to share much else. Edna has no interest in the elusive \\"business\\" engaged in by L&eacute;once, and he seems to have no thought that his wife might have an interest outside of their home. The added confusion that Edna feels about Robert--an infatuation, even--implies a future in which changes will be made. At the end of Chapter 18, all it would take, it seems, is the return of Robert to induce this change.Why should Edna be so inclined to risk her domestic safety? L&eacute;once represents stability--if an enforced one--that is the respected idea of society. But Edna's temperament towards the creative arts (seen in her enjoyment of music and her drawing) implies an impulsive streak in her, a possibility for abandonment that might lead to her passions revealing themselves. Edna seems to be oblivious to the necessities that fund her lifestyle, so even poverty is not necessarily a hindrance to throwing over her marriage in a fit of passion.Given the foregoing, one might think that Edna would be tempted to leave her husband. While she might challenge the \\"conventions\\" of her state and status, I think that she will stop herself from that final leap off the cliff of respectability. Just as she \\"awakens\\" to her newfound ability to swim and immediately tests herself by swimming farther offshore than is likely safe for such a beginner, she is able to recognize the danger in her situation and summon the strength to return before any harm is done. This bathing scene strikes me as both a perfect metaphor for her discontent and desire to push the limits of her situation, but also a foreshadowing of the events to come. Edna is decidedly unhappy in her life, but is she suicidal (i.e., mad enough to destroy her safe life)?I concentrate on Edna for hers is the main perspective of the story, although we do obtain a limited amount from Robert's point-of-view. We are not privy to the true reason for his sudden departure, but the combination of the warning issued by Mrs. Ratignolle, the comments made by Marguerite, and his own faltering farewell speech indicates that he removes himself for the safety of distance from Edna, realizing that their relationship is growing to be more than simply polite companionship.All in all, at midway through The Awakening, the subject seems to be the disillusionment of loveless marriage, in contrast to what Edna terms \\"life's delirium\\" in the last paragraph of Chapter 18. From the point-of-view of her friends and acquaintances, Edna's life seems perfect: a doting husband, two lovely and healthy children, a household with the domestic amenities, a house that is perfectly appointed. Underneath this surface perfection runs a weak thread, a flaw in the looking glass, which is the life of the mind. Edna's consciousness does not mirror this outward happiness seen by her friends, and it is this inconsistency that threatens to shatter the picture of domestic bliss. This emphasis on the mind makes The Awakening a precursor to the modernist style. While it still expresses the story of Edna through a flat, third person narration typical of the past, its psychological method is a harbinger of novels to come."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Kate Chopin takes her reader into the life of Edna Pontellier and her quest to find out where she really belongs. Throughout the novel Kate Chopin uses a foil of two women to show how Edna doesn't really fit in with either of them. First of all she develops Madame Ratignolle as the motherly type of women and then she uses Mademoiselle Reisz as the free woman who can do what she wants, when she wants. This is a great book because Kate Chopin really develops her characters to the full, but it takes the whole book to do so, so this may cause some readers to lose interest. This book is not filled with eye opening action from beginning to end, but it is written in such a manner that it does hold your attention. Kate Chopin also delves into the subject of adultery, which may catch reader's attention. I feel that this book was ahead of its time in the struggles that women face everyday that were put on the back burner like who they really are, which I would also call the theme of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone that would enjoy a read that really delves into the life of one person and explores fully. Be prepared for a surprise ending.

Chopin's wonderful, precise descriptions can thoroughly captivate a reader, leaving you hungry for more. This book tells of a young woman, Edna Pontellier, living at the turn of the century in French Louisiana, with her husband and two young sons. While spending a relaxing summer at Grand Isle, she befriends a young man, Robert, who unintentionally stirs something inside of her. Even after the summer is over and she has returned home, she continues to feel unrest with her simple, confined life and begins to take slightly shocking steps towards her own emancipation. While I found the beginning of the novel a bit slow, I grew more and more enthralled as a change came over Edna, and I found myself cheering her on, and eagerly reading more to see if what I thought might happen ever did. I was happily rewarded near the end, or so I thought. Unfortunately, the last chapter, or last page rather, was both frustrating and disappointing to me. Still, I would have to say I enjoyed the book as a whole, and would definitely recommend it to others, but with the caution that they will either love it or hate it. I also think that women in general will have a greater appreciation of this novel, as it pertains to them more, but everyone should read it, as it is an extraordinary, as well as controversial literary work."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Liza Ross's affectation of Edna Pontellier's journey through her awakening makes Edna seem whimsical and weak. The abridgement makes too many cuts which are essential to understanding Edna's break from her husband and from society's standards at the time of the novella's occurrence. Other characters also seem trite and their actions come across as incomprehensible.Robert Lebrun is certainly not worthy of Edna's affections throughout the course of the abridgement. He is much more seductive and enticing in the complete story. The same holds true for Madomoiselle Reisz. The two characters are essential to internalizing Edna's plight and understanding her ultimate fate.I have listened to many audio abridgements. In this case, the lack of story does a disservice to the listener's understanding of Napoleonic Law in Louisiana at the turn of the century. It is easy to listen to this rendering not realizing that Edna and all of her personal effects are actually Leonce's property.My advice, read the book if you truly want to appreciate the mastery of the work that made Chopin give up writing."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

The question of her marriage becomes clear: She does not love her husband. And what of that young man she met at Grand Isle? Robert LeBrun, young, handsome, well-mannered, and remarkably sensitive to Edna Pontellier's desires . . . she has fallen hopelessly in love with him.

Even more amazing were the relations between Edna and Robert. Every awkward pause, every awkward time they were apart resonated in my own life.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"THE AWAKENING is Kate Chopin's best known work, and it is also the last novel she produced, largely owing to the fact that it scandalized Americans when it was published at the end of the 19th century. Critics were dismissive; Willa Cather suggested it was a Bovary wannabe. It enjoyed a revival with the coming of feminism in the 1970s, featured on women's studies' syllabi and as a frequent pick for feminist reading groups. The question begs, \\"Is it still fresh or is it a period piece?\\" I say it's still fresh, a classic worth reading beyond its obvious affinity for women's studies. Given its short length and velvety, vivid prose, it is also an easy read, so there's no reason not to give it a go.This is the story of a 28-year-old wife and mother in fasionable New Orleans Creole society of the 1890s, who begins to respond to socially unprogrammed feelings about her desires in life. She gives into feelings for a man not her husband, resists her husband's efforts to control her life and indulges her artistic side. She sets herself on a difficult trajectory that requires, as a friend tells her, strong wings. Whether those wings are strong enough forms the tension of the novel. Don't read any critical introductions or biographical detail before reading this book, because most give away the ending. Chopin is a master story teller and a deft literary writer. The story of a woman trying to salvage the self in a social pressure cooker was not totally unheard of in the late 19th and early years of the 20th century, and it has had several outings in the last 3 decades, but Chopin writes as if she were the first and last to tackle the theme, and her twists are original. The eye on the affluent Creole society and the character development are superb."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"So rarely does a book effectively and accurately capture the ebb and flow of life that anytime an author achieves such a goal, the piece is sure to be treasured and praised by readers for many years to come. The Awakening achieves such a goal, but unfortunately, its staying power has long been attributed to its controversial first publishing. While that event is certainly significant and makes it essential to any Women's Literature class, that is not all there is to this book.I will confess, I was forced to read this book for a Humanities class. I was reluctant to start it at first, expecting the drone of feminist literature in all of its pretentious glory. I was expecting a character portrayed as such a desperate, suffering thing despite clear evidence that she was anything but. I was expecting sexist portrayals of men (and other upper class women) as ignorant and opressive forces upon this suffering main character. But much to my delight and suprise, I discovered that this is no such book. I should not have put Chopin down at such a low level, and I'm glad she proved me wrong.This book does not force sympathy for the umsympathetic. Instead, it demonstrates perfectly how an author should instill empathy within a reader. Without a doubt, this is a character-driven piece, perhaps the best example of a character-driven novel I have read yet. As an avid fan of science fiction and thrillers, I rarely encounter a book in which every scene is not apparently contrived to further the plot. This book was a real breath of fresh air. It bears every semblance to life and all of its fleeting subtleties. Chopin's characters are so convincingly real, and as a resident of New Orleans, I found her occasional descriptions charming and pleasing.I have noticed that many people have shown displeasure with the ending. I could not disagree more. The ending is so completely suited for this book. Any careful reader would detect that there is no other way for this book to conclude. This is, after all, a portrait of life, and there is no other way these events would have unfolded in real life.To summarize, this is a terrific piece of work, one which will please anyone interested in the art of writing or living."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"\\"The Awakening,\\" while not as controversial or scandalous today as it was when first released, is still relevant to modern life. The protangonist, Edna Pontellier, is a great example of a strong female character. She is not yet thirty, but tied down with the responsibilities and burdens of marriage and motherhood. Mrs. Pontellier must choose between her husband and lover, but - in an ending that will shock you - ultimately chooses neither and sacrifices everything for her independence.Edna Pontellier's journey from an ideal wife and mother to an independent woman is totally engaging. The characters she ecnounters along the way each have a story to tell, and a set of problems of their own. From the eccentric spinster Mademoiselle Reisz to Edna's baffled husband, each character adds a certain something to the plot. Edna's journey and awakening are not merely emotional, but also physical. She travels from the Gulf of Mexico, with its sultry heat and sandy beaches, to the more refined streets of New Orleans. The author relies heavily on imagery to create Edna's world, and the setting is so realistic and vivid that it practically leaps off the pages.This novel is a quick, fairly easy read. You probably won't find it shocking or sexy, but it has subtly sensual undertones. It is an excellent examination of adultery, responsibility, the roles of women, and society in general. \\"The Awakening\\" is a classic."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Kate Chopin's THE AWAKENING was not only banned. It was also suppressed for many years. I cannot understand why. THE AWAKENING is a beautifully written book dealing with a woman, Edna Pontellier, and her desire for emancipation. Edna is dissatisfied with her role in her society, and she takes positive steps to change it. While THE AWAKENING may have pushed the envelope for its time, that was no excuse to ban and suppress it. Ms. Chopin was a brilliant writer who found herself silenced because her work was too groundbreaking and brilliant. This novel deserves to be read by everyone--several times."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Kate Chopin, a woman far ahead of her time, did a remarkable job in writing The Awakening. She most likely felt many of the same things as her fiction character, writing them through her novel. It is so unfortunate that the book was rejected when first published, that people could not accept such a revolutionary and dynamic female character like Edna Pontellier. She was a strong-willed woman who discovered her independence, self-worth, inner strength and sexuality. In a time when wives were submissive and subservient, Edna breaks free of the confines of society's traditional role for women. Empowered by the realization that she can make her own decisions and act according to her will alone, not simply her husband's, her life becomes more fully real. It is then that she can also truly love. Edna had always been quietly rebellious and independent, but had slowly given in more and more to society's rules and the males in her life. She did not want to be seen and esteemed only for being a mother and proper woman. It was refreshing to see such a strong woman, especially considering the time period the novel was written, long before the times of civil or women's rights. Edna's happiness and freedom, her true self and being, are the most valuable things in the world to her. She does not want to be treated as a possession any longer. Edna's thoughts and actions were quite radical for the late 19th century, but many of the ideas from the novel still apply today, even in a time of supposed equality and freedoms. People must learn to look inward for true happiness; self-realizations and preservation. Today, people, women, tend to look outward for their contentment and acceptance, basing it on other people and material things. Kate Chopin and her character were attempting to break free of this a century ago. Reading The Awakening was a pleasurable experience from start to finish. We both really enjoyed the novel and definitely recommend it to others, especially women."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"I am actually saddened by the range of responses on this book. Mostly, I disagree with those who say the book was daring only then, but not now. Just look at the hostility of some of the reviewers now! One Christian reviewer attacked Edna as being an unworthy immoral woman. Several others were mystified that she should abandon her husband and children when they weren't really bad (ie husband not beating her, etc.). Several others pop-psychologized her and diagnosed mood disorder or depression, obviously in need of drugs. Clearly the woman is unhinged and mentally ill. Let's sedate her!The very fact that people are still so disturbed by this character's choices is the whole point of Chopin's book, and it is completely applicable now. The point is that she is asserting her right to personhood. The underlying societal assumption is that the natural course of things is that the man and/or society 'owns' the woman (hence people now saying he treats her well, as if this is relevant), and that a woman must sacrifice herself, her being, for her children, and is a monster if she does not. For you to see how sexist our society still is, all you have to do is replace Edna with a man. THere are countless books and movies in which men are married but their relationship with their wives and children is secondary, and instead the books/movies focus on their growth as a human being. It is expected that men 'sacrifice' their home life for their own life. Of course, it might come at a cost (to the women), but the cost is expected and accepted. Men go to war, go on journeys, fight bad guys, become heroes, conquer women, etc. etc etc. The whole point of the book/movie is the man finding himself. This outlook is so pervasive we don't even think of it and think of it as normal.This book can be directly compared to Madame Bovary, only Madame Bovary, written by a man, is not called \\"The Awakening;\\" and Bovary is 'punished' by horrible death at the end. For Edna, her end was her choice. And yes, perhaps she isn't strong enough, as her older artist friend warns her. If she were strong enough, she would leave everyone behind. But that's the point--that it requires inhuman strength to flout societal morality. Look at Kate Chopin, whose wings were clipped completely after the assault on this book, and who never wrote another novel and died in her 50s. Edna did the most she could, swim as far as she could, and if by swimming, she drowned, so be it. This is the point of the book. It is a brilliant book that is very relevant today. How many women still marry because it's expected of them, how many put their own needs last, and how many remain in miserable marriages because they 'think of the children?\\""},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

This, however, should not the book that is heralded by critics as it is. I cannot see what they see in it. Edna, who is married, runs off to see a second man. He escapes to South America when he realizes he is getting into this relationship much to deep, so Edna looks for a third man, who she knows in her heart and has been advised that he is bad for her; Naturally, she goes after him anyway. After getting too attached to Alcee, her other lover proclaims in a letter that he's coming back. So ends the plot summary of &quot;The Awakening&quot;, written in a wash of thinly veiled sybolism and in an excruciating-to-read writing style.&quot;The Awakening&quot; would have been a great book to read if I had been looking for either a feminist handbook or a book destroying the sanctity of marriage. Many people, particularly feminists, will argue two things, Edna was being oppressed and Edna was a passionate woman. True, Edna was being oppressed, but do three wrongs (oppression compounded with adultery and suicide) make a right. As for passion, Edna is a bland woman who relies on everyone else (Adele, the doctor, Reisz) to make the tough decision for her.Most of you will not agree with what I just said, but those are what I consider to be the cold, hard facts. I was crucified in my English class (which consisted of 3 males, 15 females, and a feminist teacher), but &quot;such is life&quot;. I also write this as a warning to all who would be swayed by the crowd to think of this as a good book when they do not believe this to be true, to give a dissenting opinion, something to balance and use as a measure to compare those other reviews against.

Edna Pontellier's experiences are so intense that she promises herself they are only the beginning. The book takes place on an exotic and friendly Creole isle.

When Pontellier's lover had gone, she was depressed, but felt glad that she had felt true love, although it didn't last very long. Kate Chopin's book was not accepted when it was first published, because society did not want to read about married women having lovers. Many people thought the book was written in poor taste; it was even banned by libraries. This was Chopin's last book because the criticism, and the harsh comments she received made her stop writing. When she died in 1904, she was denied the recognition she deserved. After her death, many viewed Chopin's book as a representation of women's emancipation. Her book was acclaimed a masterpiece.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"A controversial book of its time \\"The Awakening\\" tells of one woman's liberating journey of self-awareness and awakening in 1890s New Orleans. The spiritual and emotional development of the protagonist, Edna Pontellier, progresses slowly but surely throughout the novel. Through her mentor, Mme. Reisz, she slowly awakens to her emotional fulfillment of her spiritual being.Chopin uses illustrious and descriptive language to paint a portrait of a woman undergoing a metamorphosis. No longer will Edna think of herself as a mere possession (as was the Louisiana law at the time), but as an individual - a strong, independent individual. Although there is little action, the spiritual and psychological transformations are relayed in a thoughtful, articulate manner.It is understandable that this book was controversial in its time. Indeed, some aspects of it would still be controversial by today's standards. On the surface, this is a book about a married woman suffering a mid-life crisis, who abandons her husband and young children to pursue a life as an artist, partaking of the pleasures of adulterous affairs. Even today, few people would recommend that lifestyle choice. However, in context with the times, this is a powerful book about one woman's struggles to overthrow the shackles that bound her to her family. Apparently, this is a bond that she would not have chosen herself, but was pressured into by the constraints of Victorian society. Perhaps Edna is not after a solitary life without her family, but is pursuing a life of free will and free choice, one in which she has the ultimate authority.Undoubtedly, Edna suffers as the result of her choices. For isolation and solitude are more prevalent than love and acceptance. Although her adulterous relationships may provide a temporary pleasure, they ultimately leave her empty and hallow. Her unrealistic expectations of romance go unfulfilled. The symbolism of the birds throughout the novel provides a chilling foreshadowing of Edna's eventual tragic ending. Indeed, she cannot escape the cage of Victorian mores.Although I am certainly not the target audience for this book, I found it an interesting read. It is a well-written book and uses rich, descriptive language. Although some readers may disagree with the motives and actions of the protagonist, no one can fault Chopin's powerful message and masterful use of the English language."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"&quot;For the first time she recognized anew the symptoms of infatuation which she felt incipiently as a child, as a girl in her earliest teens, and later as a young woman. The recognition did not lessen the reality, the poignancy of the revelation by any suggestion or promise of instability. The past was nothing to her; offered no lesson which she was willing to heed. The future was a mystery which she never attempted to penetrate. The present alone was significant; was hers, to torture her as it was doing then with the biting conviction that she had lost that which she had held, that she had been denied that which her impassioned, newly awakened being demanded&quot; (XV)Kate Chopin created a work on individualism, on self; Self is what is being awakened, it is the solitary soul. In Chopin's time there were many such Ednas, women struggling to become something more significant than a prized possession but not knowing how. Creative expression through brush or pen was held as little more than another form of capricious coquetry.The development of Edna's character is tragic. Edna acknowledges her pull toward individualism, she knows it to be true and right. But Edna is only just beginning to understand and doesn't know where to go with it. She discovers there is no place for her to go, and so chooses death over conformity. I'm certain Chopin's message was to illustrate individuality and worth separate from spouse, family, religion, etc., as well as to demand that self-worth and individuality be recognized before entering \`the social fabric of connectedness and sustain the dream and the illusion.' Edna awoke in a cage with no escape, except one. She was buried in a sea of right and wrong, both within herself and without. Edna was eventually overcome by the impetus of her awakening: sexuality. But because she became aware, awakened, did not necessarily imply that she would act out on her feelings. Her illusion of Robert grew in his absence. Edna became certain of her need to consummate. She was lost. What could have been a jumping off point into self and growth and giving, instead became a dash for freedom. Freedom was first Robert and then no one.The early 20th century critics' comments were fascinating. Of special note was John May's essay on Chopin's masterful use of textile imagery. Chopin became an artist on sensuality. I also admired Ringe's notes on symbolism: The Lady in Black who was lost in God combined with the couple lost in love, contrasted to Edna who never could achieve loss of self in love for another -- this symbolism is consistent throughout. George Arms makes a strong case that the children represented a stable society and unbroken home. Edna turns to the children time and again in her confusion of self.Larzer Ziff noted well how Chopin rejected \`family' as the equivalent of feminine self-fulfillment -- it is a way to emphasize the equal worth of self in all people not just men... part of the awakening process.I disagreed with Spangler, that Edna's suicide diminished her character. Suicide was an inevitable end for the person struggling to recognize her significance independent to all others, ...and losing. Edna's displays of strength and self that Spangler admired so much, I saw as efforts at understanding. The fact the Edna almost understood but kept slipping made her slide all the more tragic.Wolff's Freudian analysis is well thought out and deep -- maybe too deep. Edna's attempt at fusion seemed more a result of her confusion at being adrift. Though I loved the analogy of a newborn with the birth of a soul.In all, one must first know themselves as a solitary soul, and then join the connectedness of those around them."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"This book is labeled a classic most likely because it is considered to be one of the earliest feminist novels. I suspect the message of \\"The Awakening\\" may not be as feminist as the feminists would like. It seems to me to have much more to do with the contrast between two cultures, Anglo and Creole, and about the difficult balance between reserve and over-indulgence.But many consider that it must be a feminist novel, because the main character engages in a profound and courageous assault on the domineering patriarchal establishment: she commits adultery and then kills herself! I know adultery is the darling of the feminist (c.f. \\"Madam Bovary\\"), but could it be that neither of these acts are a part of a profound awakening? Could it be that these are the pitiful actions of a weak woman who is unable to experience a true spiritual awakening?To pity oneself is not the same as to courageously rage against the establishment, especially when the establishment is (like Edna's husband) rather mild and non-oppressive. Nor is suicide inherently profound.\\"The Awakening\\" is an easy read and it makes for a rich study in symbolism.

She wanted something to happen---something, anything; she didn't know what. Being the pampered wife of a wealthy man, the mother of two sons, and the mistress of a New Orleans mansion, all left her unfulfilled. Her &quot;awakening&quot; one fateful summer, her quest for independence and refusal to sacrifice her individual existence is the basis of this novel. Her dalliances with other men, her friendships with women, and her ultimate fate made this a daring novel in 1899 and a startling reminder in 2001 of how far women have come."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Edna Pontellier's husband, though rather insensitive, is certainly not cruel and in fact goes out of his way to furnish their home in a way that makes Edna the envy of other married women whose husbands are less generous. Edna's children are charming, and they love her. Her mother-in-law, if not exactly close to Edna, is hardly her antagonist. Edna's best friend, Mrs. Ratignolle, is treated as a paragon of a loving wife and mother, truly happy with her husband and devoted to her own family life. Mrs. Ratignolle also has the sense to warn off the shallow young man who has begun a meaningless flirtation with Edna at a popular vacation resort; she realizes that what is meant merely as an idle diversion to the young man is something that Edna has begun to take far too seriously.The tragedy is that while Edna gets just enough insight and awareness to realize that she is a distinct, worthwhile entity in her own right and not merely an appendage of someone else, or a subset of a group, she then turns around and lets her happiness be defined by whether or not a different man loves her. This derails her progress from being a path of growth into greater self-awareness and personal autonomy, to being merely a record of failed extramarital romance.Again, Chopin is very even-handed; she does not hide Edna's immaturity from us, but neither does she lash her; the reader is left to draw his or her own conclusions.This book should be read alongside Wharton's &quot;The House of Mirth,&quot; Sinclair Lewis's &quot;Main Street,&quot; Ibsen's &quot;Hedda Gabler,&quot; and Strindberg's one-act play, &quot;The Stronger.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

I especially love the part that goes &quot;What he didn't realize was that she was becoming more and more herself every day, casting aside the ficticious self that we all create as a shield around us&quot; (or something like that). How true that is - we all build 'ficticious selfs' to protect us and one can identify with Edna's struggle to disband/destroy that shield and let her true person shine. I do not believe that she was selfish, I believe that others were selfish in not treating her more like a person and equal. This book that was written 100 years ago can still be identified with in the 21st century!

In the beginning of the book a parrot is introduced that speaks a little French, a little Spanish, and a language that no one understands. In a way the parrot is like Edna Pontellier, the main character; it sometimes seems that no one understands what she is trying to say. During this story she faces a conflict within herself because she is trying to set herself free from being trapped and being tied down. She wants to feel as if she can take care of herself if needed. She also has a conflict between herself, a man named Robert, and her husband. The reason why this conflict exists is because she can't decide whether she wants to be with her husband, or with Robert, or with both of them.

I thought it tediously leading to a climax and then found it drift off from my original perception. Compared to other great &quot;pro-women&quot; works, (A Doll's House, Hedda Gabler by the masterful genius Ibsen), Chopin had Edna gain a great insight of personal reflexion and understanding of traditional society, and then to end her glorious discovery with suicide? Pathetic, was the first word that came to mind. I believed that if Edna had truly &quot;awakened&quot;, she would have ventured into sexist society and clashed without fear to those opposed. Yet, unlike Nora, I found Edna respected no such &quot;duties to herself&quot; beyond wife and mother, and proved feeble of the complexity in self-realization. However, upon looking at this novel again, I have come to realize the brillance of Chopin. Edna is more suited to be compared with Hedda Gabler, a psychologically callous, yet stong character, and found Edna to be wildly unstable mentally. Her frequent crying instances made me embarassed to think I had missed such blatant signs. And now I can appreciate or at least come to observe that Edna had traveled one path for so long, that it seemed impossible to stray to another. (The other leading completely the other direction).

The Awakening is an inspired and inspiring work. This book is full of symbolism and passion, and though the story is an eventually bleak one, it resonates with truth. This is a book about the pain of coming to life, and the power of inescapable maternal entanglement. Read it if you have an ear for beautiful language, a wise soul, and an active brain.

It's spare and detached. I neither liked or disliked the characters, and I believe Chopin meant us to read her book that way. It was a strange experience considering the plot. Her description are beautiful, her word choice excellent. How else could we feel we so understand her characters, while not feeling anything FOR them?That's not completely true, though. I did become fond of Robert, and definitely came to dislike the main character, Edna. Totally self-absorbed, showing herself to be without any self discipline or control, Edna's 'awakening' took place with no concern for others. She freely admitted that she only cared for herself. That's one reason I can't think of this as a book on feminism, unless you use that term to mean women doing whatever they feel like at any given moment, however much they may damage others.Don't let that make you think I felt The Awakening was a waste of time. The style alone makes it worth reading for those who don't only care only about plot. The simplicity of the relatively short book is an interesting contrast will all that goes on inside. Just don't go into it thinking you're opening a typical novel, and perhaps you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"This novel of Kate Chopin's is based loosely on the (possibly) true story of a women who was infamous in New Orleans when Chopin lived there. Yet despite the truth of the story and its message, society rejected Chopin following the publication of The Awakening. This short novel is not about adultery, or glorifying suicide. It is a powerful statement about the power that people, and especially in Chopin's time, women, have to control their lives.Chopin develops the character of Edna Pointellier to demonstrate the ways that even those who seem as though they should be happy do not fit into the place assigned them by society. Throughout the book, Edna Pointellier is contrasted with Madame Ragnitolle, a woman who is naturally suited to the role of wife and mother. This novel is a reminder that there is no one life which can fit all people, whether the life of a mother or an artist or a working woman. People must be free to make their own choices. In many ways, that message is as revolutionary today as it was a century ago."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Chopin's description of everything from the houses of New Orleans to the lines of a woman's figure give the reader tremendous detail and satisfaction. One can feel the heat of the day and the smell the times. The development of relationships and characters in this rather short story is remarkable. I chalk this up to the powerful descriptions used, clearly a talented author.Now to the social implications: I have to believe that, written in its time this was a very controversial book, however, the relationships and affairs of aristocrats was no secret to anybody. The fact that the book was written by a woman probably made it all the more contentious. While I would say the book is groundbreaking, I fail to see how it empowered women. The \\"awakening\\" of the main character (Edna) is eloquently written and the initial struggle and coping of Edna could be empowering to a woman. However, Edna, while clearly revolting against her stale marriage and husband, is still under the power of men. She can't resist Arobin and is easily controlled emotionally by Robert. The ending of the book is the culmination of male influence over a woman, and the epitome of a fragile, misled woman. A strong woman would have elected a different route, not relying on the influence of feelings solely impressed by passion for a man.While the story telling of a woman's struggle to find herself, in a time where a lot of the content is unmentionable, is brilliant. The description of Edna's feelings and her pseudo-procurement of freedom through her realization of \\"love\\" is well played. However, one should pause before \\"feminist\\" or \\"strong woman\\" is cast upon the main character, as the main character is clearly weak.Awakening is a great literary work which everybody should read, but to trying to force it under the camp of \\"feminism\\" is irresponsible and vagrant."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

I long thought that in that time, when the ideas of a woman being equal was an idea that could never be thought of by women. It has never been spoke of casually that a woman did, even in those time; or especially in those times, thought of living their own life. This book was a light shown on someone realizing the way the world worked, loss, hopelessness and at the same time with this a new found growth of a person. It never seemed to be a statement of Mrs. Poniteller that she wanted to change the way society worked, it was more of an opposition, \\"if this is the way the world works, then i do not wish to be a part of it.\\" Even in her death; or presumed death, she seemed so noble.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Kate Chopin's The Awakening, published in 1899, is not a typical literature book from this time period. Even though it was published 100 years ago, it is still relevant in this era today. Although in that time period, it appeared rebellious and was banned. Long before the women's rights movement Kate Chopin gave us Edna Pontellier, a woman who feels life is passing her by. She was the pampered wife of a wealthy man, the mother of two sons, and the mistress of a New Orleans mansion on the coast of Louisiana that left her unfulfilled.Edna, the protagonist, learns to think for herself as an independent woman and defies the norm by leaving her husband Leonce and having a love affair. She meets a young man named Robert Lebrun, the two spend almost all their time together and Edna greatly enjoys his company, especially when her husband was normally preoccupied with business. Over a period of time, Robert realizes that he and Edna are becoming too close; he suddenly departs the island and goes to Mexico for business reasons. He left and didn't want to be with her because he wasn't alike to her economically and couldn't make her happy. At the end of the story, Edna swims out into the ocean thinks gloriously about how she has escaped her children, their claim on her and continues to swim until she is dead tired. Memories of her childhood flash before her eyes as she gradually drowns. Edna's \\"awakening&quot; one fateful summer, her quest for independence and refusal to sacrifice her individual existence is the basis of this novel. Her relations with other men, her friendships with women, and her ultimate fate, all of this made this a daring novel in 1899 and a startling reminder in 2001 of how far women have come.

I found the main character, Edna, did not elicit any sense of pity.

Certain types of literature you just need to discuss and have clarification on.. I was surprised at the amount of negative reviews - I was barely 23 when I read it the first time, and loved it so much; how Chopin could pack so much into such a short story. I think it's important to remember that her career was nearly destroyed by this book, and the period of time then (1899) was VERY different than now. You were basically in one of two categories, upper or working class - if I remember correctly, there was no in between. For a woman like Edna, there weren't many options if you didn't see yourself falling into the &quot;mother role&quot;, like her close friend in the book who gave birth towards the end. You couldn't stay in school, get divorced, climb the corporate ladder, or have kids &quot;eventually...&quot; If you had a lot of money, that made things easier, you could ship the kids off for a period of time. It wasn't like how it is now, that you could leave your husband, your kids, and get your own place.

She left a stagnant marriage to follow her ideals, defying a stifling society in the process.Although this is a more of a novelette than a novel and can be read rather rapidly, I prefer to digest the Awakening slowly - taking in the lush language and scenery.

I found it very interesting because it isn't like the other love stories, since it doesn't have a happy ending like most of them.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"&quot;The Awakening&quot; is ruthless in its complete exposure of social oppression and in its avoidance of hypocrisy. Although the novel was written more than one hundred years ago, most if not all of its themes are relevant today.&quot;The Awakening&quot; examines both women's social position and the perception of that position from the point of view of both genders. When Robert makes his first amorous overtures to Edna Pontellier a mutual friend warns him to act carefully because Edna will not behave in the same manner as other women. She is warning Robert, that Edna will respond to him in an independent and emotional fashion instead of playing the role dictated to her by society. This becomes clear when Robert returns from his self-imposed exile and informs Edna that he wants to ask her husband's permission to share her. Edna mocks this proposal and tells Robert that her life and her feelings are hers alone to give not her husband's. Unfortunately, Robert is unable to love Edna in a manner that is not socially sanctified. In fact, Robert prefers the absurdity of sharing Edna with her husband to having Edna give herself to him of her own volition. To Robert the choice must still be the husband's not Edna's. His affection for Edna is both shallow and inextricably conditioned by social parameters.The most difficult part of the novel is Edna's decision to commit suicide, knowing she will leave her children behind. From an emotional perspective this is probably difficult for any reader to endure. But it accurately conveys Edna's plight. No man and very few women are capable of accepting Edna on her own terms. They cannot even conceive of her as an independent person so much as an eccentric.Edna's suicide is not meant to promote suicide as a means of female social emancipation. Instead, it demonstrates that if a woman really wants to escape the pervasive restrictions imposed on her by men, she has few, if any, alternatives. While the legal and social status of women has improved considerably in the developed world, I wonder to what extent men really view them independently of social convention? And in the end, don't the men get a raw deal in this novel? Edna's husband is never able to grasp who she is. Her lover does not even know whom he loves or why? Most of the men in \\"The Awakening\\" are in love with the perception of a woman more than with the woman herself.

This is the story of a young woman, Edna, married, with two small boys, who begins to sense an unfolding yearning within herself, which she is unsure how to fulfill. When the book was written in 1899, it was considered scandalous and avant-garde, garnering scathing reviews. By today's standards it is slow and undulating, barely shocking, and somewhat slow paced, considering what Edna undertakes as she tries to reconcile her longings with social convention.

I was first introduced to this book as a sophomore in college in my \\"Women Writers of the 20th Century\\" English class. Kate Chopin masterfully paints a picture of a woman desperately seeking more in her life; a woman who doesn't \\"fit the mold\\" of societal conventions at the turn of the 20th century. Chopin slowly builds Edna Pontellier bit by bit, painstakingly peeling away at the layers and the facades this woman has been taught to put on--and which her character throws off with fancy free and terrible heartache almost simultaneously. Edna is a flawed heroine, but perhaps that is why the reader becomes entranced with her.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"In Kate Chopin's The Awakening, the protagonist of the story, Edna Pontellier, is a woman in the late 1800's who has been living a life of the expectations of the women of that time. She is a devoted wife and mother. After a vacation in Grand Isle, she meets new friends and new surroundings that influence the way she thinks. These influences also help to establish herself as an independent woman and break free from the traditional everyday womanly duties. But, will this road to becoming independent consume her so much that she will lose everything that she has come to known? It all starts with the new friends she meets while she is on vacation with her family at Grand Isle.While Edna is on her vacation, she meets Adele Ratignolle, the epitome of the typical 1800's woman. Chopin describes these women as \\"women who idolized their children, worshiped their husbands, and esteemed it as a holy privilege to efface themselves as individuals and grow wings as ministering angels.\\" (Chopin 10) She also says women, in particular Creole women, were impressive because of their freedom of expression about anything, including things society doesn't speak openly about like romantic gossip. Edna on the other hand is the complete opposite and is not the \\"mother-woman\\" type. She admires Adele because of her quality of being outspoken and it inspires her to think about old times in her youth of romantic dreams or fantasies. This is the start of Edna beginning to think in depth about her life. It also makes her begin to be more outspoken, especially to her husband. With her being more outspoken, she is able to break free from the natural hold her husband has on her and becomes free. It also begins the unspoken love that she has for another character in the story, Robert Lebrun.Robert is what the people at Grand Isle call a big flirt. Every year he courts a different woman but this time, when he chooses Edna, everything is different. Since most of the women that Robert courts are Creole women, they find his flirting funny and they enjoy his company. Edna on the other hand, takes it seriously and begins to develop feelings for Robert. She sees in Robert everything that she doesn't have with her husband: love and devotion. They develop a relationship where they're together all the time but they never admit their feelings for each other. One day, Robert announces that he will be leaving for Mexico for business. With Robert's absence, Edna drives to become more and more independent. After she has left Grand Isle, she becomes more defiant with her husband, doing whatever she pleases. This causes her to really discover how she has no feelings for him whatsoever. She decides to move out of the house and into a smaller house because she felt like it was not homely. All these things that Edna are very uncommon for women of this time to do. Another important aspect of change that Edna experiences is her drive to succeed in art, which Mademoiselle Reisz pushes her to fulfill.Mademoiselle Reisz is what most would call an old hag. Edna is the only person that she shows some sort of respect to. The Mademoiselle plays the piano exquisitely and Edna admires her. One night, she is asked to play some pieces on the piano and as soon as Edna hears it, she is moved. \\"She waited for the material pictures which she thought would gather and blaze before her imagination. She waited in vain. She saw no pictures of solitude, of hope, of longing or of despair. But the passions themselves were aroused within her soul, swaying it, lashing it.\\" (Chopin 34) The author is describing how instead of typically seeing certain images that she normally does every time she hears this particular pieces play, Edna actually felt certain passions from the music itself. Edna sees that music is Reisz' passion and soon she seeks to follow her own passion of painting. These three characters in this novel have truly been the reasons to why Edna has changed to become an independent person.In books, usually the plot and themes stand out the most to what makes the book good or bad. In this novel, Chopin has made complex characters that affect the protagonist of the story. I think that with Chopin doing this, it has made the story more interesting to read as to how this rebellion has been inflicted to Edna. Although these characters unintentionally drove Edna to her success of freedom, it also had its downfalls as well. Edna could have been labeled independent, she still had two things that were bound to her: her husband and children. \\"They were part of her life. But they need not have thought that they could possess her body, soul and mind.\\" (Chopin 156) Edna couldn't except that her children would always be affected in society their opinion of her, so therefore, she kills herself by drowning in the ocean \\"accidentally.\\" This may be a sad ending, but I liked it because I thought of it as Edna accepting the consequences of leaving something so important behind only for her self. Overall, I think that this was a well-written story, although at times it was hard to understand because there were a lot of French phrases in it. Reading it has inspired me to become independent, while watching out for not neglecting others I care about for selfish desires."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

The female characters in this novel are not two-dimensional, moving about in silent submission to oppressive patriarchal authority; rather, they are presented as individuals with thoughts, desires, feelings, etc. of their own. While by today's standards this is not a revolutionary idea, at the time Chopin was writing, it was rather novel.This book, then, served as a fascinating glimpse into a world that is past -- a world that was on the brink of change.

Second, I think there are so many of us females today struggling with our own identities.

The evidence that the main character is a woman who leaves her husband in a time when it was taboo is really not enough. Was she particularly courageous, honest or good? No. She was simply a vulnerable woman who was victim to her own troubled sea of emotions. Edna is a tragic figure, she always seems to be searching for something.. and she doesn't know what it is or where to find it. Yet the mere fact that she is searching, that she is open to something greater than the trivialities of life makes her an intriguing character. Edna's viewpoint is terribly colored, however. For to her, it seems as though she is the only one with this sensual longing. She never bothers to give anyone else a chance, and chances are, if they're like the rest of us, they've felt a similar pull at some point. But instead of harnessing this feeling, Edna succumbs to it. She retreats into herself and simply gives up on life. She resorts to shameless pursuit of self, she lives to please her momentary whims. She never considers that her husband loves her or that she has vowed to be faithful. Edna only considers that she doesn't love him, and she will make no sacrifices for anyone else as long as her own debaucheric pleasures are at stake.If I were rating Edna, I would give her one star. But I'm rating the book, and I must consider that its overall effect was powerful. That Kate Chopin's diction was lyrical and her imagery potent. That the message of this book, though tainted by the miserable and futile Edna, resounds. This is not a feminist message. It means nothing more for women than it does for men. The message is that we must always strive for the integrity of emotion. That we must force ourselves to reach beyond the superficial in life and grasp the true and lasting. Poor Edna was so close to discovering this, but she abused the longings she felt and misinterpreted them.

Out of the thousands of significant women characters that have been depicted in novels, Edna is certainly one of the most complex as well as realistic. Her emotions were raw, REAL, and completely unabashed and honest. Chopin included so many &quot;tabboo&quot; topics, including lesbianism. I can read this book over and over and still never get tored of reading it. I will always see Edna as a woman who wanted to come to grips with her own sexuality and independence. Although I did see her as selfish, I ultimately realized that she felt trapped in a society that stressed women as being the nurturers and taking care of their husbands and children...they could not dream or fufill the dreams that they had. Edna desperately wanted to cross this boundary that was set upon her society during that time. The ending was so emotional to me personally that I never fail to cry every time I read it.

He was a good man. \\"As the devoted wife of a man who worshiped her, she felt she would take her place with a certain dignity in the world of realty, closing the portals forever behind her upon the realm of romance or dreams.\\"Like \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" this entails the life off continental United States and customs of those identified as Creole. Unlike Sargasso's emotionally abused wife, Antoinette, Edna is 28, turning 29, and is just . . . just . . . very confused. Her 40-year old husband seeks to aid her in this time of maturation, but is really helpless. Beautiful and unsure of her previous decision to marry, she is wooed by others - all knowing that societal customs will not allow her to engage in illicit passion unless she makes a rash decision to leave her anointed responsibilities to her children and husband. What will she do when her lover, Robert, returns? \\"Do? Nothing, except feel glad and happy to be alive.\\" But is this enough for Robert? Is it enough for her?Of course not. \\"[S]he felt the old ennui overtaking her: the hopelessness which so often assailed her, which came upon her like an obsession, like something extraneous, independent of volition.\\" Her life became a lingering heart-breaking bore.She is neither free nor in servitude. She is neither chattel of; nor an equal to her husband. She is a prisoner of her emotions, not of societal constraints. She lives in a relatively free society, and is permitted to roam about relatively freely. But, she is not happy with this. Little can engage her sensibilities in this period of malaise which is constantly questioned by hormonal and philosophical desires. She wants a divorce although her husband did nothing wrong. But, in her days - the 19h century - divorce was not an alternative. Moreover, her husband and her society are Catholic.So she had to lead the remainder of her life with self-hatred - about how she got where she is and where she is going with what she has. She reasons, \\"I am no longer one of Mr. Pontellier's possessions to dispose of or not. I give myself where I choose.\\" And, so she shows the most demanding act of volition: suicide.My Bantam edition came with a forward by Pulitizer-winning author Marilynne Robinson (\\"Housekeeping\\" and \\"Gilead\\") who wrote, \\"'The Awakening' should be read as a meditation on the experimental basis of romantic consciousness, the sense that the world has a numinous life that is addressed to human perceptions and that it has a meaning humankind is competent to interpret. . .\\" Robinson is correct, and this book is truly generations ahead of its time in addressing this extremely undiscussed topic of female self-recognition against the male's world of control."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The Awakening is a revolutionary story of a woman's rebirth and journey of self-discovery. Edna Pontellier, the main character, discovers through a summer spent at a resort what all she is capable of doing and thinking. With the help of her new and old friends Edna becomes a new person. Even though her self-discovery includes an affair her character is still admirable.There is a lot of criticism about Enda's lack of responsibility of being a mother. I think that this criticism concentrates on a minor detail of this story. Only one part of Edna is being a mother, even though she does not take the job too seriously. I think that overall Chopin is saying that &quot;awakenings&quot; are human in nature. They have both advantages and disadvantages. It is something that every person should experience and is an essential part of growing up.I think that Edna's awakening pulled her away from her stifling normal life. Her job as a mother was part of that life. I do not think that Chopin really intended for Edna to completely abandon all parts of her life, but Edna was not a strong enough character to balance her new life with the old. Athenaise, on the other hand, could see what needed to be changed and was able to do it without abandoning her old life.I did not feel that this book was a downer, I really enjoyed it. Chopin made the story real, which is something refreshing compared to a lot of novels. This novel gave true insight into the feelings of women at the time.

This story takes place in the late 1800's when women were supposed to stay at home and raise a family. Edna, though it seemed she had a perfect life, did not want to live her life as a mother. She wanted something different. All through the novel Edna tries to go against society while Leonce, her husband, tries to keep her in line.

Now widely read and admired, The Awakening has been hailed as an early vision of woman's emancipation. This sensuous book tells of a woman's abandonment of her family, her seduction, and her awakening to desires and passions that threated to consumer her. Originally entitled &quot;A Solitary Soul,&quot; this portrait of twenty-eight-year-old Edna Pontellier is a landmark in American fiction, rooted firmly in the romantic tradition of Herman Melville and Emily Dickinson. Here, a woman in search of self-discovery turns away from convention and society, and toward the primal, irresistibly attracted to nature and the senses. The Awakening, Kate Chopin's last novel, has been praised by Edmund Wilson as &quot;beautifully written.&quot; And Willa Cather described its style as &quot;exquisite,&quot; &quot;sensitive,&quot; and &quot;iridescent.&quot; This edition of The Awakening also includes a selection of short stories by Kate Chopin."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"You know, a lot of people take this book very seriously...I am a fan of Kate Chopin's works and find this novel to be well written about a protagonist who is essentially a despicable and unsympathetic person. A lot of people give this book \\"one-star\\" for much the same reasoning I give it a high review. Similar to other writers who excel in their craft, we are given a main character who has few,if any, redeeming qualities. Think of authors like Bukowski, Raymond Carver, Fitzgerald (many times), Hemingway (often), and Poe, London, and on and on. There are many tales and stories written from the villain's point of view, and Edna really is the villain in this tale in my opinion.That does not mean the book is not brilliant, however. It is. Many see this book as a step in serious \\"feminist\\" literature...but Chopin's writing style is satirical or sarcastic in a fashion. (I know this is starting to sound like an assigned report, but hey...) I recommend that people who read literature and are open to interpretations try reading this book as a satire. After I read many of Chopin's short stories and reading her biography, as well as really sitting down and reading \\"The Awakening\\" I realized how clever of a writer Chopin was. She has a compact writing style and uses her words carefully; but much like good authors, there's more under the surface (the \\"iceberg theory\\"). Chopin usually pulls it off. I essentially came to the conclusion that the \\"Awakening\\" is not direct, like an artistic or sensual awakening, but a true awakening in the protagonist, which leads to the appropriate ending."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The first time i read Ellen Gilchrist, i was taken aback by the notion that a mother could find her own children boring. Granted, i was very naive when i read that. I was mostly drawing from what i had seen as a daughter. For my mother, motherhood is an all-consuming experience, which eclipses any other aspect of her life. So it is no wonder that to hear Ellen Gilchrist utter such unbelievable statements sent me for a loop.Then i became less naive, and realized that there are many nations when it comes to female roles. If in the 90s i was scandalized by a literature mother with little maternal instinct, i can only imagine the turmoil that The Awakening might have caused a hundred years before. And probably motherhood was the least of the issues people had with this book. Edna Pontellier finds herself, at 28, lost and unfulfilled. She is married, has two small boys, but yearns for something more. She becomes infatuated with a younger man, Robert, whom she meets during vacation. This novel does not have a happy ending.The copy i have has a quote right on the front cover: \\"Speaks to me as pertinently as any fiction published this year or last.\\" I agree with Linda Wolfe. Although the scenery is different, the customs and manners long past, the core of this book is still true and valid. The only caveat is that in today's age even the most traditional of women have a million more options than the most progressive of 100 years ago. You do realize how far we have gone as women, and what a raw deal our great-great-great-great-great-grandmothers have had to endure for generations on end.

This novel depicts conflicting issues: to cheat or not to cheat? From the beginning, Edna begins feeling unusual and intolerable feelings towards a man that is not her husband. She began feeling love and happiness, which were two feelings that she never felt before: not even towards her husband. And the man that brought on these feelings was Robert, innocent and honorable. These two met when vacationing off the coast of New Orleans and instantly felt a connection, even though they thought of it as a \\"friendly connection.\\" Yet when Robert unexpectadly left for Mexico, Edna began feeling a void in her life and soon found out that she couldnt't live without Robert. As time progressed, she began making changes that would effect everyone around her, from her husband and children to women from all over. She began filling the void by isolating herself from her husband, sleeping with another man, and eventually moving out. This novel is the most adaptable because it can relate to any generation and any person that is put in that kind of situation, which I think makes it such a worthwhile and interesting novel."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

This book pulled me in so easily and I was hooked until the very end. What really struck me was how well I could identify with Edna and her emotions. Beautifully done characterization and the simplicity of the writing and metaphors really works for the overall story.While Edna's &quot;Awakening&quot; does begin with her falling in love with another man, this is by no means a love story. This is a story of soul-searching with a modern feel though it was written in 1899. This is a story of a woman defining herself as a person.

Certain types of literature you just need to discuss and have clarification on.. I was surprised at the amount of negative reviews - I was barely 23 when I read it the first time, and loved it so much; how Chopin could pack so much into such a short story. I think it's important to remember that her career was nearly destroyed by this book, and the period of time then (1899) was VERY different than now. You were basically in one of two categories, upper or working class - if I remember correctly, there was no in between. For a woman like Edna, there weren't many options if you didn't see yourself falling into the &quot;mother role&quot;, like her close friend in the book who gave birth towards the end. You couldn't stay in school, get divorced, climb the corporate ladder, or have kids &quot;eventually...&quot; If you had a lot of money, that made things easier, you could ship the kids off for a period of time. It wasn't like how it is now, that you could leave your husband, your kids, and get your own place. I thought all of the imagery was so wonderful - Louisiana and Grand Isle are portrayed as lush, warm paradises where she suffocates... her suicide can be seen as both a defeat, and victory.

The colours, especially, are very compelling, as are the tactile images-- when the heroine swims, the sea (which is a major and obvious symbol) &quot;enfolds&quot; her in an embrace which is almost sexual.

My honors English class read it, and let me tell you that I was quite surprised to see all of the 4 and 5 star reviews that it has been given. Every person in our class of 30 absolutely hated it. Edna was the single most unsympathetic character that I have ever run across. Every moment that I spent reading this book was a moment of both agony and great hope that Edna would meet with a horrible end. I don't care what anybody thinks about individualism, freedom, or feminism (Even the resident feminazi in our class thought that Edna was an insufferable twit, and a terrible role model for feminists everywhere). In fact, Edna was the most ungrateful B**** that I have ever read about. She had next to no responsibilities. She had a nurse to take care of her children, a cook to do the cooking, and plenty of servants to do the chores. The only things that she had to do were be a loving wife and have tea with some of her husband's clients' wives once a week. She decided to blow off both of these duties in favor of- PAINTING! Yes, painting. Oh, and let's not forget having an affair with the town playboy, and trying to do the deed with dear old Robert, who turned out to be about the only honorable person in the book by leaving her. After this terrible &quot;loss,&quot; Edna just plain loses it and decides to kill herself. After living a life of luxury with a husband that was good to her even when she was acting in the most embarrassing and dastardly ways, Edna decided that she was, well, unfulfilled, and went off to the sea to end her terrible, sad, meaningless, pathetic life. This was by no means the shocking surprise ending that some have called it. I (and the rest of my class) saw it coming a hundred pages away.

I read this book on the premise that, although published in 1899, it was an inspiration to women fighting for their independence in the 20th century, and was highly disapointed.

Not only does she spend half the book asleep, drawn into slumber by the intimate touch of her many lovers, but at realizing that the cause of her achings is her dependency on her husband, she does nothing about it. She mopes around town, defying her husband without standing up for herself, she cries alot, and she ultimately takes her own life, with no consideration or sense of responsibility.

Sorry Chopin, no thumbs up for you!"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The Awakening is a very worthwhile read. Although a bit slow in some areas, Kate Chopin did a wonderful job of presenting Edna Pontellier, the main character, as a woman who struggles in a society where women are the property of men. Her love for art and music enabled her to gain a form of independence that only she and an older lady named Mademoiselle Reisz could understand. Mademoiselle Reisz has decided to be an individual, and not follow society's rules. She acts as mentor or idol for Edna. Reisz was very knowledgeable in both music and art witch also inspired Edna to take interest in her own hobbies. Edna, came from a family of Presbyterians, and purposely married a Catholic named Leonce Pontellier to get back at her father. Edna constantly faces many awakenings throughout her life as she struggles for independence from the control of men. She defies her husband and lets him know that she is not his property. This leads to a conflict between the two. Leonce believes that Edna is not a good mother and cares little for both her children and their marriage. Edna, on the other hand, believes that it is Leonce who cares little for his family and more about his wealth, property and popularity. To her husband, Edna is an object, something necessary for him to possess in society. As Edna spends more time with Robert, a friend who stays with her during the days at Grand Isle, her attitude towards Leonce begins to get stranger. This enabled Chopin to introduce a middleman between the Edna and Leonce; a physician named Doctor Mandelet. Mandelet met with the two on separate occasions and formulates a diagnosis to &quot;cure&quot; Edna from such strange behavior. As the days pass, and Leonce is on a business trip, Edna begins having strong feelings for Robert Lebrun. Their hidden love is not something they admit, but they can sense it through each other's actions. Trying to avoid falling in love with a married woman, Robert leaves town and heads for Mexico, trying to clear his head from thinking about Edna. While Robert is away, Edna begins to feel an even stronger love for him, and also get depressed. Kate Chopin developed a wonderful plot in which the story constantly circles around Edna. While Edna has Robert on her mind, the author did an incredibly brilliant choice by introducing another character by the name of Alcee Robin. Alcee enjoys making conquests of married women and eventually goes for Edna. After meeting Alcee through the horse races, Edna begins to get intimate with Alcee. Edna doesn't feel enough independence from her husband, so she decides to move into a tiny birdcage-like house to be on her own. The climax began to increase when Robert finally came back from Mexico. Edna begins to play mind-games with Robert by interacting with him less and less. Her deep love for Robert is not returned in the way that she had hoped, so she makes a decision to for a walk along the coast. Edna's choice to go for a swim is her final awakening. She looks upon her sons as the only bond that ties her to a life of being a slave to society. Moments later after extreme exhaustion, Edna drowns and dies. This book does a remarkable job telling about society during this time, and how women were viewed. It makes me curious to read another novel by Kate Chopin."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

But I was very disappointed. A cliche story about an opressed woman, The Awakening fails to display any interesting ideas. Even if it was revolutionary for its time, it has long since lost it's relevance. The main character is unbelieveable, and the reader is expected to identify with her, a task difficult to accomplish as the woman makes strange, and often selfish decisions.The book is marked with water and ocean symbolism. The symbols seem oddly placed in the book, as if the author had thrown them in as a last resort to give her story more literary value. Uunfortunately, the symbols are blatantly obvious and show little imagination.Furthermore, the ending of the book was ridiculous. It seemed to be a novel about the liberation of woman, but at the end only discourages independence. The reader is almost angered with both the author and the main character for the character's final decision.

After reading this again as an adult that has experienced things of her own, I realize again how truly amazing this novel is. The writing and the emotions evoked are incredible.Every woman should read this at least once. This book can be read over and over and at each stage of your own life, I think you'll recognize more incredible things about Chopin's writing and her wonderful character."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

She crawls into her own skin for the first time and opens her eyes and ears to her heart and soul. We all as human beings can relate to this novel by the internal struggles Edna goes through. She falls in love with a man, which is acceptable but Edna is married and has children. Although a mother, Edna is one of the most beautiful and captivating women most have ever seen. The beauty in this novel lies within the diversity of characters, the beautiful, insightful, and penetrating writing, and most importantly, The character Edna Pontellier whom we all, no matter what sex, race, sexual orientation, or culture, can relate to.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"I read this book about a year ago. The stark feminism in it hardly shocked me, because even Anne of Green Gables is written from a somewhat feminist viewpoint. Yes, feminism has been around since the fall of man.Kate Chopin is an excellent writer, of course, and she paints a complete picture without an excess of words in The Awakening. Besides these assets, however, I found myself greatly disliking the book, simply because it represents principles absolutely opposite to my own, to those that are rooted in the Bible. However, my opinion of the book changed when I reached the end. Edna was so controlled by her emotions and so vainly searching for satisfaction outside of right standards that she ended up absently committing suicide. What a profound ending this is: the path of feminism seems bright and colourful, dashing and daring, until the end, when one realises that all one's life has been spent on nothing but feeling good. Feelings may be nice, but what is left when the feelings are gone? Without mentioning the fact that Edna betrayed her husband and abandoned her precious children, the fact that Edna ruined and cut short her own life is a harsh enough lesson for any woman to read.The truth is that if one is not content where one is at, one will not be content anywhere else.And then there is this to consider: maybe Edna deemed it worth her while to fritter her life away doing whatsoever she pleased, and die before she could really reap the consequences. If so, she forgot that death is not the end, for humans have eternal souls, and hers must go someplace. If she spent her life defying God, then where must hers necessarily go to?"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"I don't think people were prepared to read a book about a woman not wanting to be a good wife or a mother. Kate Chapin introdused us to something very different but very beautiful at the same time. who understands a woman better than a woman herself? I think that Chapin was able to free herself through the character Edna Potellier, and one of the reasons why this book seems so honest is because you get the feeling that somebody actually lived through this. Chapin was able to shed some light for the darkness that women lived with. The Chartacter Edna is a symbol of freedom and liberation, showing a strong and defying person,she becomes an outcast to the typical women. Edna, unlike other woman has never really been shaped to be the house wife she was supposed to be, and because of this she could never be the mother or wife she would like to be; and besides it wouldn't make sense to trun yourself as a person to yourfamily,when all youv'e ever had was freedom in your vains. When this book came out, I'm pretty sure it come out with a scream that left the norm thinking about where the good woman had gon. Many people belived that this book made a woman look very selfish and weak because she was unable to do a job that God gave the woman,the priviledge to take care of that what a woman should take care of, but I on the other hand found myself very satisfied at the end. Society has the perfect picture of a woman, so was Edna a broken woman; or was she simple just a woman with wings?"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Edna Pontelier, the protagonist of Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening,&quot; is a wealthy New Orleans housewife who devotes herself to her family, fulfilling their wants and needs and abandoning her own. She begins her awakening when she takes a vacation with her family to Grand Isle, Louisiana and develops a close relationship with a man named Robert Lebrun. Robert Lebrun flees to Mexico and while he is gone Edna realizes she must escape the burdens society has placed upon her. She wants to become an independent woman, a woman who can fulfill her psychological and social needs. She also realized her friendship with Robert had escalated to love. When Robert returns to New Orleans Edna confesses her feelings for him and he reciprocates those feelings. However, in the 1890's there is no cure for love outside of marriage and as a result Edna can never be truly happy. Chopin uses excessive symbolism, such as the parrot in the cage, which symbolizes Edna's emotional captivity. She also uses foreshadowing, for example, Edna's brush with death in the water foreshadows how she will die. Although this novel is well written those who do not like endings with a twist will not like this novel. Chopin lived for her surprise endings and those who like that sort of style will find this novel highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

I like reading books, so since I've never heard of the book before, I was in anticipation to see what's it all about.The story started out plainly in a good written style. The imagery towards the sea, and all the symbols that include the parrot, the sea, the piano, and Adele, were very smart and intellectual.But as I kept reading, I was horrifid at what Chopin is trying to say in this book.( I am not a chauvinist or anything, and I do believe in a person having it's total freedom in deciding, and doing whatever he/she wants.) Edna decides to leave her husband, and all society, for her whims.At one point, Chopin describes Edna like an animal, and that is exactly what Edna is. She doesn't care for her children, her friends, anybody around her, but for 2 guys that are totally shallow and dumb. Suddenly, in chapter 23, Edna is sounding like a whore. Looking at guys, and ignoring her kids and husband.This may sound harsh, but I agree with those critics that condemned the novel. Society gets worse if people read this book.(not just women). If we need to become animals, to find ourselves then you go ahead.And one more thing. this book could have had a better lead character. edna can't make her mind,and instead gives up on her &quot;war&quot;.

And where a businessmans wife Edna who is the protagonist of the story, finds herself unhappy with her marriage and the way that she lives. So she is seeking a better &quot;love life&quot;. Later in the story she becomes suprisingly independent woman, who now lives apart from her children and husband. Edna is married to a man named Leonce Pontellier, who is a wealthy New Orleans businessman. Edna realizes that she is nothing but a trophy to her husband, and that it wasnt ment to be. But yet she loves her children so much, but it doesnt seem like she is involved with them as much as a real mother should be. And another reason for this is her husband doenst treat her like a normal human being, he treats more like a pet. She wants to have personal freedom, but she doesnt want to hurt the children while she is seeking personal fulfillment. Over time her seeking leads her to deep depression, and that does not help her at all. She is good friends with Adele Ratignolle, a married Creole who epitomizes womanly elegance and charm.

The opression of women in the 1800s and how it destroyed some brilliant people; or maybe even kept them from becoming real people. While we were discussing this book in class, a classmate of mine said that Edna seemed to be copying the actions of those around her because she hadn't been able to develop her own personality.

This novel deals with all the trials and tribulations of life in a society with many restrictions. I truly believe that Kate Chopin was way before her time. She deals with women and the ways they are suppressed by the social norms of society. Women are expected to place their desires for love, sex, and their need to be free in the backs of their minds. Kate Chopin breaks all of these laws, and is excellent at teaching women that they are individuals. Women are mixed individuals with many emotions. It is possible to love your family and at the same time not be happy. Anyone at anytime can find themselves and should not have to restrict their happiness. This is what happens to the main character Enda Pontellier in \\"The Awakening\\". The only problem is, when she finds her true self, society expects her to deny it. After reading this book I felt that I went trough the awakening with her. You can almost feel her pain for the need to be loved, in the way, which she truly deserved.

(Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The lot of women in the 19th century wasn't a terribly impressive one -- many of them had been reduced to babymakers and inoffensive \\"property\\" for the men.And Kate Chopin caused a massive scandal when she wrote about one woman who drifted from societal normal in \\"The Awakening,\\" leading to a world of exploration, love, and ultimately tragedy. Her misty, vaguely dreamlike writing can pull a reader into the world of 1900s New Orleans and its society, but her heroine sometimes feels more like a vessel than a fully-realized person.Edna Pontellier is the wife of successful New Orleans businessman L&eacute;once, and mother of two lovely young boys. Yet she is dissatisfied by her life, and feels no connection to the other wives and mothers, who idolize their motherhood and subservience. And when she encounters handsome young Creole Robert Lebrun while on vacation, she begins to \\"awake\\" to the feelings she has left behind during her marriage.Distancing herself from Leonce and her sons, Edna begins exploring art and emotions that have been denied her by the strictures of her society -- as well as an affair with the flirtatious Alc&eacute;e Arobin. She even moves out into a cottage of her own, much to the horror of those who thought they knew her. Her romantic feelings have not moved on from Robert, but his return makes her realize how different she has become...Kate Chopin's most famous work is often cited as a sort of proto-feminist work, with a woman rebelling against the male-dominated role she has been given. The fact that a story about a woman abandoning her husband and kids caused such a scandal only adds to that belief.But that's a rather restricted label to give such a versatile author, and \\"Awakening\\" is a book with too many facets to be so restrained. In many ways Chopin resembles a Southern version of Edith Wharton, exploring the stultifying society that she once dwelled in, and the often-tragic consequences of people -- particularly women -- who dared to step outside those unforgiving boundaries.Chopin's lush writing elevates this story even further, weaving an atmospheric, vaguely dreamlike web around everyday New Orleans. She makes readers feel the heat of a summer's day, the remote beauty of a party, the eerie majesty of an empty sea. And though \\"The Awakening\\" is infused by a feeling of languid dreaminess, Chopin creates a feeling of tension and inevitability that grows as the book goes on. It's almost a shock at the book's finale, when that tension releases in a quiet burst of poetic language.And to her credit, Chopin is able to make her points about women and society without setting up straw-men. Such characters as \\"angel of the house\\" Ad&egrave;le Ratignolle and the stuffy Leonce (who sees Edna as his personal property and expects her to obey) are examples of the usual society of the time, yet Leonce is a fully realized character who loves -- but can never understand -- his wife.Perhaps the biggest problem is that Edna herself is at times rather thin as a character. While she has many conflicting desires, she sometimes seems like a mere vessel for all those desires to be displayed over time. But there are some scenes where she does seem like a fully realized person, such as when she meditates on her lack of housewifely virtues, is struck by wild mood swings around her sons, and befriends Mademoiselle Reisz.\\"The Awakening\\" is more than just an early feminist novel -- it's an exquisitely written story about the roads that our own desires can take us down, and the tragedies that can come from it. A must-read, if nothing else for Kate Chopin's powerful writing."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Edna, born to a Presbyterian family, rarely has intimate friends. This changes, however, when she spends a summer in Grand Isle, Louisiana. There she meets numerous Creole families, including Robert Lebrun, and grows accustomed to their casual and affectionate ways. at the same time, Edna begins to realize her discontent with her role of wife and mother in Society. To escape the burdens that Society has placed on her, Edna focuses on her talent as an artist and removes herself from her previous duties of catering to her husband and children. Edna starts to appreciate solitude, and this, along with the desire to free herself from Society, leads her to commit her last act of escapism. Kate Chopin illustrates Edna's universal relationship to Society with her use of symbolism. Nearly every word in The Awakening pertains to a symbol, namely the sea, a recurring theme for Edna. While this creates an intricate novel that is well-written, less careful readers may fail to see the importance of the passages that Chopin placed in the book.

I've heard so much for so long about how it was a highly controversial and often banned book about a woman's sexual awakening, the first to openly address the subject. So I was expecting something highly erotic, but I wasn't accounting for how vastly mores have changed in the past 100+ years. To the modern reader, it's not even PG!If it had been written recently, I would have only rated it 3 stars. It reads like a pretty standard romance novel of today. I gave it an extra star in recognition of the enormous courage it took for anyone - and especially a woman - to write so openly and honestly in those days about a married woman's infatuation with another man. And for the portrayal of a woman who took her life in her own hands to leave her husband and live independently, which was unheard-of in those days. And for the fact that it was so far ahead of its time - imagine, an author foresighted enough to write a modern romance novel prior to 1899!I was disappointed by the ending, though. Without saying too much about what happens, it negates the (early) feminist message of the entire rest of the book, leaving the reader with the impression that Chopin is giving us the message that if a woman tries to be independent, catastrophe will result.That being said, it is an interesting portrayal of Victorian life in the American South, and especially of a married woman's adulterous, and perhaps obsessive infatuation with a man much younger than her boring husband. Understandable, yes, but still wrong, and although I admired Edna's spirit, courage, and independence, I didn't like her much as a character. I didn't like her selfish disregard of her commitments, especially to her children. I actually liked her husband much better than her, in the end. Edna's marriage was loveless, but she went into it knowing that and willingly choosing it. Her husband was controlling and absent at first, but as she withdrew further and further from him he changed. He really worked at the marriage (unlike Edna), even to the extent of allowing - even helping - her to do whatever she wanted, which was another thing unheard-of in those days.But I didn't need to like Edna to enjoy reading the book. It is beautifully and lyrically written, and is a deeply perceptive portrait of what it feels like to be a woman with an overwhelming crush on an inappropriate man.(221 pages)"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"Obviously, this book was far ahead of its time. It's short, but carries a huge message (whether Chopin intended it or not). I love this book and will read it again and again."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The Awakening is a wonderfully ambiguous book that resonates more powerfully if one considers it in its historical context. Its publication in 1899 ostracized Chopin for the remainder of her life (she died in 1904) and for the mores and social values of the time it was a very scandalous work. Based on some of the reviews I have seen posted, it can still invoke the ire of readers. I have a feeling Chopin would be pleased.Chopin's protagonist, Edna Pontellier, is a woman in a daze. She has a comfortable life, a loving husband, and adoring children. And something is missing. The Awakening is the story of Edna's realization of what she wants out of life, and her pursuit to get it. Her story could be from 2009, except it isn't. It is 1899, and women should be happy with material wealth, nice kids, and a good husband. And Edna was, until her inner passions and desires are awakened by a summer flirtation.What makes this novel so excellent for reading and discussing is that you can see Edna as a women brave enough to liberate herself from society's bonds, or as cowardly and selfish in her hedonistic pursuits. And the text supports both interpretations. It is almost as if Chopin is admitting to her readers that even she has ambiguous feelings about her premise.This is not a text with a lot of action; the most important movement is in the character's heads. But if you want a text that will make you think, force a deep and close reading, and yield new insights (not all of them positive, Edna is not an especially likable women) every time you visit it, then The Awakening is for you.A great selection for book clubs, or classrooms, as the imagery and symbolism in the text allows for limitless interpretations."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Who's going to write it????"},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ... (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","review":"The lot of women in the 19th century wasn't a terribly impressive one -- many of them had been reduced to babymakers and inoffensive \\"property\\" for the men.And Kate Chopin caused a massive scandal when she wrote about one woman who drifted from societal normal in \\"The Awakening,\\" leading to a world of exploration, love, and ultimately tragedy. Her misty, vaguely dreamlike writing can pull a reader into the world of 1900s New Orleans and its society, but her heroine sometimes feels more like a vessel than a fully-realized person.Edna Pontellier is the wife of successful New Orleans businessman L&eacute;once, and mother of two lovely young boys. Yet she is dissatisfied by her life, and feels no connection to the other wives and mothers, who idolize their motherhood and subservience. And when she encounters handsome young Creole Robert Lebrun while on vacation, she begins to \\"awake\\" to the feelings she has left behind during her marriage.Distancing herself from Leonce and her sons, Edna begins exploring art and emotions that have been denied her by the strictures of her society -- as well as an affair with the flirtatious Alc&eacute;e Arobin. She even moves out into a cottage of her own, much to the horror of those who thought they knew her. Her romantic feelings have not moved on from Robert, but his return makes her realize how different she has become...Kate Chopin's most famous work is often cited as a sort of proto-feminist work, with a woman rebelling against the male-dominated role she has been given. The fact that a story about a woman abandoning her husband and kids caused such a scandal only adds to that belief.But that's a rather restricted label to give such a versatile author, and \\"Awakening\\" is a book with too many facets to be so restrained. In many ways Chopin resembles a Southern version of Edith Wharton, exploring the stultifying society that she once dwelled in, and the often-tragic consequences of people -- particularly women -- who dared to step outside those unforgiving boundaries.Chopin's lush writing elevates this story even further, weaving an atmospheric, vaguely dreamlike web around everyday New Orleans. She makes readers feel the heat of a summer's day, the remote beauty of a party, the eerie majesty of an empty sea. And though \\"The Awakening\\" is infused by a feeling of languid dreaminess, Chopin creates a feeling of tension and inevitability that grows as the book goes on. It's almost a shock at the book's finale, when that tension releases in a quiet burst of poetic language.And to her credit, Chopin is able to make her points about women and society without setting up straw-men. Such characters as \\"angel of the house\\" Ad&egrave;le Ratignolle and the stuffy Leonce (who sees Edna as his personal property and expects her to obey) are examples of the usual society of the time, yet Leonce is a fully realized character who loves -- but can never understand -- his wife.Perhaps the biggest problem is that Edna herself is at times rather thin as a character. While she has many conflicting desires, she sometimes seems like a mere vessel for all those desires to be displayed over time. But there are some scenes where she does seem like a fully realized person, such as when she meditates on her lack of housewifely virtues, is struck by wild mood swings around her sons, and befriends Mademoiselle Reisz.\\"The Awakening\\" is more than just an early feminist novel -- it's an exquisitely written story about the roads that our own desires can take us down, and the tragedies that can come from it. A must-read, if nothing else for Kate Chopin's powerful writing."},{"Title":"The Awakening: Complete, Authoritative Text With Biographical and Historical Contexts, Critical History, and Essays from Five Contemporary Critical ...

Definitely recommended!"},{"Title":"Joni","review":"This is one of those few stories that never leave you. Even after you have read the book, closed it and put it on the shelf, the story remains and you can't get it out of your head. A bright, energetic, full-of-life girl goes diving into the shallow water - an act that will forever change her life and ultimately change the lives of millions of others.Suddenly, this athletic, independent young girl is trapped in a body that will not move. Paralyzed from the shoulders down, she finds herself no longer independent, but fully dependent on the care of others for the simplest of tasks. Things we take for granted like wiping away tears, blowing your own nose or brushing your hair - now on someone else's time table, not your own.Understandably, this turn of events shakes her faith as she shakes her mental fists at God for dashing all her hopes and dreams for the future. Failed romances, rocky friendships, family heartaches - Joni holds nothing back in this insightful view into her world.Through her emotional and spiritual failings, the author shares her growth and understanding of God's plan for her life and the lives of others. Using her mouth to draw and paint, the author became an established artist long before people realized that the artist whose work they were admiring was completely paralyzed and unable to use her hands. This revelation thrust her into celebrity where she has been able to make more of an impact on the lives of others than she would have ever been able to have accomplished prior to her injury.Through her charity, Joni & Friends, the author has provided for wheelchairs for the disabled around the world and opened the doors of opportunity to wheelchair bound people everywhere.I've seen the author on Larry King a few times and always wondered, \\"how does that woman keep smiling and keep such an upbeat attitude?\\" It is hard to imagine a worse fate than what she has endured since her accident, yet after reading her personal account of her life since that fateful summer in 1967, the reader understands exactly why she smiles and truly has joy in her life. I picked up this book thinking it would be 'interesting' and nothing more - I was delightfully surprised to find this to be a page-turner I could not put down. Even though I've finished reading this autobiography, I doubt I will ever truly put this book down.

Paralyzed from the neck down in a diving accident at age 17, Joni has faced suffering that few could imagine. She has endured unbelievable pain and loss. She has not even been able to do the simplest things for herself such as get a glass of water. Yet, in spite of all of that, she has excelled both spiritually and in the impact that she has had on countless others.The author provides some terrific insights into thankfulness, suffering and God's will. One thing that amazes me is her observation about how 'being in a wheelchair became trivial' after she realized how God's perspective is so completely different from ours and she changed her own. Another is the way that she visualized Jesus telling her that He knows how to run her life much better than she does even if it meant being physically helpless.Another interesting story deals with the thought that perhaps a prayer of hers before the accident led to that lifechanging event.The bottom line is that this is a superb book that should be read by all Christians, those dealing with big disabilities, and virtually everyone else who is interested in a life story made powerful by Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Joni","review":"This was such an inspiring true story.

She also recounts in detail the conversations she has had with young Christian women who are dealing with the possibility of never being married.But then there come the pictures of her wedding!!I hope no one will blame me for being unsatisfied, and wondering, How did she meet Ken Tada, her husband? What is their story? How did Ken succeed when all the other fellas failed? How long did it take Joni to take him seriously?Joni has written a postscript for this latest edition, but doesn't say much, if anything, about how she and Ken met.(Sorry to nitpick.

I felt what she felt: sadness, fear, anger, hope, desperation, and love. It is probably one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Joni","review":"I really thought that this book was cool because it had a lot of interesting parts.

The answer to her prayer took the form of a diving accident that left her paralyzed from the neck down. Non-Christians may find Joni's spiritual reflections tiresome or puzzling, but will still find inspiration in a young girl's transformation from suicidal despair to spiritual serenity.

This book is written by Joni herself, and what a wonderful, inspiring story it is. Joni finds herself in a Stryker frame with a broken neck at age 17 after a diving accident. She must then decide if her life is worth living. Fortunately, she answered in the affirmative, and now, about 45 years later, Joni Eareckson Tada exemplifies the true nature of Christianity through her intense love for others, expecially those with disabilities. She is an absolute inspiration in the courage she displays in overcoming her \\"limitations\\". She is a wonderful teacher, painter, speaker, wife, business CEO, and has chair positions on many boards, In short, she is a Christian phenomenon who decided to serve the Lord from her wheelchair. And serve the Lord she does. Joni and Friends is her organization, and she hosts a radio program daily heard on many Christian stations. I make it a point to gift her ministry each Christmas because she is truly doing the work of the Lord. Read for yourself what she had to overcome, the heartache she has faced, and yet, is such a positive influence for the Lord. Joni loves the Lord and she works tirelessly to promote His kingdom.This book will make you wonder. It will make you think. It will make you cry. It will make you cheer.

Now all of it is in one volume - and if you did not keep your daily press cuttings of their daily coverage, here is the book that enables you to be as transfixed by their coverage as those of us were who read their reports daily. Christmas is upon us - get this book for your friends to see what our troops were up to in Iraq. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan 2003) and the forthcoming CHURCHILL'S FOLLY: HOW WINSTON CHURCHILL CREATED IRAQ WHICH LED TO SADDAM HUSSEIN (Caroll and Graf, 2004)"},{"Title":"A Time of Our Choosing: America's War in Iraq","review":"This book is an excellent documentation of the events that were carried out by terrorists culminating in the 9/11 Attack on America.Details are given of all the efforts made by America to encourage the UN and all the major countries to take action to put an end to terrorism.It's clear, by reviewing events,almost on a daily basis,that if terrorism was to be defeated,America would get little support or action from the UN or Europe.It shows that it was not America's decision to \\"go it alone\\",as so ofen portrayed by the media and many anti-American countries.In fact, America was not only \\"stiffed\\" ,but continually criticized for every effort made to end terrorism.Most of Europe conducted a \\"War over Iraq\\" while America conducted \\"war on Terrorism\\".The book covers events up to the middle of 2003. Since that time there has been little if anything done by most of these countries that should have joined in fighting terrorism.The fact is that they have turned up their diatribe against America to cancel free elections in Iraq,because they couldn't be carried out.The fact that they were successful on Jan 31,2005,seems to be a great disappointment to the naysayers,and certainly not something to be jubilant about.Since the election,they have been continuing their prediction of doom and gloom.If you really want to see what America's true intentions are, this book is the place to find the statements actually made, rather than listening to the commentaries made by so many in the media.If you have bought into the nonsense that America is the villain and brought the War on Terror on itself,you could do yourself a favor and read this book and get the facts.On 9/11 President Bush said:\\"Terror against our nation wiil not stand\\"As to my title---\\"The global war on terror began in Afghanistan,to be sure,but it will not end there.It will not end until terrorist networks have been routed out from wherever they exist and it will not end until state sponsors of terror are made to understand that abetting terrorism is unacceptable,and will have deadly consequences for regimes that do.\\" This statement by Defence Secretary Rumsfeld on June 9, 2000 pretty well details America's intent to win the War on Terror.There are also several other statements made about Iran,Syria,North Korea,etc.,that should be understood when thinking what America intends to do about terrorism.Well worth reading and and keeping for a reference."},{"Title":"Hayy Ibn Yaqzan","review":"The History of Hayy Ibn Yaqzaan (Alive Son of Awake) was written by Abu Bakir Muhammad ibn \`Abd al-Malik Ibn Tufayl al-Qa'isi in pre-Spanish Iberia around 1170 with the aim of illustrating the equivalency between reason and faith as well the role of natural law. It is interesting to note that Ibn Tufayl was Averroes's teacher and predecessor as court philosopher, who in turn sparked Aquinas to write his Summa Theologica. This philosophical romance is a tale of two philosophies, represented by two islands. Ibn Tufayl compared the path of Divine Revelation with the path of Aristotelian \\"fitrah\\" (innate knowledge of right and wrong) and thereby illuminated and rationalized the Abrahamic faiths. On the fictitious and uninhabited island of \\"fitrah\\" or natural law somewhere near the Maldives appeared a lone child that some say was fashioned naturally similar to the first man Adam, while others say he was a Moses-like orphan washed ashore in a basket.He is suckled by a roe (female deer) who eventually dies, whereupon the young lad becomes a Doctor Quincy of '70s tv fame and begins his foray into forensics to discover the source of the roe's malady. Without language, this individual observes and reflects on the natural order around him in Aristotelian fashion until he is contemplating questions of metaphysics and Intelligent Design. By the age of 49 years, Hayy Ibn Yaqzaan has reached intellectual communion with his Creator.Then he saw his first human, a visitor to the island named Asaal. Asaal is a practicing Muslim brought up in the third stage of the Abrahamic faith. Having said that, it is confusing that Asaal has come to the island to be a hermit and worship God when the Islaamic religion forbids hermitage and monkdom.After the two awkwardly meet and eventually settle down to inquire about the other, Asaal teaches Hayy how to speak his language - no doubt a dialect of Arabic. Through conversation they realize that they are on the same spiritual page; one via Qur'aanic revelation, the other via Aristotelian reflection or \\"fitrah\\". Asaal invites Hayy to return to his city and meet other humans, which they do. But the other humans cannot understand Hayy's advanced metaphysical thinking; for them the Qur'aan is sufficient. Hayy returns to his uninhabitated island to live in communion with his Maker.The book is far-fetched in thinking that it does not take a village to raise a child, just a roe and God-given intellect. In real-life cases where children were cut-off from others, their development was stunted intellectually as well as socially. Humans are social animals and cannot become Einsteins of their own accord. Even Einstein owes a debt to his first wife who was a senior majoring in physics when he was but a freshman.The value of this book lies in its attempt to say that Greek philosophy is correct and Divine Revelation is correct - that there is no dichotomy between them. Ibn Tufayl is saying that natural law is no more than the rational creature's participation of the Islaamic law (or Submission to God law). Historically, this book is the mainspring to the field of natural law that Aquinas later devoted his life to. \\"Fitrah\\" is the Arabic word for \\"synderesis\\" - \\"natural law is promulgated by the very fact that God instilled it into man's mind so as to be known by him naturally\\" said Aquinas.Ibn Tufayl's short treatise is worth reading then. The only caveat is the introduction by Goodman; his Arabic is faulty and he doesn't seem to know that Spain was created in 1479 when King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella merged their respective kingdoms. Prior to 1479, there was no Spain - but that doesn't stop Goodman from referring to such nonsense as Mohammedan Spain. This story was written in pre-Spanish Iberia after the Muslims there fell into decadence and corruption and therefore represents a valuable cultural artifact in the decline and fall of Submission to God (al-Islaam) in addition to its contribution to the blossoming of natural law."},{"Title":"Euchre How to Play and Win","review":"This is an instructive and useful little book. And it's one of only two books in print on euchre that get it right (the other is The Columbus Book of Euchre, by Natty Bumppo). There are no glaring errors.There are some highly helpful hints on what to lead, and an interesting suggestion to lead a nine to save an ace (pp. 25-27. The author may have a point, but he does not explain it). There's an interesting section on bid euchre (both \\"partner\\" and \\"buck\\"), with good instruction.There are some annoying grammatical errors, such as \\"lead\\" as the past tense of \\"lead\\" going on for several pages beginning at page 23 (the author finally gets it right with \\"led\\" at page 32), and some syntactical number confusion (e.g., at p. 32, \\"If diamonds is trump . . . ,\\" and at p. 38, \\"In buck euchre each player plays for himself . . . . Each player bids on the number of tricks each feels they can win\\").And because the book was printed before personal computers made \\"desktop publishing\\" a household possibility, it's not the most attractive book out there: The only color is on the cover, and the small type makes it a little hard to read.But the content of the book makes it well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Feminists","review":"After seeing the cover and synopsis for this lost scifi pulper on some website, I managed to track a copy down for under two bucks (let's hear it for the Internet).Picture, if you will, a combination of ILSA: SHE WOLF OF THE SS, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, IN LIKE FLINT, and INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and you'll pretty much have a perfect picture of THE FEMINISTS, a novel that (probably) gave even Archie Bunker nightmares. I also discovered (in a fruitless attempt to contact the author, whose last published work is listed in 1987) this was one of several feminist-themed scifi novels released in the early 70s.In the near-future of 1971 (1992, to be exact!), the world is controlled by women, and men are expected to be subservient and are even put to death if they have sex without permission. After performing an unsanctioned horizontal mombo with a female co-worker, protagonist Keith Montalvo escapes from the system and joins a band of underground rebels bent on overthrowing the system. With the help of a few inside-spies, they manage to plot a dual-assassination of both NY's female mayor and the female President of the United States (I couldn't help but wonder if Quentin Tarantino blatantly robbed this novel's second half for his version of INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, which features a nearly-identical finale). There's action-a-plenty, some (obviously) dated social commentary, and I don't know how well the rebels would be received were this novel to be released today (they're basically terrorists, bent on bombing the Feminist Regime out of power, regardless of civilian casualties).While the writing is so-so, the story is pure \\"cult-film\\" fun (regardless of the semi-cornball ending). Cooper uses male AND female rebels, I'm assuming in an attempt to not have ticked off too many real feminists at the time of publication. If you're a fan of 70s pulp, you'll blow through it in 2 or 3 hours.

Her writing is relatively dense for those not familiar with this territory, but she is clear and ultimately rewarding. Well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Dear Impostor (Sinclair Family Saga)","review":"With a heroine named Psyche Persephone Hill, it is no wonder that Dear Imposter reflects the influence of several myths. The excessively proper Psyche is tempted into an outrageous faade when she learns she will gain control of half of her inheritance when she announces her engagement. She instructs her maid to hire an actor who will play the role of a fianc&eacute;. It certainly sounds like the stage for a Pygmalion story with the low-born actor remade into a worthy suitor. But the man who arrives at the betrothal party has no need of instruction; Psyche eventually learns Gabriel Sinclair is not an actor but a most improper gentleman.Like the Psyche of myth, she falls in love with a man whose identity is a mystery to her. Like the Persephone of myth, she loves a dark figure who frequents the Regency underworld of gambling hells. However, this Psyche challenges her love to make his home in her world while he helps her overcome her fears of impropriety. Meanwhile, the danger escalates through the attacks of Barrett, who would rather kill than lose the estate he gambled away to Gabriel.Nicole Byrd has crafted a particularly clever tale. The ties tomythology enhance and never detract from the plot. It takes a great skill to weave all of these elements together this well. Dear Imposter is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Dear Impostor (Sinclair Family Saga)","review":"Even winning an estate at cards from Lord Barrett turns into another losing chapter in his life for Gabriel Sinclair. He left England in disgrace and just recently returned to win the estate only to have Barrett send thugs after him because dead men not only don't tell tales, they also fail to collect debts. The timely appearance of a coach near the theater alley where he had been accosted saves his life.Psyche Hill thinks Gabriel is an actor that she has hired to masquerade as her fianc&eacute;. Though an heiress, her uncle holds her purse strings unless she marries. However, Uncle Wilfred has always managed to drive away her suitors because he plans to have his niece marry his son. The dynamics of relationships change when Psyche introduces Gabriel to Wilfred as her intended. Intrigued by her and needing a haven, Gabriel plays the part of someone in love, which he soon realizes is not a role anymore.Placing aside the name of the lead female character, DEAR IMPOSTOR is a puissant Regency romance that employs action and humor to add depth to an alluring story line. The plot works because the reader can see the transition of Gabriel from bumbling ham into ardent lover at the same time Psyche changes too. The support cast adds intrigue and danger to a fine tuned mix that will send sub-genre fans soaring with Nicole Byrd's engaging historical romance.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dear Impostor (Sinclair Family Saga)","review":"I enjoyed the author's Robert's Lady, but I loved Dear Imposter. The witty dialogue, the plot twists, and the romantic scenes kept me turning the pages. And just when you thought everything was okay, the author sprung new surprises on you.A very satisfying read, the kind you'd pick up a second time."},{"Title":"Dear Impostor (Sinclair Family Saga)","review":"On the first try at reading this book, I did not like the cover (which seemed amateurish) or for that matter, the story despite the promising beginning. I set the book down for a couple of weeks, during which I indulged a vampire/erotic fix. When I came back to the book, I was much more forgiving of the cover, of the story itself (writing style, plots and all).There are significant jumps in logic (or errors, if you will) starting from the fact that there were few marquesses (not marquises) in the Irish peerage (or for that matter in the British peerage), and any one could have challenged Gabriel's identity from the start. I chose not to penalize Nicole Byrd on this point, given the errors made by other authors (including Kelly in MISS MILTON SPEAKS HER MIND).If this and other problems in logic bother you, avoid this book. I read it strictly as a piece of fantasy. I allowed for Gabriel's deception to proceed, for Gabriel's allowing a villain to harrass him without calling in the forces of law and order, for the villain to be obssessed by revenge without his motivations being made clear (although I guessed that his hatred increased over time when Gabriel saved a friend from his cluthes). If I do not allow for those things, and mark off for other deductions, this book would rate a 3.2 or so.The writing style is also rather detailed, so if you are not a fan of descriptions of dresses (when the tailors are called in to help Gabriel and at the ball), this book will not please. This is a fun read, a well-written read, but not perfect. I treated it as a slightly upmarket Amanda Quick with a more tortured hero, and was perfectly happy when I finished the book. Others will view this book differently.Rating (taking flaws into account) 3.2Recommendations - avoid if you dislike errors in logic and hate descriptions of fashion and costume."},{"Title":"Dear Impostor (Sinclair Family Saga)","review":"I had been unable to find the book Dear Imposter by Nicole Byrd and tried Amason.

She hires a actor to play her fiancee but there is mix up. This book has adventure, romance and great cast of characters."},{"Title":"Dear Impostor (Sinclair Family Saga)","review":"I like Gabriel a lot. He is charming and witty and sexy, and his charm is based on kindness. Psyche is too self-contained at first, but she shows evidence of her spirit when he puts the odious Percy in his place and becomes infuriated with the \\"actor\\" she has hired (Gabriel). Secondary characters appear in the sequel, Lady in Waiting (most to greater advantage).There are problems with the tale, mostly historical inaccuracies, but if you can ignore those, the tale is engrossing and satisfying. Although sometimes taking too long to resolve and sometimes lacking enough motivation, the mysteries and dangers add to the tale's interest and are better integrated into the romance than are the attempts of many others."},{"Title":"Dear Impostor (Sinclair Family Saga)","review":"In order for Miss Psyche Hill to gain control of a portion of her fortune from her tight fisted uncle she would have to come up with an aristocratic and acceptable fianc&eacute;, so she has her maid go out and hire an actor to play the part for an evening betrothal party! Unfortunately, the actor is waylaid and the man who jumped into the carriage which was to have taken the actor to the betrothal party turns out to be the notorious gamester Gabriel Sinclair who was running for his life from some very dangerous \`sore losers' that were out to do him bodily harm! Being quite astute, and a quick study, Gabriel figures out that he is the guest of honor at \`his' betrothal party, when no one disputes who he is when announced as Lord Tarrington - the fictitious name Psyche had given to her relatives of her supposed fianc&eacute;. The divine and very proper Miss Hill was so gloriously beautiful that Gabriel decided not to correct her assumption that he was the actor her maid had hired.I really liked this story, especially after Psyche found out that Gabriel was not the actor, but a notorious gamester. The authors developed their characters very well and the dialogs were both witty and intelligent. I found the secondary characters to be quite interesting as well and found Psyche's sister Circe to be quite charming as well as the veritable \`hard as nails' aunt Sophie. What I also found enjoyable was the masterful put-downs Psyche used on her odious cousin Percy who didn't have a clue!The secret of who Gabriel truly was, did seem to be overly long and drawn out and finally meeting his father, gave new meaning to dysfunctional family! The passion was nice, but again nothing to make your toes curl. What I found endearing was Psyche realizing her love for and supporting Gabriel once she saw what kind of a monster his father was. All in all it was a satisfying read that I can recommend and I am looking forward to reading Circe's story the sequel \`Lady in Waiting'."},{"Title":"Dear Impostor (Sinclair Family Saga)","review":"This is Nicole Byrd (a mother-and-daughter team)'s second regency, after ROBERT'S LADY. I picked this book up on a recommendation from a reading list I belong to, and I was not disappointed. The story has been well-described elsewhere, so I will simply outline my impressions and my rationale for the four-star rating.The book begins excitingly with a stranger being chased by thugs out to get him... And so begins a fascinating story with some great primary and secondary characters... There is humor, there is a dark side showing the pitfalls of gambling in sleazy hells, there is a warm romance building up slowly but surely...I loved this story. The only reason that it got four stars (4.5 actually), and not five, is because of some problems - firstly,...If you want to look at the seedier side of Regency gambling, this book is a must-read. This also works as a slow-building romance between two people who both stand to lose something - Psyche the opportunity to provide her sister with further training as an artist (as well as her own freedom) and Gabriel his dream of returning home in style.Rating = 4.5Recommended = Highly"},{"Title":"Compass: A Handbook on Parent Leadership","review":"This book really is a wealth of information, especially for a handbook.

Instead, he includes Rococo, Chinese, and Gothic designs. The Rococo designs are extremely heavily ornamented, and fashioned in the most outlandish curved shapes: if you ever thought Pablo Picasso and &quot;modern art&quot; was too far out, take a look at these! The ribbon back chairs struck me as a particularly interesting design. The Chinese designs are far more subdued, and most have a bit of a swastika motif built into them. The editor for the modern version has added an appendix with several photographs of original Chippendale era furniture (not necessarily built by Chippendale himself), including several chosen to show that it really was possible to build the more elaborate designs. This is perhaps the single most historically significant book on furniture design ever written, and no furniture library would be complete without it."},{"Title":"Gentleman and Cabinet Maker's Director","review":"This book is a classic and all the other reviews are right-on.

That's OK. If you keep doing woodworking, you'll find yourself coming back to look at Chippendale. You'll go to antique shows and museums and see the real thing and eventually gain the confidence to give it a try. The book is inspiring in its design.

I must admit that this novel is not as good as The Mysteries of Udolpho. But I think when reading this novel it's important to keep in mind why Ann Radcliffe wrote it in the first place.It's impossible to appreciate Ann Radcliffe's intentions in writing this book and the complexities of The Italian without having first read Matthew &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis' The Monk. Lewis was so inspired by The Mysteries of Udolpho that he wrote The Monk, which has characters engaging in activities that are horrifying. (Lewis became so identified with his book that he was nicknamed Monk Lewis.) Mrs. Radcliffe was very upset that Lewis was inspired by her book to write his. In response to The Monk, Mrs. Radcliffe wrote The Italian. Mrs. Radcliffe &quot;corrected&quot; in The Italian what she felt was wrong and horrifying about The Monk.For anyone who finds The Italian lacking at all, I highly recommend he or she read The Monk to gain a better understanding of what Ann Radcliffe was trying to accomplish. And for anyone who has not read The Italian yet, read The Monk first- then I'm sure you will find The Italian a much more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Sicilian romance, (Belles lettres in English)","review":"This is the first book I have read by Radcliffe, and only the second gothic novel I have read. It is, by all standards of style and method, a gothic novel--so I doubt there is any need to elaborate on the moods, the romanticized environmental settings, or the literary devices found in the novel. As far as the writing itself goes, it becomes clear that the author is a very young and relatively inexperienced writer. The two major flaws of the novel that bothered me the most are: 1.) There is a great deal of redundancy in how the events unfold. For example, several times various characters would find themselves lost in the woods, suddenly see a faint light in the distance, follow the light, then find themselves in a perilous situation, only to escape by a similar means. This type of formulated plot was prevalent throughout the entire novel. 2.) Radcliffe seldom utilized transitional phrases. Often, paragraphs would shift from one location or person to another location or person with no transitional phrases such as \\"meanwhile\\", or \\"back at the castle\\", etc. The next sentence would just be about something different.In the simplest description, the plot was about a tyrannical, ambitious father who tries to marry off his daughter to regain his social standing and wealth. His daughter, whose heart belongs to another, escapes the castle, and proceeds to experience one perilous adventure after the other. But this is not really what the novel is about. It appears to me that it is more about the difference between men and women. In Radcliffe's world, the majority of men are to some degree corrupt, power-hungry, ruthless, debauched, selfish, insensitive, and tyrannical--and the effect these men have on the persons and environment around them is usually tragic. Even the presence of the few virtuous men in her novel seems to create in the women around them feelings of turmoil and anxiety. Even when they evoke the feelings of love, it is always bitter-sweet and agonizing. When men are present all is awry; violent thunderstorms cloud the sky, and even the natural environments are treacherous, gloomy or desolate. But not so with women! All women but one in this novel are virtuous, pious, demure, pure, innocent, submissive, and noble, and the natural environments that surround them are serene, beautiful, inviting, and sublime-at least until a man arrives. Throughout the novel women are constantly victimized by men, and Radcliffe seems to suggest that only when left to themselves can women be find peace and happiness in this world. Of course, considering the few rights and privileges enjoyed by women during her time (1764-1823), one can hardly blame her.Overall, I found the book a bit too tedious to really be enjoyable. Reviews site her novel The Mysteries of Udolfo as be her best, though I have not read this one. I would only recommend this book if you are serious about reading all the gothic novels you can get your hands on."},{"Title":"Sicilian romance, (Belles lettres in English)","review":"My favourite novel of Ann Radcliffe's is The Mysteries of Udolpho, but I think A Sicilian Romance is a promise of what Mrs. Radcliffe will be able to accomplish in her later books. For Ann Radcliffe and Gothic romance fans, this novel is a must because it plays on all of the classic themes of the genre. This is also great escapist reading to a world very much unlike our own. Radcliffe's heroines and heroes do suffer greatly and go through some extraordinary (perhaps sometimes unbelievable) events, but I find it thoroughly enjoyable to read about their adventures as I am a true romantic at heart. It's good to read about a world where when virtuous people are put through struggles at the hands of villians, the heroines and heroes are able to triumph."},{"Title":"Sicilian romance, (Belles lettres in English)","review":"I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie.

It's the story of Eddie, an illiterate longshoreman, and his anger towards his niece's affection for an illegal immigrant staying in his house. The complicated relationships between these and many other characters in the play makes A View From the Bridge a truly great piece of theatre. The play has the ingredients of a traditional Greek tragedy, complete with Alfieri, a narrator that fulfils the same purpose as Sophocles's chorus from his plays about Oedipus and Antigone. It's a really good read and unravels like a great page-turner."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"The structure of the play is uncomplicatad. The play is in two acts but within the acts there are easily defined divisions which are controlled by Alfieri. Alfieri is essential to the structure of the play. He opens and closes the play. He is Arthur Miller's mouthpiece and he moves the action fluidly. Catherine is a young lady who, it seems, as a result of her mother's death is living with her aunt, Beatrice, and Beatice's husband, Eddie. Eddie and Catherine have developed a close family relationship. The credibility of the relationship throughout the play is inceasingly questionable. Eddie is fatherlike in Catherine's eyes. In the first conversation between them Catherine looks for Eddie's approval that she looks good.She behaves almost in a coquettish manner to Eddie BUT this is not calculated. She sees him as a loving father figure. Eddie's obsessive attention to her physical appearance is realized when he asks her to turn around so he can see in her back. His intensions here are questionable. Is he attracted or is just parental pride? Eddie realises this from the beginning. Perhaps he feels that for the responsility he has taken, to support Catherine, he deserves a reward. The reward he wants(Catherine) is too big, and which if he got would be unnatural and ridiculous. Beatrice notices the relationship but her unwillingness to speak out makes her part of the problem. Eddie uses an emotional approach which in sensitive to Catherine's emotions. He suggests that all he is doing is looking out for her interests. He uses her inexperience to denunciate her arguements. Catherine shows her interests in Rodolpho's physical appearance. Eddie subjugates her. His intensions to show power dominate his actions. Rodolpho speech is lively and descriptive if a little frivolous. Catherine seems to be attracted to his different style which contrasts to Eddie's simple, normal style. Eddie is antagonistic towards Rodolpho because he is jealous of the obvious chemistry between the youngsters. Eddie unsuccessfully does his atmost to vilify Rodolpho. He sees him as a homosexual who is using Catherine to get an American passport. Catherine is attempting to be independent but she can't stand up to Eddie. She seems to be looking for attention again but Eddie's tension and his use of passionate words bring us to question his motives."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"Arthur Miller often allows the reader to have difficulty identifying with a character, while empathizing with several characters. This is the case in \\"A View from a Bridge.\\" When the story ends in tragedy, it is no surprise that the reader is made to question some aspect of American society.In this play, Eddie inherits the duty of raising his niece since the death of his sister. When cousins who are illegal immigrants come to stay with the family, it is a challenge to Eddie's role as father figure. The character and integrity of Rodolpho the younger immigrant is called in to question as he begins a relationship with Eddie's niece Catherine. Is he only marrying her to obtain American citizenship? Is he too much of a free spirit with his singing and dress-making skills? In Eddie's eyes, he certainly not the proper suiter he expected for Catherine. With a wedding on the horizon, Eddie takes his only real option to prevent the marriage. He calls immigration. The final confrontation between Rodolpho and Eddie ends in tragedy, but the character flaws in both men make it difficult to sympathize with either.The story raises questions of the bonds of family as well as the changing conditions of immigration into America. The fact that the play makes the reader think about social conditions is a reflecion of the quality of the play. It is from the high standard readers hold an Arthur Miller play to."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"I have loved A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE since the first time I read it, three years ago. It is a tautly written, exciting drama in which one can practically see the tragic end coming, \\"step by step, like a dark figure walking down a hall toward a certain door\\" (in the words of Alfieri, the lawyer in the play). But as well as the play \\"reads,\\" it is absolutely ELECTRIFYING when seen on stage -- as I found out just yesterday, when I saw a production of it. The actor who played Eddie Carbone, the protagonist, made the character very sympathetic; as a result, the play's ending was truly tragic. Read A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE, but also try to see a production of it, if you possibly can. I will admit, though, that it is not performed that often -- not nearly as often as it deserves to be."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"Well, after the reading the above reviews I have to say that I was compelled to write a review since I think this exsquisite piece of literature is one of the most moving plays I have ever read. A tale of wrenching and impossible desire, it exposes the danger of the subconscious and within that is a true love story. Arthur Miller has once again brilliantly created a complex and emotionally torturted man in Eddie."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"The great play writer Arthur Miller had the idea for \\"A View From The Bridge\\" when he was doing research on a longshoreman who was executed by the mob for attempting to revolt against union. He heard a story about another man who denounced his relatives to the Immigration Bureau. The play is not only about this fact, but also concerning on tense familiar and social relationships, and also there is a sexual identity subtext.Although \\"A View from the Bridge\\" is not as famous or as good as \\"The Crucible\\" or \\"Death of a Salesman\\", it is an interesting piece since its characters are so well developed. One of the main themes in this play is the \`naming names'. Just like Miller himself, the main character Eddie Carbone, had the chance of denouncing his friends. Unlike his character, the writer when inquired about his supposed communist friends chose to be loyal to them.But certainly, the main symbol in the play is Brooklyn Bridge, that means, among other things, pathway of opportunity to Manhattan and also the linkage between American and Italian cultures. And the community where the play is set is very close to this bridge. Miller has created again some effective characters in this play, who are forced to face problematic situations. They may not always succeed, but the writer does - at least most of the time."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"A awe-inspiring view of Brooklyn in the 1950's.

Marco's honesty and physical strength against the insanity and perverted thoughts of Eddie towards Catherine, was the perfect ending to a intricate struggle of loyalty versus human integrity."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"This is a tightly woven story that packs a punch in just a few pages. In fact, it was short enough that I thought there was no way to resolve the conflicts that left me hanging until the last few pages. Sure enough, Miller effectively tied up loose ends and still managed to surprise me despite ending in a similar fashion to what most would predict.The play is about an uncle's overprotective nature, which runs so deeply as to be too close for comfort, and the fact that no one would ever be good enough for the niece living in his home. The take home message is about letting go of something you love, as well as swallowing your pride, which ultimately leads to the downfall of at least two of the characters. Eddie's failure to cut his losses and admit he was wrong left him proud but dead.The setting gives a cool, albeit tiny, insight into what the New York waterfront must have felt like long ago, and the narration (through the eyes of the lawyer from whom Eddie sought advice) is a neat touch."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"Arthur Miller's View from the Bridge is a lengthy, emotionally packed drama that focuses on perplexing longshoreman, 40 year-old Eddie Carbone who has a disturbing inappropriate fixation on his 18 year-old niece. Lawyer Alfieri provides intermittent narration on the unfolding drama with tragic consequences.The 50's play, considered in Best American Plays, takes place in Red Hook Brooklyn, NY, where an Italian family, Eddie Carbone, wife Beatrice, and Catherine, the 18-year old niece whose mother was Beatrice's sister. It's unclear how young she was when they took her in, but since she has become a young girl, Eddie has been in control of her actions, the normal coming-of-age sexuality, like when he accuses her of the looks she gets by \\"walkin' wavy\\".Neice Catherine's argument to prove a short skirt isn't as short when she stands up and walks, she says, \\"when you see me walkin' down the street.......Eddie replys \\"Listen, you have been giving me the willies the way you walk in the street, I mean it.\\"Beatrice's two cousins, who are brothers, are immigrating from the beautiful mountains and oceans in Italy, but where poverty is the predominant force. The beautiful view is what is across the bridge.Hiding from immigration, the brothers are respectful and here to work and Catherine is soon in love with younger brother, Rodolpho. Through his own admission, the idea \\"eats\\" at Eddie, as his torment is fueled each day. Eddie is challenging, belligerent, sarcastic and evil.We don't learn a lot about his wife Beatrice's past or Eddie's, we just know that wife Beatrice is very aware of his actions and obsession toward Catherine. Beatrice and Eddie have not had sexual relations for months and she is craving to be his wife again.During the first act, the set-up is done well. The reader learns quickly about the sexual obsession; we learn how dedicated and respectful the immigrants are, we learn the frustration with Beatrice, and we learn very well, what makes Eddie tick!The drama moves quickly, it is intense and complete! There is a movie version, but I truly believe the best way to see this and get the feel of characters, is to see the entire play on stage. Movies leave out so much feeling one needs to grasp to gather your thoughts.I recommend highly, Miller'sAll My Sons (Penguin Classics)\\"All My Sons\\" andThe Priceand of course, the popularDeath of a Salesman (Penguin Plays). .......Rizzo"},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"The way Miller portrays the relationship between Catherine and Eddie is extraordinary, one can't help but wonder if his love is stronger than that of a father figure.

I am not familiar with Arthur Miller's reading habits, but I would assume that he knew the Greek playwrights very well. It seemed to me, as I read, that A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE is not so much a picture of \`contemporary New York' as a 20th century statement about human nature. Eddie Carbone works as a longshoreman, accepts the union and Mafia codes of solidarity that went along with the job in that time, and lives with his wife and orphaned niece. He has a good heart, he earns a living, takes in illegal immigrant relatives, and is a decent man in every respect except that he harbors an illicit love for his beautiful teenage niece, a love that leads him to acts of jealousy that doom him. One of the illegal immigrants falls for the niece, clouding Eddie's behavior, moral sense, and judgement so badly that the terse two acts must lead to an inevitable conclusion. If you want a play that speaks of modern America, this is not your best choice. The language, the scene, the mood---all quite far away from 2012. But as a view of human nature, this play is timeless, as the best plays always are. It seems to me that some other American plays are more powerful, somehow more poetic as well, but A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE certainly ranks among the greats."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"Arthur Miller never ceases to impress me.

Let's take as example a play &quot;A view from the bridge&quot; by Arthur Miller. The man cannot change his fate. The man cannot raid against fate. I think that is idea of this play. That's why it useless to talk about decisions, that effect (negatively or not) of life. The main tragedy in the play began not when Rodolpho and Marco came to Eddies house, it began when Eddie decided to &quot;keep&quot; Catherine for him. But, as I think, there was no tragedy if there were no Beatrice. She decided to loose everything. She loved Eddie, and she decided to separate Eddie and Catherine any way, so, to save Eddie for her. She cannot imagine, that it could turn into tragedy. I'm sure, that she loved Catherine, not more, not less than Eddie, and she understand, that Catherine's love want only papers, but her love for herself, her pride, won. She loved herself and Eddie more than Catherine, so, her advice to 18 years old girl was to stay with Rodolpho. What comes next? Eddie do not want Catherine to be with rodolpho. But Catherine loves him and, of course, she will not listen to Eddie, who wants for her only best, she listen to Beatrice. Beatrice thought, if Catherine will be with Rodolpho, Eddie came back to her, but he does not want to leave Catherine with Rodolpho. Later, when Catherine said &quot;In the garbage he belongs&quot; [to Eddie], Beatrice said &quot;Then we all belong in the garbage, you and me too. ...We all done it&quot;. She has no pride to say &quot;I belong&quot;, she said &quot;You and me too&quot;, &quot;We all done it&quot;. Who &quot;we all&quot; ? Eddie - he just wanted to defend Catherine. Catherine - she is young girl, and she cannot understand so serious problems in her age, she should, but don't forget, that she was raised without parents by man, who loved her. Rodolpho - he needs only passport, nothing else. Beatrice - she needs Eddie, she wants Eddie to leave Catherine, she needs Rodolpho to be with her. But why I said that it's useless to talk about decisions, that effect of life? What alternatives does Beatrice had? No alternatives. She'd lost Eddie in any way. Let's try to change the way of the story. Beatrice wanted to save Eddie for her marrying Catherine and Rodolpho. But, if her advises were like Eddies, and Catherine gone from Rodolpho, Eddie will with Catherine. she'd lost Eddie in any way. Even if Catherine married Rodolpho, Eddie will never return to her. So, she'd lost Eddie in any way. And at the end of the play, we understand that Eddie loved Beatrice. Before he died, he said: &quot;My B!&quot;. The life is strange thing. We want to change it, but it's very hard. We always want to make something better (it depends only on our character, for whom we want to make better), but it always turns to &quot;As usual&quot;. People are not so smart to change their life, their fate. And this play is just an example."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"A View From The Bridge is another classic example of Millers fine talent. Once again, he has taken a small class of people and created a literary/theatrical masterpiece. Each of his characters develop into strong individuals. It it because of his characters individuality that conflict and tension mounts. The relationships between the characters are tested and some form of problem occurs to highten the plot. Miller has an extroidinary, unique style. It reaches in and grabs the heart of the reader and connotates a kaliedascope of emotions."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"Arthur Miller's play of self-delusion and eventual acceptance is slightly above average at best. Perhaps I was just spoiled by The Crucible and Death of a Salesman, but it seemed much sloppier than his other works that I have read.It's split into two acts, which seem very disproportionate. The first act, which becomes extremely dull and seems to drag on, is more than half of the entire play; while the second act, which seems rushed, is less. Also, Miller should have gone into more depth with Eddie's transition from concerned uncle to confused monster. Eddie always has a sort of underlying hint of being disturbed, but it just isn't made clear enough.On a positive note, the end of the second act became very intense. It had my heart racing at times, and Miller ends the tale at a thrilling moment which, in my opinion, is the best way.I would recommend it only to really adamant fans of Miller who have already read his better-known work. It's absolutely not in the league of some of his other classics."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"Either I got a misprinted copy or they have a terrible editor.

If anyone else has had this problem, then there was an obvious mass misprint."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"What really kills this recording is the Guy Noire style narrator.Garrison Keillor kills this recording.We keep waiting for the wry and subtle in-jokes, and they fail to comeWhat we get is real life.Guy Noire only gets in the way.This recording arrived in its box as ordered, used. I was surprised not to find a lengthy brochure inside. I highly recommend you also get the play as written by Miller, perhaps atA View From the Bridge, Arthur Miller, I do not know, but I wish I had read the play along with hearing this live recording, as the issues raised in this play are crucial for where we are today.We are all immigrants and the grandchildren of immigrants, except for instance the Cherokee and the Sioux, etc. By what moral right may we now deny these who come as ew ourselves did?This play explores the nature of the immigrant, and the illegal one, and the criminal networks which hold them enslaved, as they are today, and the criminal employers who need pay them nothing, as they are illegal. For this reason they are labelled illegal, to pay them nothing.This play is not The Crucible as other reviewers wish. It is not Willy Loman, although issues of hidden sexual diversity may also find tracing.It is a play about poor immigrants, some illegal. We need read it today.Yet this recording may well not entirely provide a clear View from the Bridge.Apparently there was some adaptation in order to make it a purely oral reading, and thus the dominance of the Guy Noire character (a lawyer) who even provides descriptions of actions on stage as one would not hear in the theatre except in certain productions of Bertolt Brecht. All the same it was not clear to me just what Ed O'Neill was doing with Marco in the end. For all we could tell from the sighs they might have been, well, dancing.And that is the second distractor after Guy Noire: Ed O'Neill. We all know and despise Ed O'Neill fromMarried with Children - The Complete First Season, the hand in pants Al Bundy character is unshakable and the voice is clearly his here, despite the harder Brooklyn edge.It is hard to come to love Al Bundy, and it is hard for us here to identify enough with Ed's character to care in the end. We are thus tragically left with melodrama (reinforced by Guy Noire) rather than tragedy, bathos rather than pathos.And that is a shame. This play has much to tell us now today in so many ways.When we hear the original Caedmon recording of Death of a Salesman with Lee J. Cobb and Dustin Hoffman we do not need audio-visual clues telling us what we are not seeing, nor an Our Town type telling us what we ought to be seeing. Here I find the omnipresent, omniscient, ironic Guy Noire character intrusive and drawing from the direct drama, and wonder how much the original play has been adapted for this recording. Perhaps none. Perhaps too much. I need to read the book.I think people in other reviews have not heard this play clearly enough, but through the lens of other works by Miller. Read this work on its own. Do not read King Lear as if it were Romeo and Juliet. This work stands strongly on its own. We need read it now.We need open our arms to the huddled masses, as our Liberty statue promises. We need destroy the economic injustice which enslaves millions in our own homeland to the profit of a superfluously wealthy few, who when things fall apart get even more trillions thrown their way.Hear the subtext of this play. It preaches equality. It preaches justice. It preaches love. It preaches equal opportunity. It preaches America.Read the play. And then try this recording by the LA Theatre Works. You might even come to understand Al Bundy as the complex Eddie Carbone."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"(This review is for A View from the Bridge, which I give 2 stars. I think that All My Sons is Miller's best play, and rate that 5 stars)During the 1940's, Miller and director Elia Kazan were close friends (Miller actually dedicated All My Sons (1947) to him). In 1952, Kazan went before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and named eight people that had been members of the Communist party. Miller was very disappointed in his friend and wrote The Crucible as a metaphor for the witch-hunt that was taking place in Washington. Kazan responded with On The Waterfront, in which Marlon Brando fingers a corrupt union leader. Miller responded to Kazan through drama again in 1955 with A View From the Bridge.Eddie Carbone turns in two Italian immigrants because one of them (Rodolpho) is dating his niece (Catherine), whom he secretly (even unknown to himself) lusts after. Eddie is eventually killed by the other immigrant (Marco).Alfieri is a neighborhood lawyer whom Eddie seeks out for help to keep his niece away from Rodolpho. He tells him that there is nothing the law can do for Eddie, and that he should just \\"wish her luck.\\" Alfieri is the quasi-narrator of the play, and it is his neutral view from which the play takes its name (he is also a bridge between Italy & America, between old world values & the American law). He is a Cassandra character - he knows what will happen and Eddie does not listen to him.It's much less dimensional than Death of A Salesman or All My Sons, an incredible play about war-profiteering and cover-ups that has never gotten the attention it deserved (it reappeared on Broadway in the fall of 2008).Arthur Miller appeared before HUAC in 1956. True to his word, he refused to supply political information about other writers and entertainers. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail and blacklisted, but it was eventually overturned."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"This play explores the same old turf as \\"Death of a Salesman\\", but it does so with much less satisfaction and much less character development. Eddie is no Willy Loman, though, and the play suffers immediately from a lack of a central, driving force like Willy. Parts of the play seem borrowed from Tennessee Williams, and they don't seem to work in this context. There is some business about the romance of the Old World Italy versus the New World of Opportunity on the docks of New York, and it is the only topic that is at all explored well, if still unsatisfactorily. Eddie's dreams are represented in his pretty niece, Catherine; and unlike Willy Loman's uncle, she is still an attainable dream. That makes Eddie's life seem all the more petty, in comparison to Willy's: he longs wearily not after what he could have had, but after what he can never have, as he is already married. The death scene at the end of the play also seems like a forced, tacked on ending, and Alfieri's entire presence is a more or less unsuccessful stage gimmick. There are better plays by Miller, and many better plays by others."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"reading a view from the bride i was struck by the similarities of eddie carbone and archie bunker."},{"Title":"A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE:A PLAY IN TWO ACTS.","review":"This play is a very intriguing play and I find it very interesting to study.

He should be admired not just for his astounding courage in the face of great potential danger (impressive in its own right), but for the even more laudable act of allowing the \\"enemy\\", so to speak, to maintain his dignity at all times. While mainstream America elects to caricature and point its finger at the Ku Klux Klan and other similar groups for their overt racism, Mr. Davis has opted for a much more noble track, treating Klansmen as fellow human beings instead of dismissing them as mere stereotypes, in this way shedding light on their concerns, their values, their hopes, and their motives--however misplaced these might be.Although another reviewer raises an interesting point, is he/she genuinely convinced that the Klan is sophisticated enough to orchestrate such a public relations coup? After all, in the eyes of a wary public, what can the Klan possibly stand to gain from its involvement with Mr. Davis? that it is now a kinder, gentler racist organization? The Kirkus reviewer seems to have overlooked the book's most endearing quality: bringing to light that a true and lasting solution to the race problem in the United States is neither political nor legislative, but spiritual. Mr. Davis is intuitively aware of this truth, and it shows in his approach to tackling the problem head on. Rather than attacking the overt racist (an easy scapegoat to America's most challenging social issue), he instead opts for the much more noble and delicate task of attacking the racism latent within him. I give this book five stars for the author's human and visionary approach."},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"IGNORE the posted &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; comments about this book. Mr. Davis relates witnessing a Klan acquaintance being sent to jail for no other reason than being a Klansman, just like Blacks used to be sent to jail for no reason other than the color of their skin. The &quot;Kirkus&quot; reviewer has condemned this book solely because it tells of things he or she doesn't want to admit are possible, i.e., that a Black man can treat Klansmen and Klanswomen as human beings and begin to affect their lives for the better. The reason I give this book a &quot;7&quot; is because it is well-written but not greatly-written. But if giving it a &quot;10&quot; would get you to read it, then I'll give it a &quot;10&quot; - if only because you'll never read another book like this. Bravo, Daryl Davis! May your detractors have one-tenth the guts and human feeling you evidence in your book."},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"In reality, through his book and the work he put into it as well as his continued efforts after the completion of this book, Daryl Davis has in fact helped many KKK members to see the light and to quit the Klan. Imperial Wizard Kelly whom the editorial review speaks of has in fact quit the klan and has givin his Imperial Wizard robe to Mr. Davis to use in his lectures. Kelly is one of many former klan members who have been touched by Daryl Davis and his work."},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"In this volume, Daryl Davis goes on a personal mission to better understand the men behind the KKK robes. Davis had a deep personal impetus to understand not only the inner workings of the KKK, but more importantly the motivations and constitutions of the men who join this organization.It is clear that Davis's journey, which includes conversations with several individuals associated with this organization at many different levels and others who have been impacted by their interactions with the organization, had a deep personal impact on him and PERHAPS some of the men who he encountered whom later ended their affiliation with the KKK.Though I personally have no deep-seated interest in understanding what makes one associate with such a divisive, contemptible organization and thus am clearly not the target audience for this volume, I give Davis credit for seeking answers to his own personal quandaries in such a thorough and potentially risky journey."},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN BLACK/WHITE ISSUES AND THIS BOOK WAS AN EYEOPENER AND A MASTERPIECE IN THE MAKINGITS AUTHOR TAKES YOU TO THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE KLANS ROOTSTHIER BELIEFS AND WHAT MAKES THEM TICKI TRULY BELIEVE DARLY DAVIS RISKED HIS LIFE WHEN UNDERTAKING THIS JOURNEYIM THANKFUL HE DID, THIS BOOK EXPLORES THE KLANS PERSPECTIVE ON MODERN DAY AMERICA (THEY HAVE AN ANSWER OR EXCUSE FOR EVERY OBJECTIVE THE AUTHOR COMES UP WITH)UNLIKE A PREVIOUS REVIEW I TRULY BELIEVE IF ONE KLAN MEMBER CAN CHANGE THIER VIEWS AS A RESULT OF MEETING THIS MAN THEN SURELY THAT SIGNALS HOPE?READ THIS BOOK ITS HOPE FOR A BETTER WORLD"},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"Davis is truly one of the most unique thinkers to come along in many years.I have followed the author's media appearances for years and find his open-minded viewpoint refreshing and quite extordinary.While some narrow reveiwers have branded Davis a simpleton,this savvy man is anything but.He realizes that once we UNDERSTAND the enemy,we can more peacefully resolve the problem.The author's non-violent,non-judgemental approach,coupled with the courage to try and KNOW the Klan make him a modern hero.Davis keeps as mementos over a dozen KKK robes given to him by Klan officials who have left the organization after knowing him.He is a peaceful,extrordinary man!"},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"Once you open Daryl Davis's book you will not want to put it down. It is a fascinating story about his journey into the heart of racism with seeming impossible outcomes. According to Davis (who says he owns, and has read, every book ever written about the Ku Klux Klan), this is the only book written about the Klan by a Black author who has actually had face-to-face interviews with Klan leaders. I recently met Daryl Davis and heard him speak during our MLK Day celebration at the college where I teach. He is a compelling speaker and, I might add, an outstanding piano player (a long-time friend of Jerry Lee Lewis and a co-performer with Chuck Berry). Daryl Davis's story needs to be heard by all Americans and deserves national media attention. I highly recommend this book and its author. (See his web site at: www.daryldavis.com)"},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"Truly a unique piece of literature. Davis amazingly provides the reader with a viable evaluation into the mindset of members of the K.K.K. He personally (and bravely) interviews Klansmen in an effort to bring some degree of clarity regarding their bigoted philosophy. Unlike other books on the Klan, Davis successfully depicts its members as simple people who have formulated their ideology out of common ignorance. He does not hedge on the fact that many Americans, both Black and white, are disenchanted by U.S. domestic policies, and illustrates how such frustrations have fueled hatred and mistrust between various races within the nation. Virtually absent are the antagonizing rantings and ravings so often identified with the K.K.K., as Davis shares his experiences in a well balanced, easy to read manner. Contrary to the opinion of the above \\"Editorial Review\\", Davis's succeeds at bringing to light certain misconceptions of the Klan, and manages to actually humanize those members he encounters during his research. Although this is not great literature, it is definitely worth reading. NOTE: The photo on the cover is clearly the work of a skilled artist...as the \\"handshake\\" is obviously manufactured."},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. I have always wanted to read a book written by a Black person and not a White person, regarding the Klan and such groups. Klan-Destine Relationships fit the bill. I only have 2 complaints - Daryl Davis got Emmett Till's age wrong (he was 14, not 13) and the names of the accused kidnappers/killers were mispelled in the case of J. W. Milam (he wrote Millam), and wrong in the case of Roy Bryant (Mr. Davis wrote Briandt). In a later chapter, Mr. Davis wrote that a certain Klansman was in court to witness a case concerning a fellow Klansman, then wrote that the man had not been there! Was he in court that day or was he not? Other than these discrepancies, the book was informative, eye-opening, and gave me a glimmer of hope. These die-hard racists/White supremacists were actually cordial, and even friends with, a Black man! Perhaps the members of Stormfront and other racist web communities should read this book. It may not change their minds or open their hearts, but then one never can tell with people."},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"Unlike the Kirkus review, we actually got what Mr. Davis is saying. Clearly, the book is too complex for them to understand and over their heads. I'm not going to nitpick or refute their points as they completely miss the points on the incidents they list in their review. There is more to each of those incidents. He isn't taken for a ride, or being used. His point is common ground and a platform for your enemy is the only way to make change. We just heard him speak and he had a great statement: \\"Ignorance breeds fear, fear breeds hate and hate breeds destruction.\\" Mr. Davis is an agent for change and understanding. People have left the Klan as a result of Mr. Davis. He has appeared on talk shows and taken part in various events and platforms regarding race relations and hatred, including many talk shows. I would highly recommend this book. It really makes you think."},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"Great read. The books reads very quickly. I was genuinely interested in what would transpire in each chapter and what each of the Klan members would reveal about their thoughts to Daryl. I would like to have dinner with Daryl some day. He is an interesting guy."},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"This really is a book about Daryl Davis forming relationships with various clan members and that's all it ever claims to be. Some of the clan members may seem opinionated, overbearing, or just plain backwards in their thinking, but Mr. Davis portrays them as sincere and dedicated to the causes they uphold.I've been to see Mr. Davis speak. All he had to do was hold up the KKK robes from the former members he knows that are now his friends and I was convinced. Among those robes now is the robe of Roger Kelly Former Imperial Wizard of the KKK. This book is meant to inform, to battle ignorance, and it does just that.edit: If you want to see the CNN special about Daryl Davis and his relationship with the KKK on youtube you'll have to search for: black KKK member. There's a part one and a part two. I find it sad that the title of the videos completely twists the actual relationship between Davis and the KKK."},{"Title":"Klan-destine Relationships","review":"I heard of Daryl Davis and his story in a Cultural Anthropology unit on race and racism last semester. As soon as I heard of his story and his lifelong study of race, racism, and the KKK, I knew that I had to delve deeper into his story and learn more about such an anomaly. Who has ever heard of a black man at a KKK rally? I mean, seriously.When I actually got to reading this book, I learned A LOT. In the world, we are taught that all members of the KKK are terrible, evil, horrible people. Now, do not get me wrong in saying that I condone the KKK or its behaviors, but this book made me realize that like all other things in the world race and racism is a spectrum. Different clans believe in different things and have different belief systems.This book is a surprisingly easy read considering the subject matter. I finished it in less than two weeks on a busy schedule and it truly made me sit and think. And on top of that it baits you to read and others to read to the point where I intend to buy a second lending copy for others in the next few weeks.The bottom line is this: if you read this book, it will affect you and open your mind.

The author has done a tremendous job of being comprehensive, covering everything I could think about. The field varies from the arcane to the mundane, and there are a lot of threads to be tied together - and he manages to do so very well. He does say it is not a programmers cookbook, and I did not expect one. But he has done a guidebook to an industry that seems very fragmented - with this book, you get a good grip about what is fragmented and what is already standardized. The author really penetrates deep into the concepts, drilling down into position-service APIs, geocoding languages, and privacy aspects. Sometimes, he even manages to make the stuff funny, and it is readable all the time. There are a lot of tricky things here, and as a developer, you had better have a clue about which traps there are to avoid. So far, cost seems to be the biggest problem for deployment - GPS is too [costly], mobile phone networks do not offer this as a service (which they could, and this is very well covered in the book).It is a five-star in my view."},{"Title":"Creating Location Services for the Wireless Web: Professional Developer's Guide (Professional Developer's Guide Series)","review":"This guy really took on a big area - and you get the impression it is still very much an area being worked on. There seems to be a lot of hot air and very proprietary solutions in the field, but not in the book. He concentrates on standards, since he like me realizes that the proprietary standards will not go anywhere. None of them can become big enough.He talks about positioning systems, APIs, how to add geocodes using the Geographic Markup Language - really useful. The only things I missed were some more examples from real services. But he does say that since many use text messages phones, and almost all interfaces are proprietary, it is hard to talk about without being extremely specific. There could be more about how to use GPS on PDAs, though, but I guess there are not actually that many services out there.The book really digs down into the subject (there is even a chapter on privacy), and I found it extremely useful. Lots of stuff there I did not know before. There could be more software on the CD, although there are pointers to lots of it. So I got it anyway.

Satan's Ring does that, and at the same time makes no apologies. This guy has guts for standing up for such a sensitive matter that is not just nation-wide, but world wide! And I just find it unbelievable that Publisher's Weekly and Booklist actually read this and put thought into it. I think that both of them sit in a little room once a week, drinking coffee and saying, \\"Hey, look at this. Let's bash this person!\\" I really do, because if they put some thought in what they read in this book, they'd see merely past the title.It starts right off where 3 hispanics are murdered on a back country road, and at the same time, the governor's car is attacked. Behind it is a hate group called The Brotherhood of The Ring. The leader is known only as The Shepherd. Bring in Andrew Chapman. The thing about Andrew is that he used to be a member of the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood is against all minorities and wants to eliminate all of them in what they call Operation Resurrection. It also seems as if power from this group comes from power in high places. In the midst of it all though, is a prayer warrior who is known for her long lists of who to pray for. This is a novel about Christianity, Satanism, love, hatred, bigotry, betrayal and sometimes you wonder who you can trust! I can almost compare this to Ted Dekker's one and only masterpiece, \\"THR3E\\", and for that reason alone I give it the 5 stars, because it deserves more. As for John F. Bayer, he deserves more respect than PW and Booklist give him. Booklist had the nerve to actually say, \\"Unfortunately, the supremacists are merely stock villains, and one does not learn a great deal about them.\\" Please read the book, then write your review. I did, and it gave me something to keep on my bookshelf. This book also shows the power of an awesome God. He isn't always going to put people in the comfortable situation. But with that in mind, He also puts ordinary people in extraordinary situations and then you see the awesome power of our loving Father! This is that kind of book. There are times where nothing is what it may seem. That's where trust in God comes into play. I think you have to trust in God to write something like this and then get it published. John F. bayer did that, he did it with success, and nobody can tell him any different without looking like PW or Booklist.Awesome work!!"},{"Title":"Harrap's French Slang Dictionary","review":"This dictionary rocks!

Michael Rossetti, brother of Dante Gabriel didn't know Keats, had a lot of biases about him, was clearly caught in those biases and the fact that as time passed Keat's writing rose in stature of opinion. Those misconceptions affect what was written about him but he did try to write fairly. To really understand Keats, his complete letters reveal much about him. Keats was incredibly smart if not a genius, sensitive, intuitive, witty, funny, heartbreakingly emotional and passionate. Cambridge Companion to Keats edited by Susan Wolfson offers an assortment of academic insights into uncovering Keats, a complex and vibrant character well worth investigating. I give three stars to Rossetti's because of the time in which it was written. Keats is a constellation of fascination and this book does not really do his greatness justice at all but has its merits none the less."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"I am trying to make a spiritual practice of reading at least one of the daily prayers, each day.

As a gift from a daughter of one outstanding Presbyterian Pastor and Father, I noted the Greek inscription from Luke 18:1, \\"That men ought at all times to pray and not faint.\\"Each Day of Morning and Evening prayer followed the same format:\\"Almighty and eternal God, Thou art hidden from my sight:Thou art beyond the understanding of my mind:Thy thoughts are not as my thoughts:Thy ways are past finding out.\\"This became familiar to me as the Fourth Day for each Month. It was followed by yet a longer version of related Baillie Prayer. In the third place, there was another prose prayer with excerpts from Psalms, such as 17, 36, 57 and 91, In this Fourth Morning Prayer he concluded with a more personal and intimate prayer, beginning: \\"O Thou who alone knowest what lies before me this day, grant that in every hour of it I may stay close to Thee.\\" There lies his wee touch of Scottish Theology.From this first example I always linger over his final sentence:\\"Suggest, direct, control every movement of my mind; for my Lord Christ's sake. Amen.\\"Nearly every day followed this same format with exceptions for the 11th, 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th Days, he altered both style and paragraphs. Yet that hardly ever affected his sustained interest in my daily Prayers.Another poignant beginning prayer comes on 16th Morning: \\"With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early; for when thy judgements are in the earth, the inhabitants of the earth world will learn (your) righteousness.\\" Many are longer yet equally intimate...

Great Book"},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"Seems kind of funny to say that a book on prayer is a great read, but \\"A Diary of Private Prayer\\" by John Baillie is that and a whole lot more. I received the book as a gift just over 2 months ago. It has become a treasured tool to guide my prayer life, and even more to grow in my prayer life.Dr. John Baillie from what I can tell was a Scottish theology professor, preacher, and author who had a heart for prayer and a desire to help others grow.In the past 2 months, I've prayed through the book twice. It has morning and evening prayers for 31 days plus one special Sunday morning and evening page.Here's why I like this book:1) It affirms God as the one we come to in prayer, and His agenda trumps my agenda. Praying to God seems obvious, praying God's agenda for most people, not so obvious.2) It recognizes the need to pray for others, not just myself. Not just the people I know, but the people I need to know to pray for -- unnamed faces, but critical issues in the eyes of God -- the poor, the lost, those in need.3) It builds a pattern of prayer day and night that can be built into one's life. I\\"m more morning person, but because it's just a page to pray. I have time. I make time to pray morning and evening.4) It improves my prayer life. I find myself praying these prayers, and saying God that's who I want to be -- one who follows Your will, one who builds his life on Your word.The one potential downside, it is in more of a King James English. Not my cup of tea in prayer, but that too has led me to appreciate the use of language in prayer. In this case, to provide a prayer time that slowly looks at the words and even more learns to listen for Your spirit."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"This collection of private prayers has wondrously opened to me the Scripture: Matthew 22:36-38: To get the context of verses 36-38, more verses are quoted in this Message Bible translation:34 When the Pharisees heard how he had bested the Sadducees, they gathered their forces for an assault. 35 One of their religion scholars spoke for them, posing a question they hoped would show him up: 36 \\"Teacher, which command in God's Law is the most important?\\" 37 Jesus said, \\"Love the Lord your God with all your passion and prayer and intelligence.' 38 This is the most important, the first on any list. 39 But there is a second to set alongside it: \\"Love others as well as you love yourself.' 40 These two commands are pegs; everything in God's Law and the Prophets hangs from them.\\"In Baillie's diary, much of the prayer content has to do with confession of sin. I now realize my confession of sin has been unwittingly perfunctory. 1 John 1.9 (KJV) reads: \\"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\\" In a sense and until I studied Baillie's Diary of Private Prayer, I have confessed my sins so that I might be forgiven - period.In Baillie's prayers, it seems his sin confessions were a direct outflow of his abounding love for God. Now, when I confess my sins -even as I read the confessions in A Diary of Private Prayer - I consciously realize the \\"First Cause.\\" Now my overriding motivation is an outflow of my love for God and not just a desire to gain forgiveness. I am grateful for that insight."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"This is a classic compilation of wonderful prayers by an Anglican theologian. His mix of liturgical phrases and Scripture lead the soul into contemplation of God, His universe and the everyday world.

The volume may be small in size and print, but the words are priceless in leading our thoughts to God."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"This book has opened up a new level of depth in my prayer life.

I ordered four copies and received 2 hardback, used and 2 paperback, new. These are gifts, so I will be proud to give them."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"I am a minister and have used this book during worship around Prayer Time teachable moments. Baillie's prayers are superb, but they are written in an older style that would have been a bit difficult for our international congregation to grasp. But the content of these prayers was just too good to pass by. So in a typical implementation I took one of his prayers, paraphrased it, provided handout copies to the congregation, and then used the paraphrase as a template for that morning's pastoral prayer. Then I encouraged the congregation to take it home and use it throughout the week.I highly recommend this book.Pastor Tim Isbell ([...])"},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"Kindle edition is poorly proof-read. A lot of mistakes. The book is a great addition for personal devotions. Well worth the money."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"I start my prayer time off everyday with this little book. Its wonderful truths in simple form are just what I need to remember who God is. If you use the ACTS method of prayer, this is a wonderful way to show adoration for the Master. I am going to try to get one for everyone in my family. I would suggest a slow reading, however. It is an easy read, so it is possible to read the words without getting the most out of the book's depth. I also like how the devotions remind us to pray about those in certain circumstances by leaving three periods ... so we can fill in a name in our private thoughts. It is a short book with only a month's worth devotions, but I suspect I will use it for many months because the truths remain the same. It also has places in the book in each section and at the end for personal notes. I highly recommend John Baillie's A Diary of Private Prayer for a daily dose of God's greatness."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"I purchased this book as a surprise replacement for the same edition that my sister had used daily for six decades, but was lost during a hospital stay. Although her copy had been heavily annotated, this replacement copy's interior appeared untouched and the exterior was only slightly worn. This replacement copy was a wonderful blessing for my sister and I am so very thankful for the seller's association with Amazon, making it possible for me to locate it."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"The overall appearance of the printed page is repulsive. Overly bold type, type size far too small for the weight of type face, cheap quality paper. These were to be gifts to treasured friends. A huge disappointment. I've owned a hardback copy for 40+ years and it is still elegant in its visual appeal. The current physical copy is a slap in the face to its spiritual content."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"John Baillie was an Anglican theologian (edit: I've been informed that he was actually a Scottish Presbyterian theologian), and evidently not a bad one. But his greatest work was this compilation of prayers. It is arranged into prayers for each morning and evening of 31 days, plus extra prayers for Sundays. The odd-numbered (right-side) pages have the prayers, while the even-numbered pages are empty for your own notes. The prayers are a combination of ancient prayers, various Christian liturgies, Scripture, and Baillie's own writing. It is written in elegant King James English, but it is certainly accessible to anyone who can read.I can't recommend this highly enough for anyone, in any Christian tradition, wanting to grow in prayer. My God-mother gave it to me, and very quickly I was buying copies for my own good friends. Some of them were buying copies for their friends before long as well. I recommend it very enthusiastically. At least give it a try."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"This book is a new discovery for me, having received it as a birthday present. I am very moved by the reverent, poetic tone of the prayers. Some are almost liturgical in their grandeur and solemnity. But at the same time it is very accessible--not too lofty.I wish there was a bibliography or footnotes, since some of the passages are Bible quotes, or from ancient Orthodox prayer books. I would like to know more about the author and see another book by his: A Diary of Readings."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"John Baillie's book is an exceptional work of spiritual literature. The prayers are beautiful and contain all the components necessary to help one praise, thank, confess, and supplicate for others. I use it quite often as a supplement to my prayer life and often give it as a gift, so that others can benefit from it as well."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"I've been enjoying ADOPP for over a year now. It is refreshing to repeat prayers that are humble, selfless, grace-filled. These prayers are becoming formative for me, and are also becoming close friends. They lead me to embrace Christian holiness and to humbly examine my own egocentricity, confessionally. After Shawchuck and Job's, &quot;A Guide to Prayer&quot;, ADOPP is the book I've given away most. Sure, the language is a little archaic (I'm using old versions of the book. I'm not sure if recent printings have been updated) but it is well worth the investment. Of all the books I&quot;ve given my father over the years, I'm sure this is his favorite, too."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"I am delighted to find this book in reprint, as I can now give it as a gift. An old copy had been given to me, and I have found it invaluable in transforming my prayer life.The prayers are beautifully written, poetic and almost liturgical. As I read/pray them, I am sighing, \\"Oh yes!\\", as they put into words thoughts of my heart that I haven't been able to adequately express.The prayers are very specific and challenging. They cause me to examine myself, to confessions which I might otherwise have glided over, to challenge myself in the service of God.I am confident that this book will be a blessing to anyone who uses it."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"John Baillie's Diary of Private Prayer has been a favorite classic of mine for over 30 years.

I've given many copies as gifts over the years and am thankful it's being reprinted."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"I cannot stand &quot;devotionals.&quot; Modern Christianity suffers from a plague of &quot;devotionals.&quot; Collections of trite, poorly written, and misguided &quot;devotions&quot; are so prevalent that many Christian bookstores fail to carry many better (and less commercial) books. The weeds choke and finally kill of the lilies. Yet behold! What is this? A beautiful Lilly among the weeds and grass...A Diary of Private Prayer is not like other &quot;devotionals.&quot; The prayers are honest, thoughtful, and wonderfully lacking in self-consciousness. I do not believe we should go to God with a script. I do believe however that these prayers distill many things which are not commonly considered into a useful form for meditation and for drawing one into a personal relationship with God. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"Baillie has the rare ability to put into words the hopes and failings of Christian hearts and lives. I frequently give this book as a gift to friends,and most make it a part of their daily devotion. Even though Baillie uses the language of the King James Bible, he has a command of the language that is beautiful, compelling and inspirational. The thirty days of morning and evening prayers become more meaningful with repeated readings."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"Baillie puts heart and soul into every prayer. The prayers are very long and extremely well written. They are extremely powerful and pious. I wish I could pray from the heart like he does.

I was not disappointed. The book is full of wonderful devotional prayers. Reading through them each day is bringing me to a deeper and more satisfying prayer life.

The morning and evening prayers have helped me branch out on the way I pray. The prayers in the book vary quite a bit on their focus which was really fun for me. I even bought this book for my dad.That being said it is obvious this kindle book was just a scan and that nobody bothered to proof it. There are quite a few typos and this is made worse by the text being older english. I have found myself on a couple of occasions looking words up because I am not sure if they are a misspelling or some old word that I haven't encountered before. It has always been the former.

I can see why! This is a book of prayers which can't help but enhance your prayer experience. I am not one to just read my prayers to God, I prefer spontaneous conversations which build my relationship with God. However, the prayers in this book make a great supplement to anyone's prayer life. They stretch your understanding of just what might be included in a healthy prayer life - one which isn't just self-centered in nature. They are full of reverence for God, recognizing His sovereignty over all things. Some may find the old language style a bit daunting at first, but don't let that stop you from gaining the benefits of this amazing little book."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"This is one of the most inspiring and helpful prayer guides I have ever used.

It helps to begin your day on a brighter, more focused path, and helps to prepare for a review of the day's events and preparation for a night of sleep."},{"Title":"A diary of private prayer","review":"This is a great way to intentionally set aside some time to be with God. The prayers provided are timeless. I'm not one who usually goes for the King James English, but it seems appropriate here. The prayers connect with where I am each day.

If you read this Marianne DeKoven please get in touch with me. :)NOTE: I also recommend IGNORING David Williams review of this book because he is clearly just trying to sell his book. (If Amazon was moderating the reviews they would remove his for being a flagrant advertisement for his own book, but sadly they don't moderate very much.)"},{"Title":"Utopia Limited: The Sixties and the Emergence of the Postmodern (Post-Contemporary Interventions)","review":"Of all the mixed-up inside-out upside-down approaches that academics wallowing in Post-modern jargon have produced, this attempt to link the sixties with postmodernism is about the most absurd. The heart of post-modernism is a denial of any essential truth in any text. It is a complete separation of the word from any illusion of reality, a denial that presence exists and a put-down of every naive attempt to discover some absolute unifying \\"truth.\\"The sixties, on the other hand, were an essentialist response to the neo-0rthodox cynicism that preceded that decade. It was an attempt to find some \\"truth\\" under the rubble of a culture in the implicit assumption that \\"truth\\" could be found. Furthermore, that truth was to be found outside of the lies of civilization in nature, most specifically in human nature, in the depths of the truths of ones own profound self. It rejected the old meta-narratives, but not in favor of post-modern emptiness. It did so in the search for truer truth and better meta-narratives founded on what Mailer called the radical imperatives of the self.Martin Luther King set up conscience as the alternative to the law, a truth in the self which exists independent of any collective text. And as a Baptist minister he named that truth God. Even Malcolm X, who began as a cynical street punk, became the hero he did by discovering an essential truth within himself, which he called \\"Allah.\\" Timothy Leary and Baba Ram Dass believed that LSD cleared away the constructs of the state but made possible a sense of a greater truth within. The Beatles went to India to commune with the divine. The 60s were thus completely essentialist, the very term post-modernism sets itself up in opposition to.All this book does is to take the anti-institutional language with which its 60s texts attacked the establishment, then ignores the actual content of their arguments, and finally claims these esstialist 60s texts for post-modernism on the simplistic grounds that post-modernism too attacks the establishment and undercuts the old narratives.Which it does. But it also attacks essentialist alternatives, which is what the 60s offered. All post-modernism did was to take the old neo-orthodox cynicism and dress it up in Francobabble jargon with a dash of Marxist theory on the side. It is, to paraphrase Norman O Brown, a veil spun (constructed?) to hide the void.One can in fact find some foreshadowings of postmodernism in the great 60s texts, but these this book skips over. Take Norman O Brown in Love's Body: \\"The Fall is into Language\\" or \\"The world is the veil we spin to hide the void.\\" But Brown was a Christian theologian who believed that the elimination of psychological repression unleashed the true body, the id, and that this was the \\"resurrection of the body\\" which Christ announced. Better yet: read the rantings of Charlie Manson. But Manson was a product of the end of the 60s, a link to the future not an example of the 60s romantic core. In him, perhaps, is your 60s link to post-modernism attacking all words, all texts, all narratives as utterly empty at the core.As this confused gobbledyguck of book is.For more of this approach, check out my alternative reading of the '60s:Searching for God in the Sixties"},{"Title":"Student-Centered Language Arts, K-12","review":"This book was very interesting, informative, and educational. Moffett and Wagner have done an excellent job of giving instructional strategies appropriate to every age group from K-12. Moffett is a visionary whose ideas were ahead of his time. The authors begin by giving a step by step guide to setting up a classroom geared toward student centered learning. The book has three sections, orientation, basic processes, and kinds of discourse. The orientation portion helps the reader to become familiar with student centered learning. The basic processes give different methods of engaging students in activities where they are the center and not the teacher. The book linked reading, spelling, and writing. Moffett and Wagner believe that reading, spelling, listening, and thinking are major determinants to learning to communicating effectively. The section kinds of discourse give innumerable ideas on facilitating the effective use of language arts throughout the curriculum. I would suggest this book for anyone looking to enhance instruction for their students in the classroom or children at home."},{"Title":"Student-Centered Language Arts, K-12","review":"As a teacher of language arts for 30 years I could not have survived without this book, which is periodically updated. It has been my bible for teaching language arts and given me not just techniques, but enthusiasm and energy for teaching. My students have certainly profited due to this volume. My most academically-talented students (based on standardized tests), who can be the most critical of a teacher, and who are now in senior high school and even college have chosen me FOUR times--an accolade as rare as hen's teeth--as THE \\"teacher who made a difference,\\" to be placed in WHO'S WHO AMONG AMERICA'S TEACHERS. I certainly owe much to co-authors James Moffett and Betty Jane Wagner, the latter who has written many other books for teachers.The Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"Rossell Hope Robbins massive 1959 work \\"Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology\\" has been reprinted many times but is currently out-of-print. It is indeed a fascinatingly horrible compenidum of information regarding witches, demons, devils, demonologists, inquisitors, judges, hysterias, torture, and murder. It has served for the past 40 odd years as one of the most read and referenced work on the history of witchcraft and demonology, especially by many popular witchcraft authors and historians who continue to use and cite the work today.The trouble is that much of the scholarship contatined in this work is sadly outdated and lacks information on much of the recent work done in the field of witchcraft studies in the past 20 years. Also, Robbins' work suffers from the same problem that afflicted many other similar early witchcraft histories: bad translations and historical forgeries. It has been shown that many of the early translations of a number of Latin works on witchcraft (particularly those translated by the Rev. Montague Summers) are suspect. Also, several 19th century histories of the witchcraze and the Inquisition that have been used as source material by countless authors, including Robbins, have been proven to be forgeries, particularly the works relating the early 14th century Inquisitorial witch executions in France. Robbins' work has also been criticized by scholars for its lack of objectivity in its history. But this work still remains popular today and understandably so, as it contains many lurid and engaging articles on just about every aspect of the witch hunts from the 15th to the 18th century in Europe and North America. Despite many of its flaws, it is still a useful reference and for that reason it still gets 3 stars, plus I must admit, it maintains some of the mysterious aura surrounding the history of witches and demons that much recent scholarship has tried to dispel, and that makes it fascinating reading, if for the wrong reasons."},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"This book is perhaps the most important reference work in its field. If you have interest in the occult, witchcraft or details not much mentioned in standard history books, I urge you to buy this one. Although its author relies a bit too heavily on documents of the time, the information given in this book is valuable. Also, there is a passage about witchcraft in specific countries, so you might also find out something about your home country that no one bothered to tell you. Read this book, and I can almost guarantee that you'll see the last four centuries in quite a new light."},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"A long time ago I (by accident) saw this book carried by Terry Gilliam in the 'Spanish Inquisition' sketch by Monty Python. You can spot it under his arm as he gets up from his seat in the bus at the end. Realizing that this has very little do to with the actual review of this book, it nonetheless will tell you that I recognized the cover of the book when walking around in an old bookstore in Boston, grabbed it, and within 2 minutes of reading and skimming I decided that it was worth the $18.00 it cost. It was probably one of the best bargains I ever found, and opened my eyes tremendously.As the title implies we're talking about an encyclopedia, not a detailed and chronological book, but this did not hamper the book's ability to get inside my head, and touch it in a way that redefined the medieval picture I carried around with me. After spending a few hours going through the book, and picking out specific passages, I realized that I knew nothing about how people were treated not THAT long ago, when someone else accused them of witchcraft, and how hard (impossible) it was to prove ones innocence. A story in the encyclopedia tells of how a woman, owning a black cat was hanged, accused of witchcraft, for 'making' her neighbour's tea taste bad.If you wish to have just some idea of how impossible it was to prove your innocence, once you were thought a witch, Luc Besson's 'Messenger: Joan of Arc', and the Blackadder episode 'Witchsmeller Pursouivant' will give you an idea of the hopelessness some of the accused must've felt.The most horrible aspect of the book is the descriptions of how people were tortured back in those days. The only thing we can do is learn from books such as these to insure that such stupidity and ignorance won't be allowed to occur again. The book also has information on specific European and other countries, so you can locate your own country to see just how bad things were in Europe several hundred years ago. That these things are still happening in many other parts of the world, is something we should do something more about, since many of the uneducated countries still practice torture and inhuman deaths. Not that any death, ordered by other sentient beings, is human, in my opinion.The people who refuse to open books such as these, because they, among many other things, tell of the instruction manuals inquisitors could consult when dealing with witches (the Malleus Maleficarum is one), must ask themselves if they are doing so, because they find such information irrelevant and frightening. Of course it's frightening, but hardly irrelevant. It's when you turn your back on these things, that they have a chance of happening. So educate yourself about how not to behave, when someone sitting close to you is stroking a bad cat and your tea suddenly tastes bad.I'm not saying that we have to be paranoid at all, but a good portion of common sense, spiced with decency and awareness, will no doubt yield a mix that will prevent such terrible events from happening again.And if you can't find this book at amazon.com, try older bookstores. Where I found mine in Boston, another copy was also present!"},{"Title":"The encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology","review":"I first stumbled onto this book when I needed reference material for a paper on witchcraft. I've gone back to re-reference this book too many times to count! It has information on almost every aspect of witchcraft and demonology; terrific for the beginner interested in this subject.

Yuk, you may think, having sampled at least some of the trading-book deluge pumped out by the American publishing industry in the last 12 months. But unlike so many of these that pander to the desire to become rich through trading, R.E. McMaster's The Art of the Trade is time and money well spent. The book's main thesis is that while market opportunities are unlimited, a trader's time, energy, financial and above all, psychological capital are very limited. In 10 chapters, McMaster tells about the similarities and differences between trading and gambling - the biggest difference being different kinds of risk - managing risk with money management; treating trading as a business; the methodology, consistency, mentality and emotions of trades; self mastery; and in the last chapter, McMaster puts it all together. His expectations are clear and easy to follow. Overall, The Art of the Trade is well worth reading carefully. It will go a long way in helping traders preserve their psychological capital."},{"Title":"The Art of the Trade; Mastering the Analytic and Intuitive Elements of Successful Trading","review":"A lot of basic concepts, cut your losses, be disciplined etc. Author compares traders to gamblers in chap. 1.

Not in the wheel era. Trading via a stockbroker is obsolete and is a waste of time in the year 2000.Excellent book for the average trader, overall. Chap. 7 and 8 worth the price of the book.

The author's writing style allows for an easy read."},{"Title":"Joshua: The Journey Home : Joshua, Joshua and the Children, Joshua in the Holy Land","review":"First, the pros: The stories are well-written. On the surface, they are enjoyable. Parables have been used thoughout the ages, including in the Bible, to get points across. For some, this is a very good value on a \\"Christian book.\\" If I could have stopped here, I would have given the book four stars out of five.Now the cons - why I find the stories a bit disturbing: The author, a priest named Joseph Girzone, seems to be a gentle sort; one of patience & earthly virtue. What he fails to do is stick to Scriptural teachings. The disturbing part is the man presumes to speak for Jesus, a definite no-no, according to the Bible. The other is that he completely misrepresents Scriptural teachings with regards to the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. This is why I really wanted to give it one star. It may not be his fault, though. While many people remember this verse:\\"But of that day and that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son, but only the Father.\\" Mark 13:32or this one:\\"It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own authority.\\" Acts 1:7they also conveniently forget these:\\"Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory. And then He will send His angels, and gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest part of the earth to the farthest part of heaven.\\" Mark 13:26\\"Then shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.\\" Luke 21:27----------It isn't like anyone has to worry that Jesus will be masquerading as a corner hot-dog vendor. Reading Dr. Luke's verse (above) would lead me to believe the Hebrew Nationals would be scattered into oblivion.Peace & love are wonderful things and need to be learned & taught - but they are not 100% of God's teachings & are taught by God Himself in His Word. This book & others like it are not God's Words and in far too many ways, contradict & even mock God's teachings. If you can separate the book from Scripture, then there might be merit in this work, but that is an exceptionally difficult order. You would be better off reading Scripture, rather than tempting yourself to believe this is worthy.I was torn in giving stars.

Even at the local jurisdiction where I'm employed, the chapters on radon, fluoride in natural waters, water hardness, soil-borne pathogens, epidemiology, groundwater modelling, and toxicology are handy refreshers.There's a great deal here and a good portion is geared toward the needs of third world practitioners (iodine deficiencies, geophagy, elements in nutrition, arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh, volcanic emissions, etc)The map of radon risks in the Czech Republic was of particular interest (for my relatives as well). See also what aerosolic mineral dusts are doing to the Chinese population in chapter 18.Another plug for geography:While rightfully geographic, not geologic techniques, the editors include remote sensing techniques and GIS mapping for vector borne diseaes, but these spatial/graphic techniques will continue to grow in importance for other issues in medical geology."},{"Title":"Essentials of Medical Geology: Impacts of the Natural Environment on Public Health","review":"There is nothing else that compares to this concise introduction to the subject.

This 800+ page full-color tome highlights some of the significant interfaces of medicine and earth science. Most of the topics are fascinating, such as Skinner's review of the 'Mineralogy of Bone'. If you forgot what geophagy is, look no further than Peter Abrahams chapter. So finally there is an accessible primer for medical schools, I might predict that several institutions will begin using Selinus for courses in medical geology. The book's organization has laid a nice foundation for this emerging transdisciplinary study. The seven editors and some 50 contributors should be congratulated for sharing a common vision to its fruition. At 12 cents a page, I love it!!!!FYI - Lastly, you should be aware that there is another book published by L-severe that has the title 'Medical Geology' (by Komatina).

For Goodis it is all about obsession and failed redemption. And Cassidy's Girl stands alongside THE STREET of NO RETURN and THE BLONDE on the STREET CORNER as one of his masterpieces. David Cassidy is caught between two women. One woman, an alcoholic lost soul emanating good represents a second shot at former greatness. The other woman, voluptuous and iron willed drives his dark lusts, offers him bodily bliss and inevitable doom. Of course, the usual array of bums, losers, rummy philosophers and tender-hearted whores populate this work, giving the book that dreary, broken bottle, rainy sky, desolate and realistic feel of forlorn hope. Goodis is to NOIR what Poe was to horror, that is to say that Goodis transcends genre, concerning himself less with plot and stereotypes of stupid cops, sadistic killers and tough guy PIs but more about revealing the alchemy of the dark desires that drive the human spirit away from happiness and towards self-destruction."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"Jim Cassidy is a bus driver by day and a drunk by night. He becomes convinced that if he leaves his voluptuous tramp of a wife, Mildred, and takes up with the waif-like, angelic Doris, he will at long last be able to escape his hellish existence. But he soon discovers that redemption is not that simple.Cassidy's Girl is about the dark, depressing lives of a group of alcoholics inhabiting a rundown neighborhood bordering the Philadelphia waterfront. It is a no holds barred study of people whose lives are simultaneously fueled and poisoned by alcohol. Goodis describes how this community, of sorts, functions. Acts of friendship alternate with acts of violence. Love and affection coexist side by side with hate and betrayal.Goodis' portrayal of the frustratingly hopeless environment in which the characters find themselves is vivid and expertly drawn. The plot, however, is not as compelling as it might have been. Instead of flowing smoothly, the narrative has a herky-jerky quality with events occurring seemingly at random. That is to say the motivation behind the actions of key characters is many times unclear.Cassidy's plan to rescue Doris and himself is, as you would expect, eventually ruined. But the cause of this ruination is not just fate or inevitability. Cassidy himself makes conscious choices which directly lead to his own defeat.Cassidy's Girl is classic noir. Unapologetically downbeat, it fearlessly explores the ugly, hopeless side of life. Proceed at your own risk."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"This one is easily worth the price of admission. Another pulp classic by David Goodis, one of the few writers who can transcend the mundane and make tales of ordinary fallen heroes seem so intense, so poignant, that you are immediately taken in by their story and made a part of their lives. Acclaimed noir photographer and director Ed Holub (holubfilm@gmail.com) is planning to make a film of this novel, and it's easy to see why--startling opening, astonishing characterizations, and the familiar Goodis touch of angst, eerily appealing violence, and poetic narrative to bring you in and never let go. Buy this book."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"David Goodis' novel, \\"Cassidy's Girl\\" offers a portrayal of lost people in forgotten streets of Philadelphia in the years following WW II. The characters in the story are tormented and fallen. They struggle with alcohol and with their own demons. Goodis portrays them rawly yet with sympathy. The book is as much about atmosphere as about character. The story is set in the bars, tenements, narrow streets of the old Delaware River harbor and waterfront. I am familiar with parts of the Philadelphia that Goodis describes from the time I lived in the city years ago. But many of the places and scenes described in the book had already been lost.The primary character of the book Jim Cassidy, 36, drives a bus between Philadelphia and Easton for a cut-rate company with headquarters on Arch Street. Here is how Goodis introduces Cassidy and the theme of the book at the outset of the novel.\\"The bus made a turn of Market Street, went up through the slashing rain to Arch, went into the depot. Cassidy climbed out, opened the door,stood there to help them down from the bus. He had the habit of studying their faces as they emerged, wondering what their thoughts were, and what their lives were made of. The old women and the girls, the frowning stout men with loose flesh hanging from their jaws, and the young men who gazed dully ahead as though seeing nothing. Cassidy looked at their faces and had an idea he could see the root of their trouble. It was the fact that they were ordinary people and they didn't know what real trouble was. He could tell them. He could damn well tell them.\\"Cassidy spends his evening fighting with his voluptuous but shrewish wife Mildred and drinking at a cheap establishment called Lundy's Place. Earlier in his life, Cassidy had flown planes in WW II and then commercially. When he was blamed falsely for a plane accident, Cassidy's life deteriorated. He squandered his money and ultimately found himself in the Philadelphia tenderloin. When he secures the job as a bus driver, Cassidy gains a small sense of purpose and control that he does not feel otherwise.After a particularly harsh fight with his Mildred, Cassidy learns that she is interested in another patron of Lundy's Place, Haney Kendick. In his turn, Cassidy becomes involved with a young woman, Doris, 27, who is slender and withdrawn and an irredemable alcoholic. As the story develops, Goodis explores which of these women, Mildred or Doris, consitutes \\"Cassidy's Girl\\".The book includes many scenes of violence, heavy drinking, sex, and tragedy. It is also highly introspective as each of the down and out characters has his or her own story. Cassidy is forced to flee when he is accused of causing an accident in driving the bus eerily similar to the accident years earlier with the plane. For all the rage and hopelessness of the characters and the setting, the book comes to a resolution that is slightly less hopeless than is the case in some of Goodis' later novels.Beginning in 1951, Goodis (1917 -- 1967) published a number of paperback noir novels most of which are set in his native Philadelphia. The novels offer a noir portrayal of the city and of the loneliness of urban life. \\"Cassidy's Girl\\" sold over a million copies when it was published in 1951 but was soon forgotten. With the Library of America's recent publications of \\"Down There\\" (Shoot the Piano Player)Crime Novels: American Noir of the 1950s: The Killer Inside Me / The Talented Mr. Ripley / Pick-up / Down There / The Real Cool Killers (Library of America) (Vol 2)followed by its publication of a volume of five Goodis novels,David Goodis: Five Noir Novels of the 1940s and 50s (Library of America), Goodis dark world has achieved a place in American literature. Readers who come to Goodis through the Library of America volumes will enjoy exploring his other novels, including \\"Cassidy's Girl\\".Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"Goodis novels for $0.99 each on Kindle are a bargain and a much better value than the recent Library of America volume. I read a study years ago that correlated various authors' alcoholism with the drinking habit of their characters. Goodis must have had well-used elbows by the time he wrote this one. It's a good, quick read set in a world where no one is sober for long. The characters are vivid and you know there isn't going to be much in the way of happy endings for them."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"Good prose. Amusing story. This fellow Goodis clearly knew what the battle with demon rum is all about. Likely he or a loved one endured the struggle and faced the bleakness."},{"Title":"Cassidy's Girl","review":"This book is a tough call for me. On the one hand, the plot depends on a 1 in 1 million event that occurs twice (with slight variation). That's a bit much for me to swallow, especially in a genre where a big part of the illusion is the gritty \\"realism\\" of the story. On the other hand, I happen to like this kind of writing:\\"He could see the bottle rising to her lips, and then her lips meeting the lips of the bottle, as though the bottle were something alive, making love to her. . . he saw the bottle as a loathsome, grotesque creature that had lured Doris and captured her and pleasured itself with her, draining the sweet life from her body as it poured its rottenness into her.\\"If this kind of writing is not quite your style, then this is a book to skip. If this leaves you wanting more, then the improbability of the plot should not stop you from diving in."},{"Title":"Two-Hour Mini Quilt Projects: Over 111 Appliqued & Pieced Designs (Two-Hour Crafts)","review":"I've never made hanging quilts before but this book is great for beginners.

The students in that class all dislike this book, and even the teacher admits to having problems with it. It is organized into chapters, each one being a different conversational topic, such as talking on the phone or the family. There are 52 chapters, but they are each only 2 pages long. The first page has a vocabulary list, and the second has a list of questions with a few suggestions for conversations. The first set of questions refers to one or two small black-and-white photos on the vocabulary page. Since the pictures are small and unclear, it's often impossible to answer certain questions about them. The photography is bad, and so is the reproduction of the pictures. Not all the pictures are even from Latin America (or any other Spanish speaking country)! In chapter 19 it is possible to see a sign in the background written in French. And in the following chapter, there is a photo taken in a supermarket where I could make out some Italian words on the products. Another problem is that the vocabulary lists often repeat words that were already introduced in previous chapters. That would be fine if they were placed in a separate section &quot;for review&quot;, but I don't think the authors even noticed or cared about the repetition. The book does not contain any interesting supplemental texts, nor is it accompanied by a video, or even audiotapes.

Protagonist Linnell Clare is a mother of one and loyal wife of Dr. Mark &quot;Bear&quot; Clare, a dentist who has secret, profitable illicit drug business on the side. She is also an international tax attorney, a super-mom before the term was invented. Secretive Bear resents the fact that &quot;Ma&quot; put together an education after motherhood, and he distrusts her. Problems come to a head on her latest trip to Cayman when &quot;Ma&quot; pursues her own money-making sideline, albeit legal. Misunderstanding gives rise to more understanding, breeding chaos which compounds at a frantic pace until poetic justice is served at the novel's stunning conclusion.The novel has many brilliant moments where it is hard to put down. It also paints an interesting picture of the off-shore tax avoidance industry. But most importantly, Into the Deep is a haunting tale of a battle of the sexes within an emotionally-deadened marriage set against that cacophonious decade when a woman could be a tax attorney but still needed her husband's signature to set up a bank account. It is the story of a floundering marriage, capsized by a catastrophic shift of emotional, intellectual and professional ballast."},{"Title":"Into the Deep (The Haven)","review":"I agree with the reader from So.California, this book is a wonderful find.

Example: on page 3, instead of reading \\"SOME SIMPLE MATES\\", my book states \\"SOME SIMPLE I IATES\\" and where a figure should be shown, I see \\"I'mm. f. m. mm Wim 'immi.\\" (no kidding!, that exact text).... This poor reproduction of Capablanca's book is complete garbage! I have a kindle, but am not going for the kindle version because I am afraid that I will receive the exact same version that has all the \\"ILLUSTIL TIVE GAMES\\" stripped out (yeah, it contains that error too). Additionally, when referring to \\"White\\" moves, many occurences of \\"WTiite\\" are used instead."},{"Title":"Chess fundamentals,","review":"Chess Fundamentals is a classic and valuable chess instruction book.I downloaded the Kindle edition on the day I received by Kindle as a gift. The Kindle edition of this book is absolutlely free on Amazon. The text, and even the descriptive notation, are well presented. However, none of the diagrams has survived translation. Without the diagrams, the first 60% or so of the book is absolutely useless.At the back of the book are about fifteen complete games (in descriptive notation), comprehensively annotated by Capablanca. Since the book is free, downloading it is well worth it just for those games. However, readers who attempt to digest the early part of the book are headed for frustration. I'm giving the Kindle edition two stars for the well-annotated games, and providing this review to advise Kindle users of the limitations of this version. Please disregard this review if you are considering a print edition, and I highly recommend the print editions of the book."},{"Title":"Chess fundamentals,","review":"This was the first chess book I had read (well over 35 years ago). When I browse through it I still see wonderful insights, things I could not understand then. Capablanca is one of the greatest players of the game, his writing is a good match to his play. You should be warned that this is not a very easy book, but it definitely repays study. I was delighted to see it as a kindle book.Unfortunately the kindle edition has no diagrams, which makes it totally useless. Besides the use of the outdated English notation in the text is difficult to follow."},{"Title":"Chess fundamentals,","review":"Like Reformed theologian Karl Barth, I love listening to Mozart. There is something about his work that is other-worldly. He is so talented, gifted, far above the realm of mere mortals that listening to his work stirs something in the soul. Capablanca was a rare genius on the chess board. Playing over his games one senses, even if only slightly, the crystal clear clarity he must have possessed in understanding any given position. To work through his games is an education, not given by too many other chess-masters. To read his little book here is also an education. It seems elementary, simple, almost \\"See Dick and Jane Run--ish.\\" But to go over it, is still to be taught by a master, even if one thinks that they know how to read, or to play chess, already."},{"Title":"Chess fundamentals,","review":"Truly a masterpiece of the chess literature! First written almost a hundred years ago, it remains arguably the premier chess primer. I first studied this book in my early teens, and it immediately made a great improvement in my chess game. (The fact that it did not turn me into a chess master is not the book's fault, but more likely due to laziness.)I recall seeing somewhere a reference to the \\"mathematician\\" Capablanca. That resonated with me. Later I found that he had actually studied chemical engineering at Columbia -- and that only sporadically -- dropping out before completing his education to concentrate on chess. But no matter, the fact remains that his thinking had all the hallmarks of a mathematician. For example, in several of the included endgame studies, Capablanca divides the task into \\"phases.\\" These phases are analogous to what a mathematician would call \\"lemmas,\\" and this \\"divide to conquer\\" provides the novice with an insight into what constitutes \\"strategy.\\" We might say that \\"strategy\\" constitutes the art of navigation when the destination is over the horizon. We then divide the journey into a number of phases, each (hopefully) getting us closer to the final objective.It is interesting to speculate how the book would be different if written today. Certainly there would be concessions to \\"hypermodernism\\" (which partly contributed to Capablanca's undoing). But perhaps the biggest change would be due to the insight computers have given in certain difficult endgames, and mistakes computers found in classical games that were overlooked by masters. While on this topic, I have wondered about a statement he makes in the book: two bishops and a knight are slightly stronger than two rooks. Really! I think I would take the two rooks in an endgame, but I am sure Capablanca saw something I am not seeing. This is the kind of problem that a battery of computers can profitably be put to work on."},{"Title":"Chess fundamentals,","review":"Well, Petrosian said, this book, teachs me to delelopment my positional skills, when i was a kidThere are nice games, the chapter i remenber well ending games.This book is for beginer, but are very nice explained, and has some nice tip about, how to see a plan, that even today remenber.this book is a clasical, the best but very basic, if you buuy it for a beginer player, you shoul have it."},{"Title":"House Calls: Recollections of a Family Physician","review":"&quot;House Calls&quot; is a thinly veiled autobiography, of a boy, orphaned at fifteen, who grows up to become a pioneer in the field of family practice medicine. Born and raised in California, Thomas L. Stern, after a stint in the navy, finds himself in the navy's V-12 program assigned to medical school in Salem, Oregon. After med school with his bride, Gladys, he begins his practice in a small rural town where his house calls begin in earnest. The author's recounting of his cases and adventures will make you laugh and sometimes cry. It will make you long for that time before HMO's when doctors knew their patients, were part of the family and made house calls.In 1960, with Gladys, three kids, a several pets in tow and armed with years of experience in rural Oregon, Dr. Stern heads back to California where he sets up his medical practice in Manhattan Beach, becomes the technical advisor on the television show, Marcus Welby, M.D., and creates a residency program in family practice at Santa Monica Hospital.A page turning read, &quot;House Calls&quot; is an endearing, humorous and sometimes tragic look at life through the eyes of a family physician. This is a book people will be talking about long after they've read it."},{"Title":"House Calls: Recollections of a Family Physician","review":"Dr. Thomas Stern's book &quot;House Calls&quot; is a stimulating story of rural medical practice in the 1950's and urban practice in the 1960's. It begins with excerpts from his personal story which are touching and inspiring. He went from being an orphan teenager on his own to a well respected physician. He began his practice in rural Oregon where he had many great adventures. The descriptions of his travails are funny and to the point. He cared for a wide variety of patients and acquired a great insight into the human condition. He describes the priorities and struggles of a young doctor with a growing family and a large practice. His personal, as well as, career aspirations are clearly described. There are many funny moments in the book and some of heartbreak. His joys and sorrows and the misfortunes and successes experienced by his patients are discussed in a very sensitive and caring way.The years in California provide insight into the visionary efforts of Dr. Stern, a pioneer in the specialty of Family Practice. He developed one of the early residency programs for family doctors in the Los Angeles area and worked for several years as the technical consultant to the hit TV series, Marcus Welby, M.D.Most readers will be lay people who will gain insight into the workings of a caring physician's heart and mind from the book. As a former rural and later urban family doctor myself, I can attest to the validity of the human drama which Dr. Stern so ably describes. Dr. Stern has textured this book with the art, as well as, the science of medicine as it was practiced in the 1950's and 1960's and provided us all with a good read.V.

As students move through the college search process the book then allows you to compare what you saw when you visited with a published cross section of opinions. I wish these were updated more often or if the information wouldn't change that much, I think these should cost less. They become a very expensive way to review all of a student's choices. The individual college format as opposed to the larger anthology helps to not overwhelm you with the physiological and physical weight of too many colleges offered in one book. Convenient size but a bit expensive for the information recieved."},{"Title":"At the Bottom of the River","review":"Jamaica Kincaid's AT THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER is a study of voice and language that first brought the author recognition beyond the pages of literary journals. These ten stories, all but the last extremely short, are set in an intense Caribbean landscape where a girl comes of age in the shadow of her mother; they are hallucinatory, tense, and indirect, leaving much for the reader to interpret. For example, the first story, &quot;Girl&quot;, is a monologue spoken by the mother giving advice (&quot;this is how you set a table for dinner&quot;) interspersed with comments degrading the daughter. The two italicized, one-sentence responses from the daughter speak volumes about this complicated relationship. &quot;What I Have Been Doing Lately&quot; is a dream-like narrative that lists what the narrator is (probably not) doing and, in the process, illustrates the emotional state of someone so sad that she just wants to lie in bed. &quot;At the Bottom of the River&quot;, the final, longest, and most traditional of the stories, implies the past and future of the narrator through visions seen &quot;at the bottom of the river.&quot;Kincaid's style combines the effect of the simple but perfect word with the lilt of Caribbean rhythms. On the surface, these stories are not difficult to read, but they can be challenging to understand for the reader accustomed to more traditional methods of storytelling. The collection is about as short as a book can get, and so the stories can be read in one sitting, back to back, although their absorption can take much longer."},{"Title":"At the Bottom of the River","review":"Just as a diamond's facets make it shine, At the Bottom of the River is composed of disparate glimpses of brilliance. Short short stories in a unifying vein of carribean color, these pieces are mystical, sensual and poetic. The cadence of Kincaid's language takes hold of you-- you don't read this book so much as you surf it. . . you breathe it. . . you feel it resonate within you long after it's over."},{"Title":"At the Bottom of the River","review":"A book that drifts from page to page, from consciousness to consciousness.Reading the book is liking trying to look at things at the bottom of the river, which continuously get distorted by the movement of the water, the interplay of light reflected on the surface and shadows at the bed, and things that sometimes drift into view and out - with and for no apparent reason.Quite an interesting experience."},{"Title":"At the Bottom of the River","review":"'At the Bottom of the River' is a lyrical collection of some of Jamaica Kincaid's most provocative writing. Although occasionally confounding in her use of abstract images and construction of abstruse and ethereal narratives, Kincaid's stories nevertheless contain breathtaking lyricism and innovative lines of poetic prose; her words seem to reverberate from the very recesses of metamorphic meaning.This collection begins innocently enough with one of Kincaid's most impacting writings, Girl. Girl is one of the most severe but accurate depictions of the volatile intensity between mother and daughter. Fueled by a combination of love, fear, and partial loathing, a mother doles out a mantra of life lessons with equal parts concern and venom: \\"When buying cotton to make yourself a nice blouse, be sure that it doesn't have gum on it, because that way it won't hold up well after a wash. ... Always eat your food in such a way that it won't turn someone else's stomach; on Sundays try to walk like a lady and not like the (...) you are so bent on becoming.\\" The essays that follow are sinewy with sexual, violent, and spiritual themes.Kincaid's strength lies in her rage. One senses it above all in her amazing control over words, which, while extremely satisfying on the level of literary technique, also comes across as a refusal to be vulnerable and a reply to anyone who would try to keep her down.Like a journal, 'At the Bottom of the River' matures in content as it proceeds. Kincaid's prose-poetry initially appears whimsical (she describes some pebbles as \\"not pebbly enough\\") and that's the mystique of her writing, how it almost capriciously masks cerebral contemplations on living, dying, and the struggle in-between."},{"Title":"At the Bottom of the River","review":"At the Bottom of the River is a lovely rendition of a writer's mind, leisure, vision, appeal, hope, awareness and understanding. This project surpasses what the common reader readies for in the telling of a good story. Each sentence in this work is a story. I will write it again: Each sentence is a story with perfect images, &quot;The branches were dead; a fly hung dead on the branches, its fragile body fluttering in the wind as if it were remnants of a beautiful gown.&quot; Ms. Kincaid's style throughout At the Bottom might put one in the mind of Gertrude Stein. The repetition. Certainly, however, Ms. Kincaid's project is her own, very distinctive genius. It takes us to a place that lacks anything hackneyed and it is shaped with qualities that peck at our curiousity. The book works in first person and third person never conveniently laying the story out as a consecutive. But there are characters; there is a central character to follow. The movement is chopped with these extraordinary, brilliant images beyond description and most every sentence leaves on the tongue the question of &quot;who did that?&quot; or &quot;why?&quot;: &quot;Someone is making a basket, someone is making a girl a dress or a boy a shirt, someone is making her husband a soup with cassava so that he can take it to the cane field tomorrow, someone is making his wife a beautiful mahogany chest, someone is sprinkling a colorless powder outside a closed door so that someone else's child will be stillborn.&quot; And so you get these incredible juxtapositions along side wholesome chops of fascinating imagery. We move through childhood, through relationships, through friendships, through parents and through self. And there is even dialogue for the reader who whines that there is no plot.Ms. Kincaid writes this piece in a style that is deeply dense and in a way we are able to see, on the pages, a character's mind, discovery, understanding and wonder (no part of nature is left unturned). We are even privy to questions and philosophy and resignations about life and death. In this piece Ms. Kincaid gives new meaning to &quot;the universal eye&quot;.At the Bottom of the River is brilliant, genius! A must read!"},{"Title":"At the Bottom of the River","review":"Kincaid's stories have a distinct voice and accent, which perpetuate the subversion of standard rules prescribed by centres of authority. She appropriates that authority, by indulging in a style of writing which is unique (the two page sentences) and the inversion of punctuation and syntax canons. Her plotless stories describe a state of being which is fractured, which has no beginning or an end, which is struggling to come to terms with its marginalized existence in terms of race, color, gender and economic status. Being an immigrant in USA, the nameless character's struggle for self-definition, identity, and a truncated and oppressed past transfigure powerfully in this collection. The sense of dislocation encountered in her journey to America, the traveling from the Carribean to a new country, a new culture and discourse in which she must chart her own path towards self-discovery, enlightenment out her 'blackness', the assertion of her 'girl'hood, can only be relocated in vague forms 'at the bottom of the river'.Effectively disruptive, beautiful, introspective and soulful. Read this book if you are colored or an immigrant. Read this book even if your aren't colored or an immigrant. You'll love it."},{"Title":"At the Bottom of the River","review":"I got this book because it is one of the required books I need for my college class. When I began reading the book, I didn't like nor dislike the book because it is a strange book comparing to many books I have read so far in college and through out my life. This book consists of many ordinary stories such as our everyday life. For instance, \\"I am trying to read. The book is lying in my lap. I look around me, trying to find something on which to focus my eyes.\\" Some of the stories are extraordinary or strange if you would want to consider them. For instance, \\"Now I am a girl, but one day I will marry a woman-a red-skin woman with black bramblebush hair and brown eyes, who wears skirts that are so big I can easily bury my head in them.\\" or \\"I stood up on the edge of the basin and felt myself move. But what self? For I had no feet, or hands, or head, or heart-having once been there, were now stripped away, as if I had been dipped again and again, over and over, in a large vat filled with some precious elements and were now reduced to something I yet had no name for. I had no name for the thing I had become, so new was it to me, except that I did not exist in pain or pleasure, east or west or north or south, or up or down, or past or present or future, or real or not real.\\" This book is a beautiful poem but from reading the book, it didn't teach me much but it does somewhat inspire me to write my own book. (If this what you call a book, I can write one also.)"},{"Title":"At the Bottom of the River","review":"In its strangeness is its beauty.I won't pretend to have understood this book. At times I'd put it down and think, huh? But the overall impression was that of the privilege of listening in on the unstructured flow of a person's thoughts-- of following the mystical journey that takes a Caribbean girl to womanhood-- of the complicated relationship between a mother and her daughter-- and more.Still, after having read it, I still wonder, what was that about? But I feel better having read it. I feel smarter. I feel wise. I know that I have learned something. It might take me a while to figure out what it was.Enjoy."},{"Title":"At the Bottom of the River","review":"At the Bottom of the river isn't, in my perspective, a very good book. I gave it one star. I gave it one star because there isn't really a plot, main character (at least with a name), and it is boring. The book is sort of written in a mix between the first person and third person perspectives. The book is hard to understand, especially with 2 two page long sentences! The book kind of seems like it is someone thinking, with no real reason. It skips from one place to another in one chapter. It is hard to get into the story, and since there is no plot, there is little suspense. All in all, it isn't a very good book, and I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Blue Moon","review":"\\"Blue Moon\\" is one of those books that works really well for a particular type of reader but that other readers find impenetrable. Unfortunately I was one of the latter group, never able to get into the story, not sure a lot of the time what is going on, unable to empathise with the characters in the story or their lives.It's set in Sydney, Australia, where Jacqueline Dark and her brother Kel live lives overshadowed by their strange mother Lydia whose treatment of them as children is hardly ideal. Jacqueline travels to Penang, Malaysia, to try to uncover whether there really was a family connection to Penang as she always believed. At the same time her brother stays at home and tries to live his life through Jacq's letters. Parts of the story are narrated by other characters including Jacq's psychiatrist in Australia and other people in Penang.As the book progresses we learn more of the history of Jacq and Kel and of their mother's madness and dissatisfaction with her life. However I found it such a turgid read that I was unable to complete the book and consequently never found out whether the question of Lydia's family was resolved or not. This book might appeal to readers who enjoy stories written with flair but no clarity but the majority of readers would probably find this too hard going.Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book Helen Hancox 2007"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},F=["disabled"],W={key:0},q={key:1};function M(n,e,s,c,r,o){const m=y("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",S,[(t(!0),i(f,null,g(o.visiblePoems,(h,w)=>(t(),p(m,{key:w,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),o.hasMorePoems?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>o.loadMore&&o.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),i("span",q,"Loading...")):(t(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,F)):b("",!0)])}const B=u(x,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-cd79fb7f"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/8.md","filePath":"glossary/8.md"}'),j={name:"glossary/8.md"},O=Object.assign(j,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{R as __pageData,O as default};
