Perhaps. Wells, like every other intelligent human being of Victorian England, could not escape Darwin's theory of evolution with all of its implications. But the ideas go deeper. What is the meaning of human existence? Is the world just a place of aimless suffering and a mere survival through a series of trials and errors?The book has now become more timely than ever, with the completion of the Human Genome Project which, along with possibility of improving our lives with better drugs, opens the possiblity of engineering mutant beings based on human genes.

I found the story amazing and very intriuging. Though the stroy was an excellent read, I forgot about Wells for a while. Then, one day I was shopping for books, and stumbled on, The Time Machine, which I immediatly bought, due to his first story I had read. I also found The Time Machine exetremely interesting, a true literary classic. Unfortunatly, for Wells, the third time isn't a charm. When I bought The Island of Dr. Moreau, I was hoping it would be filled with the same analogies and fantastic creatures that were in his other works. Instead, I found boring animal-men and a dumb account of a mans sudden terror about nothing. The most disappointing thing about this bok is it has no bulid. It's main character is suddely in a world running for his life, but we don't know why or how.

Fired with Evolutionary fervor a youthful HGW presents smug civilization with a shocking portrayal of genius gone amuck--a direct warning of the dangers of pseudo-scientific zeal. Edward Prendick is the sympathetic but passive protagonist who barely survives a series of horrors: shipwreck and ordeal by lifeboat, only to be spit up on a hostile island, uninvited and suspiciously, barely tolerated.Idealistic Prendick gradually discovers many bizarre secrets on this tropical island, for the man called Dr. Moreau (note that HGW has chosen a Frenchman to represent deranged mentality) acts both as God and father figures for his beast people. Even his failed physician, Montgomery, struggles to resist the natural urge to mingle and evolve downwards, which means reverting to lower life forms, which combine the worst of two species. Only late in this gripping novel does Prendick emerge as a proactive hero--passionate for humanity and ultiamtely self-preservation. HGW raises serious social issues in this book: the deliberate infliction of pain, morality re man's relationship with lower orders, vivsection, animal rights, alcohol abuse, and of course his psychological mania: obsession with pure knowledge at all cost.Does Science (the white man's burden?) have the right or duty to play God and attempt to improve or rearrange Creation? Will all three men eventually revert to a lower type of anthropomorphic existence, casting aside the shackles of humanity, sinking into an inevitable moral morass on a par with Moreau's surgical freaks? Some uneven pacing aside, this book is one suspenseful and chilling package of moral challenges for the last (and this) century, served up for the true sci fi cultist's dining pleasure!"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"This book has a very slow start that is hard to get into.

Otherwise, just get the movie with Brando &amp; Val Kilmer."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"More of a horror than science fiction, THE ISLAND OF DR MOREAU is a disturbing and unforgettable book. Wells had a knack for making his stories come to life through the voice of the narrator, whom, as Pendrick in this book, seems like he's telling the story of something that really did happen. You can almost feel the emotion behind the words as Pendrick tells his tale. The almost-human creations of Moreau are nothing less than freaky. Both scarily mysterious and horribly familiar, these creatures evoke conflicting emotion in the reader. Should they just be put out of their misery? or encouraged to live? You can't help feeling both horror and pity for these very disturbing characters.While it is a short book, it feels complete, without any unnecessary inclusions, while still telling the story in its entirety. Wells knew the lessons he wanted to teach and the buttons he wanted to press, and accomplished his goals. The implications of man playing God, the reason of our religion, and the definitions of humanity are powerful messages that you can't help but absorb when reading this book. One thing, I wouldn't call this book an argument against science, but against tearing down the boundaries around the definition of humanity.Take a couple of days and read this one for fun. A great example of Wells' work and an enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I had been meaning to read this for years, having liked the old movie adaption \\"Island of Lost Souls.\\" For a book that is over 100 years old, it reads surprisingly easily for those (like myself) unaccustomed to classic literature. Every now and then there is a word or phrase that seems odd and/or unfamiliar but it doesn't distract from what is ultimately a 'can't put it down' page-turning adventure. This short first-person narrative can easily be read in a sitting or two, and this is coming from someone who doesn't read quickly.In addition to being exciting, this story is haunting and disturbing. As many have pointed out, even more than a century later it remains relevant in ways that H.G. Wells might not've imagined. Not only does it explore the theme of animal cruelty, it also focuses on humankind's capacity to attempt to control nature in potentially dangerous ways. The narrator, Prendick, is very relatable throughout because the way he tells his story, we are exposed to the horrors of the island the way he experienced them. But the really tragic figures are the animal/human hybrids who are profoundly confused by their human attributes. Wells manages to make Dr. Moreau himself less an evil villian than a brilliant scientist who has lost sight of any conventional ethical boundaries. The passage where Moreau explains his motives is chilling for just how sane this demented character comes across.Highly recommended - especially for those, like myself, wanting to sample some classic science-fiction oriented writing but aren't sure where to start. You can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I bought this for my 10 year old son who saw the movie (Val Kilmer/Marlon Brando).

Some of his stories make one wonder if he indeed had a peek into the future! Doctor Moreau! A strange man, alienated from British society because of his illegal experiments. (More like weird experiments!) This rather small book, tells the tale of our mad (?) Doctor, inhabiting a secret island where he can continue with his experiments.

As the story unfolds, the man finds out about the Doctors experimentation with animals and is horrified tremendously! He thinks the Doctor is a nutter to put it bluntly and is extremely scared of the unknown. The Doctors work is undoubtedly flawed though because his 'creatures' are a tad unhappy and therefore need to be controlled by the good doctor.

In addition, the characters are distinguishable and appealing. I really liked Wells' writing style--it's refreshing and unique. I'll definitely give another of his novels a read."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Although it is less often read than such Wells novels as THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, the basic story of THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU is very well known through several extremely loose film adaptations. Pendrick, a British scientist, is shipwrecked--and by chance finds himself on an isolated island where Dr. Moreau and his assistant Montgomery are engaged in a series of experiments. They are attempting to transform animals into manlike beings.Wells, a social reformer, was a very didactic writer, and his novels reflect his thoughts and theories about humanity. Much of Wells writing concerns (either directly or covertly) social class, but while this exists in MOREAU it is less the basic theme than an undercurrent. At core, the novel concerns the then-newly advanced theory of natural selection--and then works to relate how that theory impacts man's concept of God. Wells often touched upon this, and in several novels he broaches the thought that if mankind evolved &quot;up&quot; it might just as easily evolve &quot;down,&quot; but nowhere in his work is this line of thought more clearly and specifically seen than here.At times Wells' determination to teach his reader can overwhelm; at times it can become so subtle that it is nothing short of absolutely obscure. But in THE ISLAND OF DR. MOREAU, Wells achieves a perfect balance of the two extremes, even going so far as to balance the characters in such a way that not even the narrator emerges as entirely sympathetic. It is a remarkable achievement, and in this sense I consider MOREAU possibly the best of Wells work: the novel is as interesting for the story it tells as it is for still very relevant themes it considers.It is also something of an oddity among Wells work, for while Wells often included elements of horror and savagery in his novels, MOREAU is not so much horrific as it is disturbingly gruesome and occasionally deliberately distasteful. This is not really a book than you can read and then put away: it lingers in your mind in a most unsettling way. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"This book is less known than Wells' other works like The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, but in many ways it exceeds these other, more popular works. This novel is a story essentially about the nature of humanity. What is it that makes us people? What, exactly, separates man from the beasts? Wells' insidious Dr. Moreau is the perfect character to explore these questions as he has no conscience. As you read this book you find yourself identifying more with the &quot;beasts&quot; than with the Dr. or his assistant; and you find yourself wondering whether or not the noble beasts are in fact more human than the human characters. This work is decades before its' time; as today genetic research and animal rights are garnering more attention and headlines. I believe Wells was somehow able to see these issues decades ago when he wrote this story; and it remains one of the most salient writings on the topic to date. I heartily endorse this book for any fan of science fiction. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"This review is for the Dover Thrift Edition of THE ISLAND OF DR.

The Introduction is part of the novel and it contains important information.However, I'm guessing someone at Dover saw the Introduction ends with the name \\"Charles Edward Prendick\\" (as author of the introduction) and decided this wasn't written by H.G.

Once I began to preview the book to determine whether or not I was going to keep in on my Kindle or delete it...I couldn't put it down! The language is somewhat dated however, it adds to the story line and keeps the events back in the time they should be rather than allowing them to creep into today's timeframe. It is so interesting to read something that was written that long ago and let your imagination decide how it may pertain to today's life in the form of genetic, hybrid and biological engineering. The fictional events on The Island of Dr. Moreau seem as though they could be going on in the local university biology research lab and hidden from the public eye.

References to \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" seem to surface frequently in pop culture, so I felt compelled to read this book. Some might go so far as to argue that this is Wells' best book. I may not disagree.While the book was written before the advent of genetic engineering as we know in the 21st Century, it could be applied. Wells seems to have intended the book as a commentary on the theories of Darwin and evolution. When Edward Prendick finds himself on a remote island, he recalls rumors of Dr. Moreau. But only when he sees his handy work does the horror begin. Using manipulative techniques that include primitive grafting, Moreau made the animals more human. Yet the ultimate question of the book is whether Moreau could make the animals into human, removing any trace of animal from them.This is certainly a case of the book being better than the movie as the book makes Wells true intent evident. Like many of Wells' works, it is also a powerful social commentary that makes great reading."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"This book is one of a relatively small number of stories that could all be considered prototypes of the &quot;mad scientist&quot; subgenre of the science fiction genre. (Some of the others are &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, by Mary Shelley, &quot;20,000 Leagues Under The Sea&quot;, by Jules Verne, and &quot;Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde&quot;, by Robert Louis Stevenson.) As such, there are many elements of the story that to a modern reader may seem trite and overused; what is necessary for the reader to understand is that these concepts were NOT trite and overused at the time; this is one of the writers who CREATED these concepts, which are so powerful that they've been copied by later writers until they seem downright hackneyed. If a modern writer had written this story, I'd rate it two or three stars for a fairly competent style, by no higher because it adds nothing new to the genre. But as it is, it's one of the originals, and is worth reading if for no other purpose than to be able to see the references back to it in later novels, such as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, by Michael Crichton.If you're bored with the &quot;mad scientist&quot; subgenre, you probably needn't read this book. But if you're at all curious to see one of the books that originated the concept, this is an excellent early example of the idea. And if you are a fan of the genre, this book is definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"H.G. Wells may be best known for The Time Machine and the War of the Worlds, but don't overlook The Island of Dr. Moreau. This short novel, 160 pages, isn't so much a fast read as it is a good one. The titular Dr. Moreau is the quintessential \\"mad\\" scientist whose life's work involves vivisection. He takes animals and through surgery and brain manipulation attempts to give them humanity. The result is a twisted menagerie of beasts who share both human and animal traits. His experimentation has allowed them to understand human speech, and his brainwashing makes them believe he is a god whose laws must be obeyed.The protagonist of the story is Prendrick who gets shipwrecked on the island and then \\"rescued\\" by you know who. Prendrick's main purpose in the story is to be the outsiders who sees the island and the macabre goings on through discriminating eyes. He is also the trigger that helps the fragile society break down with the beasts regressing more and more into their animal instinct, which causes the grim downfall of Moreau.This is a story full of metaphors and deep-reaching themes. The obvious theme concerns man's desire to play God and the negative consequences of such efforts, but also the deeper conclusions one can draw about Wells' view of humanity itself.Overall The Island of Dr. Moreau, clearly shows the depths of Wells' thinking and his deep interest in society and its ills. The story challenges one to think about the negative consequences of genetic and social engineering. It also shows that H.G. Wells was a far-reaching thinker and a man truly before his own time."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"This is certainly an interesting work, though not nearly as exciting or gripping as The Time Machine or War of the Worlds. For some reason, I had the notion in mind that this short novel was a &quot;most dangerous game&quot; type of story where the protagonist is hunted, but this is of course not true. Dr. Moreau is a scientist--a quite mad one, actually--whose life's work involves vivisection; in essence, he takes a plethora of animals and, through surgery and mental indoctrination of some sort, attempts--with varying success---to endow them with humanity. The result is a twisted menagerie of beasts who share both human and animal traits of myriad sorts. They can understand human speech, in fact, which has allowed the doctor to indoctrinate them into a worldview wherein he is the god whose laws must be obeyed. While the story of the protagonist, Prendrick, is interesting, from his initial shipwreck to his &quot;rescue&quot; and eventual escape, his main purpose in the story is to describe the inhabitants of this macabre island. As one may imagine, this isolated, fragile society eventually breaks down and the beasts regress more and more into their animal instincts, to the great detriment of the &quot;god&quot; Moreau and his rather pitiful assistant Montgomery.Metaphors and broad, deep-reaching themes abound in this tale. While one can certainly make out an obvious theme concerning man's desire to play God and the negative consequences of such efforts by science, there are deeper and more mysterious conclusions one can draw about Wells' view of humanity itself. While this is certainly not a racist novel, one can conceivably see it as a warning against racial mixing, particularly in terms of the notion that the lower and more &quot;bestial&quot; traits will eventually win out over any &quot;higher&quot; traits imbued into a mixed creation, a common idea at that time. However, I tend to see the strange human-animal creations of Dr. Moreau as a microcosm of mankind itself. There is evil (or bestiality) present in all men which has the danger of erupting to the surface at any time; no set of external factors can make a truly good man. Society will always have a minority who are bestial in nature and who cannot be redeemed despite the best efforts of that society's members to form a perfect world. The tale is a rather unusual one for Wells, it would seem, particularly in terms of this seemingly negative interpretation of society itself. There are no good guys in this tale; every character is a victim; the experimentation (social as well as physiological) of Dr. Moreau is an unadulterated failure. Perhaps the conclusions I have drawn from reading this story are my own alone. The Island of Dr. Moreau, however, clearly shows the depths of Wells' thinking and his deep interest in society and its ills, and it challenges the reader to think about the negative consequences of genetic and social engineering.

His explanation is so fantastic that no one believes him.

Plus, it was violent and animalistic. It did a lot of interesting exploring into the human psyche and condition, not just about our inner animal, but about our scientific curiosities, our behaviors in various situations, etc.That's not even mentioning all of the fascinating topics Wells broached that are so timeless to have spawned many copycat stories. Sometimes in reading classics after having read and been exposed to so many stories that seem to descend directly from said classic, it can be difficult for the original story to really grab my attention.

By the 19th century, there were swathes of the medical community doing this with no anesthesia on dogs and other companion mammals, and there were no laws to stop them. Advances were made in the medical sciences (like the discovery of hormones), but terror was inflicted upon the animals, who often still acted like the companions we've bred them to be:\\"Hundreds of times I have seen when an animal writhed in pain, and thereby deranged the tissues, during a deliberate dissection; instead of being soothed, it would receive a slap and an angry order to be quiet and behave itself. . . Even when roughly grasped and thrown on the torture-trough, a low, complaining whine at such treatment would be all the protest made, and they would continue to lick the hand which bound them till their mouths were fixed in the gag.\\"~Dr. George Hoggan, 1875Wells' contemporaries didn't just accept the practice as a required part of medical research. There were anti-vivisection organizations, riots over the practice, and calls for legislation and criminalization - but it wasn't enough. The practice remained legal because professionals convinced most people that it was necessary for the progress of science.This is the missing context for The Island of Dr. Moreau. Many people were horrified by the practice, angry at the medical establishment for doing it, but convinced that it was necessary. This is the perfect environment for fears of unethical research, of man \\"playing god\\" with the animal kingdom.The book explores one vivisectionist's attempts to raise animals to the level of man by surgery and splicing. The science is silly in the early 21st century (we'd use genetics), but the ethical questions remain. Moreau's monsters necessarily degenerate into their bestial nature, taste blood, go wild, and turn into murderers, leaving his protagonist to fear that all men will degenerate into the same Hobbesian condition.For Wells, it's simply a fact that they are less than men. The one character who sympathizes with them is murdered by them, deep drunk in his own stupidity and whiskey. He has been abandoned by the society of men and resorts to animals and liquor, and among them, he deserves his death.I find it interesting to consider what the modern story would be. We've had to honestly consider whether a machine can develop awareness, and if it could, would it be a person? Chimpanzees can learn rudimentary sign language, and have been seen using tools unprovoked. Are they people? In a modern environment, the tragedy of this story would revolve less around Moreau's sin in creating his monsters, but around his sin in treating them as slaves, as something less than men.If a scientist today somehow created a dog/human hybrid that could speak with the language skills of a five year old child, what would the result be? Maybe the scientist would be jailed, but that hybrid would certainly be considered a person, not a monster."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I haven't read a classic in some time. I believe the only other H.G. Wells novel I have read is The Time Machine, which I read many years ago. It was interesting going from modern YA to something written in the 1800s.I did not know what to expect when I started reading this. I was recently home in Memphis, where my parents still live and my old bookshelf lives as well. I perused the bookshelf for books I hadn't read that I was interested in reading. This was one of my discoveries. I later found out that this book is available for free on Goodreads. I'm glad I know that now because other classics can also be found there, too.The main subject this book deals with is the difference between man and beast. Dr. Moreau has created Beast Men through vivisection, merging different breeds into humanlike entities. The science of this book is unbelievable, but I'm sure this was a potential fear for people in the late 1800s. Darwinism had emerged and science was quickly progressing.Taking into account the time period this book was written, it must have been groundbreaking. I really enjoyed the way religion was brought into it. The Beast Men's mentalities has similarities to the animals in Animal Farm, with laws that they force themselves to follow.The language was, at first, difficult to comprehend, but I got used to it a few chapters in. The word \\"presently\\" is used in this novel an excessive amount!I give this book a 4/5. Classics always seem better when you aren't reading them for school. I recommend this to anyone interested in a classic thriller sci-fi. There were some pretty creepy parts in this book."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Wells did it again!The surprise ending was OUT OF THIS WORLD!You have got to read it!I love it when an author ties a previous work in to what you are reading.Mr. Wells you are still giving MEGA pleasure."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this novel. I knew the premise of the story and had seen the terrible movie adaptations, but I'd never read the work by H.G. Wells himself. This was a perfect example of the axiom that \\"the book is always better than the movie.\\"The novel is well-written, fast-paced, and truly intriguing, if not downright disturbing. Sure, it's dated -- how could it not be? -- it was written in 1897. However, nothing central to the story is noticeable as being out of date, and the time frame in which the story takes place is an element that only adds to the atmosphere while reading. It feels like a \\"period piece\\" to some degree.The characters, their ambitions, the protagonist's war against insanity and his fight for self-preservation, the doctors' moral compromises and failures -- these and other ugly components of the human condition are on display here, and it's riveting.Presently I'm reading the earliest publishing of Shelley's Frankenstein, then onto to other works by H.G.

The story is a classic one, and I imagine most readers would be familiar with at least the concept prior to reading. The concept of the story is a good one, but the writing style is a bit dry. Some parts of the story are a little confusing to read. Although it was written some time ago, some of the themes, like the ruthless exploitation of science, are timeless. Still, it was hard to get past some of the dialogue and writing, which would transform this from a solid read, to something special.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"The world of science fiction can take us on a ride that separates imagination from reality. We can read stories about unusual creatures, a world of an \\"impossible to explain\\" atmosphere and a journey of unexpected frights. But what I read is about a scientist who is trying to turn animals into humans, and the results will surprise you and how it's unlike your average sci-fi novel.In H.G. Wells' classic novel, we follow a young man, Edward Prenrick, who is the one and only survivor of a sunken ship boat but is rescued by a group of unususal folk. He wakes up finding himself ina ship cabin with them heading in a nunknown destination. While waiting, Penrick meets the ship's keeper Montgomery, who is a bit of a rough guy, but helps Edward recover from his injuries. They finally reach an island where it is inhabited by errie fellows, snarling dogs and the man who is behind what's going on. He is Doctor Moreau, an infamous but genius scientist whose experiment is to give animals human intelligence and plans to do that. But when things start to go bad, Prenrick is held prisioner on the island and discovers that Mongomery is part of this. Now all he worries is how will he survive on this bizarre island?I was intrigued by the story's telling and plot while reading it. Some will find the story difficult to read because of how the text is written, but they will not see what will hit them. Judging of how Wells' book is, it can be comparable to some of today's popular dark-genre authors like Dean Koontz, Stephen King, and others. \\"TIODM\\" is one classic sci-fi book that many readers should explore, and how it will definitely keep them away from reality."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Written more than a century ago The Island of Dr Moreau is still read by many people to this day. An Englishman is shipwrecked and lands on the island where Dr Moreau portrays god and struggles to create the perfect race. Messages on evolution and the misuse of intelligence is found throughout the book. Issues on the role of God and his relationship with mankind are also discussed. Everyone can relate to The Island of Dr Moreau through the the beast people. We are the beast people surpressed by God, or Dr Moreau. We bury our intincts and our desires, and try to follow what society believes is right. Once in a while those emotions can no longer be hidden and they burst through our molded personalities. It is probable that this is what HG Wells was trying to express in his work since it was written in 1896, around the same time when Charles Darwin anounced the idea of evolution. There are passages in the book that make reference to the old testament. I enjoy this controversial aguement in The Island of Dr Moreau.

Since I was intrigued by Wells' War of the Worlds I thought I would give this book a bash. What a let down, it's almost as chaotic and incomprehensible as the movies it spawned.The story is told by Edward Prendick, a man of science with a background in biology. He is shipwrecked somewhere in the Pacific and rescued by a man called Montgomery who has a half-man, half-cat for a best pal. They arrive on some remote island and meet a delusional mad doctor who has been conducting brutal, evil experiments on animals in an attempt to make then near-human.The fact that Wells managed to involve pre-DNA science quite extensively in this story is commendable. But it's so meandering and unfocused that I got quite bored. But since it's not too long I stuck with it and by the end I felt like it was kinda worth it.The characters are dull and never really come to life and it lacks any definitive action or horror scene.

The main character is a young naturalist, Edward Prendick, is shipwrecked and ends up on a island where Dr. Moreau is testing the limits of creation. The Doctor is trying to uplife animals into the sphere of man - giving them the power of thought and speak, changing their bodies so they can walk on two legs and grab with two hands. He rules them like a God, promisng them pain and fire if they disobey. He acts without pity or mercy, more like a beast than a human scientist.But what happens when God dies and there is nobody to punish them?Edward Prendick seems somewhat stupid and sometimes spineless. Only in the end does he try to take command of the events flowing past him and he still fails in the end to tame the uplifted animals."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"The strange story of Edward Prendick, who is picked up in the beginning of the story as the lone survivor of an accident at sea. The crew of the ship that saves him, however, is unhappy with the other passengers: a Mr. Montgomery and his strange helper, and a cargo of wild animals. Prendick is forced off the ship when Montgomery and the animals disboard at a small island. Although unwelcome, he is taken into the care of the master of the island, the strange and reclusive Dr. Moreau. Prendick soon learns of the horrific research being performed there by the doctor.Interesting as an old horror novel, and the story is compelling enough. As seems to be typical of many similar novels from the time (late 1800's) the idea for the story is drawn from scientific ideas then prevalent, and interestingly enough, has a modern-day parallel in some of the current stem-cell research. Readers who enjoy Jules Verne would probably also like this book, although it's generally darker and more pessimistic than Verne.

As a result, when I finished it I thought of it as a freaky adventure story with a few comments on evolution.However, after reading the afterword by Brian Aldiss, I realized how deep the rabbit hole really goes with this thing. H.G. Wells has not only talked about evolution and weird science, but tied in religion, the human capacity for reason, the abuse of knowledge, and enough other deep thoughts to make your head spin.

Anyway, the doctor is Moreau. And this Moreau guy gets animals and tries to make them more human. What really bothered me about this is that he really had no reason for doing this. It might be a different case if he was actually benifitting the world by doing this. But no, he was just doing this for his own personal curiosity.

I end up missing a lot of the story and have to constantly rewind because my mind easily wanders because the presentation is so poor. Also the quality of the audio in general is really bad. Hissy and grainy."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"These days, the premise of genetic manipulation and moral complexities on an island may sound intriguing if not derivative. Think \\"Jurassic Park\\" and \\"Lord of the Flies.\\" In this case, though, the author predates those novels by decades, creating a scientific thriller that became a building block for generations to come.Prendick becomes a castaway of sorts on an uncharted island, and soon discovers man-beasts that show uncommon intelligence if not disturbing signs of experimentation. Soon, he meets Dr. Moreau and Montgomery, men intent on exploring the possibilities of vivisection, blending mankind with animals. Horrified, he worries that he will be next on the doctor's table in the House of Pain. Instead, the Beast People begin reverting to their bestial states and turning on their human lords, slowly rejecting the Law that the cold-hearted doctor has instilled, through hypnotism, into their brains. Moreau, Montgomery, and Prendick become the endangered species.Told as a first-person account, \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" is my first venture into the writing of HG Wells. I'm surprised by the readability, considering its date and British origins. Their is little of the pretentious dialect we see and hear in British entertainment.While Wells seems to wrestle here with a reconciliation of a religious society in the late 1800s and the emergence of evolutionary theory, he keeps the story fast-paced and entertaining. He seems to push against the ideas of an angry, distant God, as well as the ramifications of mankind in the throes of Darwinism. In his own words, he called the story a \\"youthful blasphemy,\\" though it seems to be more an honest questioning of how and/or if science and faith could work hand in hand.Dated as some of the scientific aspects may be, this is a clear stepping stone to many of the novels of the last few years. Crichton and company owe Wells a huge debt, and as for me, I'll be picking up more of his books."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"This is a gripping book by H.G.

His explanation is so fantastic that no one believes him.

His writing has content similar to Michael Crighton, and leaves the reader gasping for air and wondering \\"What if?\\"The only problem I had with the Kindle version, which was an excellet buy at 0.00, is that the book begins as if it were a memoir. I am embarrassed to point out that I didn't know who Herbert George was prior to purchasing the book, and found myself referring to other reviews to determine if the book was a memoir or fiction."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I knew the high level concept of this book from allusions in other stories and movies, but I'd never read the original novel. It was a bit different from what I expected.The writing style is very accessible and fluid while also being jam-packed with very vivid and detailed descriptions as well as some in-depth scientific and moralistic discussions. The first few pages were a little slow, but the rest of the book, except for a paragraph here and there, flew by and kept me very hooked.The story is presented as a written report from the point of view of a narrator who finds himself stranded on the island for a time after some disasters at sea. The narrator has some scientific background which lends to very analytical and in-depth commentary.Without adding any real spoilers, the summary is this: Doctor Moreau, after being chased out of London for his practices, is living on an island in the pacific conducting outrageous experiments. Our narrator, Pendrick, finds the island populated with creatures that are neither completely human nor completely bestial...they are aberrations....creatures partially human and partially beasts....the face of a man with almost snout-like nose and lips, pointed hairy ears, elongated torso and shorter than normal legs, etc., etc., etc. The horrors and grotesque nature of the experiments are explored in depth and naturally progress to some rather disturbing conclusions.I rather enjoyed the story and found myself immersed in the plot and the concepts. My only real complaint by the end of the book was that it all ended too quickly. I would have loved another 50 or 100 pages. Still, it is a tightly woven tale with a lot of meet in it to leave you thinking.Wells presents a thoughtful narrative addressing some of the social concerns of his day through this science-fiction story. At that point in history (late 1800s), this was all seen as fiction but based on the fears people had of experiments in the medical community. It's even more potent now, since some 30-50 years after the book, the Nazis engaged in similar \\"scientific\\" experimentation during the Holocaust (not with the same results, but with a similar type of horror upon society).I really liked the way the book finished up. In the last few pages, we find our narrator trying to sort through everything he's witnessed and come to terms with it. I really enjoyed the way Wells shows him trying to recognize \\"humanity\\" in people and distinguish between the \\"human\\" and the \\"animal.\\"A great read.*****4.5 stars (out of 5)"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Like most people I have seen this as movie years ago but it didn't haunt me half as deeply as the small novel itself. In size it's a sliver of a book but its depth goes beyond the short amount of pages. The beginning was little tough to get into but transformed into a magnificent story that kept me up for two nights in a row. Even though this was written over a hundred years ago the tale is still fresh and shocking, waking up immense pity and outrage at what people are capable of. Like the story says, the difference between man and beast is that man can lie...but both are capable of monstrosities but not for the same reason. H.G Wells was known to paint a rather melancholic and pessimistic picture of man's footprint on nature and animals and even ourselves; strangely I have always bonded with that dark side of reality. It's true, we can destroy more than create, or perhaps create while destroying precious creatures and resources.I love all sorts of island stories, where someone is literally stranded with no means of escape and at the mercy of whatever lurks in the deep jungles and caves. In this story, a small unnamed island is populated by strangely misshapen men, resembling animals more than humans. Ran by two scientists, Moreau and Montgomery, it's an insane place where new law rules and where animals are turned into people. Or so they think, when Edward Prendick, a victim of a nasty ship wreck gets rescued and taken to the island he uncovers horror that almost claim his sanity. He sees that there is no way out, he's trapped in a place where normal doesn't exist, a new world populated with half man and half beasts, with volatile emotions and restrictions. I enjoyed discovering the islands secrets with Edward, and many emotions shook me as I read. Page 98 was perhaps the most disturbing, the memory stuck in my head, especially since I have pets at home, I can tell when one is happy and when it's distressed and this book is full of distressAfter reading this I am hungry for more of H.G.

G. Wells. All three authors created highly imaginative, sometimes frightening stories. H. G. Wells was the more modern author and with some revisions to reflect modern biology and medicine, The Island of Dr. Moreau (1896) could easily be a contemporary horror story.In this tale Wells employed the narrative style characteristic of nineteenth century fiction. The story is told by the only survivor of three men drifting aimlessly at sea with little water and food. The rescued Edward Prendick finds himself on a ship with a most unusual cargo - a menagerie of animals - all destined for a remote island. Unexpectedly, as a fellow traveler disembarks along with the caged animals, Prendick is forcefully cast ashore on this strange island, the island of Dr. Moreau.Wells allows Prendick (and the reader) to gradually unveil the horrifying mystery of Dr. Moreau's isolated laboratory. This exciting blend of science fiction, horror, and mystery is surprisingly suspenseful.H. G. Wells is best known for The War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man, The Time Machine, and The Island of Dr. Moreau. These four superb science fiction novels share the common theme of man overwhelmed by the potential of science for harm and evil. His entertaining stories are surprisingly provocative.In his later years H. G. Wells became increasingly pessimistic about man's future. He refused to leave his home in Regent's Park during the German bombing of London. He died in 1946.Hint: When searching for editions by title, check under Dr. Moreau and Dr Moreau and Doctor Moreau. These different spellings can yield different results."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Until I read this book, I didn't know that a serious novel about human like animals existed. Certainly H.G. Wells is not most well known as one of the fathers of sci-fi for this novel. It was one of his first, published in 1896, and the book lovers of the time must have really found this work disturbing and shocking. Maybe that's why The Island of Dr. Moreau has been playing catch up to The Time Machine and War of the Worlds ever since. I admit that I myself found the basic idea in this book very cruel, but I realized that the book covered other issues as well. Besides being the novel about an insane scientist who tries the hand at playing God, this book evokes thoughts of social responsibilty and freedom of all living things. Also, it shows that sometimes who we think of as being authority really have no right to be, and deals with anarchy and revolution. But it is the basic plot that has the most effect. Why does Moreau torture animals so that can make them in the image of man? Dr. Moreau beats Victor Frankenstein on who is a more of a nutcase. Frankenstein intended for something good to come out of his work. Moreau did his experiments just for curiosity. He didn't expect for his creations to have any real purpose. He didn't care for them. And yet he brainwashes his creations to fear and respect him, to treat him like a god, and follow his laws. And another thought occurs. What really seperates man from beast? What causes humans to sometime commit violent and brutal acts? What does that account for? When I read this novel, the reality of what genetic cloning may become years from now passed through my mind. If genetics had been an established science in the 1890's, Wells could of utilized it in this book, but he would probably have created a controversy beyond any proportion. But certainly the ignorance of genes back then was not his fault, and he came up with probably the best substition: vivisection. Being the substitute of what was unknown and likely more plausible, vivisection was more than enough to shock Well's audience of reading about the blasphemous idea of creating &quot;Beast-People&quot;. I am certain that people in 1896 weren't ready for it. Neither are we. That's what I think is the main reason that The Island of Dr. Moreau isn't as popular as H.G. Wells other novels. I found, however, that this was a worthwhile read because its suspense and creepiness intrigued me, and it made me think of some social issues. If you're a person who can bear reading a grotesque story of cruelty and suffering, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Frankenstein is to resurrecting the dead as The Island of Dr. Moreau is to genetically splicing, or chimeras.The premise is simple: A guy is the only survivor of a shipwreck and ends up on an island in which a doctor is genetically modifying animals and turning them into humanoids; and of course, at some point, the crap hits the fan. It's a very odd book but a classic in science fiction.I admit that it's a hard book to read, until you get into the flow of things.

Dripping with atmosphere and filled with a pitch dark portrayal of the suffering inflicted on the world by man's callous and wanton infliction of pain and atrocity in the name of \\"science,\\" The Island of Dr. Moreau provides an anti-creation story with the amoral Dr. Moreau as God the creator. With hardly an unnecessary word, this short novel rushes relentlessly through a nightmarish landscape to a dark, inevitable conclusion, leaving deep philosophical, scientific, and theological unease in the reader.Pendrick is ship-wrecked and rescued by Montgomery, a fellow Englishman who is in the process of transporting animals to an island in the South Pacific. Of particular note is Montgomery's assistant, whose aspect and physiology are unsettling. He seems to be animalistic in features and movement. The other sailors share Pendrick's unease and summarily throw Montgomery, his assistant, and their animals, along with Pendrick, off the ship upon reaching their destination. If the assistant was unnatural in appearance, he is nothing compared to the \\"men\\" that assist in bringing the party ashore to what Pendrick later discovers is an island under the charge of Dr. Moreau---a literary figure rivaling Ahab in obsession and malevolence.Moreau and Mongomery make no attempt to disguise what is happening on the island as Pendrick is quickly driven outside by the screams of agony of Moreau's latest experiment. Pendrick describes the screams as \\"if all the suffering in the world were given one voice.\\" Running to the beach in fear and to escape the awful suffering, Pendrick encounters the other residents of the island---the \\"men\\" and other creatures created by Moreau on this anti-Eden with Moreau as a demonic counter-part to God.Transformed and reborn in the pain of Moreau's scalpels, the island is populated by hybrids of all types of animals. Some human in form, some animal, some the stuff of nightmares that make one think of Lovecraft's monsters. These creatures are held in place by \\"the Law\\" which governs their behavior and a twisted form of society that places Moreau at the apex as its Creator and God.Moreau's control of his Eden is tenuous as it requires him to maintain his God-like stature in the eyes of the \\"men\\" who are reverting daily more and more to their animal instincts. Even as the nightmare moves towards its inevitable conclusion, we are left to wonder, along with Pendrick, at what truly is the difference between man and the other animals, as well as the use and value of science and religion in society.Wells later classified this book as a \\"an exercise in youthful blashphemy\\" and one can clearly see why he might say this as Moreau creates commandments (\\"the Law\\" of the creatures), the threat of torment (in \\"The House of Pain\\") and places himself as the creator and God of creation to keep control over these creatures. This makes Moreau that much worse than even the most terrible of his creatures because, even as he describes the abominations created by Moreau, Pendrick tells us that while animals are capable of terrible violence and cruelty, \\"it takes a real man to lie.\\""},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I am making my way through the classics. Of course there are many by H.G. Wells on the list and I am glad for that. The Island of Doctor Moreau is bone-crunching goodness. What an imagination!

After reading The Island of Dr. Moreau and Time Machine, Wells' ideas certainly comes across as prophetic. He has clearly thought in detail about the ramifications of science and society's evolution. I was impressed with Time Machine and this one is just as good. These days we talk and hear about Cloning and Genetic Engineering, and their pros and cons with ease; so the image he creates here and the message he wants to convey may not appear to be revolutionary, but if we remember that we are talking about 1890s, then it's easy to understand why Wells is termed as a visionary. We as a society will do anything that is possible; if something is possible, then it will be done; once done, we then come up with an ethical reasoning for it. What Wells wants to remind us here are the potential ramifications of fooling around with certain inviolate principles of nature. Once the genie is out of the bottle, there may not be much that can be done, and that's what Dr Moreau here experienced. In an era where the Darwinian theory was gaining ground, Wells points out that although we're moving to a \\"higher\\" level in the scale of evolution, the \\"lower\\" aspect is still very much alive, albeit hidden. I liked Alan Lightman's introduction as well."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I first read this book when I was about 13, and I really liked it because of its unique story. Reading it again as an adult, I realize that I missed all the philosophical implications entirely.The narrator of the novel, Edward Pendrick, is shipwrecked and alone in a small life-boat, when he is picked up by a freighter. Strange circumstances lead to his being left on a small island with an ex-medical student, who is prone to drunkenness, and Dr. Moreau, a disgraced scientists. Also on the island are various strange-looking \\"natives,\\" who are almost animal-like in appearance.It soon becomes apparent that Dr. Moreau has been performing bizarre experiments, transforming animals into a semblance of humanity, with the ability to walk upright and to speak. Unfortunately, they tend to revert to bestiality.And what happens next? That suspense is the strength of this story. That and the very literate writing.What did I miss the first time? I missed Well's suggestion that man is not so far from beast as he would like to think. The narrator says, \\"A strange persuasion came upon me that, save for the grossness of the line, the grotesqueness of the forms, I had before me the whole balance of human life in miniature, the whole interplay of instinct, reason, and fate, in its simplest form.\\"I really like this comment on the difference between man and beast: \\"An animal may be ferocious and cunning enough, but it takes a real man to tell a lie.\\"For those who have not yet read the book, but who have seen the movie(s), don't assume you even know the story, much less understand the implications.

There is a secret to this island, something terrifying, and Prendick is about to find out what it is, whether he wants to or not.This book is one of the crowning examples of nineteenth century fantastic fiction. But, it is not merely an early science fiction story. Mr. Wells wrote this story as something of a lesson about scientists playing God, and creating monstrosities (not unlike Mary Shelley's Frankenstein). This book is an exciting adventure story, with a fascinating lesson. Even though the book was written in 1896, it is still an exciting read, one that I highly recommend to you."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I saw the movies of this first, and thought that the book wouldn't be great, but the book was actually amazing. The story is much deeper than that of the movies and it's a more thrilling tale."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"The Island of Dr. Moreau is one of my favorite books by H.G. Wells. Certainly, amongst his popular works (let's set aside his lesser-known books for now) he has stories with a grander scope (War of the Worlds), stories with more interesting characters (Invisible Man), even stories with a better social commentary (Time Machine). But of all his stories, The Island of Dr. Moreau is the most realistic, the most unsettling. The science portrayed in the story is admittedly outdated, and the characters aren't quite as interesting, but the story is certainly more than the sum of its inferior-to-other-pieces-of-other-Wells-stories parts.There is still an element of realism to what the story proposes, and that is why I enjoy it so much. We know the moon is not what H.G. Wells painted it to be, nor Mars. It's safe to assume there are not invisible scientists running amok in remote rural villages. And I'm pretty certain that we have not yet built a time machine that can travel 800,000 years into the future at the mere flick of a crystal rod. However, the idea that a brilliant, isolated scientist could mutate (perhaps mutilate is better) animals into semi-intelligent, semi-human creatures seems just on the border of plausible, especially in this modern age of genetic manipulation. There is no villain in this story, at least not in the same sense as Invisible Man or War of the Worlds. The Doctor from which the book derives its namesake is very smart, very devoted to his work, and perhaps a bit dismissive of people who do not agree with him, but he hardly seems insane. Even the protagonist comes to this conclusion. That caught me off guard. I thought Moreau would at least try to harm the protagonist, or perhaps torture his creations, or something of that nature. The creatures created by Moreau are not the villains, either, although they are terrifying. I say they are terrifying because they are not quite human, nor quite animal, so the reader may sympathize with their bizarre existence on one page, and then be disturbed by their animal nature on the next page.Even though the book does contain a \\"message\\" like a lot of classic fiction in this genre does, the story itself is a great read full of adventure."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Couldn't get into this book at all.

And, although they tell their stories in very different ways, they share common themes. First, there's the basic question: do people have any business attempting to create human-like life? Second, once that's been done, what is the creator's responsibility towards the creation?\\"To this day I have never troubled about the ethics of the matter,\\" says Dr. Moreau of the torment he inflicts on the creatures in his care. He even sets himself up as lord and law-giver to the beasts that he has partly humanized. Much more that Dr. Frankenstein, Moreau typifies an ugly stereotype of scientists: arrogant, amoral, and self-centered with a brutality made chilling by its blindness to the sufferings of others.I like to think that today's bioengineers hold themselves to higher standards, even when animals must be used in research. Certainly, the ones I know maintain awareness of their work's moral implications. It would be a mistake to think that every (or any) scientist shows the same sadistic hubris as Moreau. It would also be a mistake to forget the real power of today's science, and the responsibility that must go with that power.--wiredweird"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"There are two things I associated with H.G. Wells. One is The Time Machine, which of course was the primary inspiration for my all-time favourite TV show, Doctor Who. The other is The Island Of Dr. Moreau, which like the Time Machine, I saw as a pioneer literary work in science fiction.After being picked up from the dinghy of the Lady Vain by a trader ship, Edward Prendick goes to a small unchartered island in the Pacific, where he finds some very strange looking natives, including a serving man with furred pointed ears. The island is run by Dr. Moreau. Could this be the same Dr. Moreau who had to leave England in a hurry because of a scandal involving experimentation on dogs?The contrast between man and animal is one theme here, as seen in the natives' laws: \\"Not to go on all Fours; that is the Law. Are we not men?\\" or \\"Not to claw Bark of Trees; that is the Law. Are we not men?\\" No we are Devo. Sorry, wrong reference. Prendick is also called a \\"five man,\\" as in five fingers. What makes men different from animals? Reasoning, language, being bipedal, trimmed nails, and sophisticated in manner, although that last point is certainly debatable.However, most people are so keen to see this as a pioneering sci-fi literary miss the intellectual background. After Darwin's theory of evolution started to crack the foundations of Victorian and religious thinking. It seemed that we were closer to apes than to God. However, humanism also reared its head again, and Moreau becomes another Dr. Frankenstein in playing God. Small wonder why Wells later called this a \\"an exercise in youthful blasphemy,\\" though it's interesting that he initially became a disciple of pro-evolution scientist Thomas Huxley--in the novel, Prendick himself claims to be a student of Huxley.So far, this book has been remade into at least four movies, none of which have faithfully adapted it. There was even a Dr. Who story, Timelash, which borrowed heavily from it, and the theme of man usurping God's place at his own peril comes through.This book has some relevancy today, as stated in the afterword by Brian Aldiss: &#65533;The spirit of Dr. Moreau is alive and well and living in these United States.

I found it to be the perfect balance between action and introspection. The subject matter is horrifying (and sometimes gory), but very realistic and similar to what is currently being done with modern medicine and surgery. As usual, Wells shows himself to be almost creepily prophetic. The science in this book would be a little off if it had been written 50 years ago, but it was written in 1896!!!

Its Wells' skill as an author that he's able examine the most dramatic elements of both these qualities of Moreau's creations.From my perspective this book exhibits its greatest dramatic strength when Wells assumes the voice of Moreau as he explains to Prendick the reason for his work. All the hubris that would later accompany science's complicity in the development of the atomic bomb and revolutionizing the war industry are amply put on display by Wells in service of that greater point that science without humanity is every bit as barbaric as Moreau's monstrosities.Like his later Invisible Man this is Wells at his most dark when he permits himself not only to hold a mirror to cutting edge (if admittedly over extended) science but also to the worst in the human character itself."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"H.

In particular, I think about the pseudo-revolution of the beast men versus authority.The story is masterful, disturbing, and still poignant.

The Time Machine is one of my all time favorite while The First Men in the Moon pretty much fell completely flat for me. My only knowledge of the Island of Dr. Moreau was from snippits of the 1977 and 1996 films and an appearance in volume 2 of Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Neither film is highly regarded with the more recent receiving six Razzie nominations and winning two. It's a real shame because I absolutely loved the book.The stories protagonist, Edward Prendick, is lost at sea and eventually finds himself at the titular island of Dr. Moreau. The island is occupied by Moreau, his assistant Montgomery and scores of heavily clothed men and women whose unnatural body shapes and movements seem to reflect something not quite human. Moreau and Montgomery are quite pleasant gentlemen and have no issue with putting Prendick up for an extended stay. It's when Prendick spots a pointed and furry ear peaking out of the clothing of one of Moreau's assistance that he really starts to get an inkling of the true situation.This is the classic story of the scientist who loses touch with humanity in his quest for knowledge. There is no apparent malice in Moreau's motivation even as he performs some of the most appalling experiments imaginable. What Moreau does is sickening and yet he's the most pleasant host and is really never unkind to Prendick. The scientist performing monstrous experiments has been done to death but Wells wrote his book before it became a clich&eacute; and Wells' scientist isn't a cackling pontificating fiend which makes his actions all the more horrifying. Moreau takes no pleasure or sadness in the torturing of animals even as he runs his \`House of Pain'. It's the casualness of Moreau's disregard that makes him so frightening and the truth is that Wells never really hammers down on Moreau. Sure, he gets his in the end but it feels like Moreau gets off very light given his actions.What really killed \`The First Men in the Moon' for me was Wells near total disregard for science. The Time Machine was extremely thoughtful and The Island of Dr. Moreau is likewise well conceived and executed. Wells' somewhat formal style of writing bored me in \`The First Men in the Moon' but here it's a great contrast to the horrific nature of Dr. Moreau's experiments and his \`House of Pain'. It somewhat reminds me of Lovecraft who also wrote in a very elevated manner even as he described the most surreal and grotesque events.

The island is populated by two men, a Mr. Montgomery and a Dr. Moreau, along with some other beings that the narrator (the rescued) finds hard to identify. Eventually he discovers that these are creatures that Dr. Moreau has created through experiments in his lab. Moreau feels that he can eventually create human like creatures from beasts which he pieces together from other creatures, a swine with a dog, for example. The beasts, under the oversight of Moreau, have begun to develop an almost human culture that includes pseudo-religious chanting and worshiping of Moreau. However, over time they tend to return to their original animal nature and they struggle against edicts to eat flesh or walk on all fours. Some have become subservient while others hint at rebelliousness. It is this placing of human vs. animal nature within the story that echoes similar struggles within the human species and alludes to some of the timeless debates about the nature and origin of humanity. When Pendrick (the one rescued) returns to civilization, he finds it hard to distinguish his human neighbors from the sub- and semi-human beasts form the island. In this confusion, the blurring between human and animal nature is expressed and reminds the reader of times when one can act more like other, in both directions. The book is a captivating and disturbing success."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"This novella is interesting as a piece of science fiction, the genre of which H.G. Wells is sometimes called the father. It was written a few decades after Darwin presented his theory of evolution. The concept of evolution produced a lot of anxiety among intellectuals of the time, including Wells, who looks at the implications of the theory here. He puts the narrator, Prendick, on a secret island populated by Moreau's man-beast creations. The events which follow continually blur the line between man and animal, just as evolution forces man to see itself in the context of other species. Oh yeah, the novella, like any good sci-fi book, is suspenseful, and a little scary. And it's not very long, so you'll have plenty of time to read all your other books too."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Filiquarian Publishing, LLC published this book under the idea that it is in \\"public domain status.\\" Meaning, it is not any better than you would find online.

The cover is as basic as it gets, and has no text on the spine (see picture.) The back cover has merely a UPC barcode.

Cherry is attractive, smart, savvy, organized and detailed - everything a nurse should seem to be!"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Written more than a century ago The Island of Dr Moreau is still read by many people to this day. An Englishman is shipwrecked and lands on the island where Dr Moreau portrays god and struggles to create the perfect race. Messages on evolution and the misuse of intelligence is found throughout the book. Issues on the role of God and his relationship with mankind are also discussed. Everyone can relate to The Island of Dr Moreau through the the beast people. We are the beast people surpressed by God, or Dr Moreau. We bury our intincts and our desires, and try to follow what society believes is right. Once in a while those emotions can no longer be hidden and they burst through our molded personalities. It is probable that this is what HG Wells was trying to express in his work since it was written in 1896, around the same time when Charles Darwin anounced the idea of evolution. There are passages in the book that make reference to the old testament. I enjoy this controversial aguement in The Island of Dr Moreau. This might well be the mystery that unkowingly intrigues poeple to read this book. Anyone will enjoy this classic science fiction thriller."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"The mad scientist has been with us since the early 1800s. And while H.G. Wells didn't create the mad scientist stereotype, he certainly gave it a boost in his harrowing novella \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" -- beast-men forced to live like humans, a crazy scientist carrying out mad plans, and a bland Englishman stuck in the middle of it.After he is shipwrecked, the English gentleman Edward Prendick is rescued by a passing boat. The man who saved him, Montgomery, is taking a number of wild animals to a remote deserted island, where the creepy Dr. Moreau does some kind of research on the animals that are brought there. Naturally, Prendick is suspicious of Moreau's activities.It doesn't take long for him to stumble across the products of Moreau's work -- grotesque hybrids of animal and human, who are surgically turned into humanoids and ordered not to act in animalistic ways. And with the laws of nature being horribly perverted, it's only a matter of time before Dr. Moreau's experiments lash out.It's pretty obvious from this book that H.G. Wells was nervous about the ramifications of meddling in nature -- be it vivisection, evolutionary degeneration, or even just the idea that scientific progress could be used for horribly evil things. As a result, \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" is perhaps his darkest, most horrific book.The first couple chapters are rather stuffy in the 18th-century style, with Prendrick fussily noting everything that's happened to him. But the creepiness begins to enter once he arrives on the island, and explodes into weird, almost dreamlike scenes once he encounters the Beast Folk, culminating in the slow decay of everything on the island.Prendrick is also perhaps the weakest link in the book. When the only other humans on the island are.... well, a mad scientist and his sidekick, you need a protagonist who really grips your imagination. But he's honestly kind of bland, to the point where any number of the beastly folk have far more presence and power than he does.\\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" is a dark, eerie cautionary tale about science run amuck, and only its bland protagonist keeps it from fully engaging."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I have no idea how I've missed this little gem of a novel all my life, but I'm glad I finally ended up reading it. One of the reasons I love these editions is because I can easily catch up on classics and stories I have missed.This story was both horrible and wonderful at the same time. Some of the descriptions within - of the gore, the vivisections, the three main characters' reactions - seem so, well, modern. It is definitely a novel before its time. Some of the images stayed with me for a while, especially those from the lab.In short, I would recommend this book, especially to fans of horror/science fiction."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Having never read this or seen a film adaptation I still knew a little of what to expect having not lived under a rock all these years. Still, this was a difficult story for me to like. It's engaging, hard to put down, and everything else one wants in a story. But whoa, this is dark."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Considering this novel was first published in 1896, it is a testament to Wells' visionary imagination. His description of horrific vivisection experiments is a century ahead of its time. Dr. Moreau is portrayed as the ultimate villain, disregarding ethics for his own desire to play God in the name of scientific advancement. This is a great work of early science fiction that challenges the moral implications of science even today."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I wanted to read this story after we found a used DVD of the movie version with Val Kilmer and Marlon Brando. I often like to read the original material to see how it compares to movie interpretations. What surprised me, was how much I enjoyed the book, given that the movie is hardly Oscar material.HG Wells was ahead of his time. This book is not long, but it is still timely, thought provoking and very, if not MORE relevant than ever, even though it was written in 1898. It is simply the story of a man stranded on a remote Pacific island where a scientist has been mutilating animals in an effort to artificially create human-like creatures. Though the details of the technology have changed, the morality has not. Though I haven't seen it, I heard the Science Channel had a special called \\"Humanzee\\" and on the commercial for the program a scientist said, \\"its only a matter of time before somebody fuses a human with a chimpanzee\\". I immediately thought of this book.Why anyone would WANT to fuse different species together is beyond me. In this book, Wells explores the horrors and twisted mentality that lurked behind those horrors. To me, this book was more about the moral issues of this question, than the technology of it. Is it ok to be a god and manipulate life itself? The creatures on this island are Frankenstiens and Moreau is equivelant to Dr. Frankenstien. Just because you CAN do something technologically speaking, does it mean you should?For anyone interested, here are some basic observations about the movie vs. book:For one thing, Dr. Moreau is not the kindly, fat, cuddly, almost lovable and forgivable character we see int he movie. He doesn't love these creatures he's made. This is a major difference in my mind because it makes the story so much darker. Val Kilmer played Montgomery's character more or less as I pictured him in the book, (though in the book he's an alcoholic, not a drug addict). Montgomery in the book misses London and seems to feel \\"stuck\\" or \\"trapped\\" on the island, where as in the movie, he doesn't seem to mind being away from his homeland. That alters him slightly, but not as much as Moreau is different in each version.The Beast People are also different between book and movie and some of it has to do with the difference in technology between then and now and some of it has to do with Moreau being different in his attitude between the book and movie. Overall, we don't get to know the Beast People as individuals too well, though in both cases, the hyiena is a bad guy.All in all I really love this story, and though the make up is goofy in the movie and Brandon is way too kindly, I enjoy both versions of the story."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"The Island of Dr. Moreau was originally published in 1896. I had not previously read it, nor had I seen any of the several film versions, although I was familiar with the basic story. It has inspired untold variations on the \\"mad doctor tampers with the laws of nature\\" theme.Wells does not really address the hard science of the story, but that really isn't a problem. Going back in time through literature, the \\"science\\" in science fiction operated in increasingly broad strokes.The novel was not as engaging a read as I'd anticipated. One doesn't really feel much if any suspense, although that might have been a different story a hundred years ago.However, the novel does stick in the mind, almost hauntingly, and causes one to think about some of its themes (beyond the obvious themes of eugenics, genetic engineering, and the ethics of medical research), particularly human nature and what it means to be human. The main character's reactions when he returns to human society are quite interesting.On an interesting historical note, the publication of this novel coincided with a massive movement to abolish vivisection in Great Britain.Ultimately, The Island of Dr. Moreau is an engaging read and one of the cornerstones of science fiction.RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Cherry Ames and her fellow Spencer Nursing School nurses all enlist in the Army in World War II.

As I looked through the fifty or so reviews, however, I realized that none of the reviewers had realized what the main idea of this book was, or if they had, they failed to mention it, and failing to mention the main point of a book in a review of the book is a rather poor practice, is it not?The main point of this book was that Wells wanted us to wrestle with one assumption that science in his day was making, and still is today, namely that whatever we can do we should do. Just because scientific advancement has given us the ability to do things, does that mean we should? In Wells' day the hot topic was vivisection, so that is the practice discussed in this book, wrapped in the garb of a novel, and a very good novel at that. The same discussion is raging today with issues like stem cell research and cloning. Just because we can clone a human, does that mean science should do it? If not, why not? Because it violates humanity? If we are products of evolution what basis do we have for holding humanity as something that should not be violated?These issues are the ones that Wells brings to bear in this book by having Moreau use vivisection to create (near) humans from animals. The horror of the new creations is that they are distorted humanity. They are the violated humanity, but why should we find that horrific? Dr. Moreau, the figure of rationality with no regard for emotion, conscience, or morality, has no problem with the creatures. He does not see why they are horrific to Prendick, the narrator of the story. It seems that Wells is saying that scientific rationalism has no basis for saying that we should not violate humanity in the interest of science. For those who hold to this scientific rationalism, the question of should does not even arise. In such a position, can is equal to should.Of course, there are secondory points as well, such as man's ever persistent derire to shape the world around him to fit his will. Wells' point seems to be that our attempts to do this are doomed to failure, as nature simply refuses to be bent, just as Moreau's \\"humans\\" refused to stay human and kept reverting to their original animal state.As for the literary quality of the book, it is of the same excellent quality of the rest of Wells fictional works. The sense of realness is still there. The best way I can think to describe it is that is writing seems have the exact opposite feel that of fairy tales. Fairy tales always seem magical, happy, and imaginative. Wells is extremely realistic, usually unhappy, and seems as if they were writings of someone who had really been through the things the narrator claims to have been through.Overall grade: A"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Wells' imagination is almost scary. Despite being written over one hundred years ago, Wells presents a tale chilling and relevant to this day. A great story in it's own right, it delves deeper into human technological and biology conflicts that have only intensified in recent years. With the onset of cloning, gene therapy, and genetic modifications, the issues spark debate to this day.It starts off with Pendrick, shipwrecked, eventually arriving on the Island of Dr. Mareau and discovering strange beasts. These strange beasts were not natural though, but instead modified animals made up to look and act like humans. Without giving away the plot, the book then moves into action, while moving into such themes as insanity, animals versus humans, and the existence and treatment of god.This book works as a simple fun filled novel with intrigue, suspense and action. It's strange to have a book of such magnitude provide so much simple enjoyment. Even without the deep literary and social meanings, this book stands out by itself. The only flaw is the somewhat antiquated language.Of course, as a sort of added bonus, the insights and issues brought up provide a great addition. Such a book could easily be debated in literary and scientific circles. If such a book was used in my English classes, as opposed to such crud and Faulkner and Jane Austin, I might have actually enjoyed class.The Island of Dr. Maruea is the best mixture of plot and intellectual enjoyment I read since Animal Farm."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"And it is with these words that the main character in Hg wells masterpiece, &quot;the island of Dr moreau&quot;,expresses the feeling of being back in civilization. This is not a book just about being trapped on an island with a madman, but is a book about finding ourselves here in this existence and confronting and doing battle with the dual nature of animal and human in each of us. It is the struggle between social responsibilty and personal freedom, between the primal, organic impulses and the spiritual and intellectual. The conflict is eternal and inherent in what it is to be human. To negate and deny the other aspect is to live a life lacking of the full breadth of what it is to be human and to be at conflict with oneself. To live with both aspects is to live, paradoxically, with the same struggle.

The results were unbelievable, as I ended up really loving it.Edward Prendick is stranded on an island with a mad scientist, Dr. Moreau, and his assistant, Montgomery, who are performing horrendous and terrible experiments that lead to beast-like creatures that talk and behave like men. As the days go by, Prendick sees horrifying things that he will never be able to forget. This is Edward Prendick's story, and the account that you are about to witness is chilling and unforgettable.I really enjoyed this novel. I enjoyed it because it proves to be a book with different layers and hidden meanings. Sure, on the surface it appears as your everyday science fiction novel filled with thrills and excitement. However, there's a deeper meaning behind it all. What is that? Well, I'm not about to divulge that to you! That's part of the fun in reading this. The great thing about this story is that you can still enjoy it even if you don't feel like figuring out Wells' hidden meaning behind it all. It appeals to advanced readers and to those who are not as advanced. There's a little something for everyone.&quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; is a very engaging and well-written classic. Wells doesn't hold back when it comes to dishing out deep symbolisym and exciting action. If you're looking for an interesting read, I highly recommend that you check it out.

Most of his books in the field were written before the term was coined in the 1930s. Along with Mary Shelley, Jules Verne, and Robert Louis Stevenson, his work laid the foundation for almost every major form of Science Fiction. Just as many other books written since Wells share elements with THE INVISIBLE MAN or THE TIME MACHINE or THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, so numerous novels, short stories, movies, and television episodes have been influenced by THE ISLAND OF DOCTOR MOREAU.

While not a perfect film, it is easily the most intriguing of the three films, not least because of Bela Lugosi's unforgettable portrayal as The Sayer of the Law. In fact, both of the later films are more in the way of remakes of the first film rather than versions of the novel.Nonetheless, like with Wells's other novels, reading THE ISLAND OF DR.

While I found this book moderately entertaining, the premise was simply too absurd to draw me in. I could swallow some of the physiological biology, however at the point where animals began speaking as well educated Englishmen, Wells lost me.Certainly, the underlying theme has resonance today, in an era of increasing bio-medical engineering, and certainly, social commentary was among Wells's strong suits.

The first, who predicted the coming of space travel, sea travel, and modern geology, among other things, was Jules Verne. The second, who developed the idea of an Invisible Man, Martian Invaders, Time Machines, Atomic Energy, and Genetic Engineering, was H.G. Wells. The greatest works of Verne came true and yet men still strive to accomplish the ideas developed by Wells. Which one was the true visionary?However, two famous works of Wells HAVE come true. The first is his beliefs for the use of Atomic Energy in 'The World Set Free,' the other is man's perfection of nature in 'The Island of Dr. Moreau.' The main difference is that his modern day's 'viviseciton' has been replaced by OUR modern day's genetic engineering.Here is classic Wells; man's struggle with concepts of nature which he cannot comprehend, his inevitable downfall, and salvation and forgiving through nature. Yet in 'The Island of Dr. Moreau,' Wells's belief that humans are basically evil is never more easy to see.It also flows at a much smoother pace than some of his other novels, however certain parts can be hard to understand (I still don't understand exactly HOW the animals can talk and why they revert back to animals after 10 months WITHOUT Moreau as opposed to being half-humans for years WITH Moreau). And the end feels rushed as well.Overall, I would recommend it to anyone who appreciates science, literature, and the strange feeling that comes with the realization that a book that seems so modern was written so long ago."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"I would have given it five stars if it wern't so short.The Island of Dr. Moreau is about a man named Prendick who , after his ship was distroyed, ended up one way or other on a small island.

The word picture of the characters were clear enough to give me an idea of the hybrid man-animals that were created by Dr. Monreau and Mr. Montgomery, but still let me fill in the gaps to my liking.You will feel yourself take to the man-animal creations and struggle with the idea of what is it to be human and how, or if that can be harnessed, taught or evolved artificially. Maybe we will never know, but for me I believe it is unique to be human and it is something that we will not see in other species no matter how far along we move forward with science.This story provides one with the question of what is it to be human and lets your run with and make your own conclusion as the story comes to a close.Finally, like other reviewers, I urge you not to see the film first because it will pigeon-tail your imagination."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"One of the quickest reads in the H.G.

He puts his sentences together in a clean and simple way that makes his stories relevant as time marches on. I suggest downloading it now and reading it today!"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"This is the first book by H.G. Wells I've ever read and it is a good introduction to this writer. Wells helped forward many of the concepts that among the bread-and-butter of modern popular storytelling - the time machine, the scientist who doesn't know when to stop messing with nature, invisibility, alien invasion, etc.While the science in this book hasn't aged well and is pretty laughable, you can't fault Wells for that. In fact, it is easy to imagine scientists doing work similar to Moreau's, just using today's methods. And suffering equal to (or greater than) that going on in Moreau's labs is happening for animals right now also. It's easy to agree with Pendrick that for humans, suffering that is invisible and silent to us is bearable, but that \\"It is when suffering finds a voice and sets our nerves quivering that this pity comes troubling us.\\"Human curiosity still trumps any interest animals have in avoiding pain and living a natural life. In that way, despite the fantastic desert island setting and bizarre results of his experiements, Moreau is one of the most realistic characters in science fiction."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"A sinister book that is absolutely true still today. At the end of the 19th century surgical attempts and experiments permitted some animals to be transformed into evolved forms of their species close to human beings. He is an animalistic Frankenstein, this Doctor Moreau.These evolved animals could speak which is impossible since they could not have the phonatory, articulatory and brain capabilities necessary for language. But the idea enables the first level of the fable. And it is a fable at the time that could become a nightmare. Moreau's attempts were only surgical before anesthetics and antibiotics. It means it was highly improbable.The next stage is that Dr Moreau, through some kind of hypnosis impresses into their minds a \\"religion\\" of sorts in two directions: first fear, the fear to go back to the house of pains, that is to say Moreau's own laboratory, to suffer some more in the hands of Moreau who is seen as the master, the only authority, a god of sorts in other words. The second trend is the learning by heart and the ceaselessly repeating of a catechism that implies they respect some rules because they are human. In fact it is the reverse of what they say in this catechism: by repeating these rules they can pretend they are human.But strangely enough the ruin of this world will come from the very assistant of Dr Moreau. He will bring from his last voyage to Africa some rabbits he will free in the jungle and a man that had been picked up in the middle of the ocean more than half dead. The rabbits will multiply for sure but some of the monstrosities created by Moreau from carnivores will get a taste of that blood and that is one of the rules in the catechism that is thus broken. Once this rule is broken, why not the others, and once this rule is broken by one creature why not by other creatures. This creates a rebellion among the more or less controlled \\"society\\" of these monstrosities and against the humans who dominate them with whips, guns and fear.This will be amplified by the escape of the latest animal, a leopard, from the laboratory before the transformation is complete. The hunt for that imperfect animal leads to the death of Dr Moreau and then the complete crumbling of the island.The assistant becomes crazy and spreads alcohol among the beasts, burns the two boats that could provide an escape and some of the carnivores can attack and kill the assistant.Pendrick, the rescued guest saved from a shipwreck, has only one solution: to escape after killing the carnivore that is most menacing. But to escape he needs a boat of some kind. His building a raft is not that successful but a current brings a small boat with two dead people aboard. He is able to recuperate the boat and escape. Within three days he is picked up by a ship.But back with humans he finds he has developed a taste for solitude, mistrust for humans and that no one wants to believe him, not even the slightest allusions about this island.But this book is still valid for us because with our surgical science and technology, with our anesthetics and our genetic engineering we can do exactly what Dr Moreau tried to do, but without the pain and without the drawbacks. We easily can clone for instance or graft one animal element onto the genes of a human being, or vice versa and develop animals with human physiological and physical characteristics, and vice versa, humans with animal characteristics.In fact we can wonder at times if our neighbors are not genetically modified organisms when we see how animal-like their behavior may be when they bark or ululate or go for a taste of blood on an accident scene or on a crime scene.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"The mad scientist has been with us since the early 1800s. And while H.G. Wells didn't create the mad scientist stereotype, he certainly gave it a boost in his harrowing novella \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" -- beast-men forced to live like humans, a crazy scientist carrying out mad plans, and a bland Englishman stuck in the middle of it.After he is shipwrecked, the English gentleman Edward Prendick is rescued by a passing boat. The man who saved him, Montgomery, is taking a number of wild animals to a remote deserted island, where the creepy Dr. Moreau does some kind of research on the animals that are brought there. Naturally, Prendick is suspicious of Moreau's activities.It doesn't take long for him to stumble across the products of Moreau's work -- grotesque hybrids of animal and human, who are surgically turned into humanoids and ordered not to act in animalistic ways. And with the laws of nature being horribly perverted, it's only a matter of time before Dr. Moreau's experiments lash out.It's pretty obvious from this book that H.G. Wells was nervous about the ramifications of meddling in nature -- be it vivisection, evolutionary degeneration, or even just the idea that scientific progress could be used for horribly evil things. As a result, \\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" is perhaps his darkest, most horrific book.The first couple chapters are rather stuffy in the 18th-century style, with Prendrick fussily noting everything that's happened to him. But the creepiness begins to enter once he arrives on the island, and explodes into weird, almost dreamlike scenes once he encounters the Beast Folk, culminating in the slow decay of everything on the island.Prendrick is also perhaps the weakest link in the book. When the only other humans on the island are.... well, a mad scientist and his sidekick, you need a protagonist who really grips your imagination. But he's honestly kind of bland, to the point where any number of the beastly folk have far more presence and power than he does.\\"The Island of Dr. Moreau\\" is a dark, eerie cautionary tale about science run amuck, and only its bland protagonist keeps it from fully engaging."},{"Title":"Island of Dr. Moreau (Horror Classics)","review":"Reading The Island of Doctor Moreau for the first time was amazing. I've spent 30 plus years with every book I could find on our own ancient history trying to find out where we came from, and I can't help but wonder if H.G. Wells knew something of that history when he wrote his book. In Zacharia Sitchen's work we have the scientist Enki going off the experiment on the local animals to produce a hybrid between his species and the local ape-like creature to produce modern man. Is it merely a coincident or was Wells mining ancient cellular memories.While Enki did gene-splicing and worked with his sister, (genesis means beginnings/gene of isis) Moreau had his drunken assistant Montgomery. In the Island, the Moreau predicts that the animals will revert back to animals(mark of the beast he calls it) and they do once they see and taste blood. Is that Wells' commentary on mankind, that we revert to beasts once we taste blood(wars)? I also equated the Mark of the Beast that Wells talked about with Revelation and the dreaded Mark Of The Beast which is thought to be a computer chip to some. Maybe it's just us turning back into the beasts our creators brought us up from. Tasting blood does seem to turn us into beasts.I think this book should be read with Sitchen's work to see the parallels of how we might have been brought up from beasts by a consciousless creator to satisfy his curiosity and test his skills. How Moreau's assistant felt sympathy for the beasts and wanted to teach and befriend them. Enki was sympathetic to his 'beast creations' and wanted to save them from his brother Enlil. Enlil wanted to destroy the beasts(flood) because they sickened him and the beasts wouldn't follow the Law.Spoiler-read no further.I especially liked how when Moreau was killed by one of his beasts, Montgomery told the beasts that Moreau wasn't dead he'd just dropped his form to go up to heaven, and that the law still applied, and their creator would be watching from above. Sounds just like a priest trying to stay in power and keep the beasts, who were in the majority from killing him.When Pendrick finally gets off the island, he finds he can no longer live with the rest of humanity because he keeps seeing a shadow of the beast in their faces. Absolutely amazing book. Read it and have it haunt you for the rest of your life.When I Dream"},{"Title":"The Cultured Man","review":"I first read this book over fifty years ago as part of an honors program reading assignment.

When reading this work today, it is extremely difficult to imagine the terrible conditions these men lived under on a daily basis.Sent by the U.S. government into a hostile land that belonged to the Sioux and Cheyenne Native Americans, these soldiers built a fort along the Montana Road to protect travelers and prospectors. But harsh weather conditions and the ever-present threat of furious Native American warriors offended by the placement of this fort in the heart of their ancestor's land, eventually led to the infamous massacre.On the morning of Dec. 21, 1866, Captain William Fetterman led 80 men out of Fort Phil Kearny to rescue woodcutters under assault by Red Cloud's Oglala Sioux. Crazy Horse, among others, set a decoy trap for Fetterman and his doomed troops, and as they rode over a hill were attacked and killed to the man in a furious battle lasting about 20 minutes. This massacre eventually led to the dismantling of the fort, a Congressional investigation, and the destruction of Kearny Commander Henry Carrington's military career.When reading Brown's novel today, one realizes that the situation Carrington was forced into was an almost impossible responsibility. Fetterman and his men were not the only casualties at this doomed outpost. In fact, after reading \\"The Fetterman Massacre,\\" one realizes men died on a monthly basis, including woodcutters, settlers, prospectors and soldiers going to a nearby stream to fill water buckets.Brown's work is fascinating, and he draws from such historical documents as Army records and first-hand interviews to paint a vivid, if not heartbreaking picture of these terrible frontier wars. When one stands today at the desolate, almost gothic location of the fort outside of Sheridan, Wyoming, one can almost hear the trumpet calls, the crack of rifles and the cries of men losing their lives. The battlefield and the fort locations are almost pristine, with only a nearby Interstate visible on the far horizon.With Brown's painstaking documentation in hand, one can almost step back in time to this lonely place. And perhaps that is the strongest recommendation for this book. It recreates a time and era in frontier history that was brutal, if not alien. \\"The Fetterman Massacre\\" is an eye-opening work about a little-known moment in American history."},{"Title":"The Fetterman Massacre (formerly, 'Fort Phil Kearney: An American Saga)","review":"I found Dee Brown's book on this military history to drag a bit at the start,but by the middle of the book I was pulled in by the intensity and detail of his research.

From the cunning stealth and strength of the leader Red Cloud,to the meticuliousness and orderly fashion of Colonel Henry Carrington, who through him and sub-ordinates(Fetterman) misdecisions,led to an combined victory of Sioux,Cheyenne,and Arapaho. Dee Brown's detail and account of this pre-cursor event to Custer,should be read by every sincere western historian."},{"Title":"The Fetterman Massacre (formerly, 'Fort Phil Kearney: An American Saga)","review":"The Fetterman Massacre occurred right after the Civil War. On the Montana Road, the commander Colonel Carrington was detailed to build and staff three forts in Montana and Wyoming. The Sioux and other Indian tribes led by Red Cloud laid seige to the forts. The Indians laid a trap and when one Captain Fetterman went beyond his orders, he and his troops were killed and their bodies mutilated. Dee Brown doesn't paint a pretty picture of the Army's decision to blaim Carrington or the Indian habit of butchering people. The only one who comes out positively is Colonel Carrington.

Knowing now that Crazy Horse led the Fetterman attack, we know that he was there during these days watching each day as the fort was built. The military did a really outstanding job of planning every detail of how things were done, from building the fort with logs planed on two sides to how the wood trains would go out in two columns 100 yards apart with outriders. Using flag signals, to alert the fort as to Indians on one road or another. The Indians used mirrors to signal, and then started using flags to signal mocking the army's use of flag signaling.

In this book Jeff Roberts goes from an entry level job in a railroad (a thinly disguised Baltimore & Ohio) operating department and progresses to steam locomotive engineer. Along the way he (and the reader) learn a lot about how a railroad works, more than just the parts Jeff needs to know for his job. There's a little adventure thrown in and the time frame from entry to engineer is shrunk a bit unrealistically (actually, maybe shrunk a lot with the soldiers returning to their old jobs back in the late 1940s) but it doesn't hurt the story. I first read this book back when I was about 12 and it really stuck with me. After a forty year career as a railroader on rereading it I am struck with the realism.

However, the book reads more like a rambling rant. I'd give the book two stars if I didn't agree with much of what Johnston says.For all her credentials - Johnston has had several reseach fellowships at prestigious universities and has written 7 books on mass media - I was suprised at how poorly written this book is. Criticizing mass media is something that, I feel, requires a more balanced calm tone in order to have any affect on people. Mass media is such a built-in factor in our lives that any attempt to make us analyze it needs to appeal to our common sense, not attack us with a polemical attitude. Surely there are better books out there.Here are some of the problems I found:About the sources cited in Johnston's book: Are Ed Asner &amp; Michael Dukakis really bona fide commentators on this topic? How about Johnston's liberal use of &quot;unpublished research papers&quot; - my quotes - by media studies students? I counted 25 different student papers cited in the first 2 chapters. It's not clear whether these are undergraduates or graduate students. Many of the quotes taken from those papers are little more than the student's opinion. And then, in her &quot;acknowledgement&quot; section, Johnston merely thanks the student researchers for their &quot;insights.&quot; How about thanking all of them by NAME since they contributed so much to writing of this book? I find it really peculiar that she used student papers in this way.For a quote about how 73 percent of violent acts go un-punished, Johnston quotes an article in Harper's. Wouldn't data from the Bureau for Criminal Justice Statistics or some other official source be more appropriate? I doubt Harper's did their own data gathering to get that factoid.How about proofreading? I don't know much about M.E. Sharp (the publisher) but obviously they didn't proofread this book very well. The CBS cop show &quot;Martial Law&quot; was referred to as &quot;Marshall Law.&quot; A search engine named &quot;Havista&quot; was mentioned in the notes. I think they meant AltaVista, but I can't be sure.The book is worth reading through, if only to get an idea on how to begin thinking about criticizing mass media. Take it with a grain of salt, though. I can't suggest another book on this topic since it's pretty new to me."},{"Title":"The declining quality of teachers (NBER working paper series)","review":"This paper has captured what centuries of economics research has failed to do: understand the connection between teacher quality and economic development.

Barbizon art was mainly landscape paintings from which impressionism eventually sprang. After a brief introduction on the Barbizon movement and what made it different from the Hudson School and other landscape artists author Estelle Riback introduces the reader to four of the most important American Barbizon artists. Each of the artists, William Morris Hunt, George Inness, Homer Dodge Martin, and Alexander Helwig Wyant, get their own chapter with a detailed analysis of their influences, history, style, and the legacy they left behind.\\"The Intimate Landscape\\" is an excellent analysis of the American Barbizon movement and a recommended read for anyone interested in the Barbizon School."},{"Title":"The Intimate Landscape: A New Look at the Origins of the American Barbizon Movement","review":"An enthusiastically and unreservedly recommended addition to personal, professional, and academic American Art History collections, The Intimate Landscape: A New Look At The Origins Of The American Barbizon School by Estelle Riback offers an expertly informed and informative history and analysis of the work of American artists William Morris Hunt, George Inness, Homer Dodge Martin, and Alexander Helwig Wyant who were the late-nineteenth-century progenitors of what was to become known as the influential American Barbizon school of art. Breaking with previous American and European art traditions, these four original, gifted, and innovative artists opened a new movement in the development of American landscape painting, preparing the way for an eventual emergence of modern art in American salons, galleries, and popular culture."},{"Title":"The Intimate Landscape: A New Look at the Origins of the American Barbizon Movement","review":"\\"The Intimate Landscape\\" is \\"co-titled\\" \\"A New Look at the Origins of the American Barbizon Movement\\" and thereby purposefully connects the landscape paintings of a group of 19th Century American artists (mostly East Coast) to an established category of painting in France. Fair enough. The research on these Americans--William Morris Hunt, George Inness, Homer Dodge Martin and Alexander Wyant--is well done and their lives and works well-described. As is probably true with most books on painting, it would have been nice to have had more illustrations. But those provided in this work are representative and well enough printed, and this is a small, specialized work after all.Anyone interested in the evolution of American landscape painting will find this a valuable reference book."},{"Title":"The Intimate Landscape: A New Look at the Origins of the American Barbizon Movement","review":"THe Intimate Landscape not only provides a good review of an important period in American art, but provides insights into the work and minds of greats like George Inness, an artist who I would love to learn still more about.

Now, nearly a century later, we have a real compendium (137 articles) of the works central to this school. This valuable series complements several other pragmatist-centered series Shook has pulled together (among them, \\"Chicago Functionalists,\\" \\"Early Critics of Pragmatism\\" and \\"Early Defenders of Pragmatism\\"). Taken together, these series offer scholars an exceptionally convenient historical resource. They are part of Thoemmes Press's ambitious History of American Thought project, which aims to bring together elusive or out-of-print titles. The historical breadth of Thoemmes' project is laudable for it extends beyond works by the pragmatists to examinations of the St. Louis Hegelians, as well as early American receptions of Darwin, Hume, and the German idealists, to name just a few.There is little to criticize in this well-chosen and well-introduced series. This series is highly recommended. The books themselves are well-made and designed for long use. Footnotes (rather than endnotes) are a welcome convenience. Good-to-superb introductions and an intelligent choice of articles invite readers to witness a vibrant and multifaceted period in the evolution of several disciplines. Dewey scholars will benefit especially by many articles chronicling his examination by (and debate with) realists and idealists, as well as the way in which his views were interpreted and applied by his colleagues and students. Throughout the four volumes, the exchanges are vigorous, ideologies are varied, and the activism is unapologetic. Such a collection is available nowhere else."},{"Title":"The Great Pursuit","review":"The story of a publisher, Frensic, who convinces an unimaginative would-be author, Peter Piper, to pretend authorship of a wildly successful, pornographic novel. It's a funny book, though not riotously so: more witty and arch, or getting its humor by deflating stereotypes. Its plot is devious and twisted, but though there's sex and a riot and some explosions, it seems restrained compared to other Sharpe books. I must say I don't care much for the abrupt, highly unsatisfying ending. Start reading Sharpe with Wilt or Blott."},{"Title":"The Great Pursuit","review":"The zany plot lines and characters of Tom Sharpe are present, but the language is toned down slightly. The plot is rather summarily tidied up at the end as though the word limit was achieved and the author just decided to work into a close. Early promise in the plot was therefore not fully realised. The characters were as likely and unlikely as ever. On the whole not up to the great 'Blott', but not quite as raucous as some of the others by Sharpe."},{"Title":"The Great Pursuit","review":"I did not enjoy this book at all. It was all I could do to even finish it. I felt no investment in the characters and I never once laughed. I would never recommend this book to anyone. I didn't feel like the plot had gone anywhere until I was 3/4 the way done with the book and even then the plot wasn't very exciting or captivating."},{"Title":"The Great Pursuit","review":"I enjoyed this book. The concept is reasonably understandable, a uk publicist has a sure fire winning manuscript, who's author who wants anonimity, so installs in the authors place a writer who's willing to pretend to be the original writer so as to premote the book for the sales pitch to the USA. Sounds simple? No chance!Having already agreed, the surrogate author finds the book is not at all to his taste, and throws a wobbly!! The ensuing chaos is all you'd expect of a Tom Sharpe book, ranging from vast amounts of expletives, through to dialogue thats sharp, witty, and occasionally leaves you grasping for the dictionary. Its not Porterhouse Blue standards... but its still well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Great Pursuit","review":"All I have to say is that while reading a Tom Sharpe book in the subway you'll probably end up missing your stop. Accidentally because you are so engrossed, or purposely because you don't want to put the book down. Watch out, you might end up in an area you don't want to visit!!"},{"Title":"The Great Pursuit","review":"Tom Sharpe's one of the great British comic novelists of the last fifty years, if not the best. I've read his books, seen TV versions, and always with the same result. Raucous, bawdy, and, at times, bitingly satirical tales. This is another of the same.I'm reviewing the UK 1977 Pan Books edition.The novel falls short in the hastily fabricated ending, and I see I'm not alone to think so. Was Sharpe's own Great Pursuit to finish in a predetermined number of words? The story rushes to an end through the last couple of chapters.I think Brits would appreciate the humor more than anyone else, because it fits a comic tradition that's British more than it is American. Nobody I know hereabouts has read any of his novels. Their loss.It was a minor niggle, and odd, that Sharpe's research for the US scenes was lacking, with things such as misspelled place names (e.g. Ashville, NC) and huge errors in distance between Bangor and Tuscaloosa (2000 miles?). Maybe I'm being picky, but for me the little mistakes take away from the enjoyment. I haven't noticed those kinds of things in the other novels I've read, such as Porterhouse Blue, the Wilts, Blott, etc.But it's still a damn good read. I've re-read it a few times, and will do again. I'd recommend it, but not for a first Sharpe experience. Try Blott or Wilt first.Four stars instead of five, due only to the rushed ending and the niggles."},{"Title":"The Great Pursuit","review":"This was the first Tom Sharpe's book I read.

Pelageya Nelovna - wife of a petty factory worker Vlassov stays away from social consciousness and revolutionery movements because of the burden of her life itself. She is a representative of hundreds and thousands of workers who can only think about their work and hard ways of relaxation out of it. The change she shows with her son Pavel Vlassov who takes a different direction when compared to other people living in the workers townships and moves in the path of revolution and eventually becoming a complete part of the revolution itself inspired thousands of soviet workers lived under the capatilist society of the then soviet union. The moral charecter and support Gorky extended for the revolution was manifested in &quot;The Mother&quot;. She became representative mother country calling and supporting her children fighting for their rights. Running under the backdrop of workers township where men work till their bodies are completely tired, drink and beatup their wives and children to sublimate their frustration - mother represent the life of working class people in soviet union of later half of 19th century and early stages of 20th century. Away from political movements and social portrayal &quot;The Mother&quot; is also an excellant lyrical beauty. The events created and the detailed explanation of the backdrop in which the events occur represents creative and poetic story telling capabilities of Gorky. This is not a book to pass your time. If you like to read serious literature, if you want to read how to portray the social history in a contemporary literary work -this should be the first to read."},{"Title":"Mother: The Great Revolutionary Novel","review":"If you haven't read this moving paralell between the evolution of one man's mother and the evolution of Mother Russia you really ought to.

THE MAIN POLITICAL POINTS MADE THERE APPLY HERE AS WELL. IN ANY CASE READ BOTH WORKS IF YOU WANT TO GET A FEEL FOR SOCIALIST PROPAGANDA AT ITS LITERARY BEST IN THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY.More than one socialist commentator has noted that a revolution is made at the base of society by a combination of experiences that cause the masses to throw of their former servitude, indifference or fear and just go for it. Needless to say those times are few and far between so that it is important to study the mechanics of those changes even if, as here, they are changes in an overwhelmingly agrarian Russia that was just entering the capitalist mode in the early 20th century. I believe, as Brecht obviously did when he brought it to the theater in highly industrialized Germany, that those same sentiments would also be expressed in more developed capitalist societies when tensions reached the breaking point.Brecht has adapted for the stage this story written by the great Russian writer, and sometime revolutionary, Maxim Gorky. The story line in both cases is fairly straight forward. A working class mother not far removed from the farm is fearful that her son's Bolshevik revolutionary activities will bring disaster on him and the family. As the story unfolds and the son's commitment grows in line with the government's repressive policies the mother starts, slowly, very slowly, to get the point of his work. Along the way her own \`politics' change and by the end she is as committed to the cause as her son. Her banner is now red.On the stage this story gets told amid banners and music that add to the dramatic effect. In either format this is a powerful story and good piece of socialist propaganda. I remember an old German Communist Party member once telling me that in his youth he was actually recruited to the Communist Youth League by this play. Apparently the German CP set up literature tables in the lobby of the theater and at intermission and the end would sign up theater patrons after they had experienced the play. The book probably had the same effect."},{"Title":"Mother: The Great Revolutionary Novel","review":"Maxim Gorky's revolutionary novel, &quot;Mother&quot; is propaganda at its greatest.The story plays with emotional themes and uses common human feelings to drag the reader in while laying the ground work for a book that follows the work of revolutionaries.The book uses simple style to make it an easy read while slowly adding thicker and thicker layers of propaganda and pro-Marxist Communist theory.Writen early on in the movement, this great Russian story gives a somewhat acurate look into the lives of the factory workers in Russia around the tunr of the century.The melodramatic sentamentality, idealistic theorizing and heavy use of playing with our heart strings are the only things that keep this novel from being a 5.Well written and successful in pushing forth a doctrine for the Social Republicans, this is a wonderful and easy read. It tends to drag during certain sections but can be read without any true effort."},{"Title":"Mother: The Great Revolutionary Novel","review":"This is one really good book by one of my favorite writers Maxim Gorkij. Not the best but just read it, I know I will again."},{"Title":"Mother: The Great Revolutionary Novel","review":"Maxim Gorky's masterpiece \\"Mother\\": a talent spoiled and a good story goes into the drain. When i am reading towards the pages of the novel i began to feel like a filthy, worthless rat because all the (good) characters are out of this world. They are heroic, manly (and womanly of course)and a hundred percent perfect. But only in revolutionary matters of course. You will see that with the rest of the story casual everyday human feelings, emotions or behaviors that every single person have deal with goes into the drain also. Pavel (son) is a cartoon character that pops up with bigger than world aphorisms whenever needed. His friends are on the way to the perfection like him as in jesus and his disciples. He is some sort of new jesus but alas problem of religion is neglected and whole of it goes into the trashcan with simple, childish transformation of the soul of an religious old lady. I've read it to the last sentence and i will read it again a second time soon but only in the sake of not neglecting a huge name like Gorky. I am not unfamiliar with marxism and left, i got my share of them in my time. I am 38 years old and to this very day i tend to classify this work with other classics but now i think some of the lesser names have twice the bigger masterpieces than this.

The work explores what factors shape vote choice.A number of key concepts were developed, such as the two step flow of communication. This described the process by which \\"opinion leaders\\" gather news/information about an election and then pass this on to others, thus creating a two-step flow.The book examines other key issues such as social differences between Republicans and Democrats, ideological differences between Rs and Ds, the role of media, effects of the campaign on vote choice, the effect of being cross-pressured on vote choice, and so on.

However, what is most intriguing is the fact that Charles Dickens in some aspects suggest that sometimes hard times are circumstances that we subject ourselves and others to and whether is under ones own volition or under false pretenses.

Dickens brings several characters to life and weaves an interesting story about their interactions with each other. Most of these characters are poor and they live in a pollution ridden town where the economy is based on coal production. Dickens's description of their lives is excellent.

I reccommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"This wonderful sequel to THE CHILD QUEEN is well done. Throughout both books you get hints of the influence Mary Stewart's ARTHUR series has had on this writer. This story told through Guinevere's eyes is compelling, moving, and captures your heart from the start. You get emotionally involved with all the major characters and you will weep at the inevitable ending. VERY WELL DONE!!!"},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"I came here ready to give this book five stars because I so adored it in high school, reading it over and over--even crying at some parts. But, then I was so stunned at all of the mixed reviews here, nearly equal in complimentary and unsavory. O_oEven more confusing, if you look at the reviews for \\"Queen of Camelot,\\" which is basically \\"The Child Queen\\" and \\"The High Queen\\" combined, the reviews are nearly 100% positive with no mention of apparently how awful the latter half of the book is (at least according to the reviews here)! So, I'm not sure what is going on.Thus, until I reread it and when/if my opinion changes after, I am going with my original feeling, and giving it five stars. I don't remember ever feeling dissatisfied with it or that McKenzie was off the mark, and felt it was just as beautifully written as \\"The Child Queen\\" with follow-through that was not disappointing.I still have my copy of this from so long ago and hope to return to them once I've beaten down my growing pile of new books that are waiting for me to explore them.

Meanwhile she struggles with her agonizing love for Lancelot as McKenzie creates high drama and narrative from this ill fated love.And of course the shadow of the great and terrifying Merlin always hovers over all.The total effect creates a compelling and spellbinding epic which serves as an imposing example of the author's enthusiasm for her subject."},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"The High Queen continues the story of King Arthur from Guinevere's point of view.

Fairly standard Arthur fare. The High Queen was in much the same vein, and was enjoyable until the end. Unfortunately, McKenzie decided to make Mordred noble and likable. Then she had to figure out how to make this noble and likable character fulfill the prophecy of killing his father. The ending made no sense compared to the rest of the book - it just seemed like a slapstick comedy with horrible results."},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"This book is so sappy that ever page you turn just makes you want to drop the heavy weight book down and puke. If you like reading about a weak, horrid, dull, whiny, annoying and above all...pitiful female character with no soul, passion, or feelings but greed, this is the book for you.The High Queen is one of the worst books on King Arthur and his court I have ever read.

Thing is, I wish I never did start. Okay, so Arthur dies, and Guinevere starts crying her eyes out, but other than the visible notions, it seemed as though nothing happened at all emotionally. Nancy Mckenzie has lost the respect I had given her for such a great book and writing of the first, but this has just backed down my praises of her.

If I read how traitorous she was, I'll keep on referring back to this book and just probably end up pissed off that the other authors would make her such a disagreeable character compared to this Guinevere (if that wasn't too confusing to understand). So the bad thing was that this book has made me biased towards other Guinevere characters. Though Guinevere cried quite a bit, it was an intreguing book and the characters were interesting.

This book is pretty massive in size, size not being much of a problem for me, unless the pages were filled with utter junk and horrid language text. There is no distinct or creative pattern, this book's prequel would have standed by itself well enough if it weren't for this meaningless and tediously trite second novel by the author."},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"Where do I begin? The High Queen is a moving and powerful sequel to the awesome book The Child Queen. I am an avid reader of fantasy books, especially those based on Arthurian legend, and these have to be not only among the best, but probably the most emotionally-charged. Both books are the basic Arthurian legend as told by Guinevere, but be warned, there are a few twists, (not giving anything away), Nancy McKenzie presents her own Mordred, one who is much different from the evil bastard son most may expect. I adore Ms. McKenzie's Arthur, he is portrayed here as the great man of legend, a man who will truly bring peace and justice to the world, while at the same time the reader is forced to fall in love with Lancelot, just as Guinevere does. The true beauty of this book is that as Guinevere struggles with her love for both Arthur and Lancelot, the reader does too. WARNING: The ending of this book is so powerful, I finished it at 4 in the morning and just sat and cried my eyes out. This is the first and really the only book to really make me CRY. At the end I really cared for each of the characters and almost couldn't bear to have it all end. Even knowing the legend and what happens could not prepare me for the ending Ms. McKenzie created. I was truly moved. Please read this book and it's companion, The Child Queen. If you like novels based on Arthurian legend, fantasy books, or would like to try something new, try these. You won't be sorry, I promise!"},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"How could ANYONE not like this book! I am an avid reader, and this is the first book, EVER, that made me tear up. Guinevere, Mordred and Artur reach out of the pages and pull you into their lives, really making you CARE about them! For instance, Guinevere is a heroine that you really like, except that she seemsto say &quot;but i'm only a woman!&quot; before she goes off and does something noble or heroic. Mordred is not the evil and twisted soul that other books on Arthurian legend would have you believe. Instead, he is kind and gentle, tormented only by the fact that he MUST kill Arthur, his father, and that he loves Guinevere, who only can love him as a son. If you love Arthurian legend, and you've never QUITE bleived that Guinevere was wimpy, or that Mordred was evil, this is the book to get. Kudos, to you, Nancy McKenzie!"},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"After The Child Queen, I was sure the sequel was going to be a disappointment. I was wrong! The High Queen lives up to the promise of The Child Queen.

You have to see how the story ends. Others may not have liked some of the content, but history is not all roses and fairy tales. Nancy gets close to the actual legend of King Arthur with this story (at least as far as other books and documentaries I've read), and this written from Guenivere's point of view makes it a story worth reading. Again the characters come to life, and the betrayal that Guenivere must overcome from her closest friends is very heartwrenching. If you loved The Child Queen, you will like The High Queen"},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"I recently read the combination of Nancy McKenzie's two books, The Child Queen and The High Queen, and until recently the stories by Persia Woolley were my all-time favorites. This book is incredible. I have read this book 3 times, because it is always a wonder to me how the characters grow and the times change. The first time I finished it, I cried and was melancholy for days. This book so completely depicts all of the characters, I easily and immediately felt a part of Camelot and a part of this story. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!"},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"This was a great book. Even though everyone knows the Guinevere and Arthur story, this book managed to put a new twist on it. The depth McKenzie gives to Guinevere allows the reader to feel everything Guinevere does. There was a bit too much foreshadowing in my opinion, but with knowing the ending, it is fairly easy to pick up on. It is nice to see the story from Guinevere's view point."},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"I loved this book, but then I love all books on King Arthur. I'm not a big fan of Guinevere's, but she is sort of likeable in Nancy mcKenzie's retelling of the story. I give it one and a half thumbs up!"},{"Title":"The High Queen: The Tale of Guinevere and King Arthur Continues","review":"I read The High Queen after having read The Child Queen (it's prequel) and I could not put either book down. I am normally a very slow reader, but I got through these books faster than I have any others. I admit that McKenzie's books are not &quot;high art,&quot; but as someone who is enthralled by the Arthurian legend, I found them immensley enjoyable. McKenzie writes so that the reader often feels as though she were in the novel. I certainly found this to be true. McKenzie's descriptions of the characters and events stayed mostly true to the traditional legend while still &quot;humanizing&quot; Arthur, Guinevere, Lancelot, and all the rest. The characters became people rather than just bits and pieces of the legend. Again, I have read plenty of other books with more symbolism, meaning, and &quot;depth,&quot; but I have enjoyed no others to the extent of The Child Queen and The High Queen. I really wish McKenzie would publish another book; I would love to read it."},{"Title":"Literary Laurels: A Reader's Guide to Award-Winning Fiction","review":"An ably assembled resource for literature students, trivia addicts, and those trying to settle intellectual debates.

(Both have extensive technical book sections). This book caught my eye and I decided to browse through it. First off, I must say that in the bookstore I was &quot;wowed&quot; by quality of the content. After I got it home and started implementing the examples in the chapters, I can definitively say that this book is excellent.My goal in my book search was to find a book that explained the VB.Net language as it pertained to the VB.Net development environment. I wanted a book that actually &quot;showed&quot; me how to navigate around the IDE while explaining nontrivial VB.Net concepts and examples, and discussing the language so that I would be able to write some programs after finishing it.Some of the earlier chapters are geared to a beginning programmer (somewhat like me and even less so), yet the authors branch off and talk about relevant topics without falling off a limb. For example, in chapter 2 - &quot;Writing Software&quot;, the authors discuss data types and give numerous examples of accessing the different properties of each. When they get the the Boolean datatype, they actually go into a juicy amount of detail about binary representations and even discuss binary math. Its just a few pages in length but it is darn appropriate and gives a nice overview into the topic at hand. However, they keep it moving and move on to the next appropriate topic with their usual clarity in writing.I am now focusing on their chapter on &quot;Building Objects&quot; - chapter 4. I have to say that this chapter offers the clearest examples of classes that I have seen. Far too often I have read about classes in other books and have seen weird examples that had little to do with real life...often requiring a &quot;suspension of reality&quot; on behalf of the reader such that the reader was forced to make the leap from theory to reality. This book, on the other hand, shows me how to construct an object that I can actually relate to.So far I have not found any errors, although they do list some (minor) errata in the Wrox website. But the fact that Wrox even *has* a comprehensive website proactively listing potential errata is yet another reason I am glad I bought this book from this publisher. By the way, I found their website and located the section related to this book in about 12 seconds. The quality is in the details, and obviously somebody at Wrox actually cared about the ease of finding information about their published material.Like I said I am only on chapter 4, yet I have done a lot of &quot;skimming&quot; ahead and I eagerly await the topics in later chapters where I will learn how to build little Windows applications, make my own menus, handle errors, connect to a database, etc. Basically *all* the things I want to learn how to do. (Are they mind readers?)Excellent work."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book is for beginner programmers who have chosen Visual Basic .NET as their first programming language. It is also intended for programmers experienced in another programming language, but who are new to Windows programming.The book begins with step by step instructions on how to install Visual Basic .NET. Next, there is a brief introduction on how to write Visual Basic .NET code, and a description of what the .NET framework is. The next chapter teaches how to control the flow of applications using loops and branching structures. You will then learn how to create windows, screens, and how to add menus to your applications.Visual Basic .NET is the first version of Visual Basic to provide full object oriented capabilities, making it among the most powerful windows development tools. The book teaches you what object oriented programming is and how to use it in your applications.Chapter 15 and 16 introduce database access with Visual Basic .NET. You will learn what a database is, how to write simple SQL statements, and how to use ADO.NET to access Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Access databases. The final three chapters show how to create applications for the web using web forms, XML, and web services such as SOAP, &quot;Simple Object Access Protocol&quot;.Like all Wrox Press beginner programming books, this book is written in a clear and easy to learn manner. Each chapter contains plenty of sample code examples and an end of chapter test.If you are new to programming, or new to Windows programming, &quot;Beginning Visual Basic .NET&quot; is an excellent first step in aquiring the knowledge needed to develop Windows applications."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I am a Systems and Network Administrator who used Visual Basic 6.0 to automate many of the redundant tasks typical of this environment. I don't claim to be a &quot;developer&quot; but have been developing tools for a long time. I typically do not like WROX books but after sitting down at my local bookstore and plowing through 20 books on VB.NET, this one stood out. It has good examples that you can follow, it assumes you have basic programming/development skills and it is well written. If you are a developer by occupation this is probably not the book for you. For those of us who do not release our code to production environments this book has served me well by not being incredibly basic nor losing me in advanced topics."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I am a new programmer and would NOT recommend this book to someone else who's new. Wrox presents the intangible before the tangible and introduces concepts within concepts without explanation. An example of how the intangible is presented before the tangible is in chapter 4 where they introduce objects, classes, properties, methods, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism and namespaces(whew), but it's not until chapter 7 that they explain how to put a button on a form. Seriously out of order in my opinion. An example of how concepts are brought up without explanation all throughout the first 8 chapters (all I could stand) is how various code methods are used without referencing the big picture. What are other methods in the same class? Could some of the most common ones be listed in a glossary? I know there are a lot of them and they're somewhere in the MSDN library, but a beginning point of reference would have been nice.This was such a frustrating book that I nearly gave up on learning programming all together. I decided to give it another try and can recommend two books that present everything in a clear and logical manner. Visual Basic .NET by the \`In Easy Steps' people is the first. It's light, clear and offers a quick overview with lots of pictures. It isn't detailed, but it's not designed to be. I don't think you can buy these books through Amazon. This excellent series is available at Barnes and Noble. For greater detail I highly recommend Microsoft's Visual Basic .NET Step by Step. The book is true to name, meaning it establishes a building block approach and takes you through everything step by step. Its thoroughness is a joy. Michael Halverson understands the learning process and has a good sense of humor too. A Microsoft product with a sense of humor? Yes. It solved all my frustrations brought on by Wrox and made learning easy and fun."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book has left me with more questions than answers. I'm new to OOP and this book certainly has not helped. The book said it was for \\"Beginning programmers\\" but after chapter 3 it assumes you magically know OOP concepts. It left me flipping around the book, searching for definitions.I've purchased other Wrox books before and have been pleased in general. For some reason Wrox dropped the ball on this one. It's as if the book was written by three authors at different times and then compiled into one book, without regard for what you have or haven't already learned in previous chapters.I wish there were a rosetta stone for new beginners to make the bridge to .Net. Until then I'll be searching for a better VB.Net book."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I bought this book a few days ago and due to other commitments I have only read up to chapter 4. During this reading, I wrote out every example in the book. To my surprise, not only did every example work, but I managed to remember so much more than I thought I would. I even went as far as to debug a friends application, with no assistance from any book. My total reading time thus far for ANY .NET book has been 3 days...and my only source of reading has been this book, and the online classes reference from VB Studio.NET.I particularly like the fact that the book presents an idea, steps through the code and then details each section of code - what it does, how it works etc. This was very useful in understanding why things are structured the way they are.I might also add that I have never programmed VB in any way before, making me a total newbie at this (my only other programming language is a little bit of Perl). Even if the other chapters turn out to be rubbish (which I very much doubt), then I would still say, this has been well worth the money. I have learnt (and retained) that much.I wholeheartedly recommend this book. Go buy it."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I purchased this book 3 days ago and because of other commitments I have only read as far as Chapter 4. However in that short space of time, I did the right thing by myself and wrote every example out in the book so far (nothing beats learning by doing, at least as far as I am concerned). I must admit, having gone from a flat 0 in VB experience to now writing basic programs by myself without referring to any book or online help.Even if the remainder of the book turns out to be [weak]), the info I have learnt already has made me very happy with the purchase.I have not seen one error yet, everything works as shown and is explained so anyone can understand it.If you are new to VB.Net or programming at all, buy this book. It is without doubt the best book I have ever seen on the subject of programming. This is my first Wrox book and it probably will not be the last if this is the quality of their products. This book Wrox! :)"},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I have read many Books on the topic of Visual Basic, this one being my first foray into VB.Net. This book contains the best compilation of exercises I have seen in a beginner's book. The explanations are thorough and clearly explained. In addition, the authors appear to go to great lengths to expose the reader to a wide variety of functions throughout the lessons. I will admit that the editing staff for this book might benefit from taking an English class or two, as some of the grammar in the book is painful to read. However, in spite of the ineptitude of the editing staff I think you will be hard pressed to find a better resource for learning VB.Net. This is a how to manual, not a literary work of art. While I have noticed the poor editing, it is not substantial enough to make me want to throw the book across the room (which I have done with some books in the past). I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who needs to get their feet wet with VB.Net."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I was trying to find a book that would extend my VB6 capabilities to VB.NET especially that the language has completely changed.

It requires a little bit of experience, a good understanding of VB6 will help a lot."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"If you are a beginner to VB.NET or even a beginner to programming and are interested in creating a software application, this book will give you all the information you need to get started on this endeavor. By the time you reach the end of the book, you may have to supplement your knowledge of VB.NET by reading a few other books depending on the nature of the software application you are creating. But otherwise, if you want to buy just ONE book and learn VB.NET in under 10 days (enough to create Version 1 of your software application), this is the book for you.Why is it such a great book for beginners? It explains all the necessary concepts in great detail and in a simple fashion. No prior programming experience is assumed and the authors do a terrific job of explaining all the concepts and use good examples. The sample code can be downloaded from the publisher's website and there is an excellent discussion group led by the authors and other industry experts to answer any questions you may have on VB.NET.The book covers the following main topics - an introduction chapter, VB.NET development tool, basics of writing software, how to control the program flow, intro on objects, the .NET framework, how to build windows desktop applications, how to build web applications, how to access databases, how to access other applications using your custom application, etc.Of course, if the application you are building is a complex one, this book is NOT sufficient. You need to supplement the knowledge gained through this book with the knowledge from a variety of other books. This is the unfortunate thing with the .NET technology as it stands right now. The situation is definitely improving but it's not there yet in terms of easy explanations on how to manage the development of complex software.What struck me most about this book was the ease with which practically anyone with above average reading and computer skills can learn how to use this powerful technology. The explanations were very clear leaving almost no doubts on how to use VB.NET for developing software applications. I believe that you can get through each chapter in 1-3 hours and if you are determined to learn VB.NET in 10 days, I believe you can do it with the help of this book. You would have to spend 10 hours a day but you would get through this book by the end of the 10 days. This might be the reason why the sales rank of this book on Amazon has gone up so rapidly over the last few months.Recommended process for learning VB.NET using this book - read the book cover to cover without skipping any chapters. You can work through all the examples in each chapter or skip them if you feel comfortable that you understood what the authors are trying to convey. These chapters are organized the way they are for a very good reason, to help you learn VB.NET in the shortest amount of time and hence the recommendation NOT to skip any chapters in this book. They all cover very important topics especially for beginners. If you have any amount of programming experience - .NET in particular, you may find it extremely difficult to keep your focus while reading this book as it is too basic and covers too much material that is aimed at teaching how to program. But for beginners, this book is a blessing. Enjoy learning to program in VB.NET and good luck with your software application!"},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"I loved the sample and explanations on XML serialization as well as the topic on collections. What I didn't like was the their discussion of objects esp. the example - a CAR. It could have been much helpful if they had stick with the customer and bill classes. Overall, I can recommend this to programmers with experience on other languages, and it would help if you know already the basics of objects, as the discussion on classes will only be on Chapter 10. If you are a novice or VB beginner, I would advise you to buy a second book to support your learning together with this book. A good second book will be an Apress book.If you want a thorough OOP tutorial, buy Daniel Clark's Beginning OOP using Visual Basic 2005."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This book is excellent for beginners; it explains all steps in details.It is definitively a must have!"},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"VB is widely considered one of the easier ways to build a GUI. Its latest incarnation is described here. The authors show you how Microsoft has tweaked it into the .NET framework. The teaching pace is deliberately measured. For example, in a chapter on making menus, the steps are set up in considerable detail, with many screen captures. The authors take little for granted in your programming background.The size of the book partially reflects the many diagrams offered. Since these can be very useful and reassuring to a new programmer, it is a good thing that the authors are so liberal in furnishing them. But the size is also a measure of how far VB has come from its Basic roots. VB now has strong object oriented capabilities, and several chapters use this. More for you to learn, of course. But in the long run, it might help your coding habits."},{"Title":"Beginning VB.NET 2003 (Programmer to Programmer)","review":"This is the first time I am writing a review on a book.

A code part, with the relevant code highlighted, so that you don't have to search for it and highlight it. And then an explanation of the code.

Most of the material is covered in a superficial, rushed manner. These guys were obviously more interested in getting their faces on the book cover than teaching. If you're coming from VB5 or VB6 you'd expect to see an introductory book to VB.Net to contain at least a list of VB5 functions and their VB.Net equivalents. For example: Substr(strA, 1,3) & strA.substring(1,3)The treatment of ADO.Net is pathetic. They explain how to bind data to form controls and the datagrid, but nowhere do they cover the basics you were used to in VB5 or VB6. Like, how do you reference individual fields in records, perform seeks or finds. No guidance as to how you do edits (rs.edit), adds (rs.addnew) or updates (rs.update) like you did in DAO. No direction on how to allow for the disconnected data model implemented in ADO.Net versus what it was in DAO. Like hey, how do you determine if the record you're updating was accessed and updated by another user before you completed your update. That seems pretty elementary stuff and its omission gives you an idea how carelessly and hurriedly this book was sent to print.Setting up the datagrid for data binding is done programmatically in the book instead of showing you how to do it through the IDE which is infinitely simpler and likely the most frequent way you'll do it. No discussion of how to manipulate data in the grid. Simple but essential stuff like how do you determine which cell/row was clicked. How do you get at the Cell's data, edit it and tell the user if there was an error or even simpler: How to set the Cell & Row headers or highlight the entire row if any cell was clicked.A word about support. Forget it. You're supposed to be able to download the source for the book. I tried multiple times at different times during the day/night. My download request kept timing-out after 100 retires. Gees!This book is a bad reflection on WROX /Wiley the publisher. Is there no one doing quality control?Good quality work takes time to craft and a thoughful, empathic approach.

It starts quite simply doing a little program where you type in your name and it comes back with a 'Hello' statement. From there it goes step by step to fairly complex programming using Microsoft's ADO.NET interface to talk with SQL Server.Microsoft has established this programming evironment where everything about the language, the editor you use to program it, the utility routines you call on, the database you access has to be Microsoft product.

Nothing particularly fancy, but a little something to keep a box from being, well... just a box. To me it's a rather daunting proposition, one that involves as much luck and magic as it does skill. Marquetry, which is ithe creation of complex decorative forms out of veneer is high end inlay, and one of the true tests of craftsmanship in wood forms. Not being one to start out with something simply, The Marquetry Course was the text I finally selected as a how-to book.Metcalfe and Apps do their best to present marquetry in a stepwise basis. Text, photographs, and drawings get the point across so that the only hurdle is the fear of trying in the first play. But marquetry isn't simple even when you understand how it is done. If you want to be original, you are faced with twin challenges of design and skill, and then you have to install the design on an object which you also designed and built. No mean accomplishment.The book presents a set of traditional designs and uses them in projects. You will learn how to shade, construct, glue up, and finish each piece. Some are well past the 'amateur' level, but others are surprisingly simple. The book serves as inspiration as well as instruction, and I found a more than a few ideas that can be applied elsewhere as well. So even if you decide not to inlay that amazing rose, the book will still be a valuable asset."},{"Title":"Marquetry Course","review":"I have read this book from cover to cover and truly enjoy it.

Even the retinal pigment epithelium cells would divide only if low levels of ultraviolet are present but not too much.The sunlight is the food of the spirit. Many people fear the sunlight (full spectrum) but it does not worsen their emotional state; it just makes the suppressed fears come up to the surface to be healed.

He says, therefore, that we potentially harm ourselves when we hide from sunlight. In Light: Medicine Of The Future: How We Can Use It To Heal Ourselves Now, he explains how to utilize the therapeutic benefits of light. Dr. Liberman says that &quot;light is the basic component from which all life originates, develops, heals, and evolves.&quot; Everything that humans do is affected in some way by light. Light has been used for healing since the time of ancient Egypt. Modern scientists began recognizing the benefits of light therapy in the late 1700's. Although many people believe the ultraviolet (UV) light is harmful, Dr. Liberman maintains our bodies need at least a small amount of UV light in order to function properly. He cites studies which indicate that, due to all the ways in which we block sunlight from our lives, including wearing sunglasses designed to block out UV rays, &quot;it is possible that we are unknowingly contributing to the increased incidence of blindness and eye disease in this country.&quot; Dr. Liberman does warn against looking at the sun directly, or exposing ourselves to it between 10:00 a.m. and 2:00 p.m., but emphasizes that light is a nutrient for the body. He says people need to be outside in natural light, without sunglasses or sun block, for a minimum of one hour a day. He warns that warm-white and cool-white fluorescents &quot;should absolutely be avoided.&quot; People who cannot get outside regularly need to equip their work areas with full-spectrum light fixtures. Syntonics is the name given to light therapy, which involves utilizing specific colors for healing specific ailments. Dr. Liberman discusses its benefits in treating vision problems, seasonal affective disorder (SAD), cancer, and learning disabilities. He says that &quot;as we continue to discover and understand the role that light plays in our lives, its use as both a therapeutic and preventive tool will become more evident.&quot; Because each individual is different, Light: Medicine of the Future doesn't get into prescribing particular colors for each potential illness. It is an invaluable reference, however, for all those interested in natural healing. Extensive appendices provide sources of supplies and a listing of light therapy practitioners.Sandra I.

I am an NLP trainer, hypnotherapist but I didn't think I had many options when it came to vision for my daughter. We focused on Hypnosis to improve her sight. We now have Dr. Liebarman's books and are working on light treatments to help her.I find this book fascinating. I studied Sound therapy which also focuses on Vibration/Frequency to treat the body! Whether it is through the eyes, ears or via body - there is no doubt they work. It is finding out what frequency the body needs and applying it in a way that works best for the person - that seems to be the key. In the book, Dr. Lieberman talks about helping his mother with Turquoise light. He also refers to a lot of other dedicated researchers and their studies to prove that light treatments do work.One of the most fascinating messages from this book is the fact that we need UV Light. It is amazing how we are becoming a CREATED society vs a NATURAL society. We are now eating foods that are created, live in created environments with fluorescent lights and avoid natural sunlight and natural things in general. How we evolved to think Nature is BAD for us - is another story.I am now investigating adding light therapy for my treatments. I already integrate NLP, Hypnosis, Sound and Energetic sessions to help assist others as we balance our minds and bodies.I absolutely loved this book and will be discussing it with our metaphysics and spiritual group.

I emphasize his institutional and academic credentials because he has authored a work which has proven controversial and continues to elicit both enthusiastic praise as well as criticism 22 years after it's publication.That light and color are imbued with therapeutic properties when correctly used will come as no surprise to practitioners of Ayurveda and other systems of natural therapeutics. Our Ayurvedic sages and rishis knew and taught countless centuries ago of the curative effects of color and of radiant light, whether of the open fire or of sunlight. Light has been used for healing since the time of ancient Egypt. Western healers began recognizing the benefits of light therapy in the late 1700's and the 19th and 20th centuries have seen the discovery that sunlight is a necessary precondition to the body's formation of certain essential nutrients in such a fashion as to parallel the plant kingdom's utilization of photosynthesis.Dr. Liberman postulates that life on Earth evolved - with a very few exceptions - in such a way that sunlight is an irreplaceable component in it's nourishment; writes the author, \\"... light is the basic component from which all life originates, develops, heals, and evolves. Everything that humans do is affected in some way by light.\\"Although many believe that the ultraviolet (UV) light emitted by the sun is harmful, Dr. Liberman maintains that humans require exposure to at least some amount of UV light in order to function optimally. Citing data from a good number of studies which indicate that, due to the many ways in which we block sunlight from our lives (wearing sunglasses, \\"protective clothing\\" and headgear, sun blocking creams, etc.) designed to block out UV rays, the author asserts that \\"it is possible that we are unknowingly contributing to the increased incidence of blindness and eye disease in this country.\\" Dr. Liberman holds that most people need to be outside in natural light, without sunglasses or sun block, for a minimum of one hour a day and warns that warm-white and cool-white fluorescents should be avoided. People who cannot get outside regularly need to equip their work areas and living spaces with full-spectrum light fixtures according to the author.Syntonics is the name given to light therapy which involves the use of specific colored beams of light for the purpose of treating specific ailments. Dr. Liberman discusses its benefits in treating vision problems (the province of Syntonic Optometry), seasonal affective disorder (SAD), cancer, depression, bipolar disorder and learning disabilities, among others and writes that \\"as we continue to discover and understand the role that light plays in our lives, its use as both a therapeutic and preventive tool will become more evident.\\" For those involved in healing professionally or interested in learning to use color and light therapy, extensive appendices provide sources of training and supplies as well as a listing of light therapy practitioners.I believe this superbly written and organized book is a must read for anyone who is involved or interested in holistic healing, especially with light and color. Ayurvedic practitioners and students with an interest in what are called the \\"subtle therapies\\" will find it a worthwhile experience to learn of the copious contemporary scientific research data confirming the usefulness and therapeutic validity of some of our tradition's most ancient healing practices.Bill Courson - Sent from my iPad"},{"Title":"Light: Medicine of the Future: How We Can Use It to Heal Ourselves NOW","review":"I bought this book about 7 months ago and I have been picking it up and rereading it ever since.

These three figures have come to be important influences in Beckett's writings, and the fusion of Dante and Joyce reveals the very core of Beckett's own oeuvre. (This is the piece where Beckett defiantly stated: &quot;Here form is content, content is form.&quot; Also, the line: &quot;Literary criticism is not book-keeping.&quot;) In any case, Beckett the great prose-stylist, a healthy rival to Joyce, demonstrates his worth as a critic, perhaps the best critic of Joyce. Also, included in this book is the &quot;Three Dialogues&quot; with Georges Duthuit. This is the classic pseudo-interview that reveals some of Beckett's greatests remarks on art:&quot;Yet I speak of an art turning from it in disgust, weary of its puny exploits, weary of pretending to be able, of being able, of doing a little better the same old thing, of going a little further along a dreary road.&quot;&quot;The stars are undoubtedly superb, as Freud remarked on reading Kant's cosmological proof of the existence of God.&quot;&quot;All that should concern us is the acute and increasing anxiety of the relation itself, as though shadowed more and more darkly by a sense of invalidity, of inadequacy, of existence at the expense of all that it excludes, all that it blinds to.&quot;Superb. It's hard to imagine giving good word to Beckett. It is better to let these words trickle, slide, and coagulate on their own. As Beckett quoted from Freud, &quot;The stars are undoubtedly superb...&quot;"},{"Title":"Disjecta: Miscellaneous Writings and a Dramatic Fragment","review":"Beckett at 22. Who could write that essay at 22, but Beckett? In fairness, most of the ideas are from Joyce's mouth to Beckett's pen: but it is Beckett's pen, not Joyce's mouth that interests us. Lines scarely better than those in Beckett's &quot;Proust&quot;.The danger, after all, is in the neatness of identifications."},{"Title":"Disjecta: Miscellaneous Writings and a Dramatic Fragment","review":"This is not much of a book. It is a collection of scraps of writing done by Beckett. There are Essays on Aesthetics,Words about Writers, Words about Painters.Beckett writes about Joyce, Proust, Sean O'Casey and Irish poets like Denis Devlin, and Thomas McGreevy. The language is extremely difficult and Beckett often uses words I doubt most readers will know. Some of the essays are in French, and Beckett would not allow them to be translated. There is little to my mind which signals the great Beckett narratives which are the heart of his work. The editor of this book had Beckett's permission to bring together these pieces but it seems to me they will add nothing to Beckett's reputation."},{"Title":"Miss Media: A Novel","review":"In a literary fiction world that seems dominated by either down-on-their-lucky city princesses or anonymous White Man Angst, it's a true pleasure to read a funny, pugnacious, pointed satire about media madness, misbegotten role models, internet etiquette, big business, and the search for true love. Lynn Harris tells the fast and furious insider account of Lola Somerville (a woman you hope will be your best friend and condfidante), and her attempted road to success at a women's media empire that's more Death Star than North Star. The book is part roman a clef, part relationship guide, and part thriller, but most of all a true satire that captures the madness that was the Internet Bubble and the insanity that engulfed everyone who was a part of it -- and lived to tell the tale. Definitely grab this funny and refreshing novel, relish every last page, and share with friends!"},{"Title":"Miss Media: A Novel","review":"I say shave your legs, throw a log on the fire, wriggle into your best shorty nightie, slip in between clean, crisp sheets, pull up a snuggly cover and savor this delicious novel. Personally, I have no fireplace and seldom launder my sheets but despite any evidence to the contrary I DO shave my legs, and anyone in any circumstace would be plumb loco (that's right, I said it, plumb loco) not to LOVE this book! (If aforementioned nighties and leg shaving references imply men won't like it, wrong inference. I just like inserting the word nightie into all my reviews.)A modern-day Dawn Powell, Ms. Harris' roman a clef eerily, cheerily captures the hope, hubris, insanity, inanity of the dot.com and women's media milieus. And whether your vantage point on that arcane era is as a weathered insider or unscathed voyeur, there's plenty o' suspense, romance and jaunty insights to keep this thinking (wo)man's pot boiler bubbling."},{"Title":"Miss Media: A Novel","review":"this was such a treat to read-- the characters are engaging, the writing is clever and terribly funny, and the satire is spot-on. i can't wait to start death by chick lit."},{"Title":"Miss Media: A Novel","review":"MISS MEDIA is a wonderful, crazy, and strangely moving book.

The descriptions of its superb design and build, that made the \\"Scooter\\" a favorite with pilots for 50 years, is all here. The book reads well, is informative and I found it free of noticeable mistakes. The artwork of 20 color profiles, in many of its various plumages, by Dave Windle, is amongst the best in this kind of volume anywhere. The many photos, primarily color, are also excellent.

It's interesting now to see many of the poems from Meditations, a number of his other poems previously published at Blackbird.com, all together, situated among the other poems. In the new, broader context of Ornithologies, it's like seeing all of these poems almost entirely anew. This says something important about the poetry's ability to endure, its staying power, and about the quality and import of their content.There is a kind of grandness and still, a muscular fragility to the writing in Ornithologies, and it's a beautiful book, physically, and in content. The poems here are full and lush, and have certainly found their form and are comfortable in their bodies. There is a striking balance between the sonics, imagery and narrative, so that we are absorbed by the poems, leaving the waking world behind. The physical and spiritual worlds quietly collide in these poems, and what might seem far removed from the everyday life is brought to bear, which is to say that to read these poems is not simply an emotive, or reminiscent experience, but one that spurs one to thought. This may seem a statement to be applied to most poetry, but indeed it is the exception rather than the rule. Jarrell could have been speaking of Ornithologies when he said of Paterson, \\"The subject of Paterson is: How can you tell the truth about things?-that is, how can you find a language so close to the world that the world can be represented and understood in it?\\"Ornithologies brings to mind Davis McCombs, Gabrielle Calvocoressi, Jennifer Grotz, Jason Schneiderman, Dan Chiasson, Steve Gehrke, Jennifer Michael Hecht, Kathy Graber, and Patrick Phillips - they've all, relatively recently, written impressive first books, and that's saying something because first books are a damn tricky thing. (If you need convincing, look at a favorite poet's first book and marvel at its unsettled awkwardness compared to the poet's later work. Ornithologies would convince you that this is actually Poteat's third or fourth book.)Not to overstate it, but at a time when one cannot help but feel that poets are publishing too much, too often, and that so much of that work is tragically average and often unimportant, Poteat's Ornithologies feels significantly relevant to the reader's world, and thematically, rhetorically, imagistically, and otherwise substantial."},{"Title":"Ornithologies","review":"Be careful when reading \\"Ornithologies\\" (Anhinga Press) by Joshua Poteat. His poems are so mysterious, eloquent and downright powerful, they may ruin you with beauty. Good poetry calls attention to what would otherwise be overlooked, but the best poetry changes us. Poteat's poems succeed in showing us \\"what it means to be/honey in a tobacco pouch, the skin of God in a firefly's gut.\\"Because existence is uncertain, his narrators relentlessly name the knowable world, as if cataloging can protect us against our own disappearance. He brings us closer, not merely through a rich inventiveness, but through the narrative position itself, which is reverent of all it observes.In \\"Nocturne: For the Night Workers of the South,\\" he is a night watchman at an asylum, where \\"when it rained,/spotted-moth larva would tunnel from the wet plaster ceilings/and drink the patient's ears.\\" In \\"Our Memory, the Shining Leaves (Waterford Fair Civil War Reenactment),\\" while watching a faux battle, he focuses on a boy who \\"searches the field after the skirmish/looking for a trace of what he saw (gold button: hank of hair:/glass eye in a raven's mouth).\\"This is not a poet who needs a soapbox, but one who begs a small and gentle witness to the largest questions of existence. And his world is our world - built on a type of loss that the South can \\"understand: each thing is of itself./Each thing is its end.\\" The poems in \\"Ornithologies\\" deserve a national audience.

She runs across seventeen-year-old Sterling O'Connor at the Diary Queen. She hires Sterling to help her repair her tumble down old house. Their relationship is fraught with simmering tension comprised of sexual energy, mutual need, and affection. The small town is buzzing with stories of the two of them and when Lara is later found murdered in her bedroom, Sterling is the prime suspect.This first novel is told in flashback sequences interspersed with the present day.

She drives south, but her vehicle breaks down in Winston, Georgia. While waiting around, Lara sees an old fixer upper Victorian home that on the spur of the moment she buys.Lara drops in at the local Dairy Queen where she meets teenager Sterling O'Connor, whose attitude for a seventeen year old is refreshingly punk to the outsider. She hires him to renovate her new house. Meanwhile her new neighbors Dave and Pam Grier think that the couple is having an illicit affair and he as the district attorney wants to insure propriety occurs. However, someone puts five bullets into Lara killing her. Winston police chief Jimmy Edgars investigates the murder that has two prime suspects: Sterling and record store owner Eric Teague, who desired the Washingtonian competing with the teen.THE NIGHT SHE DIED is a strange but excellent police procedural that starts with Jimmy investigating the homicide of Lara, but is actually more of a character study that uses a murder investigation as a tool to look at the lead triangle of the victim and her two beaus. The story line is intriguing as readers learn what makes Lara tick and how the two men in her life react to her whims. Although much of the support cast fails to become much more than shadows, readers will appreciate this fine drama.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Night She Died","review":"I agree with most of the reviewers here who said this book is very well written, and is a real page-turner. It is...for the most part. However, by the time I got to page 230, I was annoyed. It seemed like the story was just going in circles. Laura Walton, the pretty new woman in a quiet, gossipy small town in Georgia, has come there to try and escape her memories of Washington D.C. Of the boyfriend who died in a horrible car accident, and the life they had together there, only to be murdered 3 months after arriving.She befriends two local men. Sterling O'Conner, a 17 year old boy with a hard life, and Eric Teague, owner of the music store who's been a father figure to Sterling ever since his daddy skipped town. Both men are attracted to Laura, but neither seems to get anywhere. There's just pages and pages of her toying with both of their emotions. Her neediness and constant cries for attention were really trying on my patience.What I most looked forward to were the chapters after Laura's murder, when police Captain Edgars was trying to put together the pieces of her death, and figure out who the murderer was. It was just such a drawn out process, that after 3/4 of the way through I started skimming to get to the who-dun-it pages. And even that didn't surprise me. I was just so relieved to finally get through the book. While the characters were all very well developed, and the story well written, the pace was just too slow for me. And the monotony of the relationship between the three main characters irritated me.Overall, I just wasn't impressed with Ms. Patrick. It was a decent book, and as much as I'd love to , I just can't give it the rave reviews that everyone else here has given it. If you love murder mysteries, then you'll probably really enjoy this book...but I guess I just couldn't get past my extreme dislike for the main character, Laura Walton."},{"Title":"Night She Died","review":"This book was one of extensive drama, detailed almost gostly decriptions of suspects and characters in book, descriptions that allow one to follow the drama of a typical small town murder, with all suspects known to simi retired, homicide investigator who moved to a small town to work without the hassle of the big city he removed himself from.

The story line pulls the reader in right away and Patrick's execution was pitch perfect.\`THE NIGHT SHE DIED' takes the reader back through a series of events that led up to the death of a woman who just moved to a small Georgia town.

The wonderful photos and the well-written text were some of the best I've encountered in mountaineering literature.I liked how Galen Rowell interspersed his account of the expedition with earlier accounts of K2 attempts, some successful and some not. They gave an interesting insight into the history of this tough mountain and the people who have climbed it. The journal excerpts from various 1975 team members were insightful and intriguing. I am now going to start on &quot;The Last Step&quot; by Rick Ridgeway, about the 1978 American K2 expedition. Apparently, this team wasn't without their problems either.I found it ironic, that after all the team discussion about the possibly negative implications of having a woman (Dianne Roberts) on the team, especially the wife of the leader, that she really figured very little in the disputes and quarrels. It was also ironic that there was still a lot of dissention and miscommunication amongst the team members on the actual expedition, even after the team expelled Alex Bertulis from the original team, due to lack of confidence in his ability to be a team player.Read it, you won't be disappointed. I gave it a four because I found the first couple of chapters hard to get into. But once the '75 team is formed, it picks up quickly and then is quite hard to put down.Unfortunately, Galen Rowell, the author of this book and a well-known photographer, recently was killed in a plane crash near his home in California with his wife."},{"Title":"In the Throne Room of the Mountain Gods","review":"The laundry in this expedition gets aired in this book. This seems to be the book that the movie K2 was based on. A lot of the characters and events are similar. Rowell gives a lot of historical background from other expeditions to K2. Rowell writes this novel from his perspective, but he also uses the diaries from the other expedition members to tell the story. He also gives the perspective from the porters point of view, however, it seems like he is mostly guessing what the porters feel and think and I've never like that from a ethnographic point of view. Considering the trouble the expedition had, it's a wonder that any of them wanted to return. Some of the best photographs of the region are shown. Galen is great photographer."},{"Title":"In the Throne Room of the Mountain Gods","review":"Most mountaineering books chronicle successful ascents.

Rarely does a book bring together pictures, text and feeling as this one does. Along with Pete Boardman's Shining Mountain, I rate this among the best mountaineering books out there. This one is destined to become a cult classic"},{"Title":"In the Throne Room of the Mountain Gods","review":"The photos make this book a classic, but the story is also very interesting and well written. The human dynamics of a failed attempt on one of the most intense mountains in the world create a story that chronicles an important part of mountaineering history.

Therefore I found the book very interesting and well written. I thought the author was very objective in explaining their adventure. Also the historical background that he gave was very helpful. The pictures were outstanding. The need to become more familiar with geography was very stimulating. I was very disturbed however at the volume of criticism that was directed towards the porters. After all the climbers were intruding upon their country and into their ecosystem. And in actuality the porters were doing the majority of the work for the expedition, and they the porters, and the country, were expected to bend over backwards to do everything possible for the expedition. And when you look at it seriously the climbers were nothing more than extreme playboys living off of other people's money and in other peoples country. Granted, however, their endeavors certainly were extreme and exciting."},{"Title":"In the Throne Room of the Mountain Gods","review":"This is an interesting book that describes the expedition and personal relationships during to their attempted K2 bid."},{"Title":"Seasonal Guide to the Natural Year--Southern California, Baja: A Month by Month Guide to Natural Events (Seasonal Guides)","review":"At last, a book that allows you to see what will be happening at a destination at the time of year you will will there.

I'd say the average rating at this point, 3 1/2, is a bit high. This is an average book. I can see where it *might* be of benefit to some users, but it has always seemed to me surprisingly short on details. There're some good explanations of things but in my view they tend to be overviews. In three years of use, I don't think it's solved more than two or three problems, and they were not of any great consequence. The CD-ROM included with the book has been of no help. The book strikes me as having been written by a number of people without a real focus. IMHO it's more like a dictionary or reference, and its focus is like them.I think slightly higher of Mansfield's book, Windows NT 4 Workstation. At least, it has some more practical and easily useful info that's easier to read. Norton has a book on this subject, but I have no idea of it's quality. If you're into networking and the server side of things, try Mark Minasi's Mastering Windows NT Server 4.

Or what if you run NT at home and don't have a system administrator? This book touts itself as if it's the book FOR system administrators and then it tells them to &quot;see their system administrator.&quot; (ayeeee!)Thank god I'm just a programmer, not a sys admin and thus only disappoint myself when I can't find the answer.

The invisible newcomer, eventually dubbed \\"The Friend,\\" soon became a fixture in Henry and Emma's existence, staying around for over 50 years in the role of trusted confidante and teacher.He gently led the couple on an odyssey of self-discovery and spiritual understanding that changed them for the better and altered the course of their lives.In the late 20th century, spirit guides abounded in a variety of media-friendly forms - from the articulate and intellectually appealing Seth of Jane Roberts to that bombastic ancient, Ramtha. By contrast, the Invisible Friend was a quietly patient, unassuming presence who was unfailingly kind, down-to-earth and, most importantly, effective.Mental-health professional and new author Laryssa Nechay was a visible friend to Henry and Emma, and knew them well. She tells their story from the viewpoint of a skilled psychotherapist with a wealth of clinical experience. Her story shows graphically how Spirit can and does teach, act, and influence our mundane lives from the unseen world.She gives a realistic assessment of the couple and provides her own insights into the dynamics of this spiritual-world/\\"real-\\" world type of relationship.It is a quiet read, and probably will be slow-going for many, but as a first-time effort I give Nechay a grateful five stars for bringing us this insightful look at one couple's gradual awakening."},{"Title":"Invisible Friend: A True Story of Spiritual Initiation","review":"After reading \\"INVISIBLE FRIEND\\",I truly believe God has BLESSEDthe Nechay's with PERFECTION in Understanding and Helping toheal others. \\"INVISIBLE FRIEND\\" \\"Truly Amazing\\" And I Thank Youso very much for SHARING.

I had identified with Henry and had begun, for instance, to learn definitely not to judge myself.

It's also fun to read.Once you've wet your feet a little (excuse the metaphor), if you want more, this is an excellent book to own."},{"Title":"Being Colloquial in Esperanto: A Reference Guide","review":"I'm quoted on the back of the dust cover as writing, in another review: \\"I would say that this is a book which should be on the shelf of every serious American (and other English-speaking) Esperantist, and I cannot recommend it highly enough for those who want to move from the status of beginner to that of expert.\\"I'll stand by that, but go a step further: Despite this book's basic purpose (to help the English-speaking reader understand more about Esperanto), and despite the fact that it's definitely not a textbook, I would say that it's actually possible to learn the language from scratch via the first half of this book. Not for everybody, of course, but for the committed individual who is willing to plow through 118 pages of great (though never excruciating!) detail about Esperanto, its grammar and its word-formation system without drills or exercises. The fact that Jordan has a terribly dry sense of humor, which he doesn't hesitate to share with the reader, makes this relatively painless. By the time you reach the end of that first section, you should have a full command of the language, except, perhaps, for vocabulary (and I use the word \\"perhaps\\" advisedly, because at least half of those 118 pages are given over to a multitude of examples of usage, and you should be able to pick up a pretty good vocabulary just from those).Oh, and if you want to increase your vocabulary beyond this (and you should), don't forget to read the second half of the book, \\"Potentially Troublesome Words,\\" in which you'll find much more detail about those words in Esperanto that can mislead the English-speaking student, as well as the words you ought to use instead.Note: Jordan's (not overlong) lists of transitive and intransitive verbs that will cause trouble for English-speakers (because in English the transitive and intransitive versions of the verb are identical) should be studied and memorized by every American student of the language.

He peppers the book with humor and with wordplay (even the title gets a chuckle) and shows himself the linguist that he is in everyday life. There is much which is fundamental in the book, and yet there are curiosities and rarities that one might find elsewhere only with great difficulty, and these serve to whet the reader's curiosity and lead him on to the next chapter. I loved this book and in a personal letter to the author (before the advent of e-mail) I let him know that my only criticism of _Being Colloquial_ was that there was just too little of the book. Is a mouse the polar opposite of an elephant? In Esperanto, it might be! Jog your grey matter and have fun doing it -- and learn the language which has been, for over a century, the most universal and successful of all planned languages.

Only for his personal idol Neruda would Octavio get involved with politics, but he pays quite a price after Allende's reign falls; thugs of Allende's opponent Pinochet abduct and torture his wife Salome to frighten Allende supporters and to personally make Octavio pay. After Salome is rescued, she, Octavio and their children receive political asylum in Sweden.Salome visits Dr. Samuel Rudin, an expert on post-traumatic stress syndrome. Samuel has his own troubles as his French Jewish parents never mentally escaped the Holocaust though they fled to Peru before Hitler's invasion. His wife Kaija also has parental issues as her parents sent her to the safety of adoption in Sweden during WWII. Samuel and Salome have a brief affair, but the doctor knows it's wrong and ends it.Two decades later, Salome is asked to testify against Pinochet. With Samuel dead for years, she turns to Octavio, whom she still loves, asking him what she should do as she fears repercussions.SWEDISH TANGO is an intriguing look at family vs. society told by the perspectives of Salome and Octavio. The story line is at its best when it places an Ayn Rand lens on societal ethics against personal loyalty and safety. When the tale spins into a possible second chance romance, it still hooks readers interested in what happens to the lead couple, but also loses its deep thought provoking philosophical questions on the needs pf an individual and a family against the demands of deadly leadership and a nation.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Swedish Tango: A Novel","review":"(Alyson Richman read at the West Side YMCA as part of the Writer's Voice Visiting Authors Series on October 1, 2004. This is from my spoken introduction that evening).In \\"Swedish Tango,\\" Alyson Richman covers, through tales of personal devastation and resurrection, the tragic political upheaval of Allende's Chile, the sad, and to most of us I'm sure sadly obscure story of Finnish War children, and the complexities of survivor's guilt through the eyes and heart of a man only part of whose family escaped pre-war France. With these enormous events as backdrop, she manages to at the same time delicately navigate two larger-than-life relationships; relationships whose paths are heartbreaking in their small details and particulars.Because of the ambitious cutting back and forth from story to story, from decade to decade, it would be easy for the author to lose the reader. Yet Ms. Richman never loses her firm grasp on each character On the contrary, that seeming device keeps the reader focused on the people involved--flawed, admirable, impetuous, passionate, and all too human. With an true artist's hand, she allows you to eavesdrop on them--their conversations, which sound like actual people talking, the way people who know each other, deeply talk to each other, even when they are speaking of events so much larger than themselves. They stay, in today's vernacular, real.With each choice the characters make, with each turn of the plot, you find yourself leaning forward with them, urging them on, hoping that the choices they make do not destroy them, and fearing for them, as they encounter circumstances beyond imagining. But we don't have to imagine. Alyson Richman has wonderfully captured the richness of these people in \\"Swedish Tango,\\" and their stories echo and reverberate long after the last page."},{"Title":"Swedish Tango: A Novel","review":"If you haven't discovered the author Alyson Richman, you are in for a real treat. Every book that she has written is a very special jewel including Swedish Tango. The details speak of the research, thought and artistry of this author.

I am a city person by birth, and I was surprised at how many of the themes of this book I could relate to. I not only learned a lot about life on a farm; I also learned about life as a teacher. The concept of farming and teaching going hand in hand was an idea I was not fully able to appreciate until I started reading these thirty-four, creative nonfiction essays.Each author and text is unique, and yet common themes unite every narrative, making this an almost flawless collection. Some of my favorites include \\"Reading and Writing the Land\\" by Michael Carey, \\"Addicted to Work\\" by Linda Hasselstrom, and \\"The Way the Country Lies\\" by Douglas Bauer. I was pleasantly surprised, for instance, by the amount of stories these authors shared intimating sneaking off to read books as children while everyone else worked on the farm. Like many other people who grew up in urban areas, I always imagined farm children as constant workers who spent all their time helping elders.Many other surprising, stereotype-exploding scenes populate this fine book of nonfiction. After reading the work of these contributors, almost all of whom have won awards for both their teaching and writing, it would be impossible for someone to fall back into the stereotype of thinking that a person from a farm is somehow less cultured or educated, as demonstrated by the credentials of the contributors, which range from U.S. Poet Laureate (Ted Kooser) to former Pulitzer Prize nominee (Robert Higgs).Jack has done a wonderful job editing and artfully introducing his collection (check out \\"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Farmer Hyde\\"), as each essay flows effortlessly into the next one and unusually fine author biographies precede each essay. The personal essays, memoirs, and literary journalism anthologized in \\"Black Earth\\" are so thoughtful and at the same time so down-to-earth that it was easy for me to forget that I was also learning a great deal about agriculture as I read. The book's illustrations, drawn from Bob Artley's nationally syndicated \\"Country Things\\" cartoon series, make for a delightful bonus.This would be a great text for teachers, farmers, and students of the land, as well as a general reader interested in farm and ranch life past and present. In a time when farming is a dying art, it's wonderful that a book like this has reestablished the beauty and artistry of both farming and teaching and has perfectly demonstrated why the two go hand in hand."},{"Title":"Black Earth And Ivory Tower: New American Essays From Farm And Classroom","review":"Compiled, organized and edited by Zachary Michael Jack (Assistant Professor of English, North Central College, Naperville, Illinois), Black Earth And Ivory Tower: New American Essays From Farm And Classroom is a compendium of articulate, informed and thoughtful commentaries on modern farming, teaching new generations of time-honored agrarian values, and critical accounts of shifting national priorities as America continues the trend of expanding urbanization and declining small farm agriculture. Professor Jack brings a special insight and sensitivity to the issues addressed having been raised on an Iowa farm that his family first settled in the early 1860s. Also available in hardcover (1570035881, $59.95), Black Earth And Ivory Tower is a highly recommended addition to community and academic library Agricultural Studies, Farm Life Studies, and Social Issues reference collections."},{"Title":"Winter harvest,: A novel","review":"Long renowned for her historical fiction, British author, Norah Lofts, turned her hand at a work of fiction based upon the heartbreaking and tragic story of the Donner Party, a group of nearly ninety individuals who, in 1846, set out for California from Missouri, taking a new route that obliged them to cross the Sierra Mountains. They were to find themselves trapped high in the Sierra Mountains by a bitter, winter cavalcade of storms and relentless snow. This desperate group of pioneers, who saw their numbers reduced by nearly half, finally resorted to cannibalism in order to survive. Their tragic story is the inspiration for this book.In this book, the author leaves behind the English countryside where so much of her historical fiction takes place. Ms. Lofts, instead, turns to the American West, where in 1846 a small party of pioneers, meet up at a lonely outpost, Fort Mason. There, they learn that one of the parties, led by Kevin Furmage, a well to do businessman, is going to try a new route to California, believing that such would shorten the traveling time. The others are intrigued by the opportunity to shorten their traveling time, and, one by one, they elect to join Mr. Furmage's party of three.Mr. Furmage now finds himself accompanied by four other parties: the Smiths, a family of five now joined by a Mr. Cooper, an invalid, the Warrens, a family of five, the Glennys, a party of three, and that of Madame Jurer, a party of five. Together, this motley, rag-tag group intends to break new trail to California through the Sierra Mountains. What they will discover is that this new trail would break them. Beset by desert thirst, Indians, flood waters, loss of their oxen and their food stores, as well as snow storms high in the Sierras, which would leave them caught in its drifts, and bone piercing cold, this disparate group of people would have to resolve their differences and band together in order to survive. Their survival, however, would come at a price that they would never have believed that they would be called upon to pay.This is an interesting tale that will engage those who enjoy well-written historical fiction.

It covers all aspects of setting up a LAN Party from the small friendly gathering to a large professional event. It covers all of the technical aspects as well as all of the social and logistic issues that each type of LAN Party must deal with.

One of the core problems that I see with the book is it's take on networking. It has a tendency to give misleading descriptions of certain topics. The demonstration of making cat5 cable has one of the ugliest cables I've ever seen.Discussion of managed switches and VLANs as an alternative to routing? VLANs create virtual lan segments. In order to connect VLANs you need a router. For large scale LAN parties the only benefit you'd obtain with VLANs is that VLANs won't forward broadcast traffic from one VLAN to another.. even then, you'd need a router to connect the network segments, which doesn't forward broadcast traffic by default to begin with.Also in talking about hosting large groups the author suggests routers as the primary solution because of CSMA/CD problems. Collision problems occur on shared media environments from situations where you say.. used only hubs for your large network. Switches filter traffic based on MAC addresses and are pretty good at alleviating excess traffic. The only potential problem with switches is in regards to broadcast traffic, in which case a router to split up your LAN here and there would help that problem. However, routers are generally much slower than switches unless you are willing to shell out major amounts of cash.CROSSOVER cables!? The author needs some help here. Uplink ports on a hub or switch are just ports that have already been crossed over. You can use that port for regular computers if you use a crossover cable (since it will turn the uplink back into a straight-through) OR you can connect switches/hubs together using it and a straight through. Crossovers can additionally be used with normal ports on a hub/switch to connect them together."},{"Title":"LAN Party: Hosting the Ultimate Frag Fest (ExtremeTech)","review":"Overall, not a bad book.Does an excellent job of compiling all the \\"arcane\\" knowledge of how to plan for a LAN Party.

I believe that the writer would have at least recommended some other books on the subject or maybe some online references.There are some very useful tips on how to keep your LAN Party guests entertained and I am sure to utilize them on a LAN Party being planned.Definitely an excellent reference for a \\"noob\\".

But within the developed countries, it has spawned a subculture of twitch computer gaming. It has elements of the video arcades, post-1979 Space Invaders. But those were usually single player games, or turn-based two player games.Now Steinmetz writes for so-called LAN Parties. The book has a lot of gritty hardware and software details. Especially, of course, how to network a bunch of computers together. Assigning IP numbers, using routers and switches etc. All the way up to configuring a large room for 63 players.Note how wireless barely gets a mention in this book. Correctly so. While WiFi is hugely popular to a general audience, here its bandwidth is too small. You need wired connections.Future historians and sociologists might also find this book useful. Aside from the technical details, Steinmetz helpfully documents this subculture on a contemporaneous basis.

It is an excellent overview of events and provides a good framework and context for additional reading. If you have not taught African decolonization before you will find this a valuable resource. If you are not teaching and have a general interest in the subject, this is also a good introduction. However, if you are teaching, or have a deeper interest in the subject, you will have to do additional reading, because this book is only good as an introduction to the topic. You are not going to find any in-depth discussions about anything: culture, society, political actors, etc. Obviously that is not the book's purpose, so I really shouldn't criticize it on those grounds. It is clear, straightforward and to-the-point and might be a good book to assign for students as well. Especially since it is short, but covers so much information.Professors who have been teaching these subjects for years, however, will not get a lot out of this book, I imagine, since it is a basic overview.

Not long afterward, Nicky's hooligans realize that Joey knows they killed Sonny. Not wanting to commit a homicide so soon after the previous one, the Mole mob hire Joey as a chauffeur to keep an eye on him until they can decides how to dispose of their new employee and the eye witness.JOEY DEE GETS WISE is an intriguing urban crime Noir without a professional sleuth. The story line grips the reader with its dark look at life in the city contrasted against the gala of an Italian Feast (those are worth the trip to the Big Apple). Except for Joey and the mean streets of New York, the support characters feel more like caricatures out of the New York Italian stereotype handbook.

Or, if you have diabetes or insulin resistance, Dr. Isaacs will clearly explain what is happening inside your body, in a way that is easy to understand. If you have hypothyroid or hyperthyroid, Dr. Isaacs tells you what's going on and what to do about it.It includes information on hormones, metabolism, insulin, the &quot;glycemic index&quot;, androgen disorders, the thyroid hormone, cortisol, stress, the adrenal gland, the growth hormone, hunger hormones, and more. Many of the issues he discusses seem to go together, like pieces of a giant puzzle, but he makes it very easy to follow along. And ... this is the best part ... Dr. Isaacs suggests simple ways to help balance your hormones once and for all!The letters after Scott Isaacs' name are: M.D., F.A.C.P., and F.A.C.E. Those letters represent: M.D. - Doctor of Medicine, F.A.C.P. - Fellow of the American College of Physicians, and F.A.C.E. - Fellow, American College of Endocrinology. Endocrinology is the study of the endocrine gland, hormones, and metabolism. The criteria for obtaining the F.A.C.E. designation can be found at: http://www.aace.com/college/criteria.phpThe criteria require that the doctor be actively practicing and be a member in good standing for at least one year ... in addition to other requirements. In other words, Dr. Isaacs is a licensed medical doctor, who is actively practicing in the specialty area of endocrinology, which is the study of hormones and metabolism. These credentials make him a fine expert to learn from.This book is so easy-to-read, and contains such important information to our overall health, that EVERY woman should read it! If you are considering this book, buy it!"},{"Title":"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","review":"Scott Isaacs with Todd Leopold, Hormonal Balance (Bull, 2002)Scott Isaacs' diet book is not the kind of thing people pick up, flick through, and try. Which is a shame, really. Hormonal Balance doesn't just hand you promises of \\"lose this much weight in this much time\\" and cover it with a thin scree of what looks like science. In fact, the science behind the diet covers the first three hundred pages of the book. Thick reading for the diet book crowd indeed.Another difference between Isaacs' book and most of the others is that Isaacs, when talking about the various hormones, what they do, and what problems deficiencies or excesses may cause, is not afraid to let the reader know when he's heading out into uncharted or controversial waters. For example, many diet books tell you to get away from aspartame, but don't bother to tell you why. They don't tell you this because much of the research on which they're basing that advice has been debunked, or was never scientific in the first place. Isaacs, on the other hand, is more than willing to say when something he's talking about hasn't been tested on humans, or is still in the hypothetical stages. This leads to more of a sense of the ability to trust the man; always good when looking to someone for health advice.The book's difficult going, but not too much of a bear. Hormonal Balance is written not to be read by other endocrinologists, but by John Q. Public, and Isaacs never forgets that the average joe knows nothing, or less, about what he's on about. The end result is a readable book about a subject many doctors are still in the dark about.As for the diet itself, it's far more of a common-sense thing than most of the popular diets of the past thirty years; balanced food, lots of fruit and vegetables, egg whites or egg substitute, as much diet soda as you want (finally, someone willing to concede that not all soda is packed with sugar and calories!), etc. The kind of thing you'd probably be doing, if you didn't have that all-consuming obsession with chocolate, ice cream, that sort of thing.

I was amazed to learn the connections between your everyday health, metabolism, and hormones. It was wonderfully enlightening!"},{"Title":"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","review":"At first I thought that this book was useful.. It turned out to be a MUST-HAVE for everyone! A great resource and instructional book for almost every aspect of a human being's health! Although people always tend to comfort themselves that nothing's wrong with their health, sometime they suddenly find out that they have been having a hidden, serious problem that they should consume not less than a billion medicines to cure.This books helped me spot the reasons why I had several but minor problems which my mother always tried to convince me to believe that I'm a perfectly healthy person. Now, and with the help of Hormonal Balance, I discovered and was able to reach the specific health problems I've been having for the last 15 years and how will I be able to overcome them.Highly recommended!Special thanks and appreciation to Dr. Scott Isaacs who seems to have put a lot of effort in bringing up such a perfect solution book!"},{"Title":"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","review":"A wonderful book that I will always keep.

If that delicate balance is disrupted, due to excessive alcohol or caffeine, for example, or eating too much of the wrong kinds of foods, etc., then the effects should be obvious: irritability, nervousness, moodiness, depression and anxiety, and other conditions. Women should find this book especially useful, since it candidly discusses the causes, effects and corrections of PMS and menopause. This book is just as much for men, too. Mr. Isaac is convinced that obesity is the cause as well as the result of a poor, deficient dietary and exercise regimen. Reduction or elimination of lipids (fats), decreased sugar, counting calories sensibly, monitoring weight and maintaining exercise are all detailed in a way not found in other books. The eleven chapters perfectly over the 397 pages is one of the best literary, medical and wellbeing investments that can be readily purchased today."},{"Title":"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","review":"I was somewhat disappointed with this book on a number of issues. Whilst I do not doubt that the author is an excellent endocrinologist, I do really think he should stick to what he knows best.I was expecting a layman's guide to how our hormones work. Instead I got drawn into a lecture on nutrition and positively cringed at some of the misinformation, such as don't chew your food thoroughly as it will cause an insulin surge - simply untrue as slow eating has been proven to improve satiety over a longer period.And telling us that saturated fats cause cardiovascular - again not true as meta analysis has proven this to be a fallacy.That coconut oil is unhealthy - it's positively one of the healthiest oils going!That we need to drink at least eight 8oz glasses of water a day. A fad which can lead to dangerous overdrinking of water. Fluid intake from watery foods and other incidental drinks when thirsty is the more natural way to proceed.And so on.A lot of the information in the book in now common knowledge - e.g. on insulin resistance - or very dry and off track. In the end, I just couln't continue reading any further and put the book down a third of the way through."},{"Title":"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","review":"The most comprehensive book I have read thus far on total hormones.Easy reading, easy to understand.

Good technical information in easy to understand terms. Appears to be very thorough. However, his dietary recommendations are lacking. Good, healthy nutrition does not include such things like processed foods and artificial sweeteners. There is so much good nutritional information available that never made it into this book."},{"Title":"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","review":"I read Dr. Isaac's book cover to cover and found it not only informative, but fascinating and easy to read. He make the highly complex endocrine system easily understandable in layman's terms, and his writing is very conversational and straight-forward. He has an open-minded approach to endocrinology, meaning that he understands there's not always a one size fits all approach to treatment. Patient lab results are a good baseline, but patient input and symptom description is also important. For this reason I made an appointment with him and was equally impressed with his bedside manner - he listened - and his thorough review of my case history. He even went as far as requesting all of my previous records from other doctors who I've seen for thyroid disease. The book covers all the hormones, their roles, and the various illness that can result from improper balance. His diet recommendations are very sensible and easy to follow. I'm looking forward to trying some of the recipes in the book and the diet section has inspired me and given me ideas to include more fruits and vegetables in my diet. For the first time in several years I feel optimistic that a) I understand what's going on in my body, and b) I've found a doctor that cares enough to work with patients until they are well enough to enjoy life without worrying about chronic health problems. I too was a bit concerned that he's not an Armour thyroid fan like so many of us who've felt better on that drug. I thought it would be my panacea based on internet research, but instead it seems to be doing more harm than good. And the way he explained his thoughts to me on that topic made perfect sense. He supports the use of Armour for patients who do well on it, but it must be prescribed properly and carefully monitored. I would recommend this book for anyone with weight or other endocrine or metabolic disorders who wants to understand the role of hormones in the body in language that's clear and easy to understand."},{"Title":"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","review":"I was enjoying this book until I came upon the Thyroid section where he stated that natural thyroid meds, like Armour, are actually dangerous and should not be used if you can take a synthetic version, like Synthroid.

This is not true, as many many people, including myself, take it everyday and feel great instead of taking the synthetic stuff.I was shocked to read that."},{"Title":"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","review":"A must read for anyoone going through menopause and considering bio identical hormones.They changed my life and this doctor has many more helpful facts in this book."},{"Title":"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","review":"I haven't read the book but wanted to comment on the person who said he's misinformed about Armour's. Perhaps this is something he didn't explain clearly. I'm an RN who is also a homeopath and clinical nutritionist who no longer practices but does copywriting and consulting in holistic medicine. When possible, it is best to take something closer to nature. Armour's, in my opinion, is preferable when it is indicated - but it isn't always indicated. Armour's comes from a pig. So for a vegetarian, it might not be a good choice. But it is what makes it more bioidentical to a human. However, it is higher in T3 than T4, the active form of thyroid hormone. It also contains the other forms of thyroid hormone that we don't know much about. Which you would think is a good thing. But for some people, it's too much T3 and they do better with T4, hence Synthroid. While Synthroid is synthetic, it is still bioidentical. If someone is taking too much T3, it causes hyperthyroid effects - increasing heart rate and blood pressure. I would suspect this is what the dr is referring to when he says it can be dangerous. A hyper state can also cause bone loss and many other problems over the long term. Some people do best with one over the other while others may actually do best on a combination."},{"Title":"Hormonal Balance: Understanding Hormones, Weight, and Your Metabolism","review":"This has been helpful with questions that I have had.

The limited proteins will leave you hungry no matter how many trips you make to the salad bar. And let's face it, without the dressing--you're only allowed two 1/8 tsps of oil per day--you're not eating dry salad for long. And no one is eating much more than two pieces of fruit a day without suffering the consequences. This is a one-size-fits-all diet for a population that is not all one size. My own minimum daily requirement of protein is 70 grams, which is more than this diet allows and I'm a small framed woman. With this diet, you can't help but lose weight. You'll be starving.

Kindness is a way of life, a way of being. The author points out techniques to learn to be kind by empathizing with others and as well as techniques to learn how to be kind to yourself (an aspect of kindness that many people overlook). Not just content to explore kindness, she also explores the enemies of kindness and how to keep them at bay. If you want to change yourself and change your world you can't go wrong with this book. &quot;A Short Course in Kindness&quot; is a recommended read."},{"Title":"A Short Course in Kindness: A Little Book on the Importance of Love and the Relative Unimportance of Just About Everything Else","review":"Kindness is not wimpy, not &quot;nice&quot;, not for the faint of heart.

There have been a few titles in my lifetime that I have given to the people in my life who are closest to me. &quot;A Short Course in Kindness&quot; has joined that list. Buy this, read it, and then live it in your day to day life - you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"A Short Course in Kindness: A Little Book on the Importance of Love and the Relative Unimportance of Just About Everything Else","review":"The first thing that struck me when I read this inspirational little book was Forrest's proactive definition of kindness. Kindness is not an insincere compliment or an empty \\"call me if you need help.\\" Kindness requires us to give something of ourselves. It doesn't have to be a huge sacrifice, either. It is one part empathy, one part compassion, one part charity. Kindness is giving the perfect gift without the holiday.But more than telling us what kindness is and isn't, Forrest inspires the reader to be kind. She does so most powerfully by seeding her pages with first-hand accounts of the effects of kindness on every day people like you and me. For this reader, these stories conjured memories of kind acts that were bestowed upon me, reminding me how a smile or a hug at just the right moment got me through some of my most painful experiences. Surely, I thought to myself as I read, these are things I could do for others.And that is my favorite part about reading A Short Course in Kindness. The feeling I come away with that kindness is inevitable. It is in our nature. Despite the horror that the news media report to us every day, examples of people being kind to each other abound. I wish this book was required reading!Forrest's writing style is warm and humorous, and she isn't afraid to share her own painful experiences. The chapters are short, yet quite moving. I find it makes for great reading whenever I catch myself with a few minutes to spare. I'll read a few pages at bedtime, click off the light, and slip off to sleep feeling peaceful and optimistic.

If you are philosophically inclined and if you have ever devoted some time to exploring the subject of kindness, then I believe you'll find this book as unchallenging as I have. I lost interest in it almost completely by the 40th page and struggled with it through the end. On the other hand, if this subject is new to you (you have neither really thought about it nor read any books about it), then I would recommend it, because it offers some ideas not encountered in everyday conversations. I would even guess that people who read a lot would not like it, because the subject of kindness is explored through literature too.I gave it a very low rating because:1. I think that the content of the book does not nearly justify the price of 10 $(130 small pages with not much substance)2. the author has no advanced knowledge/ideas on the subject and adds nothing new to what is already out there.

The latest anthology centers on alternate history and like the other collections includes a wonderful spread of tales covering a what if scenario on a wide range of eras and events written by mostly famous authors. All fourteen stories attain a high quality including those from lesser-known writers.

Historians, and history buffs have enjoyed the pioneering work of the 'What If'(c) series. In the 'What If' series, eminent historians put to use their knowledge of people and situations when confronting crucial historical events in which the results could in all probability have turned out very differently. The series pioneered the genre of 'alternate history'(sadly misused in this books title) and set a standard of excellence in scholarship. Turtledove's title 'The Best Alternate History Stories ot the 20th Century' is so misleading as to be a great dissappointment to whomever accidently buys this book. (This book is one of the reasons I miss flipping through the pages at the local bookstore.) This book is not alternate history, by any standard. It's science fiction through and through. I'm not particularly fond of science fiction, so I'm not qualified to judge this book by its merits as science fiction, but I suspect that the reason this book has rated as highly as it has, has more to do with the tastes of science fiction fans than that of history buffs."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"If the title of \\"The Best Alternative History Stories of the 20th Century\\" is truly accurate, then there must be a shortage of great stories in this particular subgenre. To start with, there are a total of only 14 stories in the 415 pages of text. Two of them, Ward Just's Civil War time travel saga \\"Bring the Jubilee\\" and Brad Linaweaver's Nazi nuclear victory space exploration story \\"Moon of Ice\\" take up close to half of the book.The rest are a mixed bag. Allen Steele's entertaining, \\"The Death of Captain Future\\" was my personal favorite, but it read like straight science fiction to me, I couldn't detect any \\"alternative history\\" in it. Most of the others feature history changes that are trivial (Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"The Lucky Strike,\\" Susan Shwartz's \\"Suppose They Gave a Peace\\") or just not enough of a twist to be truly interesting.

I like to read AH in order to gain a better understanding of what really did happen in history. One of the ways to understand what did happen and why it happened is to examine what might have happened but didn't. Unfortunately this collection of stories offers no insights into historical events and besides that the stories are dreadfully boring. I have never heard of any of the authors before, other than Larry Niven and Turtledove himself. Their stories are not good either.Here are the first five stories:The lead-off is THE LUCKY STRIKE, a ludicrous tale of a conscious-tortured American bombardier on the Hiroshima A-bomb run who intenionally misses the aiming point and incenerates an empty forest instead of the city. The idea is ridiculous because:A) Nobody on the plane knew enough about the atomic bomb to know what its effects on Hiroshima would be, yet the bombardier is tortured by the \\"atoms and x-rays\\" obliterating the city. The bombardier wouldn't have known what an x-ray was.B) The idea that any American serviceman would be bothered by A-bombing a Japanese city is dubious. All knew that the Japanese tortured and murdered captured Americans, especially B-29 crews, by the thousands and butchered civilians in occupied countries by the millions. To Americans soldiers and airmen, killing Japanese was the moral equivalent of killing snakes. I personally know one of the men who flew the Hiroshima mission who has written his own book with an entire chapter explaining why dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima was necessary. He and the other men who fought the war would probably vomit on reading this puerile story.THE WINTERBERRY is a story I read three times without comprehending what it was about.ISLANDS IN THE SEA is a Turtledove extravaganza that opens with a boring monologue about something that happened with Islam during the middle ages. I've read over a dozen Harry Turtledove books and liked everything else he's written, but this one is a snore job.SUPPOSE THEY GAVE A PEACE is a long-winded diatribe having to do with somebody's recollections of the Vietnam War. I read it a couple of times without comprehending what it was about. I lived through that time and should have got the point, if there had been one.ALL THE MYRIAD WAYS is a cliche'd hack story by Larry Niven about billions of timelines resulting from time travel.The only story that's even marginally readable is Ward Moore's novella BRING THE JUBILEE. However, this turgid story is nearly 60 years old and is based on time travel, an unsatisfactory device for conjuring up alternative histories.Trying to read this garbage will either give you a headache or make you want to throw up."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"It is a very good book.Some of it may not be exactly A/H but it's close enough interesting enough and certainly written well enough by all of the authors to be called Very Good A/H.I won't go into detail about all of the story's because there is enough on the books page that describes it well, however I will say that I found Niven's &quot;All The Myriad Ways &quot; a disturbing but new way for me to look at parallel universes and good enough for me to say it is the best story in the book (to me)."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"Harry Turtledove introduced me to the whole alternate history genre way back in the early nineties with The Guns of the South, his brilliant take on the American Civil War. Turtledove is all over the alternate history map with books that even include aliens invading Earth during WWII, and the like, but my other favorite of his, Ruled Britannia, sees William Shakespeare using his writing skills to motivate the populace to overthrow their Spanish oppressors. It is only fitting then that Mr. Turtledove is the editor of this collection of some of the alternate history stories considered to be the best ones written last century.The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century includes fourteen stories (one of which is 100 pages long) that offer \\"what if\\" re-imaginings of everything from the dropping of the atomic bomb on Japan, to George McGovern's Vietnam-era election victory over Richard Nixon, to Shakespeare lost in the New World and living with an Indian tribe, and on to more commonly-themed tales involving a German victory in World War II and a Southern one in the Civil War.The longest, and oldest, of the stories (\\"Bring the Jubilee\\") dates to 1952 and the most recent (this collection was published in 2001) was written in 2000 - with the majority of the tales having been first published in the eighties and nineties. Some of the more recognizable author names are: Harry Turtledove, Kim Stanley Robinson, Larry Niven, Greg Bear, Poul Anderson, and Ward Moore.My personal favorite is one of the more oddball ones in the collection, a story by Nicholas A. DiChario called \\"The Winterberry,\\" in which John F. Kennedy survives the head-wounds he suffered in Dallas on November 22, 1963. It is a touching tale of innocence, family love and loyalty, and overwhelming sadness. Even if you never read another alternate history story, I think the ones like this one - the non-military themed ones - will appeal to most any reader. And, who knows? You just might find yourself intrigued enough to read others in this fun genre."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"This is a perfect example of what happens when an author farms out his material. It was not good at all."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"The title of this book itself merits some analysis, before even going further into examining the stories themselves:\\"The best\\" - well, as you will see below, it is really not the case for most of them...\\"alternate history\\" - not always; at least one of the stories is mainstream (and very good) SF;\\"stories\\" - two of the \\"stories\\" are actually shorter versions of novels\\"of the 20th century\\" - to clarify things, the stories were indeed all written in the 20th century, and some are placed in XXth century, but many of them treat other time periodsAs for the stories themselves, here are my impressions (with as little spoilers as it was possible):\\"The lucky strike\\" by Kim Stanley Robinson. The story is linked to the first nuclear attack against Japan (we learn it on the first page so this is not really a spoiler). It is very well written and a good read, no argument there. But it is also - in my modest opinion - the MOST BIASED and the least satisfying in the whole anthology. Author looks at the situation in July 1945 in Pacific with the eyes of a far left peacenik from the 70s and as a result the whole story horribly and - in my modest opinion - unfairly insults a great American soldier, brigadier general Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. (1915-2007) and a great American president, Harry S. Truman (1884-1972). The last two pages are so incredibly stupid and naive that I laughed out loud. I will not reveal more, but if after reading this short story you feel like agreeing with the author, I propose you to watch a great Japanese movie \\"Japan's longest day\\" (1967) and/or read the extraordinary book \\"Hell to pay: Operation Downfall and the invasion of Japan 1945-47\\" by D.M. Giangreco. They are I believe a sufficient rebuttal to Mr Robinson's views.\\"The winterberry\\" by Nicholas A. DiChario. This story is connected to the Kennedy clan and I will say nothing more about the plot. It is a short, sad and very well written tale, which I am certain you will enjoy. Is it however really alternate history? Well, a little bit certainly - but I would rather consider is as mainstream literature, just with a little surrealistic twist.\\"Islands in the sea\\" by Harry Turtledove. The great master of alternate history can do no wrong, so this is another very good story. In the first paragraph we learn the time and place of action - 769AD, just after the fall of Byzantium to the conquering Arabs, in the Balkans, among the still pagan Bulgars (today we would say Bulgarians)... Nothing more will be said on the plot. Very well written, very erudite (Mr Turtledove is a recognized expert on Byzantine history) but the idea of the great Greek city falling to the Muslims already in VIII century makes it a rather sad reading to any Christian (like me)...\\"Suppose they gave a peace\\" by Susan Schwartz. A really VERY interesting story about the Vietnam War and the peace movement between 1968 and 1975 with a really sharp shock coming in the second part. The title is a variation on pacifist slogan from the 60s \\"suppose they gave a war and nobody came\\" - and towards the end you will understand how intelligent this title is...\\"All the myriad ways\\" by Larry Niven. I usually like very much Larry Niven works but this is a very poor story. At the end I was like \\"Duh?\\". Also it is not really an alternate history story, but rather... well, here I admit that have a problem - I do not really know what this story is about. It is however also mercifully short - only eight pages and half...\\"Through road no whither\\" by Greg Bear. It is about two German officers traveling through occupied France and losing their way. For the life of me I could not find any alternate history motives in this one either. It is also a very poor story but once again, thanks God, it is really short - even shorter than the previous one.\\"Manassas again\\" by Gregory Benford. Here there is some alternate history in the distant background but this is mostly a story about a war of humans against robots. A rather dull read - if you skip it you will not loose anything.\\"Dance band on the Titanic\\" by Jack L. Chalker. No, sorry, contrary to the title, \\"Titanic\\" does not figure in this story, which is focused on a point in which many alternative realities interpenetrate and enter into contact one with another - and also about a business company which profits from it when in the same time providing a quite useful public service to all the worlds concerned. Not a particularly great story, but certainly better than the three previous ones.\\"Bring the jubilee\\" by Ward Moore. This is a very long short story, which later was expanded into a novel under the same title. I must admit that once I realized it, I stopped reading this story, after about 30 pages, so I can read later the novel without knowing how the whole thing ends. The story is centered about the second most enduring fantasy in the whole alternate reality genre - the victory (or at least survival) of Southern Confederation against USA in the War Between The States (1861-1865). Here, already on the first pages, author adopts, somehow irrationally, the view that this Southern victory would break not only the rise to power of USA but even the whole development of our planet - and as a result in the 30s in XXth century the plane was still not invented and the cars are a luxury reserved to the most obscenely rich billionaires... Well, after all may be this is not so strange after all, considering that the author was born and grew up in New York and after that spend most of his life in Chicago, and so is a full blooded Yankee...)))\\"Eutopia\\" by Paul Anderson. A very interesting description of an alternative North America, which was colonized between X and XV century by the Vikings coming from Greenland and the Magyars (Hungarians) coming from Siberia, both of them clashing with native Amerindians. The story occurs long time after those struggles in a time when the three cultures learned to coexist, developing even a common syncretic religion - and I almost died laughing when I noticed what is the composition of the Holy Trinity in this religion...))) As most of works of Paul Anderson this story is quite good and already figured in some other anthologies. The final solution is however rather disgusting.\\"The undiscovered\\" by William Sanders. THE JEWEL IN THE CROWN! The best story of this whole book! In the end of XVI century, in a world ALMOST exactly like ours, Cherokee Indians (important notice - William Sanders is himself a Cherokee Indian)living in what will be one day North Carolina raid a village of their hated enemies, the Tuscarora nation. The returning war party brings amongst the captives an Englishman, who was previously captured and enslaved by Tuscarora - he is the first white man the Cherokee ever saw. Now this Englishman is not just an ordinary guy, but I will not say anything more about him to preserve the surprise - however be assured that the mutual cultural shock between the Cherokee and their prisoner is one of the best and merriest stories I read in a very long time. I was reading this story in the subway and at one moment people started changing places to go away from me, because I was wildly laughing with tears running from my eyes! This story is quite dangerous, because later that day I had an attack of uncontrollable laughter during a business meeting and then again during family dinner at home - and both my boss and my wife were VERY unhappy with this! Once I was done with this story I immediately looked up William Sanders on internet and I am going to buy more of his works very soon.\\"Mozart in mirrorshades\\" by Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner. This is a story about an inter-temporal colonization, in which a private venture somehow like Indian Company colonizes parallel worlds in various stages of pre-industrial development, using technological superiority to subdue and exploit them. As the result of conquests the destiny of some of the historical figures changes and in one of those worlds, where the colonization occurred in XVIII century, Mozart is reduced to be an unqualified worker... The story is not bad, with some interesting twists and it could be worth to develop in a full scale novel.\\"The death of Captain Future\\" by Allen Steele. Here bad news is that this is definitely not alternative history but the mainstream SF - good news is that this story won Hugo Award and it REALLY deserves it! It is the second best story in this anthology. It is extremely well written, with a very clever plot and has many interesting twists and surprises and at least three very touching and well developed characters. A real pleasure to read!\\"Moon of ice\\" by Brad Linaweaver. This story treats the FIRST most enduring fantasy in the whole alternate reality genre - the victory or at least the survival of Third Reich in WWII. This is never a comfortable topic but here it is treated quite successfully (at least in the beginning) by the author. The story takes place in 1965, it begins the day of Hitler's state funerals and has the form of diary written by Goebbels himself. The first half of this story is not bad, but then it turns weirder and weirder - towards the end I felt more and more like in the old \\"Wolfenstein\\" computer game. The finale is simply ridiculous, at least to anybody who has even the slightest understanding how totalitarian regimes function, or even the smallest knowledge about Third Reich security apparatus and its hold on the population and the country.Conclusion: all in all it is a three star book. The two best stories (\\"The undiscovered\\" and \\"The death of Captain Future\\"), both already classical, are widely available in other, probably better anthologies - as for the rest it is a mixed lot, with the good and the bad in equal proportions."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"Overall, this collection is great. I just tackled all of it in the past two nights. The only problems I have with it is that it isn't entirely made up of alternate history. At least half of it is time travel or alternate dimensions. While a few of these are still enjoyable, such as \\"All the Miriad Ways\\" and \\"The Death of Captain Future\\", they shouldn't be in the book. But this really isn't too bad, because most of us AH buffs are into Sci-Fi too.But, that's the only problem I have. I was brought to tears at the end of \\"The Lucky Strike\\", and am still pondering over \\"Suppose They Gave a Peace\\" and \\"Manassass Again\\". IF you like AH, you're probably gonna love it."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"It is a very good book.Some of it may not be exactly A/H but it's close enough interesting enough and certainly written well enough by all of the authors to be called Very Good A/H.I won't go into detail about all of the story's because there is enough on the books page that describes it well, however I will say that I found Niven's &quot;All The Myriad Ways &quot; a disturbing but new way for me to look at parallel universes and good enough for me to say it is the best story in the book (to me)."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"This is a mostly enjoyable collection of innovative stories, but the title of the anthology is far from accurate. Of course anyone can argue about what the \\"best\\" stories are in a certain category, but the bigger problem here is that this collection is not entirely Alternate History (AH). This is surprising for a collection compiled by Turtledove, who of course is one of the great practitioners of that genre. This appears to be an editorial challenge as the publisher may have requested a collection applied to the \\"category\\" of AH, only to reveal that this is a very difficult label to define. Some tales like Jack L. Chalker's \\"Dance Band on the Titanic,\\" Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner's \\"Mozart in Mirrorshades,\\" and others are merely time travel stories with the familiar don't-alter-the future theme. \\"The Death of Captain Future\\" by Allen Steele is a fun story but an inexplicable addition to this anthology, as it is straight sci-fi without the slightest hint of AH.The stories that really are AH are high quality and make this collection mostly a success, but they only make up a distressingly small percentage of the book. In fact, the story of his own that Turtledove contributes to this book (perhaps suspiciously), \\"Islands in the Sea,\\" is one of the best and actually sticks most closely to the supposed theme of AH. Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"The Lucky Strike\\" is surely a classic of straight-up AH, while the most enjoyable story here is William Sanders' \\"The Undiscovered,\\" a comic tale of Shakespeare trying to put on a production of Hamlet with an adopted tribe of New World Indians. Rest assured that most of the stories here are good and even great, but the title of the anthology is not entirely accurate."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"Sorry, but I was expecting something better.Some of these stories are very good; in particular, &quot;The Winterberry&quot; by Nicholas DiChario, &quot;The Undiscovered&quot; by William Sanders, &quot;The Lucky Strike&quot; by Kim Stanley Robinson all deserved to be included.&quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot; by Ward Moore I personally disliked, but it was definitely one of the most famous alternate history works of the century so I suppose Turtledove almost had to include it. However it is more a short novel than a story, and takes up almost a quarter of the book, so if you have already read it then this is pretty annoying.&quot;Moon of Ice&quot; by Brad Linaweaver is just awful, the one really badly written story in the book. Otherwise the quality of writing is good to excellent throughout.On the other hand quite a few of these stories are not what I would call alternate history. Certainly not &quot;The Death of Captain Future&quot; by Allen Steele, a fine story by a fine writer but straight space-travel science fiction without any alternate history to it at all. &quot;Mozart In Mirrorshades&quot; by Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner seems to me more of a time travel story than alternate history.As a general science fiction anthology this is not bad at all. As a collection of stories having to do with alternate realities it's also okay. The best alternate history stories of the twentieth century? I don't think so."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century (2001) has fourteen stories and an introduction by Harry Turtledove. The introduction is an excellent review of the genre and the stories themselves are gems that have long been buried in moldy magazines or ancient -- to the younger fans -- anthologies. I have encountered several of the stories, but others were entirely new to me.Robinson's The Lucky Strike has the Enola Gay crash on takeoff. DiChario's The Winterberry has JFK live through the shooting in Dallas. Turtledove's Islands in the Sea has Constantinople fall to the Muslims in the 8th century. Shwartz's Suppose They Gave a Peace has McGovern winning the presidency. Niven's All The Myriad Ways has humanity facing the realization of a probability multiverse where all uncertainities are resolved in each and every way.Bear's Through Road No Whither has the Nazis winning World War II...temporarily. Benford's Manassas, Again isn't really alternate history so much as cyclic history, with robots instead of Negroes. Chalker's Dance Band On the Titantic has an intercontinual ferry boat. Moore's Bring the Jubilee has a historian accidently disrupting the timeline so that the Union wins the Civil War. Anderson's Eutopia has a universe in which Greece never declined.Sanders' The Undiscovered has Shakespeare captured by American Indians. Sterling and Shiner's Mozart in Mirrorshades has 18th century Europe invaded by contemporary American culture. Steele's The Death of Captain Future is not so much an alternate history as the story of the birth of a folk myth. Linaweaver's Moon of Ice has another story of the Nazis winning WWII, but with a future much more different than they imagine.Some prior reviewers have pointed out that not all of these stories are alternate history. I must agree with this in two cases (see above) but the time travel stories do impact subsequent events to produce an alternate history and the intercontinual travel stories are tours of other histories. These stories could be classified differently but history is a prominent theme in ALL of them.This volume could have been titled \\"Some Representative Stories About History From a 20th Century Perspective\\", but you couldn't get all that on the spine in any reasonable size type. The publisher probably had something to do with the \\"Best\\" part of the title.These stories are not history per se, but they demonstrate some truths about history. They make you think about the consequences of accident and error, suggest that we can't ever know all about the past, and question whether we are any good at predicting the future.This volumes, and others like it, remind us that the past is unchangeable, but is also the source of today and tomorrow. Do we really know what our options are? Read and consider.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"There are some very good alternate history tales, some that are not so good and a few that seem to be less alternative history as merely action stories in another time. Three long stories stand out: THE LUCKY STRIKE - how the US dropped the bomb, won the war, and spared Japanese civilians. BRING THE JUBILEE manages to include the Civil War while still maintaining a small shred of credibility by starting in the 20th century. MOON OF ICE is one of the best Hitler Wins stories ever written. Unlike other tales in which the world is a giant slave camp, civilization evolves and Germany evolves along with it. ALL THE MYRIAD WAYS has my vote for the best short story.A few are downright silly - SUPPOSE THEY GAVE A PEACE about the election of George McGovern. MOZART IN MIRRORSHADES is likewise unworthy of conclusion. One is struck that perhaps the most important event of the last century - the Russian Revolution & the advent of Marxist dictatorships - is strangely absent. In sheer numbers of people affected and human beings killed for ideology, nothing else comes close. All in all, a good, uneven collection."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"I guess I'm too avid a reader of \\"alternate history\\" to expect to find anything in an anthology of previously-published stories I haven't read several times before, and that's the case here. But are these the \\"best\\"? Yeah, some of them. Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"The Lucky Strike\\" certainly is, and so is \\"Moon of Ice\\" by Brad Linaweaver, and Jack Chalker's \\"Dance Band on the Titanic\\" is one of my favorites. But Susan Schwartz's \\"Suppose They Gave a Peace,\\" while it's a pretty good story, was published less than a year before this book was compiled, which simply isn't enough time for any story to become a classic. Others really don't seem to fit the theme: Larry Niven's \\"All the Myriad Ways\\" is an exercise in philosophy/psychology in which alternate history plays only a small, background role. \\"Mozart in Mirrorshades,\\" by Bruce Sterling and Lew Shiner, while also a good story, is time travel, not alternate history, and Allan Steele's \\"The Death of Captain Future\\" has nothing to do with it at all. I think Harry also made a mistake by including Ward Moore's truly classic \\"Bring the Jubilee,\\" which is a novella, not a short story, and takes up a quarter of the book; that space would have been better allocated to one of the pieces from _What If_, or some other story from earlier in the century, since Moore's is the only story that predates the late 1960s, and most of these were published only in the 1980s or later."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"As a sub-genre of science fiction, alternative history looks at what might have been rather than what might be. As Harry Turtledove points out in the introduction of this book, it is a genre that can trace its origins as far back as the Roman historian Livy, but it is only in the past few decades that it has come into its own, with variations ranging from straightforward \\"what if\\" stories to ones where time travelers create (or are transported to) alternate futures through their intervention.Many readers familiar with alternative history tales might quibble (as some have in the other reviews) with some of the selections that Turtledove and Martin Greenberg made for this collection. Regardless, this book offers a good sampling of tales, ranging from an alternative account of the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan (Kim Stanley Robinson's \\"Lucky Strike\\") to what might be considered the first cyberpunk alternative history story (Bruce Stirling and Lewis Shiner's \\"Mozart in Mirrorshades\\"). What makes this collection worth owning, though, is Ward Moore's classic novella \\"Bring the Jubilee\\", one of the first (and possibly still the best) tales based on a Southern victory in the Civil War. Moore's story alone makes this book a must-have for any fan of alternative history, and a good read for anyone who enjoys science fiction."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"A few really good choices of classic examples are here, such as &quot;The Lucky Strike,&quot; but too many of these stories are either only vaguely altenate history or they lack the credibilty necessary for fiction based on conter-factual speculation. I recommend the collections Roads not Taken and the Way It Wasn't, both more to the point, and of course, the essay collections What If One and Two. And of course, great alternate history novels abound- why not start with Pavane, by Roberts and The Alteration, by Amis? Nothing in this collection ranks in the same category with them."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"All around, this was a very good collection of short stories. Not all were especially memorable, and some were not even really alternate history: both of the stories \\"The Death of Captain Future\\" and \\"All the Myriad Ways\\" (which contains one of the best endings I have read) were excellent, but neither was alternate history. I could see how \\"All the Myriad Ways\\" made it into this collection, as it dealt with alternate worlds, but there were others which had no place in such an anthology. Don't get me wrong; most of the stories in this collection were enjoyable, some even unforgettable. There were a few poorly written, disappointing stories, but these were by far the minority. One warning: Many if not most of the stories have appeared in other places, so if you hve read many anthologies of alternate history, you may want to just get this title from the library."},{"Title":"The Best Alternate History Stories of the 20th Century","review":"Don't get me wrong. Most of the fourteen stories contained in this collection ARE good, but all too few of them are really alternative history (AH).Certainly, \\"Bring the Jubilee\\" and \\"Moon of Ice\\" belong in this collection, being pioneering works in the genre (though long-time readers of SF - like me - will have come across them before). The dated writing style of \\"Jubilee\\" (written in 1952) actually adds an air of authenticity to it. One might, however, argue it's not a short story, but a novella - it takes up nearly a quarter of the book.\\"The Lucky Strike\\" by Kim Stanley Robinson, and \\"Islands in the Sea\\" are solid entries. \\"Islands\\", by Turtledove himself, is possibly the best AH story in the book. \\"Suppose They Gave a Peace\\" is refreshingly subtle. \\"The Undiscovered\\" is also an interesting little tale that fits well in a collection such as this. And Poul Anderson's \\"Eutopia\\" explores an alternate America from the viewpoint of an inter-dimensional traveler in a similar vein to his Time Patrol books.The remaining stories, however, roam farther afield.Greg Bear's \\"Through Road No Whither\\" is a great mystical story that contains characters from an alternate history, but is not really an AH tale itself. \\"Manassas, Again\\" contains AH references, but they aren't integral to the story. And \\"The Winterberry\\", while excellent, might better be classified as a part of the \\"conspiracy theorist\\" genre.Three stories, \\"Dance Band on the Titanic\\", \\"Mozart in Mirrorshades\\" and Larry Niven's \\"All the Myriad Ways\\" (the best of the three), are about inter-dimensional travel rather than the histories of those alternate dimensions.And Allen Steele's \\"The Death of Captain Future\\" concerns neither alternate history nor timelines, but is a mainstream SF story.

Not this one.In this story, Doyle does not try to incorporate the deductive reasoning of Holmes, and he has created a very believable and interesting character who tells the story from the first person. \\"I\\" is not only hypnotized by a woman but his mind is at times completely taken over by her. She even forces him to pledge his love for her. Through sheer force of will, he is able to counter her control but never for long. After he tells her that he hates her, she makes him do and say things that make him look like a lunatic. And then...Short. Fun to read. And like I said, this story works because it really is a departure from the Holmes character and doesn't need Holmes to make it work.What can I say but I liked it?"},{"Title":"The parasite (The acme library)","review":"Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is, of course, best known for his Sherlock Holmes and Professor Challenger characters. What is much less well known is that Doyle was fascinated with spiritualism and the paranormal. Indeed, his fascination may well be categorized as a morbid obsession to find proof of existence beyond the grave dating from depression which began after the death of his wife, Louisa, in 1906. Doyle's readers, at least, can be pleased with the results. His futile efforts at quasi-scientific exploration of paranormal phenomena provided fodder for an enormous number of short stories and novellas that could hardly be more different from the focused attention on data and facts - it only counts if it can be seen, felt, observed and measured - that is seen in the Sherlock Holmes canon. These little known stories, exemplified by THE PARASITE, can best be categorized within the horror genre.Austin Gilroy, a physiologist, is a realist and is firm in his belief that the paranormal is hokum. On the other hand, his friend, Professor Wilson is a dyed-in-the-wool true believer and, with a view to convincing his skeptical friend, introduces him to a \\"skilled\\" psychic, Miss Penclosa. Despite his rejection of her amorous advances, Gilroy is maddened to discover that he is falling under the power of Penclosa's abilities and that he is being forced into the humiliating position of unwilling and subservient love slave to Miss Penclosa. And he is positively horrified to realize that he is contemplating the mutilation and murder of his current fianc&eacute;e with a vial of sulphuric acid.THE PARASITE is an enjoyable novella that can be comfortably devoured in a single sitting and atmospheric literature that exemplifies Victorian behaviour and beliefs. The story itself, while hardly up to the grisly standards of 21st century horror, is typically open-ended and, like so many Twilight Zone episodes, leaves the reader with a pleasant feeling that all is not as it seems and any number of possible resolutions might be imagined.Highly recommended if you'd like to sample some Arthur Conan Doyle writing that is well off the beaten track! Those readers interested in pursuing more of the same might explore the anthologies ROUND THE FIRE STORIES and THE HORROR OF THE HEIGHTS.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The parasite (The acme library)","review":"Aside from the Sherlock Holmes stories, Arthur Conan Doyle also wrote a series of science fiction novels around the character of Prof. Challenger.

The story is a typical Victorian novel using antiquated words which needs constantly looking up in a dictionary. It is not one of Conan Doyle's better works. It lacks imagination, wit and character development but there's only so much an author can do in 56 pages.SPOILER:The worst part about this story is the ending. It is one of the biggest anti-climaxes I have come across. It would be so very convenient for all heroes if the villian just up and died. That's what happens in this story. The villian simply dies of exhaustion and everything becomes alright. It is probable that Conan was working under size restrictions but a writer of such great works as Sherlock Holmes should have tried harder."},{"Title":"The parasite (The acme library)","review":"The Parasite is one of the best stories I have read by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle that is not of the Sherlock Holmes variety.

It gets out of hand and the professor finds he has taken on more than he can handle. She has him under her spell and it quickly goes down hill. The story is told in such a wonderful way that you find yourself almost pleding with the main character to get hold of himself, to stop what he is doing and run away.

The narrator is an independent minded female in her mid-twenties who lives in the 1700s and chooses to become a vampire as a way out of her restrictive times. She thinks being immortal will give her freedom. The story isn't sensationalist in the least - no real sex or gore to speak of.....so if that's what you're expecting, you should look elsewhere. This work is not a masterpiece but not junk either. The historical overviews were interesting and the plot kept me reading on. Theresa (the narrator) is a remarkable protagonist in this genre - she is unique in that she wanted to become a vampire and doesn't have any subsequent moral dilemmas over this choice. In fact, her only moral issue occurs as a vampire in a situation with another vampire (Mara) who Theresa believes gave humans too much info on their kind due to her empathy with them and vampire guilt (we're talking strains of &quot;Angel&quot; here). Theresa does feel guilt over her handling of this situation and spends the rest of the story trying to make amends. It was disappointing having Theresa's character sell out and become the repentent female type.

The next day as he returns to his London home, he encounters her walking on a lonely road and seeing the peril that she could fall into, takes her to his best friend Henrietta(Hetta) Silverdale's house. So begins a comedy of errors and misunderstandings as Desford tries to find Cherry's grandfather and avoid scandal.All the main characters were very likable and even the baddies give the reader a chuckle. One of the biggest problems with this book is that I believe that the novel may have benefited from being shorter because there were parts of it that I was not bored with but certainly not interested in. A prime example of this is when Desford sets off to find Cherry's grandfather. The long descriptions of the journey there and back were somewhat tedious and I was impatient to hear more about the main characters not about road travels, broken wheels and horses going lame. Another part of the story that was not as well handled was the romance between the two lovers(sorry I will not tell who these are, you will have to find that out yourself). Not enough time was spent developing that story line and the reader is left to fill in their back story. By the time they get together, you are happy for them but its hard to feel very invested because you are not given the opportunity.It wasn't all that I thought it was going to be but it was not bad at all. Something tells me that this book is not Georgette Heyer at her best. All in all an entertaining read."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"While I'm a fan of almost everything Heyer writes, this one was vastly amusing. It's filled with busy plot where the hero attempts to be just that: a hero to laud, all without compromising Charity or himself in the meantime. And of course, we cannot forget about prior romantic connections, the expected behavior of a gentleman, or the comedic lenghths at which the hero must travel to honor his word. The conflicts and characters all add up to great entertainment."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"This is one of the author's later Regency romances (her next-to-last one, in fact) and while it's not nearly her best, it's not bad at all. It could also practically be titled \\"Regency Road Trip.\\" Charity Steane (but who prefers to be called \\"Cherry\\") has the misfortune to be the daughter of a con man and wastrel who essentially abandoned her to a private school when she was small -- and neglected to pay the bills. Charity was eventually packed off to the country home of her aunt, who saw her as a source of free household labor and treated her abominably. Having taken all she can stand, Charity packs her old portmanteau and sets out on foot for London, to seek assistance from her grandfather, who had cut all ties with her father. However, though she's nineteen, Charity looks and acts much younger and has almost no experience at all of the world. Cut to young Viscount Desford who has been visiting his parents and is also on his way back to London. He sees Cherry trudging along the road and, being both a gentleman and a Good Person, picks her up for her own safety, promising to escort her where she's going. When Granddad (who wasn't expecting company) is discovered to have gone off to the country himself, Des is stuck with the bewildered and panicky girl, for whom he now considers himself responsible. What is he to do with her while he tries to locate the old man? He can't take her to his own home -- people would talk. So he conveys her quickly to the home, not far from his parents' place, of his very old friend, Henrietta Silverdale. Nearly ten years before, Des and Hetta had been the subjects of a parental conspiracy to get them married off, which they had successfully resisted, but they've remained very close and have frequently come to each other's rescue. So Hetta will look after young Charity while Des pursues his quest for her relief.That's the set-up, somewhat reminiscent of a Hollywood-style romantic comedy, and it works very well. The supporting characters are equally well drawn and the action is more pall-mall than usual in Heyer's work, as Desford, playing the gallant knight errant, hares off to Harrowgate and Bath, interviewing reluctant servants and dealing with rebellion on the part of his own butler and groom, whose sense of the social niceties are more rigid than his own. The pattern you would expect, from experience in reading Heyer's books would be for Des and Charity to discover their feelings for each other in the last chapter, but -- well, I won't give the ending away. But it's an enjoyable weekend's read."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"I'll admit it openly and unashamedly: I am a Georgette Heyer fangirl. Anyone who knows me, knows that I simply don't read romances or chick lit, so this admission is a rather earth shattering.I have been a Heyer fan, since that day in the library when, ever searching for something to recommend to a precocious early teens reader, our local librarian Jill turned to the other librarian Mary and said, \\"How about Georgette Heyer?\\". Mary, the Heyer reader, decreed that was an excellent idea, and lead me through the stacks to the H's, showed me the row of Heyer's novels and recommended one. It was love at first read. Since, I've tried other \\"Regency\\" authors, but my addiction is to Ms. Heyer, not to the genre of Regency Romance.Ms. Heyer was excruciatingly historically accurate (to the annoyance of her critics) and filled her books with as much of the language and flavor of Regency England as she possibly could (another sore spot with critics). For a teenager with Asperger's, a predilection toward British history and a love of words, Ms. Heyer's Regency novels, full of such detailed depictions of high society life during this time, were gifts from heaven. I still read them anytime I want a lighter read, to escape completely and totally into another time.Charity Girl has long been one of my favorites, since that first reading when I found myself surprised (due to slowness to pick up on social cues, even in books) with the ending couples. In this delightful novel, the Viscount Desford (quite the eligible bachelor), meets young (beneath her years) Charity Steane in the role of poor relation in her aunt's house. The next day, he literally runs across her as he is returning to London; she has run away from her unkind (though not cruel, but certainly not loving) aunt and is attempting to walk to London.Desford knows that she is unsuspecting prey for any blackguard that drives by and does what any decent gentleman would do: he reluctantly becomes involved. His attempts to help Charity find a safe place send him from one shire to the next watering hole, looking for her grandfather. In the meantime, he has placed Charity in the charge of his best friend, Hetta, much to Hetta's chagrin. They've been friends since nursery days, though, and Hetta is persuaded to help him out this scrape, though she worries about the outcome.Charity Girl is witty and intelligent, with a satisfying romantic conclusion. Her characters are lively and their dialogue is a joy to read. For light reading (though meatier than most light reading), one can't go wrong with this one."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"When Viscount Desford comes upon a young lady walking to London, he stops to ask her where she is going. Charity says she is running away to her Grandfather, so the Viscount vows to help her find her eccentric relative and ends up travelling all over England looking for them. The rather funny antics of Charity and the Viscounts difficult search make a funny story. The outcome is filled with fate, but it all ends well. It is all Georgette Heyer!"},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"2.5 starsThe descriptions about this book strongly reminded me of another Georgette Heyer book,The Foundling, and I had a strong feeling that I would know how things would turn out. I was right.I really liked Desford although he seemed a little too perfect. I enjoyed his exchanges with his crotchety father, and how could one hate a guy who was so gallant towards his mother? The interactions between Desford and Henrietta clearly showed their closeness but like everyone else, it seemed one of just two young people who had grown up as close friends with each other. Henrietta was too good. She was a bit snobbish, very mindful of class distinctions in one scene, which tarnished the halo a bit in my eyes, but still remained generous and a kind friend to Charity.Charity was too helpless, too naive and eager to please, and too boring, and her father was over the top. He seemed like a caricature of a con man, and not at all like an Honorable. While Desford and Henrietta might have found him amusing, I found him irritating as Simon and tiresome.I thought that Desford's quest to help Charity took too long. There were so many obstacles that I grew a bit bored and eager for the end. He is sent here and there, and manages to get to a resolution just as everything was coming to a close, and that was just too many convenient inconveniences for me. Desford just couldn't get a break, and neither could I. I struggled with the scene when Simon is forced to deal with Mr. Steane, and I was ready to bang my head against the wall. I just wanted Simon to throw the guy out.Basically, the only thing I really liked about this book was Desford and his interactions with the people he comes into contact with. Most of the other parts of the book kind of just bored me.This review was cross-posted from Goodreads."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"First let me say that is book isnt your typical love story where the main characters fall in love at first sight. There isnt very much interaction between the hero and heroine.At the age of twenty-nine Viscount Ashley Desford is lectured by his father, the Earl of Wroxton that he should now consider settling down and producing an heir.Viscount Desford attends a country ball and accidently meets Charity Steane, a nineteen year old girl living almost as a maid in her aunt's home.He brings it upon himself to help this unfortunate creature from a sad life of servintude and tries to track down her grandfather since her father is considered dead. He has Miss Steane stay with his dearest childhood friend Miss Henrietta Silverdale and her mother Lady Silverdale's countyhome. In the process of running throughout the country, Ashley realizes his own heart. Clean romance, characters are well developed and it is a story I would read again."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"While this book may start off slow and shaky, by the end Heyer has her footing again and the plot and characters sparkle. In Charity Girl a Viscount named Desford meets a young woman named Charity, \\"Cherry\\" for short, hiding away upstairs at a ball. She was foisted off on these relatives by an absent father and is treated more like glorified help then a poor relation in need. Naturally she ends up running away to London in a search for her grandfather. Desford finds her on the road to London and, after hearing her story, decides she would be better off with her grandfather and so gives her a lift. Unfortunately they arrive in London just to discover that her grandfather is out in the country and no one knows where or when he will be back.Now things look really bad. Desford is now in a position where he has an unattended young girl who has run away in his carriage and no family for her to go to. That's when he hits upon the idea of taking her to his best friend Henrietta out in the country to have her watch the girl in respectability while he tries to track down her grandfather. That's when the story really takes off and all sorts of twists and turns follow as Charity settles in caring for Henrietta's shrewish mother and Desford sets off going from town to town searching for the missing grandfather.I thought the beginning of this novel started off a little shakily. I guess I'm picky in my romances, I like to know who the couple is that I'm rooting for up front, but that turned out to be impossible as you don't know for sure until about half way through the book. Once that is cleared up the story picks up nicely from there. There are all of Heyer's hallmarks, last minute plot twists, snappy and amusing dialog, sparkling female characters, and trouble makers that make your blood boil.After a beginning that has Charity sparkling about half way through the author suddenly reduces her to a silly chit with more beauty than sense. Along with that she is portrayed as loving, wait for it, regency romance novels. The moment that was revealed was the moment that the plot started to turn and I thought it was half hilarious, half outrageous. Charity chatters on with Henrietta's mother, and anyone that will listen, about the plot twisty romance novels that she loves to read and makes herself ridiculous by so doing. A writer of regency romance makes fun of a reader of regency romance in a regency romance? I think only Heyer could pull that off. I heard before that she never thought much of the readers that enjoyed her work and after reading scenes like that I do start to wonder!The book still finishes wonderfully even after all of that. I loved the wit shown by the Desford and Henrietta. I liked the barbs and jokes that were scattered throughout, even the ones pointed squarely at me. But, most of all, I really did like Charity even if she ended up being reduced to a silly girl by the end. I still loved her character from the opening pages. If you don't mind unexpected pairings and a surprising romance that twists and turns, or being considered a silly wigeon for enjoying such, then you will love Charity Girl."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"I love Georgette Heyer books and I was thrilled when I saw \\"Charity Girl\\" which for me was a new Georgette Heyer. It didn't live up to all her other books. The plot was weak and the lead characters barely interacted with each other. Worse the book was all \\"tell\\" and barely any show. Still the characterizations were, as usual for a Georgette Heyer book, so well done that Des and Hetta felt like real people.One definite negative distraction was the typesetting. No one went through and removed the hyphens that were used nearly forty years ago when a word was split in two at the end of a line. The new typesetting has these hyphenated words in the middle of a line. I hope if there is another edition put out in the future they are removed."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"Everything is just average (if not boring) in this one. I found no sparks flying between the hero and heroin. I kept waiting and waiting for the story to take an interesting turn, and it never did. Halfway through, I was almost tempted to put this one down, but for sheer obstinacy. I was quite disappointed when I reached the last line, but also relieved because I can finally go on to the next one in my Heyer list."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"I really liked this Heyer. Unlike many of the silly \\"love at first sight\\" stories which are found in my least favorite Heyers (where \\"offers\\" are made within days of a couple meeting), this book is about dear friends who have a second chance to find love together.The characters are realistic and likeable-- a pleasure to spend time with. Not a fevered sort of romance, a quiet comedy of manners and real love."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"\\"Charity Girl\\" is a historical romance novel set in England during the British Regency period (1811-1820). As usual for Heyer, the story was very funny. There was a nice level of historical detail woven into the story, and the characters were all enjoyable. It was clear which woman was best suited to Desford, and it was fun seeing how they would finally end up together. The only reason this book didn't quite rate among my very favorite Heyer's novels is that a few scenes ran on a little too long, in my opinion.There was no sex. There was some explicit bad language. Overall, I'd highly recommend this humorous romance."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"just not my favourite, lots of pages spent on how long the travels took, still a very lovely Georgette Heyer book :)"},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"Georgette Heyer is probably my all-time favorite author of historical romances. You just can't find a bad one of her stories. I can't even declare a favorite among her books because they are all equally good, and all with just enough unique plot twists that they don't start sounding/feeling the same the more of them you read."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"This is fun-not her best, but definitely one to read. Her characters are as lively as ever, and find themselves in hilarious circumstances."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"Georgette Heyer is absolutely my all-time favorite author. She combines a light-hearted approach to her characters, but she makes them so believable that I wouldn't be surprised to meet any one ot them at my next club gathering, or find one of them waiting in a doctor's office and ready to strike up a conversation. Her plot development is always a source of amazement to me. There's inevitably a surprise twist waiting for the unwary reader. But the best part of all her books-- and this is no exception--there is a happy ending!"},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"Although I pretty much had the plot figured out this was still a sweet read. My favorite part was when Cherry asks Henreitta if she can say yes to the marriage offer. She is quite innocent and sweet. A refreshing happy ending. The part I disliked and took a star for was te excessive cant wordage and some rather slow spots that could have been deleted without harm to the storyline. A fun tale with romances within romances."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"At first seeming in danger of falling into my least favorite of Heyer's tropes--the older man with a beholden waif--Charity Girl avoids that fate for something much more satisfying. Henrietta doesn't get enough attention, but the ending is an enjoyable farce and, as usual, it all comes right in the end."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"Ashley Carrington, Viscount Desford, is in dire straits, all due to his chivalrous nature. Having recently been raked over the coals by his father, the Earl of Wroxton, for refusing to propose to his lifelong friend, Henrietta, Desford escapes to the home of his more understanding aunt. While there, he meets a young girl named Cherry hiding upstairs during a ball. He is charmed by her innocence but thinks little more of her until he encounters her on the road to London. When he stops to question her, he learns her sad tale of abandonment by her father and mistreatment at the hands of her aunt. Feeling pity for the girl, he rashly decides to help her in her escape and in her search for her grandfather. Unfortunately, their search in London is fruitless and they hear little good about the man who, it seems, is a recluse and miser. Desford, refusing to be daunted, takes Cherry to stay with Henrietta while he continues the search. What follows is a comedy of errors which threatens to ruin Desford's reputation and leaves Cherry's future very uncertain. In the end, as with all Heyer novels, love conquers all...and we're reminded that sometimes the best love is the love you share with a friend.Brimming with the witty dialogue, numerous plot twists, laughable characters, wonderful phraseology and satisfying ending that characterizes Heyer's work, Charity Girl is another excellent example of Regency Romance at its best. Who can resist an author that uses words like \\"comfumbusculated\\" and can get away with quotes like \\"Gammon! Show me the female who doesn't hope for marriage, and I'll show you a lunatic past praying for!\\" Though, as other reviewers have pointed out, Charity Girl may not be one of Heyer's best books, I still feel it ranks at least four stars! If you're looking for a book with clean humor, sparkling characters and enough drama to keep you turning the pages, this is one for you."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"I love a book that makes me smile while reading it and this one is perfect. If you purchase it and like it try the Grand Sophy next and the Talisman Ring after that...all three of them are wonderful reads....good characters, happy endings, lovely and fun story."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"This is a later work, and is missing the character development and true dialogue between characters that create such enjoyable characters in her earlier works. The dialogue that is here seems to consist of every cant phrase and idiom that has ever appeared in any of G. Heyer's books. This may have been an attempt to appeal to a new generation of readers or simply evidence of a waning interest by the author. As with most of G. Heyer's books I will reread it several times and may find that I have missed some quiet humor. It should be read by any fan, but will never be my favorite. Venetia has that honor."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"CHARIETY GIRL by Georgette Heyer is not an outstanding addition by the Queen of Regency, but it is a light fun read.

We are made to understand that Ashley and Henrietta have known each other all their lives and, after a whole lot of plot spent on resolving events concerning the rather insipid Charity and a series of other characters, we are to assume that Ashley and Henrietta are now in love. Just like that.Don't get me wrong, I loved both Ashley and Henrietta. Especially Henrietta as she is one of Heyer's older heroines (and I do love the older heroines). I just needed a little more time spent on developing a relationship between the main characters. Something, perhaps, akin to Bath Tangle."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"Typical of Heyer's regency work.

Amazon has been good enough to fix other books with typos; please add this one to the list!"},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"This is my fourth Heyer. I liked it better than Beauvallet, about the same as Cousin Kate and not quite as well as Sylvester. Although now that I look back at Sylvester, I'm not sure I'm really feeling the Heyer-love. In general, they've been nice, pleasant stories, but I'm not overwhelmed by their wonderfulness. Could be the older style, could be I'm not reading them in the context of when they were written (1970 for this one--I was 9. I'd probably have loved it then, if I'd been allowed to read it.), or could be I just haven't read the best ones.Viscount Desford's family had intended a match between him and Henrietta Silverdale, but having grown up together, they're instead best friends. And now she has (the very bland) Cary Nethercott as a suitor (who's definitely not good enough for her).So when Desford rescues Cherry Steane, who's run away from her aunt's cold charity (read: servitude), only to discover that the grandfather to whom she was running is out of town, who better to care for the girl than Hetta?It's a bit of a comedy of errors with Desford running all over the country chasing after Cherry's grandfather, and friends and family alike assigning him motives for doing so. And there's an interesting and potentially dangerous twist, too.I really wasn't sure what to expect from this. Perhaps it's obvious to everyone else, but until nearly the very end, I didn't know that the romantic hero and heroine were Desford and Henrietta. Because so much of the story was about Cherry, I thought she must be the heroine, and it just didn't fit. So I spent most of the book slightly confused and wondering what Desford saw in Cherry besides her youth and prettiness.On the other hand, I liked that it confounded my expectations--yes, I know I'm contrary--I've been told that before. No doubt on a re-read, I'd pick up more on the signs between Desford and Hetta.I did enjoy all the characters, but it left me feeling a little spoiled or jaded maybe, that I had trouble fully enjoying a story without knowing where it was going. Something to think about."},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"......if you love romance novels......especially victorian english.....then read heyer novels......she is the best of the best......she takes some getting used to because she uses the language of that era......also for example she will use about eight different names for the carriages.......because that's the way her characters would describe them......this actually makes the stories much more interesting...but takes getting used to.......i have almost all of her romance stories and re-read them a lot....however........she also does some books that are more about the history than the romance....and these i do not like so much.......but if you are into history...she really did her research.....this particular book combines romance with comedy......something i really enjoy........"},{"Title":"Charity Girl","review":"unfortunately I could not read this entire book.

Unforturnately many of them don't write very well. To have these men tell their story to a professional writer, and Lynch is a much better writer than he was when he wrote editorials for the Times Union, was a masteful stroke. By having 3 stories to follow, the book never dragged on endlessly. The personal stories of these 3 warriors is compelling and I highly recommend the book. The anit-Semitism Al Cohen experienced is well described but not overdone. Lynch makes his point and moves on like a good writer.

The Germans were desperate to keep the allies from entering Germany in the closing year of the war. A cruel winter held the frontline in its frigid grip.

These men, at the age of approximately 20, were called upon to defend against the Nazi horde, specifically at the Battle of the Bulge.

It's not the actual accounts of the three veterans but rather the author's interpretations and way of writing which is horrendous - and from a historical point of view completely worthless: A black/white, purely patriotic picture of the war of good against evil. Certainly, nobody doubts that many nazis were criminals, but in this book every German was a nazi (actually only about 15% were in the party), cowardish and dispicable. For the ignorant reader this may be great but for the ones who have more intellectual capacity it's too plump. The authors love describing scenes of carnage amongst German troops and obviously find that quite arrousing; Peiper's unit were a bunch of murderers (here Malmedy comes in handy, of course) but they should have relied on new facts rather than 1945 war propaganda. The old story of one of the veterans telling German Prisoners that he's a Jew may have been fun in Private Ryan, but in fact no German soldier would have given a thing about it. It is a well-preserved myth that the normal German soldier considered himself as part of a \\"master race\\". They cared about their loved ones and saw themselves taken from their families to fight a war which they knew was lost - or doubted its cause. The total number of 30.000 soldiers executed for \\"desertion\\" speaks for itself.But who cares when it's about the story of GI heroes?"},{"Title":"War of the Mountain Man","review":"Don't read this book....unless you're prepared to read the ton of otherbooks in the \\"Smoke Jensen and Preacher\\" series.

Reading Phillips' classic may disturb you into a proper understanding of the real and living God, a mystery whose ways are higher than our ways, whose thoughts are unfathomable.In this pocket-sixed book, Phillips deals with incorrect ideas about the God of the Bible. He's not a cosmic policeman or a divine grandfather. Neither is He a bellhop, a tottering old man, nor a fire-breathing despot. He is a God who loves the world for His own glory and calls everyone to repentance for their sins against Him. Does that fit your understanding of God? If not, you may be deceived. Don't let yourself exist with a God too small for your life.Read this book. Come to know the infinite Almighty."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"In this 40-year-old short Christian classic, Phillips does a masterful job showing just who God isn't...and is. There are certain false images that we may have of God, but Philips tackles these in the first half of the book. I believe much of the views today's America has about God come from the media and their stereotypical nonsense--this is the kind of thinking Phillips seeks to destroy. The second half is dedicated to the constructive view of the authentic God who, it should be pointed out, is much greater than the limited box many stick Him in."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"I picked up an early edition of this book at a used book sale recently.

Lewis fan, so I am already quite familiar with the &quot;destructive&quot; views of God which are briefly examined in the first half of this book. But, the second part of the book in which the &quot;constructive&quot; view/feel for God is explored is, in my estimation, good and original stuff. [I liked that Phillips used the word &quot;stuff&quot; so I thought I'd add it here.] Like Lewis, and unlike so many of the more modern Christian writers, Phillips can certainly &quot;turn a phrase&quot;. He writes so well that it makes his constructive vision of God, in the person of Jesus, come alive and convince.

It helps those who have either an authoritarian view of God or a permissive view of Him. We must also face the fact that God does not operate in ways that we can predict. Hence, for example, the challenge of suffering and evil."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"I first read this book in the mid-70s after a few semesters at Bob Jones University and it confirmed the rightness of my decision to move on from fundamentalist and conventional Christianity, including the parochial Catholicism I grew up with. This, and Robinson's Honest To God, helped me in the personal journey from Sunday school and catechism piety to an authentic adult spirituality. Adults everywhere have been making the same move over the past thirty years and it is helping our religions to grow up as well. Read this book and join the movement from the pious pablum of traditional religion to the savory sustenance of adult spirituality."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book is really rather easy to read and fun. We often &quot;assume&quot; God is supposed to be one way (God is our conscience, God is a policeman, etc) where in truth those ideas are derived from other sources and have nothing to do with scripture. This book points us in the right direction and is refreshing reading for both believers and non-believers."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"...then keep reading to move towards a better understanding of him.In church school classes, in Bible studies, even in pulpits, I constantly encounter people who have a neatly categorized, labeled and filed-away God. The most common thing I see is people who reject a particular doctrine, Scriptural passage, or the like, because they know &quot;God wouldn't do that&quot;. And how do they know? Because THEY wouldn't do that if THEY were God. Yes, their God is too small; and probably so is yours and mine. Reading this book will help us realize how great he is."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"The first half of this book is devoted to demolishing destructive views of God. Phillips can be as unsparing at this as Nietzsche or Feuerbach. Especially shocking is his section entitled \\"Pale Galilean.\\" The second half of the book attempts to reformulate the Biblical view of Jesus and to make his sayings palatable and comprehensible to modern readers. Some readers may feel that Phillips \\"tames\\" Jesus's hard sayings to the point that they become unrecognizable. On the other hand, for those who are looking to escape from fundamentalism into a more liberal version of Christianity, this book just might be the key."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"An oldie but a goodie.

It carries a big explosion in a small package!Like most people, I was introduced to J. B. Phillips via his rather bouncy and energetic translation of the New Testament; so buying this book was the next necessary and logical step.In it, Mr. Phillips discusses way that we limit God; we limit His power, His influence in our lives. It reminds me of what Joseph Smith said, \\"It is the constitutional disposition of mankind to set up stakes and set bounds to the works and ways of the Almighty.\\" We have these weird conceptions of God. I think they come from Type \\"A\\" overachievers-these people who are the movers, shakers, and leaders in the world-who make God in their own image, so he ends up looking more like a rulebook, and less like a holy being.For some reason, we don't want a strong God interfering in our life, telling us to love those oh, so obnoxious people.Besides, a weak God is easier to control.His section on God in the arts absolutely tore my head off. Mr. Phillips makes the point that we never see God interacting with evil people, only with the Good, as if He is only concerned with the good. In \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" near the end, we see Annikin/Darth Vader have a few pricks of conscience before he kills Emperor Palpatine, but you never see this wrestle with conscience in other villains. But we know it goes on!J. B. Phillips has a blessed gift for language that is flows, bounces, and he creates wonderful images that stick with you. On top of these obvious linguistic abilities, he was a piercing insight that glances through the creaky creeds and misconceptions of our age, and into the holy of holies."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"The basic premise of this book is that most of us have an inadequate concept of what God is. The first half, subtitled &quot;Unreal Gods&quot; is devoted to dispelling a number of popular notions about God's nature. The general thrust is that our personal theologies put too many limits on the Almighty.The second half of the book &quot;An adequate God&quot; was, ironically, less convincing than the first. Too much ink was used to promote the &quot;Jesus was God&quot; theory, adding that Jesus' message 2000 years ago was all God ever needed to give us to prove Himself to us. Too little space was given to what God is for us here and now.The book challenges us to part with our limited perspectives, but is not entirely successful at inspiring unlimited vision."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"Being a 40 year old book I thought this text might be a bit outdated. I was pleasantly surprised. J. B. Phillips seems to be best known for the New Testament he wrote hin a language is modern day Londoners would better understand. He wrote this book about the most common ways people view God incorrectly. I would call it putting our personal baggage on God.Examples would include, The Kind Old Man view of God which see him as wise, but out of touch. My favorite, and most personal was the Meek and Mild God. This God is ineffectual, irrelevant, and unassertive. Although Jesus was gentle at times, he could show some serious backbone as well.This book is well worth reading, especially given its small size."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book was written by a British preacher long ago but the material is still relevant, although the language is at times outdated.

Interesting reading."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This has been a favorite of mine since it first came out. J. B.

I would say this book played a big part in making me a better Christian. I recommend it for Youth and up. Amust have in Christian publications."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"Book was in great shape and what I wanted.Why do I have to type more words if I don't have any more to say to review this item?"},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"J.B. Phillips wrote this book many years ago, but the insights he offer are still poignant today. The reader is sure to come across several lesser gods that he is at least prone to if not fully devoted to. The older, simple style, is refreshing as Phillips does not concern himself with modern atheist-theist debates and arguments but simply proceeds with what he believes. For this reason, the agnostic may be disappointed, but if he should continue through to the end, I am sure that he will not be upset at Phillips lack of apologetic, but appreciative of his sincerity and what he does accomplish.Book thesis: It is the purpose of this book to attempt two things: first to expose the inadequate conceptions of God which still linger unconsciously in many minds, and which prevent our catching a glimpse of the true God; and secondly to suggest ways in which we can find the real God for ourselves.As noted in the thesis, Phillips divides his book into two sections. The first section deals with all of the false notions which are prevalent in the minds of believers and unbelievers alike. Surely, there are more that are present (and Phillips acknowledges such), but the ones that he puts forth are pertinent to many people today. For some of them the reader may think, \\"No, never thought that before,\\" but for others he may say, \\"Yes... sadly, I do tend toward limiting God in that way.\\" The second section of the book approaches things from an angle I was not expecting, but an appropriate angle and one which is helpful for believers and seekers and agnostics alike. He begins the second section by essentially asking, \\"What if there was a God?\\" and \\"What if this God entered physical reality?\\" By doing this, Phillips provides the reader with the philosophical framework to consider the presence and immanence of a deity. He does not force the reader into Christianity but simply leads the reader asking \`what if' and \`shouldn't we expect'-type questions. For the Christian, this is also helpful because it gives them a framework by which to keep their own thoughts of God in check.By the end of the book, which should not take too long, the reader will be aware of how easy it is to slip away from an accurate conception of God revealed, and he will be encouraged with joy and hope do know God personally and truly as he is. This book will spur him on to seek out the person of God deeper through study--primarily through the study of Scripture but also through the teaching of theologians and philosophers through the centuries."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"I received the book much quicker than I thought I would and it was exactly as described; GOOD CONDITION.Thank you for the quick delivery and honest description.Traci M. - Henderson, NV"},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"J.

DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book along with Leslie Weatherhead's \\"The Will of God\\" are the two most influential books in determining my own personal view of God and how to make sense of many things in this world. There is not much more I can say regarding this book as I feel that that statement of itself speaks volumes for my opinion of this book. It was recommended to me by the one minister in my life who has had the largest influence on my Christianity...and for which I am thankful.Phillips addresses most all of the views of God that I have encountered in people and then sets each aside by exposing the problems inherent with each view. He challenges the reader to expand his or her view of God and not to try to fit God into a neat little box, but rather embrace God for what He is...bigger than we can imagine. By doing this, it frees the reader to understand Him so much better."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"In this small book, Phillips strikes at a vital issue in today's church: the multiplicity of false conceptions of God. The false conceptions of God that we hold are damaging to the faith and Christianity as a whole. Phillips brings many of these inadequate conceptions of God to light in the first half of the book, which I thought was some of the most poignant writing in the book. Too often we limit God, especially so that we can have our \\"God-in-a-box\\", which is essentially a shrunken-down God that fits OUR notions of what God is like and where He is. This along with many other false conceptions of God which Phillips gives name, create a pseudo-god that we ourselves hardly respect, and neither do those outside the church. And more importantly they do not reflect the true nature of God as revealed in the Bible.I was slightly disappointed in the second portion of the book where Phillips tries to open up a more full image of God. Most of it was very well written, and I especially liked the way he pointed to Jesus Christ as the \\"focused\\" God that came to be among us and die for our sins. However, scattered things in the latter portion of the book I disagreed with, for example, the way Phillips seemed to downplay sin somewhat. The true ugliness and despair of OUR OWN SIN is what nailed Christ to the Cross and was the punishment Jesus bore IN OUR STEAD! This makes the resurrection of Christ all the more joyful for sin-wearied souls, as we have the promise of forgiveness and eternal life WITH OUR SAVIOR!!! It is important that we recognize our own sinfulness and are repentant that we may receive this great gift. Altogether \\"Your God is Too Small\\" is a good little book for all Christians to read."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. The author started out well by describing a number of God types that are accepted by many, but don't really exist.Unfortunately, when it came to explaining the God that he thought did exist, he went straight to the \\"New Testament\\" of the Bible, and limited his views to a rather fundamental Christian concept. He ignored the other valid religious ideas and stuck to the \\"guilty until proven innocent\\" point of view of most of the Christian world. An infinite Creator/Creation cannot be understood by any limited idea, especially one that insists on taking scriptural writing literally."},{"Title":"Your God is too small","review":"I have listened to a lot of sermons in my life, often from people who would not want to spend that much time listening to me, who, of course, thought that I needed to be saved, or who thought that none of us could possibly understand a bigger picture than our own self-interest, and I have also listened to people who spoke out of a desire to proclaim whatever they considered godly. This small book is a great summary of the real ploys which may work for or against any of these views in a particular situation. Count me among the people who have had more trouble with doctrine than with poetry, but who might be more open to considering questions about God than about the meaning of life sometimes. The big transition, near the middle of this book, jumps from &quot;Unreal Gods&quot; to &quot;An Adequate God.&quot; Trying to give up the common modern substitutes in order to worship precisely what everyone else is supposed to be worshipping only works when those people who think they should have your real devotion aren't paying attention."},{"Title":"Civil War genealogy: A basic research guide for tracing your Civil War ancestors with detailed sources and precise instructions for obtaining information from them","review":"Dr. Schweitzer is best known for his series of booklets on research for individual states, but he completed others that touch on certain aspects of genealogical research, including this particular title on researching Civil War related materials. While this handbook is a concise and brief primer or starting point for most researchers as well as a handy reference to have, it is now rather out of date as it does not include internet resources and new technologies used by researchers. Schweitzer's basic guidance and direction is still as solid as ever and his prose is plain and direct as he provides a listing of those resources available. There are undoubtedly other books that go into greater detail and that would provide better overall utility to the researcher than this. Since this title was written years ago some telephone numbers and addresses have changed and some organizations, groups or societies may be dormant or closed. While Schweitzer does not make reference to internet sources or email addresses it's just as well as they tend to get out-of-date quite quickly.

It precedes the mafia cleanup in Italy, that resulted in horrific murders of investigating judges, and yet features many of the same names, &quot;families&quot;, and same tentacles. The case went on forever, each mafioso from high to low represented by a scrum of lawyers, all battling for their moment in the spotlight. The title comes from the heroin traffic fronted by pizza restaurants, good for money laundering as well as handy pickup points. Alexander seems to have spent every day in court, finding something interesting to say even when the case bogged down in legal flummery. She covers both sides and the infighting that went on behind the scenes.

Surprised to know how Giuliani orchestrated this trial which costs the taxpayers of New York more than 50 million because he was obviously eyeing to become Mayor even then. I still don't like Giuliani because I felt that the 22 defendants and their numerous attorneys clogged the court system for 16 months. The trial of drug trafficking and the mob seemed to be endless. Shana Alexander has written about subjects but this book will probably be her finest works to date. It is mind-boggling to read about the characters in this case, the families, the defendants, the lawyers, and others involved.

But breasts are more \\"out there,\\" visually and socially, and this extremely fun book (approximately the size of a breast) uses hundreds of photographs to celebrate them and document societies' ever-changing attitudes, codes, fashions and artistic representation (one chapter is devoted solely to their representation by woman artists). There's a thoughtful chapter about adolescence; funny bits about Hollywood (in a candid shot, Sophia Loren in all her glory glances disapprovingly at Jayne Mansfield's down-to-the-nipple decolletage); interesting facts about the breast's dual role as sexual organ and milk producer -- hence the duality of the sacred and the profane. Since the book fits so comfortably in the hand, I find myself taking it with me from room to room, so I bought myself another on and now I have a pair."},{"Title":"The Breast Book: An Intimate and Curious History","review":"I bought this book after seeing \\"Cleavage\\" on A&E; a few weeks ago since one of the authors was featured on the show. (Side note: I was quite frankly amazed not to see Marilyn Yalom on this show, but maybe I missed her.) This is a small, cute and flirty book that contains a sort of sound-byte history of the female breast. The pictures are great although far too many are not captioned - if you want to know what you're looking at, you'll need to comb through the credits at the back of the book. A few sections of the text are more or less meaningless (i.e., The Veiled Erotic); others do have lots of genuine facts and insights. In other words, if you want to look at pictures of bosoms without getting too wrapped up in history, politics or other serious issues, this is the book for you. That said, I do think that the book does a good job of looking (very, very briefly) at the breast in its many incarnations: sex object, food, cultural icon, etc. It's a good starting point if you have a serious interest in the history of the breast. I would probably rate this book higher if 1) the book was bigger, 2) and went into more detail. To my mind, if this book is a publishing gimmick (which I believe to be the case), then why not spring for a bit more substance? With all the pictures, I am certain people would be willing to plunk down the cash for it.I read that the authors put two years of research into this book, and I am pretty perplexed by that. The book came out in 2002, yet a lot of the information could have been directly lifted from Marilyn Yalom's A History of the Breast, which was published in 1995, and which is excellent and far superior (I would recommend it to anyone).

Although I had read All Is Quiet On The Western Front previously, I was not prepared for what I read here- the senselessness of the killing was unimaginable. How in the world could General Haig (the British commander) and Field Marshall Foch (the French commander) send hundreds of thousands of men to their death? If my memory serves me correctly, up to 20,000 allied soldiers died in one month alone.This is a highly readable history of the battle, one that will captivate your interest and keep you reading until the end. Simply put, this book is hard to put down. Time after time, you ask yourself, how could they keep up this senseless slaughter, asking yourself what compelled these men to obey orders that meant certain death for no gain whatsoever? Certainly the First World War was one of the most senseless and unless wars ever fought, laying the groundwork for even the more destructive Second World War.When the United States entered the war, it was to General Pershing's credit that he refused to dole out American troops under the command of Haig and Foch. Pershing knew that they too would be used for cannon fodder under European command. Since the Civil War, Americans have been reluctant to give their sons over to such slaughter.This is a gripping book. Well written and hard to put down, it will take you back to a time and a war now almost forgotten."},{"Title":"In Flanders fields: The 1917 campaign","review":"If you enjoy the style of Stephen Ambrose, you will like In Flanders Fields.

I read it cover to cover immediately. I also recommend Lyn Macdonald also for coverage of WW1."},{"Title":"In Flanders fields: The 1917 campaign","review":"In Flanders Fields is the most readable World War One book I have yet come across; infinitely more so than Ian Ousby's Road to Verdun which, although starting promisingly soon gets bogged down in academic pontificating. The Road to Flanders, as the title suggests deals with the conflagration that took place there in the autumn of 1917 - also known as he Third Battle of Ypres - when the British Army tried once again to break the stalemate on the western front and push the Germans out of Belgium and away from strategic ports.In Flanders Fields focuses on three key players - British Army Commander-in-Chief, Douglas Haig; his nemesis British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and mud.The October offensive against the German lines was an unmitigated disaster and many historians have attempted to put the blame squarely on the shoulders of the Field Marshal Haig. This is understandable - Haig pressed ahead with his scheme despite the warnings from generals both French and British and the disapproval of the British government. Bur as you read this book you will see that there were other factors that played their part: internal bickering, vanity, bad weather, indecision, false promises, lax security (the British plans were published in advance the newspapers), and No Man's Land where the mud was so deep soldiers and mules drowned by the dozens.In Flanders Fields is really well written - as well as depicting the whole event clearly, Wolff actually manages to bring the whole event to life and takes us into the meeting rooms and the pages of secret diaries. Entertaining but not for the easily depressed. I recommend this as a first-class introduction to anyone interested in finding out more about World War 1"},{"Title":"In Flanders fields: The 1917 campaign","review":"This edition of IN FLANDERS FIELDS was published as part of Penguin's series of \\"Classic Military History\\" and no one should quibble with its inclusion in such a grandiosely named group. As indicated by the title, the book covers only the 1917 Flanders offensive by the British (with a small but equally disastrous contribution by the French), otherwise known as the Third Battle of Ypres or the Passchendaele campaign. But that campaign is emblematic of the senseless slaughter on the Western Front in World War One.IN FLANDERS FIELDS is written from the perspective of the British, who were responsible for the decision to initiate the 1917 Flanders offensive (rather than wait, for example, for the arrival of the Americans to tip the balance and break the stalemate) and who suffered the most from it in terms of casualties. The story is told at a number of levels: the geopolitical, national politics, civilian government versus top military brass, military tactics and strategy, and front-line soldiering. It is first-rate history. But the most striking feature of IN FLANDERS FIELDS is Wolff's superb writing.Some examples:\\"[At the beginning of 1917 in Britain'] the great masses of tired and depressed ordinary people merely got on with the war * * *. The ignorant saw no reason to doubt. The religious prayed. The poor worked. The Liberals wrung their hands. Few surrendered to thought.\\"\\"Gradually the great guns became silent. On the chessboard of Flanders the opening phase had ended. The pawns lay still, filled with forebodings. The grandmasters stroked their moustaches, surveyed the deadlock, and plotted their next moves.\\"\\"Haig's own generals wanted him to stop. The politicians had lost their last vestige of faith in his campaign. The morale of his own armies was sinking into the swamps of the Salient. What Haig still hoped to achieve * * * and what he was trying to prove, are perhaps questions more appropriate to a psychiatrist than to the student of military science.\\"Finally, two anecdotes from a book loaded with instructive vignettes and anecdotes:By 1917, British front-line soldiers, thoroughly disillusioned but still inexplicably fighting on, took to singing sardonically to the tune of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\":We're here because we're here,Because we're here, because we're here;We're here because we're here,Because we're here, because we're here.The Flanders campaign became a quagmire literally as well as figuratively because of the geography -- flat terrain, clay soil, and water, water everywhere. When one front-line officer was instructed by a zealous but ignorant commander in the rear to consolidate his advance position, he responded, \\"It is impossible to consolidate porridge.\\"Only a few other books that I have read are the equal of IN FLANDERS FIELDS in combining an objective and instructive historical account and excellent, literate writing."},{"Title":"In Flanders fields: The 1917 campaign","review":"I read this book in 1965 and it easily won the award for &quot;best book read this year&quot; even though I read 41 other books that year.

His description of the hideous battles that made up the shapeless and shambolic mess that was 3rd Ypres are searingly good, but for me it is his excellent portrayal of Haig vs Lloyd George that makes the book outstanding. Reading it and realizing that Haig had to show the politician who was really in charge, by persisting with a meaningless slog through bottomless mud, at the cost of heartbreaking casualties, brought home more than anything else I have read, the crass stupidity of war. Wolff refers to Haig's chief confederate, Lt Gen Kiggell, breaking down into sobs at being shown a part of the battlefield. \\"Did we really send men out to fight in that?\\" This much used quotation has been debunked by many people as untrue, and yet this vignette continues to fascinate me. I suspect that it is true, but because it didn't appear in an official memoir, it has been attacked as untrue. I wonder. It all reminds one of the attempt made by the Victorians to rewrite history and have Admiral Nelson's last words as \\"Kismet, Hardy...\\" Enough.

It is hard for us to imagine a time when men lived in a sea of mud beneath fortified heights, drowned in shell holes, never saw a tank, and had negligible air support, while the enemy artillery turned over every square inch of ground. The loss of several hundred thousand in one battle was deemed tolerable and was to be encouraged if the general could gain several hundred yards of ground, nor was there any hope of it ever ending.

After three years of constant artillery bombardment, the no man's land between the lines had been reduced to an impassable quagmire. Time and time again, British soldiers were ordered to march through this waist deep treacle as German machine guns raked the men crawling through the mud. Advances of a few hundred yards were hailed in propagandistic despatches as great victories. Thousands of lives were squandered in the process of trying to advance through mires. Ninety years after the guns were silenced, farmers continue to find corpses and skeletons of soldiers who were lost in action. The locals refer to this as occurrence as \\"the harvest of the bones.\\"Given the gross ineptitude of command leadership of the British Army, it is nothing short of a miracle that the Central Powers did not prevail in the First World War. The American entry into the conflict on behalf of the Allies served to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. In retirement, Field Marshal Alexander Haig was subject to a tacit blackballing by the British military and political establishment.A personal aside: my late father was a friend of a gentleman who was related to John McCrae, the poet who wrote \\"In Flanders Fields.\\" McCrae died on the Western Front."},{"Title":"In Flanders fields: The 1917 campaign","review":"Mr Wolff has captured the complex details and produced a compelling and interesting account of the bitter fighting in Flanders.

As a Sixties Airplane/Doors/punk counterculture political type, the Deadheads were a constant frustration because we could never scrape them off their black-lighted dope-mattresses for our moratoriums and sit-ins. Yet we always suspected they had some kind of handle on the true &quot;counterculture,&quot; if only because they seemed familial and, besides, we never understood a single word Jerry said. And look: Sixties politics is not just dead but repealed and reversed, yet Deadheads still live. Baruth's hallucinogenic book oughta top the best-seller list, because the Sixties and Nineties kids are natural allies who just haven't met each other yet."},{"Title":"The Millennium Shows","review":"This novel has gained some deserved fame among Deadheads and fiction lovers. The mysterious main character, who goes by the name Story, takes us on a tour of that now-lost culture in its final glory. It is also a novel about complex personal and group relationships and the problems of individual and group identity. In other words, it is much more than a celebration of the Dead. It begins with the recognition that the Grateful Dead phenomenon was always about the swirling, color-filled culture of the people who followed the Dead from show to show.

Novus Ordo Catholics will be right at home with this but if you are a Traditional Orthodox Catholic who favors the Roman Rite and who has been traumatized by the profanations inflicted by iconaclastic innovations, this is the same ole same ole Vatican II \\"stuff.\\""},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"Overall I think it is really quite thorough and ought to serve for a long time to come.Things I like:1. The separate service for Vigils and Lauds; None of my other prayer books do this, and I like it.2. The longer readings for Vigils and the non-Biblical readings;there are some really great readings there from the Christian ancients.3. The Psalter and supplemental psalter in moderately inclusivelanguage (but see below).4. The hymnody integrated with the psalter (one less page flip than I was expecting to have to make!), with some really nicely written hymns. Many are English translations of ancient latin hymns.5. Most of what is needed in the psalmody so that I don't have toflip back and forth between the common and the psalter too often. I especially like the common canticles printed in card stock at the front and back of the book, making it easy to get to.6. The faithfulness to the Rule's intention, though obviously updated in many ways.7. The excellent cover, binding and 5 ribbons make it easier to use the book frequently.What I'm not so fond of:1. A fixed invitatory.2. A fixed Compline. Because I tend to have the most time at night, and am in the most prayerful \\"mood\\", having a fixed Compline is very disappointing (though traditional). One thing I've done is that I supplement the Compline with the next morning's Vigils. That seems to work out well for mesince I don't have enough time in the morning to do both Vigils and Lauds. I sometimes use either Celtic Daily Prayer (Northumbria), The Rhythm of Life (David Adam), Hour by Hour (from the BCP), or the Holy Cross Monastic Breviary during Compline because they all have certain variations to Compline.3. The \\"aid to praying benedictine prayer\\" in the opening pages and introduction is too short, repetitive, and really doesn't explain much for a person who doesn't already know how to do it. I can't overstate this. If you already know how to do the Liturgy of the Hours, you don't need this section, and if you don't, this section will not help you. You'll need help from someone who knows how to do it.4. The calendar is very full. I don't use very many of these, because I find them confusing, disruptive and additional page flipping. On the other hand, for those people who really dig that stuff, this is a real boon for them. On the plus side, major feasts are printed in all caps, making it easier to pick those out. Also as a plus, the readings for feasts are wonderful. Flipping through many sections (Proper of Saints, one of 3 Commons, and Festival Psalter), is not fun at all.5. The selection of additional prayers in the Appendix is much, much, much, much too short. In this regard, the Glenstal Book of Prayer, Work of God (Judith Sutera), Hour by Hour, and Monastic Breviary are all far better. I would have gladly given up a few pages of memorials to saints in favor of some additional prayers for occasions.6. While significant effort has been made to make the work ecumenical, some additional work could have been done to make it more so. It is particularly uncomfortable for those who struggle with Catholic mariology. You'll also notice readings from books that some protestants consider non-canonical. That's okay with me, but thought I'd mention it.7. The psalter, the supplemental psalms (available only for vigils and lauds), festival psalter and all others put together, still omit over 1/3 of the psalms. Including some of my very favorite ones. That's really too bad. It would have been better to include more psalms, over a 2-, 4- or 7-week cycle.8. It contains no traditional nor contemporary confessional prayers. I ended up pasting one into the back of the book. I consider this to be a signficant omission."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"This latest edition of the distinguished series of \\"Short Breviaries\\" ( a sort of oxymoron if you think of it) by St. John's Abbey is in some ways an answer to a need. The need for clerics, religious, and liturgically-interested laity to have at last an English language breviary with good English and a repect for Catholic and monastic tradition. Not here do we find that godawful \\"Morning; Mid-Morning; Noon; Afternoon;Evening;Night Prayers\\" but the traditional and already acceptably \\"Englished\\" Lauds;Terce;Sext;None;Vespers and Compline. We also find decent and pleasing translations of the actual liturgical hymns in the \\"Liturgia Horarum\\" NOT the gleanings of the 70's vintage LH which is still the only official English LH in the US. The Collects are also freshly translated in a more literal and beautiful English than we currently find in the official liturgical books. (On this, more anon.)In short, is this the ( in my opinion) long-awaited death-blow to ICEL and its monopoly?The book itself is literally and figuratively \\"handsome\\": it is pleasant to look at and fits rather nicely in one's hand.It is in my view amazing for the richness of content that it manages to pack into one volume in comparison with the cumbersome and bulky 4-volume LH.However...For those (like your servant here writing) of a more traditional RC bent there are the occasional shocks. The new Grail Psalter with its \\"horizontal inclusive\\" language can almost make one laugh with its dextrous acrobatics to avoid at all costs the use of the dreaded word \\"man\\" ( a fault shared in other places in the Book); the \\"litanies\\" of the ferial office composed by members of the Abbey community that ( in my opinion) are at times a little too psychological and individualistic for a liturgical book; not to mention political ( are \\"we\\" REALLY fostering intolerance and violence? ); and the occasional \\"howler\\" of a Collect. A prime example is the Collect for the Feast of the Transfiguration, August 6th, which is more more about Hiroshima than Tabor.There is also of course the question (forthrightly addressed in the introduction) of its non-canonical status for RC clerics and religious bound to the recitation of the Liturgy of the Hours.So, why do I use it, as dubious as I am?Well, I suppose, just the sheer joy of finding an English Breviary that I can hold in my hand, can pray and not be ashamed of; with none of the sadly time-worn gimmicks and dishonesties of the 70's ICEL 4-volume \\"jumbos\\". Also, the traditional Compline, the daily use of the Gradual Psalms in the \\"little hours\\"; and reasonably sized readings in \\"Vigils\\".I make up the defects for myself from the Latin LH and the \\"old Breviary\\" ( the \\"Preces feriales\\" cover all the territory nicely) when necessary; and leave the question of my \\"obligation to say the Office\\" to God and my confessor.Since I got this Book I've almost never missed a day; more than I could say before."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"Having prayed the official Liturgy of the Hours for four years, the general pattern of praying every morning and evening is built into me almost subconsciously. However, I do occasionally like to break with my routine to spice-up things a bit and come back to the LOTH fresh. Benedictine Daily Prayer is a nice way to do that. It's a fun way to keep my regular prayer habit while still trying something new and different.What I enjoy:1. BDP is beautifully bound with burgundy leather with the five color ribbon markers sewn right into the binding. This makes it more esthetically pleasing than my Christian Prayer breviary that is bound in vinyl with the ribbons connected to something that slips into the spine. The gospel canticles for lauds and vespers are printed in card stock in the back of the breviary, making them easy to find and unnecessary to use a ribbon to mark there place in the pages.2. The hymns are original and often end with the same trinitarian verse and \`amen', which I find to be a nice touch of monastic prayer. The structure of the psalter gives four psalms for each hour, which is a nice change from the usual three provided in the LOTH. It also has a good feel in the hands, a good sized type, and repeats the antiphons at the end of the psalm, preventing repetitive page flipping.3. The scripture readings are from the NRSV, a Bible translation I have used for years, and is also part of why BDP is more ecumenical than other breviaries.4. Uses the Sunday Gospel as one of the readings for vigils each Sunday, which I appreciate because I often like to read the passage before Mass.What I don't care for:1. The psalter is only one week long which means anyone using this breviary daily will probably want to graduate to a higher one at some point. There is a section for supplemental psalms to create a two week cycle of psalms but this is only provided for vigils and lauds. This repetition means BDP will probably never completely replace the Roman Breviary for me. However, the scripture readings are in a four week cycle and the antiphons for the gospel canticles, the intercessions, and the closing prayer are all in a two week cycle, preventing the repetition from getting entirely maddening.2. Though I enjoy having the weekly Gospel passages at my fingertips, I would prefer if this volume didn't have vigils at all. For someone like me who usually only says lauds, vespers, and an abbreviate compline, the readings and prayers for vigils only take-up space. Without them the book would be quite smaller and therefore easier to handle and store and carry on trips.3. Probably the most confusing part of this breviary is it's instructions on use. For someone starting cold on daily liturgical prayer a prayer partner would be needed to learn how to use this volume unless one if already familiar with the LOTH. Some of the closing prayers also have an awkward ending, with the last sentence being \\"This we ask of you.\\" For someone who isn't used to the common liturgical practice of collecting prayers with \\"We ask this through your son, our Lord Jesus Christ...\\" this abrupt ending would be a throw off.All in all I think BDP is a nice way to break from the official LOTH for those of us who are easily bored. It would also be a nice way to start the habit of praying throughout the day or something to try during Advent or Lent. I am still on the look out for a breviary that combines the seriousness of the Liturgy of the Hours but makes way for originality and contemporary language. BDP was a right step in that direction."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"This is a very well put together Daily Office. As a parish priest in the Episcopal Church I appreciate its ecumenical sensitivity and traditional liturgical piety. The readings for the sanctoral cycle are superb: instructional, inspirational, theological and pastoral. They provide a great resource for daily preaching. A great find for all who wish to pray in the spirit of the Rule of St. Benedict.If I were to change the book, I would have all 150 psalms included in the weekly cycle of prayer. I also would refrain from editing the psalms (the contemporary Roman usage eliminates the so-called \\"angry\\" verses and psalms from the liturgical psalter). This being said, I value the hard work of the Benedictine monks and oblates who made this short breviary for people who do not have the time to recite all 150 psalms in the course of one week and who might find \\"angry\\" psalms confusing and unsuitable for their personal prayer."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"I was disappointed when I received \\"Benedictine Daily Prayer.\\" I found the layout and typeface of this book less eye-friendly and far more complicated than either the one or the four volume editions of the Liturgy of the Hours. For a book of over 2000 pages, the selection of psalms is even more abridged, and certain of the \\"harshest\\" verses in some psalms e.g., 110 and 137 are censored without even noting it. Like most things in life, the page-flipping can be mastered, but if this is the only resource one uses for daily prayer a limited and biased view of God's word will eventually result as it violates the Benedictine principle of reciting the ENTIRE psalter over a period of time.On the plus side, it does include far more readings, both Biblical and non-biblical, than the one volume LOH, including writings from and about more recent and even occasionally non-Catholic saints. The intercessions are more timely for 21st century Christians. This book could work for those who don't care about the abridged psalter and want an expansive selection of readings in one volume.In short, I would use this as a resource for the readings and intercessions, and either a Bible or some other psalter scheme for a fuller psalmody."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"As someone with an abiding interest in the Benedictine rhythm of prayer, I've found this short breviary a useful tool for incorporating prayer and contemplation into my routine. The format is clear and much less confusing than more traditional breviaries; the propers for the seasons and saints are easy to follow with a little practice, and the Ordinary for the Liturgy of the Hours lays out the course of daily prayer in a clear, concise fashion.I personally enjoy the inclusive language of the Grail translation, even if it does make the psalms less quirkily beautiful than they are in the KJV or RSV versions. I do agree with other critics that the Benedictus and the Magnificat are poor prosaic paraphrases of the elegant poetry of scripture, but it's easy enough to paste alternative versions onto the breviary's endpapers.Prayer is work, and this short breviary helps make that work meaningful rather than merely frustrating. For those who find comfort in the structure of liturgy, this volume will be a welcome resource."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"The past seven years I have been searching for something to use for daily prayer that would join me with the community of believers who are praying the Liturgy of the Hours. Along the way I have found prayer books that work somewhat, but in Benedictine Daily Prayer I have found a home!I learned to pray the Divine Office aka Liturgy of the Hours as a Benedictine, and although I left community life nearly thirty years ago, I have not abandoned my monastic roots and the pursuit of God. Benedictine Daily Prayer brings together the Day Hours and the Office of Readings into one volume that is easy to use and aesthetically pleasing as well. It mixes contemporary with the historically familiar to form a text that has dignity and has enriched my prayer.One needs to adjust to the positioning of the ordinary and festal texts, but, quite frankly, I found that easy to do once I took the time to read the directions, no longer written in rubric red!I have also enjoyed the simplicity of the The Glenstal Book of Prayer and use that as a traveling companion , when I am away from home. Here Benedictine Daily Prayer is my breviary of choice."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"General comments: font is smaller than some might like or need. However, the book is imminently portable and a blessing to be all in one. Paper is of high quality, print is two colored, easy to read and the book is light weight. The leather is perfect, it lays flat in the hands.Weekly Psalter: Benedict set up the Monastic Breviary to say all 150 psalms in one week. The night office has 70, 10 a day. Because Vigils are abbreviated and have only three psalms, the \\"supplemental week\\" provides the reader an ability to recite more psalms. For an Oblate this is a perfect there are not that many lay persons who have time for the entire Vigils office.Canticles: Canticle of Zachariah Canticle of Mary translation, sigh... I didn't care for them. For me I used the Liturgy of the Hours translation for 10 years, I copyied the Common Texts 1 card and cut it down to size and added it to this book. If you haven't used anything else, this probably won't bother you.Proper of Saints: The Optional Memorials are reduced to a prayer, the readings for those Optional Memorials are not in this Breviary. However, a huge plus, there are Benedictine saints (i.e. St Walburga) and days (i.e. All Benedictine Souls) that you can only find in a Monastic Breviary/Diurnal. For an Oblate it is good because it focuses on the Benedictines. Much like the Carmelites or Franciscans who have their own Propers that they can use to augment their Lauds/Vespers.Readings: Excellent! The NRSV is superior to the NAB. However, the readings do not correspond to the Liturgy of the Hours, or the lectionary. The bonus is the Sunday Gospel readings are the new three year cycle (A, B, C). This is wonderful. The reader is able to link the Vigil reading to the Sunday reading and a following patristic reading. The patristic reading doesn't follow the Liturgy of the Hours book, however it is a higher quality translation. Other than the Sunday readings there are two Scriptural readings, in the Hours book there is a Scriptural reading and a patristic reading. For an Oblate who might not be Catholic I see this as a bonus because it comes off as less \\"Catholic\\". For an Oblate, this fits so well with the Rule, and Lectio Divina. I love the Scriptural focus, it provides an opportunity to read more Scripture in daily prayers.Overall: Well worth the price.

Even those under RCC oversight now have no \\"official\\" LTOH. Through consultation with the Confederation, abbies more or less adapt a LTOH to their special needs, locations and ministries. For monks in an abbey, this can be seen as a great and good thing (if the abbot is strong and maintains true Christian teachings) and this volume supports a modicum of flexibility.Good: It's simpler to use. That means oblates and pious individuals can eventually use it without having to be in choir for \\"follow the leader\\".Good: The Propers of the Saints (calendar) is really full. I'm always in favor of holding up real examples of real people who loved the Lord.Bad: The gender-neutral Psalms are a distraction. Seriously, OK? The contortions necessary to avoid writing \\"Him, His, He, Father, Son\\" and so on are painfully obvious and it really does cause a moment's distraction during the reading. Instead of having our mind on God, it's yanked back to a thought of political correctness. What WERE they thinking?Bad: You want rubrics? Want to know when to stand or sit? Want to know how to spot an abbreviation that isn't obvious? Want to know how to resolve Occurrences and Concurrences and how to do a Commemoration? Well, I suspect everyone who bought this book wants the same, too. You see, it's all missing. If you have another breviary, or the popular Monastic Diurnal, or are lucky enough to be near a place where you can actually join in choir, then you can really make use of this volume. Otherwise, you just sort of make it up. Do what seems right, yeah? Read a little here, a little there. Sure, you can get the day of the week right. You can get the hour right. But is it a ferial or festal? Is there a Proper of the saint if tomorrow's Sunday and it's the beginning of an octave? Do you Commemorate instead? Etc. It just ain't in here, folks, and this is one seriously, glowing ommission. The introduction says to scan the common Weekly Pslater and somehow you'll just catch on. Right. I have some ocean-front propery in Dustbowl, OK, to sell to the editor who wrote that one!All-in-all I think it's a great attempt to simplify, but sadly the gender-neutral Psalms and complete lack of rubrics were serious mistakes. Beginners will have to choose: make up your own rubrics, or, seek help from an abbey or one of the other LTOH books, such as the Anglican Breviary or Monastic Diurnal."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"The book isn't bad; it is well made, the many ribbons are really helpful, and most of the text is ok. However, the prayers aren't what you would expect to read.

Very easy to use if you know the pattern of the Hours...will require some patience if you don't, though the instructions are clear. Recommend you log on to a BLOG Site called the Anchoress--Google the title, will take you right there. Her recommendation led me to the book initially.From the Anchoress...This new Breviary - which the authors are quick to assure is not meant to replace either Christian Prayer or the 4-volume Divine Office, does give Oblates and other Christians inclined to pray the Office an alternative. (Many, many Benedictine Oblates are Lutheran, Episcopalian, Methodist, etc). Structured along monastic lines, the book contains excellent instructions for use, and brings wonderful new readings - both biblical and non - to the fore. I was especially pleased to read John Paul II's remarks at the canonization of Edith Stein, which were very inspiring. This volume also contains the writings of Catherine of Siena, Therese of Lisieux, Theresa of Avlia and many more women (not simply those three doctors of the church). And it brings you Vigils...the long watch of the night - the longest of offices, but also quite lovely.I am slipping this volume into my bookshelf, because I'm liking it very much, and I think many of you will, too, whatever your denomination. The editors did keep non-Catholics in mind when they put this terrific prayerbook (a nice size, too - it feels good in the hands) together."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"Benedictine Daily Prayer: A Short Breviary, stands in the line of 'short breviaries' that have been produced by the Liturgical Press since the mid-20th century. Their aim is to make the Divine Office more accessable to laity (with a particular aim, in this edition, to Benedictine Oblates). This book succeeds to a moderate level.The layout is very crisp and easy to follow, and the book itself is simply gorgeous. There is a minimal amount of page turning, and there is a great depth of Scripture and Patristic Readings presented, considering it is intended to be a 'short' breviary. The intercessory litanies are often quite nicely done, the translation of the Ambrosian office hymns is exquisitely done (and in modern english, with most of them being without a hint of the problematic Filioque tendencies that some translations of these hymns have), and the prayers for some of the saints days are thought provoking, though obviously influenced by Roman theology and thought.Sadly, the terrible translation of the Canticles, the use of the NRSV, and the gender-neutral revision of the Grail psalms takes away my enthusiasim for this book. Also, it's rather limited single week format for the psalms is somewhat lacking, both in number and in variability, though I realize that a fixed weekly recitation of the Psalter was Benedict's norm.I would prefer using this book as a supplement to the single-volume Christian Prayer, but not independently. Still, it is a worthy effort, even if I happen to feel it still falls short."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"Although the Liturgy of the Hours will vary with geographic location, Abbey affiliation and religious denomination, \\"Benedictine Daily Prayer\\" offers those wishing to share the Divine Office with monks, sisters, and other religious around the world a way to do so that is very close to traditional monastery prayer life. Anything more would probably be too burdensome for the lay person.While difficult to understand the rhythm of the prayers at first, perseverance is rewarded by confidence, comfort and a reality check spread throughout the day that brings us back to our Lord from the rat-race of the secular world.Get it. Pray it."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"This very handy and complete Breviary is, with a little patience and study, available for use immediately for those who follow a seven office prayer time outside the monastery or convent. Very good summary of the history of breviaries and the instructions are quite helpful, too. Convenient locations of common prayers and the saints days are a great compliment. No need for another book with the exception of daily Gospel readings. But so many readings from the Fathers and Mothers of the Church are included and latin titles for hymns, plus Marian hymns at the end of Compline. I've not seen a better or easier to use Breviary."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"This is an excellent alternative to the standard Roman book of Christian Prayer, which some people find unapproachable. It is well bound and the ribbons are sturdy. I have never been exposed to the Liturgy of the Hours before and it was fairly easy to figure out using this breviary...no small feat. Buy this book or the book of Christian Prayer; either help us to meet the exhortation of Paul that we pray without ceasing."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"Almost Wonderful.I may be in a minority concerning the mad dash towards inclusive language. I see the point to a degree but not to inconsistent translation of the same word according to personal preference. Having got that out of my system this is a very nice breviary. The quality of the binding is good and the text easy to read even for old eyes like mine. A pretty good attempt to be faithful to the Holy Rule all in all, considering there is no Hour of Prime and the Hour of Vigils is severely truncated from the twelve psalms called for. Still, Benedictine Daily Prayer is easy to use and is set up roughly according to what St. Benedict envisioned, I think. There are some very good Readings that are a break from the LOH. I would probably give it 4 stars if it weren't for the weak translation, for instance the Benedictus and the Magnificat. I copied them on cards from the RSV version and keep them in the front and back of the book. If the RSV had been used for the text, to my way of thinking I would have gladly given a 5 star rating. A good way to pray the Divine Office, roughly according to Benedictine tradition, if you are familiar with stronger translations. Nothing in Benedictine Daily Prayer is contrary to the Catholic faith, that I am aware of."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"This book is very comprehensive. It contains a 4 week psalter for morning and evening prayer and has the other offices, too. There are plenty of additional readings for holy days and for easter and lenten seasons. I think it's excellent for oblates. There is a minimum of 'flipping' involved. It has a great Benedictine feel to it. The litanies (intercessions) are more user centred, eg to pray for the lonely and sick. You're left feeling satisfied when you use it."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"\\"Benedictine Daily Prayer, A Short Breviary\\" is an excellent resource for daily contemplative and corporate prayer.

(5) Opportunity to try something new if bored with LoTH?!Con's: (1) Uses the Grail Psalter - blahhhhhh! (2) Uses NRSV translation for scriptural texts! Blahhhhhh! Just say it....'man', not 'person'. Inclusive language will be the death of linguistic beauty former generations cherished. I am not happy with the ICEL's bland translation of the LoTH by CBP, but it is more the norm in the Church and provides greater variety of readings. It was said of ICEL \\"Half know Latin, but know no English...the other half know English, but know no Latin!\\" But I digress...(3) Does not provide all psalms of the psalter, only 100 or so! And many of those have been redacted and shortened. (4) The compiler/editor is a Lutheran! No offense, I want my Catholic stuff from faithful Catholics! He may play with the Benedictines up in Minnesota but that doesn't make him suited to compile and offer texts for Catholics to use. (5) Uses a one week psalter instead of two (or four if you prefer). (6)Done in conjunction with Benedictines in Collegville, MN. They are not a hotbed for strict liturgical orthodoxy.

This reviewer would rather take things from a personal standpoint.Those who are familiar with the official Liturgy of the Hours will find some slight differences, such as structure and translation. Those familiar with the Benedictine world will not be surprised by such a variance: every monastery is just a bit different from another; this breviary is in that line of thinking.The 1-week psalter scheme, including the Supplementary Psalter for Vigils and Lauds, follows the Rule of St. Benedict rather closely. This yields insight into the genius of Benedict himself. The 1-week cycle (even when using the Supplementary Psalter) gives a rhythm to the week, outlined in Sr. Joan Chittister's commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict. Once one gets into that rhythm, the Psalms suddenly become a companion during the week: something to look forward to for solace, or sometimes to dread for their stark challenge to our limited, yet-to-be-converted views of our daily life. Monotony gives way to depth, where God is truly found; this is the foundation of the Benedictine Way.The readings for Vigils can be used in the context of Vigils, or, as the editor points out, can be used instead of the Short Readings at Lauds and Vespers, in the tradition of \\"lectio continua\\", or a continuous reading of biblical books. The non-biblical readings for Vigils are excellent. They give one abundant material for reflection, both from ancient and modern authors, very much in line with the intent of St. Benedict in his Rule.Although the translations of the Canticle of Zechariah and the Canticle of Mary (and Canticle of Simeon) are from ICEL, with a certain bullet-like brevity to the text, it somehow just seems to fit the rest of the breviary. One could easily substitute them with the ICET translations from the official Liturgy of the Hours.This breviary is excellent. It is very user-friendly. Oblates will find it helpful incorporating it in their daily lives without much burden. Although the variety in the Psalm schema is limited, one is invited to a greater depth of the psalms themselves. After all, what good is using the entire psalter for a non-monastic for the sake of variety, when one could use a limited psalter that plunges one into the depths of God?"},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"I did not find the instructions on how to use the Brievary very \\"user friendly\\", but after some instruction from my pastor, I found the Brievary fairly easy to use. I pray the Brievary for Lauds, Vespers and Compline and look forward to that time spent with the Lord and the Psalms, which He, and centuries of Jews and Christians have prayed. I would urge others to make/take the time to pray the daily Liturgy of the Hours. I even gave up my treasured Magnificat magazine to spend time with the Benedictine Daily Prayer!"},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"This is a great book for those who don't have the time to read the entire Liturgy of Hours each day.

I can find my way around with a marker for the Proper.The readings are good selections from a wide range of ancient and contemporary authors. I look forward to discovering who I will be hearing from each day.While the title suggests there may be a strong Benedictine background, I have not detected it even though that was what originally attracted me to this book. I would recommend this for anyone looking to step up to a daily pray discipline."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"A beautiful concept.

There are only about 100 of the total 150 prescribed by the Rule of St. Benedict and some of them are shortened. When the publisher calls this a short breviary he doesn't come right out and say that it is brief in the psalm complement, and in fact you will not find a psalm list in the index. The introduction of the breviary cleverly skirts the issue with a little deft word play. Why not just come out and say it. It's a waste of money. I'll stick with the LOTH and fiddle to read the whole psalmody with my bible. Why doesn't someone make a decent breviary with a two week psalmody?"},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"When I was a graduate student, I began to make a habit of going to the Episcopal cathedral that was next to campus and saying matins; when I had late classes, I would also show for vespers. When I graduated, it was necessary for me to be in my office before the fixed time for the hours to be recited, despite the fact that I was still right next door to the cathedral. I'd had some contact with Dr. Johnson when I worked on my MA thesis, so I was excited to see a breviary with his name attached to it (I actually bought a copy the first day it came out). After some fitful starts, I began using it more or less regularly. However, after some time, I felt something was missing. Specifically, I had become used to the canticles that the BCP provides for the major offices and really felt something was left out by omitting them from Lauds and Vespers in the Benedictine Daily Prayer. Certainly, there are hymns built right into the liturgy (some very wonderful ones, I might add), but it still would have been nice to see the biblical songs given a place of prominence, even if just as an option. Of course, I don't know if this would have ever even been a consideration since I am unfamiliar how prominent a place canticles have in LOH, but here again, it would have been nice."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"Benedictine Daily Prayer: A Short Breviary is a jam-packed, unofficial, yet thoroughly well-structured and wealthy prayer resource.

It includes all the lesser hours that Benedictines use according to their particular community. My favorite parts of this prayer resource are the sections for saints' days, feasts, and vigils.

I have been an Oblate for more than 20 years and was a Brother at a midwestern monastery for two years.The good:1-Uses the Benedictine calendar for the celebration of the Saints (I still use this book so I can celebrate those feasts and memorials).2-Psalmody laid out more in line with monastic ideals.3-The included hymns are wonderful.4-It it easy to hold and once you get used to how it is set up, easy to use.5-I like having the Te Deum, Te Decet, Magnificat, and Benedictus on card-stock at the front and back of the book.6-Having the option of using the scripture readings for the Office of Matins as-is, or reading the longer versions using a bible (as noted in the book).The not-so-good:1-I found the some of the translations to be awkward and hard for me to pray.2-I would have liked to see a full two-week Psalter.3-I actually found it to be longer than the Roman LOTH, because it uses more Psalms per hour (which sometimes isn't good if I am in a hurry to get to work.4-I would have preferred the second reading for Matins to be non-scriptural as it is in the regular LOTH (and as it is at the monastery where I am an oblate and where I was a member).Overall, a very good one-volume LOTH book for anyone who wishes to pray in a more monastic manner."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"Benedictine Daily Prayer .......As I start writing this review I have to acknowledge the reviewer above, the one from Kansas, whose perceptive and insightful comments got him a whole big bunch of positive helpful votes which he richly deserves. I would like to do more or less the same kind of comparison review zeroing in on some other features of the book in question that he may have overlooked or that did not seem important to him. Surely I will also overlook a few. Let me start out by going over, briefly, the history of my relationship with formal, official prayer over a few decades.Since I am a layperson I have no \\"canonical\\" obligation to use any particular prayer format but I have been using the Liturgy of the Hours for daily prayer since about 1980 when I came upon the one-volume edition published by the Daughters of Saint Paul (Paulines). Even though I have no special love for that group of reactionary church ladies, I must admit that they do produce very good books. And besides, as they worked on this one, they had the excellent liturgical and theological advice of the late Archbishop of Hartford, Connecticut, John F. Wealon. The book is called Christian Prayer and the copy I have is leather bound. I don't know if it is real leather or imitation. It doesn't much matter.This book is by no means beautiful but it is consummately useful. ... or maybe just functional, which is all I really want. As you open it randomly you think the type (fonts?) would be more appropriate for a quarterly report from a large corporation ... maybe one that manufactures clothes hangers. It is not at all attractive and doesn't look even remotely religious. But prayer books don't have to be \\"pretty,\\" do they? In any case, when you begin to use it on a daily basis you start to not care at all about how the printing looks. It is set up in such a way that only an idiot would have trouble using it. The psalms are done in bold print, easy to see and easy to read and before each one, besides the antiphon, there is a short sentence in very small type, either scriptural or patristic, that points up the Christological dimension of the psalm's meaning. The hymns are in larger print and not in bold, but very easy to make out.After each psalm there is a psalm-prayer, which I have discovered is a peculiarity of the American-English editions. The editions I use in French and Spanish do not have this feature, and my Australian friends who pray the Divine Office are amazed that our editions contain such a feature. But this is not an American invention. You find it described in The General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours. It is just that publishers in other countries have had the sense to ignore it.Also, during Ordinary Time you don't have to do any page-turning when you get to the Benedictus in the morning or the Magnificat in the evening. They are both printed out as part of the hour in very small print presumably because the publishers think you have seen and said it so many times you know it by heart so you don't have to run your eyes over every syllable every day.For the Invitatory before the first office of the day you have to go to the Ordinary and select one of the psalms given there along with seasonal antiphons. In Benedictine Daily Prayer (=BDP) you don't have a choice ... you have to be content with just Ps. 95 which is called Ps. 94 because the book uses the \\"other\\" numbering system, and you select the antiphon according to the day of the week. The wording of the psalm is also different from (and not nearly as beautiful as) what they offer in the Pauline edition.In fact there are several places where the language in this book seems to be excessively experimental. Let's compare the two publications on Ps. 95.The Pauline edition says:Come let us sing to the Lordand shout with joy to the Rock who saves us.Let us approach him with praise and thanksgivingand sing joyful songs to the Lord.And here is how BDP renders the same four lines:Come ring out our joy to the Lord;hail the rock who saves us.Let us come before him, giving thanks,with songs let us hail the Lord.The BDP rendering is flat and seems to ignore the genius of English poetic rhythms. Its diction appears also to be un-English. But in these two regards the Gospel canticles (Benedictus and Magnificat) are even worse. They are so poorly done that I pasted a photocopy from the Pauline edition over each of them.Instead of the psalms arranged in the four-week cycle as prescribe by Vatican II documents BDP still uses a one-week cycle. For the midday hours it uses sections of Ps.119 on Sunday and Monday, and the gradual psalms the rest of the week. This is kinda hard to get used to.Allowance must be made for the fact that we are dealing with two separate liturgical traditions. BDP comes from the monastic tradition in which no attempt is made to group psalms around a common theme that is often reflected also in the reading. The \\"cathedral\\" (Roman) tradition does offer the kind of thematic arrangement. The monastic office starts with the early psalms and reads them (or sings them) straight through up to Psalm 150 without regard to what the psalm says.In favor of BDP I have to say that it is very good to have all the daily readings for the predawn office (vigils or office of readings) for the entire liturgical year between two covers, something you don't get in the Pauline edition (but there is a nicely done companion volume that does contain the entire hour). But, here again, one has to wonder why these particular readings were selected for BDP. Maybe I am just too accustomed to the arrangement of one biblical reading followed by a non-biblical selection.Let me oint out that while the intercessions in the Pauline edition are very good (used by most of the English-speaking world), those in the BDP are a lot better. I am puzzled by the comments of one reviewer who said they are too psychological and individualistic. Not at all. They are frequently beautiful as they search for the roots of many of today's social ills.In any case, after using the BDP for six months I went back to the Pauline edition and have stayed with it ever since. Maybe I'm not monastic enough."},{"Title":"Benedictine Daily Prayer","review":"I want to like this breviary! It is attractively and sturdily bound. It is relatively easy to use. The text is readable and the pages sturdy enough to withstand regular use. It is a great introduction to the Daily Office for someone searching for a gently ecumenical approach.So what is there not to like? The original version of the Grail Psalter is a banal and painfully anachronistic creature of the 1960's, and the inclusive language version included in this breviary is not an improvement. The textual gyrations to avoid any mention of gender (especially male) are distracting and frequently awkward.The readings included for the office of Vigils are another failing of this edition. The Liturgy of the Hours typically uses in this office one scriptural reading and one reading from a non-scriptural but related reading from within the church tradition (often a father of the church). This is a useful and edifying approach in that there is some unity of theme and the reader is exposed to two approaches to the topic at hand. This breviary opts (on weekdays) in favor of parallel, sequential reading of unrelated scriptural texts, much like the current Episcopal daily lectionary, which often leaves you thinking more about the dissimilarity between the readings and trying to remember what happened in yesterday's reading rather than thinking about the readings at hand.My final complaint is that the biblical text in the Vigils readings is often identified as being a particular range of verses, e.g., Acts 10:1-20, but upon closer examination, it is clear that text has been left out of the readings. Why not be upfront and identify the omissions rather than misrepresenting the completeness of the readings offered?No matter how winsomely packaged, I recommend that the reader seeking a one-volume breviary considerChristian Prayer: Liturgy of the Hours - Black Leatherfrom Catholic Publishing Company, or its shorter companion, \\"Shorter Christian Prayer: The Four-Week Psalter of the Liturgy of the Hours Containing Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer,\\" rather than this expensive volume.Update 05/23/12: I notice that some of you do not think that this review is helpful.

Not only is it a very reliable edition (typical with C.F. Peters), it also is that much the more valuable for including the editorial markings and suggestions of an important Wagnerian conductor of 100 years ago by the name of Felix Mottl; it's very obvious that he knew his stuff!!!! To boot, the fonts and engravings are such that one just CAN'T fault it other than what I've described above.Very warmly recommended!! [For those who want a fully-modern edition featuring all of what I'd like, one has to get Schott's current edition which, although indeed the very best one for both study and for conducting from (especially in terms of size - though it's amply possible to direct from this edition, so clear it happens to be!), is also fantastically expensive!

One can find the direct influences on, for example, Claude Debussy and Gustav Mahler. The \\"Tristan chord\\" reverbrates throughout literature, has become a literary formula in itself.I have many of the Wagner scores out of simple curiosity; I don't claim to have the musical expertise by which I could either play or conduct any of the masterpieces. But they are often fascinating to follow while listening to the operas.This score is structured in the traditional format. But for me it's particularly valuable because I can see that \\"Tristan chord\\" over and over. I may even transcribe some of the music so that even as unaccomplished a musician as I can play it.I long to follow this again and again too, along with the several recordings of I have of \\"Tristan und Isolde.\\"Further, the art on the cover is the same as that on the Bernstein recoring my spouse gave me for Christmas several years ago.Finally, several of us were quizzed at a \\"Tristan\\" seminar. The questioner suggested that every single insrument of the orchestrat plays the final chord of the opera...except one. I remembered that the first time I saw this opera, the English horn player was out of the pit during the opening of the third act. Hmmm. It seems like the English horn stands out in other ways too.

It requires large orchestral and vocal contributions, and its score offers nearly as much music as Beethoven's 9 symphonies. The Dover edition is a thick 655 page volume in which there are as many as 24 separate instrumental lines for the 100 orchestral players, plus three or four for the singers. It is 655 pages long, 8.5 by 11 inches in extent, roughly the size of the Tampa Bay Metro (pop 3.3 million) phone book. Its size allows the type to be easily read and the music to be followed when listening to a recorded source, for example, and to be easily read and understood in almost any context, other than that of actually conducting a performance. It is obviously not intended for the local high school musical, though (and I am not just making this up) an amateur Tarpon Springs (pop.20,000) music group recently staged a complete performance of Wagner's four Ring Operas, with piano musical accompaniment this year! If you're determined to go this route with Tristan, you need this score, badly! I have found it useful in my role as record reviewer, in resolving certain difficult questions I have come up against here and there in this deep and difficult work. Indeed, it is fine for anyone who has any unresolved question about the music. It is sturdily paperbound, and it is well worth the modest asking price. Much of the text, however, is reprinted directly from German sources, so an elementary understanding of that language is helpful.That is all I can think of on the downside, and in summary I found this work not only authoritative but also user-friendly.There is one final matter to be noted. The source copy for this edition was originally the property of the well-known 19th century conductor Felix Mottl. Mottl made a comprehensive series of suggestions to enhance the effectiveness of presentation of the music in actual performances. These helpful suggestions are systematically identified by the letter B in this edition of the score.

In fact, it holds a unique place in operatic history; it has inspired the thinking of philosophers, even scientists, just as works such as Oedipus Rex, Hamlet and Don Giovanni had done before. No opera lover's book shelf is complete without a copy of this score. Dover's edition is a reprint of the reliable C.F. Peters edition from the early twentieth century. The scholarship is highly reliable as is generally true with Peters, especially with Peters' German scores. There is an English translation of all German frontismatter, but no glossary of German musical terms. The cover art for this edition is Der Kuss in Gustav Klimt, an art work as erotic and disturbing as this Opera is. The score is too big, and the book too small for podium use, but it is perfect for at home.

One would think another book should at least have one story that hasn't been published elsewhere."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"I am a huge fan of all the Sharpe stories, and especially the audio books. This one was especially well done by a new reader.As to the book itself, I found it rather odd. This book has three parts, but unlike his other novels they are three separate, unrelated parts.Part 1 deals with a skirmish in which Sharpe is marooned and has to survive with an annoying superior. This is fine and good, and quite amusing in places.Part 2 deals with clandestine operations in Cadiz with Sharpe being involved to get things set right. Also a good part, and probably my favourite.Part 3 deals with the Battle of Barossa. This part is exceptionally well told and is one of his best battle depictions.The problem is that the three parts have virtually no linking between each other. The villain of part 2 only appears there and vanishes again, being handed off with two sentences in the last paragraph. The villain of part 1 also vanishes until the very end...and there is little closure there.It's like the author wrote three short stories and nailed them together with little relationship between them. Odd sequences such as the fire raft battle also seem stuck in and not very well fitted in.Overall, it's a fine book, but the three parts of the book is confusingly disjointed."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"This is one of the more self-indulgent in the Richard Sharpe series about a roguish British rifleman during the Napoleonic wars. It could also have been more accurately titled \\"Sharpe Gets Really P.O.'ed,\\" since that's more or less the theme. It's a boring period in the French siege of Lisbon, so Sharpe's light company is detailed to escort a party sent to destroy a pontoon bridge near Cadiz, down in the corner of Spain. Things go wrong and the captain and five of his men are carried downstream on a runaway section of the bridge, have to flee farther south to avoid capture, and end up in blockaded Cadiz itself. Sharpe's more fundamental talents are called on to help the governor recover some incriminating love letters, but Cornwell kind of leaves that section of the story hanging. Sharpe then takes his squad off to get involved in the Battle of Barrosa, just down the peninsula from town, in what he admits is not his fight. But the author wants to tell the story of Sir Thomas Graham, a real-life hero who humiliated the French with less than half as many troops, so there we are. The battle itself is described with Cornwell's usual brio and close attention to important detail, but the book wouldn't have been long enough with just that -- hence the blackmail conspiracy. I'm continually amazed that the French -- especially Napoleon, who was far from stupid in military matters -- never caught on that arraying their battalions in column instead of widespread lines prevented most of their troops from being able to fight at the same time. Had they adopted the British infantry line, to which they lost battle after battle, the French would probably have taken and held all of Europe. Anyway, we never do find out what happened to Lieut. Bullen, except that he's apparently a POW at the end of the book. And I also have doubts that a brigadier would have been put in charge of such a small party on such a relatively minor errand."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"I would tell you to skip this book, but you deserve to read the wonderful story of the Battle of Barrosa which the British won single-handed against horrible odds while the Spanish troops rested nearby. In the real-world history of the Peninsular Wars, this was the occasion when the British first claimed a French Eagle.Before that, the book opens with a sequence where Sharpe is treated badly by a new foil, Brigadier Moon, who doesn't want any competition for credit from Sharpe. Naturally, it all comes apart and Sharpe has to save the day . . . but at what cost to his pride and to himself?Eventually, Moon, Sharpe, Sergeant Harper, and a few men reach Cadiz, which is the tiny remnant of Spain that is not under French dominion. The Spanish expect Cadiz to fall soon to the surrounding French, and British influence is at a low ebb. Further problems arise when the British ambassador (Lord Wellington's younger brother, Henry Wellesley) finds himself being blackmailed and embarrassed by some letters he wrote to a woman he believed to be a Spanish lady, but who was not. Sharpe is pressed into temporary duty to pay the blackmailer. If that doesn't work, he's expected to steal the letters. The intrigue involves the future of Spanish politics as well as British-Spanish relations.The opening sequence ends up being more interesting than it starts, but Brigadier Moon is more of an annoyance than a real threat to Sharpe . . . which undercuts the power of the story. The intrigue in Cadiz would be good if this were primarily a spy series, but it's not. So the intrigue mostly distracts from the opportunity to write more about the Battle of Barrosa, which is a far more interesting tale.Sometimes authors can try to be too clever and hurt their books. I fear that's what Mr. Cornwell did here.If you find your interest waning in the beginning or middle, just skip ahead to the part where the British and Spanish leave Cadiz by sea to attempt to attack the besieging French from behind."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"Sharpe's Fury: Richard Sharpe & the Battle of Barrosa, March 1811 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #11)"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"Bernard Cornwell writes fast. That's nine parts good--we get to read lots of his work--and one part bad--if we read his work fast, we find a bit of formula, a touch of repetition. And it's difficult not to grab everything he does as soon as it's out.He's good.Historical fiction, if it's action fiction, or military historical fiction, has a peculiar requirement.It is the fate of most soldiers, in any war, to spend the bulk of their campaign plodding along, watching the pack of the soldier in front of them. Eventually, they fight. But fights have small, furiously intense scenes, if the soldier wants to survive.My father, an Infantry officer from WW II, can tell you a great deal about WW II in Europe, along a path, as he says, three hundred miles long and three hundred yards wide.It would be difficult to write a novel about Waterloo from the point of view of an artillery battery commander who sees troops to his front, or not, fires, or not, is wreathed in blinding smoke, is frantically trying to make up gun teams as casualties mount, and won't know who won for at least a day. It would be a fascinating story, primarily for those whose ancestors have cocked the cannon for generations. But not for many others.Historical fiction protagonists must, to see the things and participate in the action that the story offers the reader, move across events, rather than along with them as a soldier in a column must.Cornwell is particularly good at this. His Sharpe character is involved in small-unit actions, is cut off behind enemy lines, is chosen for special independent missions either because he's good at it or because the more socially connected in the Mess can do without him.In the run-up to the Battle of Assaye, Sharpe does not move with his regiment, but instead is assigned to aid and protect a wandering intelligence officer from the East India Company, thus taking him crosslots to the events of the period.In Cornwell's Saxon chronicles, Uhtred has several things going on which would not be likely for the Saxon warriors. He has a small patrimony of land of which he should be chief but has been robbed of it by the Danes. He wants it back. He fights for Alfred against the Danes. He is sometimes given independent tasks taking him far from the center of power--and back again. He is almost pathologically stubborn and defiant of authority. And Uhtred is not following the pack of the Saxon warrior in front of him, marching back and forth across England, trying to fend off the Danes.So, with Sharpe, and Uhtred, and the English archer in the Hundred Years War, Cornwell moves his characters across events, giving us clear, well-researched views of how the world of that time worked and looked.Cornwell's characters are introspective, without losing the power of instantaneous decisiveness. Some of what they do appears ruthless, and from our(for now) more civilized viewpoint, unnecessarily cruel. But a moment's thought will indicate that there was no other choice.In this case, Sharpe, left with a few Riflemen inside a besieged city for perfectly understandable reasons, becomes the point man for some serious intrigue. He hides, surveys, bribes, steals, kills and generally saves the part of the day which needed saving. His relationships with historical figures seem realistic.True to Cornwell's practice, we see at least one small battle or raid, almost a military procedural, and then the book ends with a huge, decisive battle--a real one--in which Cornwell partly abandons Sharpe's point of view to give the reader a broader view of the fight.It must be said that Cornwell loves the British soldier and, in this final battle, the author drops Sharpe altogether while he describes the fighting and the soldiers who struggle with such incredible courage.His practice of providing an afternote on the historical details he's used in his books is invaluable. It demonstrates that, although he is fast, he works very hard at his craft.There is no reason to think he gets it wrong."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"Cornwell has produced another great novel with Sharpe and Harper.

I'm actually having a hard time believing Cornwell wrote this one. Cornwell has a certain style and vision with regard to Sharpe and this book in not at all consistant with his other writings.Cornwell's books, even some of the not so great ones, all have a readability and flow to them. Sharpe's Fury does not.I don't want to discourage anyone from reading Cornwell (the Sharpe books and Arthur tales in particular) because they are outstanding. But this book is poorly written and not indicitive of his real tallent.Mr. Cornwell, if this is the type of Sharpe book you are going to churn out in the future, please don't publish it. If you are using a ghost writer, as I suspect, get someone who has read all your stuff and loves the character as much as the rest of us do."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"I have loved the Sharpe series but most of the recent ones have dealt with his early days in India instead of the Peninsular campaign which is where most of the story takes place. This book represents a return to the \\"older\\" stories and it is a welcome return.The story is of the siege of Cadiz and the battle of Barossa. It takes place shortly after the Talavera story in which Sharpe captured a French eagle. In Sharpe's Eagle, Sharpe was credited with the first capture of a French standard. This story tells the story of the real first capture.While tasked to help blow up a bridge, a bumbling brigadier gets himself, Sharpe and his riflemen stuck on one of the pontoons drifting towards the sea. They make their way to Cadiz where the rump of the Spanish government is located. There, feelings are running high. Though the Spanish are now allied with the English, they are still bitter about their defeats when they were in opposition and mad about matters of Britain's foreign policy. There is a faction that wants to come to a settlement with Napoleon and that faction is doing anything to discredit the British. In particular, they have their sights set on the British Ambassador, the brother of Gen. Wellington. They have some of his letters and are threatening to publish them and embarrass the government. Sharpe is detailed to help buy them back from the blackmailers or steal them if he must.Other matters are brewing as well. The British garrison is preparing to sally forth to hit the French in company with their Spanish allies. The problem is that the Spanish contingent is larger so the Spanish general is in overall command. He is a coward and an inept one at that. He manages to get his forces cut off and then, when battle is joined, refuses to fight. He lets the Brits and Portuguese do the fighting. It is a desperate fight which the allies have no hope of winning but then history, and this book, tell a different story.This is a good story and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"Bernard Cornwell is a superb historical novelist. In \\"Sharpe's Fury,\\" the novel may be more satisfying if you read the \\"Historical Note\\" at the end of the book first. It is here that Cornwell describes his technique of taking the historical incident - the facts - and then outlines the embellishments he used to create the fictionalized story.The Battle of Barrosa Cornwell fictionalizes is really a historical footnote. But Cornwell's genius is his ability to make history come alive, whether it is early Saxon England or the 19th Century Peninsular War.Cornwell's vehicle is Richard Sharpe, a larger than life British thief turned soldier, the Duke of Wellington's ambassador brother who becomes involved with a Spanish courtesan, a stuffy British brigadier, a nasty French colonel, a murderous priest and many other characters.Cornwell weaves his history into the fiction. An imaginary affair between Henry Wellesley (Wellington's brother and ambassador to Spain) and a Spanish courtesan results in a blackmail plot using indisceet letters written by the ambassador.Sharpe is summoned, on the basis of his reputation for effective violence, to recover the letters. Cornwell builds a solid plot involving a murderous priest, an admiral hoping to restore the Spanish monarchy and the precarious relationship between Spain and England.There's a bit of invented or retold action here that depicts the nature of early 19th Century European war and, frankly, it is interesting.But the real action is the Battle of Barrosa. It was of moderate scale: about 10,000 French troops and perhaps 4,000 British troops - while several thousand incompetently led Spanish troops did nothing. Cornwell excels at describing the maneuvering of troops in the Napoleonic era, the ghastliness of battle, the incredible bravery of the troops and the victory acheived that day by the British, led by a particularly able general.This is definitely history \\"light\\" and Cornwell is to be commended for making history accessible to so many who otherwise might know nothing of the times he writes about. A great adventure novel as well as an engrossing history (as long as you know how to sort the history from the fiction).Jerry"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"The story was just what you'd expect a Sharpe series story to be: entertaining, and making you learn about the history of the Napoleonic wars while making you feel as if you were in the front lines.Note that this is the large print edition (I didn't notice or expect this when ordering it), which is mildly irritating to read if you are used to read books in regular font."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"From his Saxon Chronicles to Agincourt to the Sharpe series (approximately 21 books long plus short stories), Cornwell is a masterful writer of action and adventure. Richard Sharpe, a whore's bastard raised in the rough London streets, starts out as an English private serving in India in 1799, where he is flogged early on for trumped up charges. Despite his humble origins, one thing he excels in is fighting - he is a superb and lethal soldier - rising to the rank of sergeant. Fate brings him into contact on the battlefield with the future Lord Wellington, whose life he saves, earning him a commission to junior officer. This opens a whole new set of challenges, as he faces the distrust of his enlisted ranks and the disdain of his gentlemen officers. Sharpe's adventures take him through the Napoleonic Wars in western Europe and promotions through the ranks to regimental commander. There is abundant action, politics, brutal violence, sex, complicated plot lines and studies in human nature, all written in with gripping prose and attention to historical and military detail. At the end of each story, Cornwell summarizes the actual history into which Sharpe's adventures have been woven."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"I started reading the Sharpe series a few months ago in chronological order. I've got nothing special to say except that, as usual, Bernard Cornwell is able to maintain in Sharpe's Fury the same excellent quality presented in the previous books."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"This is another well written adventure in the Sharpe series which depict in an excellent fashion the British army and attitudes of both the officer class and the men of the army of this era. I enjoyed the realistic background that Bernard Cornwell has created for the continuing adventures of his hero, Sharpe. The battle scenes bring to vivid life the warfare of the Napoleonic era."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"This is Cornwell's 21st novel in his Richard Sharpe series. This prolific author has published nearly 40 historical novels. All of them are excellent. They are excellent reads. They are excellent literary works. They are excellently researched.I love history. I love reading good historical fictions, based on real events. I love reading anything written by Cornwell. I especially love reading his series featuring Richard Sharpe, during the Napoleonic Wars.Why? The writing is excellent. The story flows. The reader is eager to turn the pages. Three hundred plus pages pass by in mere hours with few breaks. The reader just wants to keep reading. One is drawn back into the past. One can feel the intrigue & smell the smoke of battle. BUT, besides that, Sharpe is a man other men aspire to be or become. List a whole plethora of positive values & they total Richard Sharpe.Loyal, humble, brave beyond measure, a great friend, up from the ranks, not pompous, not wordy, always willing to fight no matter the odds he faces, honest, loaded with common sense, & someone you want to have your back in any fight. Yet, he has his faults. He kills when he has to; sometimes with a bit too much relish. He steals when he has to; but, it always seems as if he's stealing for a good cause. He usually spits in the face of authority & they usually deserve it; yet, he can bend his knee to authority, when necessary.Sharpe is surrounded by a core group of supporting characters; from the always feisty Irishman, Sgt. Harper, to the rest of his green jacketed riflemen & even including periodic appearances by the Duke of Wellington who seems to regard Sharpe as a friend while the rest of the officers look down their noses at Sharpe because he's risen from the ranks & not born to privilege. I love character-driven novels. This recurring cast of characters in these Sharpe novels always add to my enjoyment. Cornwell is able to seamlessly add new characters into this group of regulars.This book again finds Sharpe in precarious situations, facing treachery & intrigue & then taking part in a battle where the British forces are vastly undermanned; yet manage to win - with Sharpe & his men always having a major part in the victory."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"In my opinion, Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe Series is one of the best examples of an historical novelist bringing the reader directly into the period and events of which he writes. I've, in the past couple of months, read all but the final three in the 20+ novels and hate it when I finish each one know that I'm coming to the end. But, I'll just wait a bit and go back and read 'em again.Had a similar experience with Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series.Interesting that both author chose to write mostly about the Napoleonic Wars."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"I stumbled on to the Sharpe series accidently. I have now read all 20+ and am working on the video series. The books are better, even though Sean Bean does a good job in the videos, he is not whom I pictured as Richard Sharpe. (Too short and too fair.) The books have some repetitive themes, the battle horrors, while accurate get a little tiresome when repeated so often, but then Cornwell didn't write them intending them to be read one after the other.As a history major I am very impressed with the research the author has done to make his novels so real. Tarring mustaches! I'd never heard of that. The action scenes are well written and the plots are mostly realistic, even though getting saved at the last minutes time after time stretches it. As I said, I'm sure these books were not meant to be read back to back to back.In all, worth the effort."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"As a new comer to Sharpe books, i have been reading them in chronological order. So this is #11 for me. I must say I love ALL the Richard Sharpe books - I am usually a sci fi fantasy reader but from the first Sharpe novel (Sharp's Tiger) I was hooked. The depth of detail, the smell of the battlefield, its all so very well done.I have to say however, this is my least favorite Sharpe book of the 11. It's not that bad - it's just not as good as the others. The main reason for this is that for some reason, Sharpe virtually disappears from the 2nd half of the book. More so than the past books, this is almost 2 very different books. The first half is all about Sharpe trying to recover stolen letters that are being used to blackmail an english ambassador. Once that's taken care of - the vantage shifts away from Sharpe and onto General Graham (a fine character to be sure) and Sharpe is only seen intermittently while the main battles rages. This confused me as all previous Sharpe books thrust our Captain right into the main events of the story. Usually Cornwell has no problem putting his fictional Captain right into the main events of battle - but for some reason Sharpe only hovers around the edge of this one. I found that odd.So, in the end my only complaint is not enough of our favorite rogue, Captain Richard Sharpe. Of course I'll be onto #12 soon enough."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"If you get up early in the morning for work, or to get the kids off to school, this book and other Cornwell books are not for you. They is are impossible to put down.They are proverbial page turners.My wife, here-to-fore, has been contented to read the \\"classics\\"; all of the English writers and most Vampire novels. Butnow, she can't put the Sharpe series down. My only regret is that we didn't find out about Cornwell earlier. Excellent writer."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"Even though Captain Sharpe and Sergeant Harper are part of this plot, it's quite evident that the true heroes of this story are the regular British soldiers. There is a sub-plot about some indiscreet letters, and the burning of fire rafts, but when it comes to the battle, the stars are the ordinary soldiers who chrarge up a hill against an entrenched enemy with overwhelming numerical superiority, and don't stop until they have routed them. Our heroes are somewhat incidental to the battle action, and the author makes quite clear in his writing who is to be praised for this close-run victory. Sharpe has had his moments of glory; it's now the turn of the regular soldiers to be justly praised for their courage and dogged determination to succeed against all odds."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"In fact, it may be his worst. As much as I love the 21 novels of the Sharpe series, this one shows signs of carelessness and indifference on the part of its author. The plot is loosely thrown together and the whore-pretending-to-be-respectable-and-snaring-a-British-officer theme is straight out of \\"Sharpe's Enemy\\". Cornwell is churning books out at a terrific clip with the \\"Lords of the North series\\", Sharpe, the Grail Quest and various singletons. Maybe it's time he took a rest or concentrated on one project."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"Good fall asleep reading, except you keep wanting to read another chapter.Bernard Cornwell continues his story about Richard Scharpe. Richard Sharpe is a fictional character in the tradition of the Horatio Hornblower series by CS Forrester. Instead of following the rise of a Navy midshipman rising through the ranks of the British Navy (interestingly following a similiar path as Nelson). Richard Sharp is a the soldier on the land directly fighting Napoleon. The story by itself is exciting and would be enough.For me the frosting on the cake is the way Bernard weaves the history into a fictional story. The reader comes away understanding Spain's attitude towards France. The fear the French had for the Spanish gurella fighters. The tensions and anger between the Spanish governments and England.It's also intrigueing to compare the foibles of a great man in the early 1800s and compare that with our political leaders today. I can imagine thier are men in Richard Sharpe's situation cleaning up political and other indiscretions in our time as well.Richard Sharpe is similiar to an 18th Century James Bond, though the gadgets are replaced with a determination, viscousness and raw edge not seen in Roger Moore's James Bond, that allows him to step across the grey areas of right and wrong. Instead focusing on staying alive and accomplishing a goal no matter how sordid or morally unclear.Enjoyed the book a great deal."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"another good one from cornwell. but he had to go into the past (of sharpe\`s) to do it. i hope he does one that will not go into sharpe\`s past. but ither way, we need more of shape"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"Bernard Cornwell's titanic Richard Sharpe series continues with its newest installment, \\"Sharpe's Fury.\\" The novel breaks no new ground for fans of the Sharpe series, and yet offers some of the most poignant and moving tributes to the bravery of the British soldier - both ranker and officer - found in Cornwell's novels. Sharpe does not get all the glory, but he gets his due.\\"Sharpe's Fury\\" brings to the fore several of Sharpe's main traits - he's a devil in a fight, he's carries a grudge with the best of them, and he's a low-down rogue and thief to boot. Sharpe is enlisted by Sir Arthur Wellesley's younger brother to do a bit of dirty work in the Spanish city of Cadiz . . . the younger Wellesley, a diplomat, foolishly committed his adoration of a local high-class prostitute to paper, and several Spanish operatives are extorting the ambassador. Sharpe and Harper find themselves working with the sinister British agent Pumphrey to steal the letters back, and find themselves up against a villainous Spanish priest who is as dastardly as they come.Sharpe also finds himself pinned against the sea by the French army, and while Sharpe sees his time on the battlefield, it is here where Cornwell turns the story over to some real-life British heroes. The British soldiers are ostensibly under the command of a local Spanish general, but this general is an insult to the Spanish people and is content to proceed on his cowardly way. As a result, the British army is forced to fight against impossible odds at the battle of Barrosa, and in this hugely violent battle, the outnumbered British do their nation proud. Cornwell's battlefield prose sings as only his can, and the thrills are matched only by the adoration with which Cornwell describes the valiant British army - cutthroats fighting alongside gentlemen - wage war against a vastly superior force.This book is a must for any fan of Richard Sharpe or Bernard Cornwell, and promises that Cornwell continues to fill in the gaps of the Sharpe narrative with spellbinding new additions."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"Another excellent adventure by Cornwell.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"As Cornwell explains in his always enlightening 'historical note' he visted the Barrossa battlefield while on a personal trip to Spain and thus Sharpe and Harper were sure to follow.Sharpe's Fury tells the tale of a crucial turning point in the Penninsular War against Napoleon's armies - the 1811 Battle of Barrossa. Spain (or the Spain that was allied with Britain) was reduced to a foothold in Cadiz. The British won (with virtually no Spanish help) and a tide was turned. The battle also featured the first 'eagle' (or cuckoo) taken by the British (Sharpe's Eagle notwithstanding).I've read nearly all the Sharpe books (as well several other Cornwell novels) and I found Sharpe's Fury to be every bit as good as any of the others (well, except maybe Sharpe's Fortress, a personal favorite). The book features an exciting retelling of a famous Napleonic battle with numerous real historical characters (Thomas Graham, Henry Wellesley, and Sgt. Patrick Masterson to name a few) and of course a beautiful and intelligent woman.Highly recommended for fans of Sharpe, historical action novels or the Napleonic wars."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"If you are a first time fan of the Sharpe series, I believe that you will enjoy this new addition to the much loved series. But as a long time fan, I felt somewhat disappointed in this book largely for 3 reasons:1. We have read this story before with the revenge motiffs and this story did not add a whole lot to this legendary motivation of Richard Sharpe.2. No particularly compelling bad-guy--this book needed Pierre Ducos or Sgt. Hakeswill very badly!3. No compelling love interest for Sharpe--a little fling for Sharpe in the first half--but no woman encountered who was all that interesting!Having said all that, the last quarter of the book which describes the battle of Barrosa is extremely fine and exciting which elevates this Sharpe novel a bit. There are however, much finer Sharpe novels out there and I heartily recomend them-but Sharpe's Fury rates a C+ or a B- at best with me!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"For those who have read all of the previously-published Sharpe novels, this is one of the weakest. The beginning is a pleasant refresher for people who haven't read a Sharpe story in a few years, but probably repetitious for those who are reading the novels in chronological order for the first time.The best part of the novel is the second section, in which Sharpe once again bails his \\"betters\\" out of problems of their own making and meets, inevitably, a beautiful and inappropriate woman.The third section, the actual battle of Barrosa, is one of the least exciting of the many recounted in the series. Much of the description seems like filler.Nevertheless, any Sharpe story is welcome. I just hope that Bernard Cornwell can think of some new adventures, perhaps set after Waterloo, to keep Sharpe and Harper marching somewhere new."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"I have read everyone of the Sharpe series and love them. This recent is a good book, but for me the least exciting. It appears that our favorite author may be getting tired of this series. Too much historical overview and battle activity without mention of Sharpe. I hope thiis is not the last, but maybe there are no good battles left for Sharpe to fight."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"I have been a long time fan of Cornwell's Sharpe series and have been distressed by the decline in quality of both the plot lines and the writing. I had believed that his series departure, \\"The Gallows Thief\\" might have been the worst thing he had ever written, but this entry into Sharpe's history might win out. Sharpe has become an iconic figure of the Peninsular War and Cornwell's placing him in the Rifles was brilliant. The character has grown in the series with fleshing out of his past soldiering in India and revealed details of his life before the army.This entry, however, seems as if it were phoned in. It seemed almost a pot boiler, with minimal effort applied. The plot, aside from the battle, was so-so, the final battle scene was excellent as is usual with Cornwell, period details were good, but almost everything else was tedious. This might have been better had it been 100 pages shorter! I sincerely hope that if this is an example of what we can expect with the series in future that Sharpe and Harper march no more. We already know what happened to Sharpe after the war and we know his beginnings. I don't think the character is served, nor the reader, by recounting each and every fight he was involved in -- particularly if it's not done any better than this account."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"Something I've enjoyed for a number of years is the pleasure of Mr. Cornwell's Sharpes Rifles series. Recently I picked up Sharpes Fury to reacquaint myself with Mr. Sharpe and his erstwhile riflemen.To help everyone get on the same page, Sharpes Fury takes place during the siege of Cadiz and the battle of Barrosa (1811). In this case, Mr. Sharpe and his riflemen aide a British gentleman in Cadiz; then the British troops at Barrosa (after all, what would a Sharpe book be without Mr. Sharpe helping out in the battle).For me, this was a solid 4.5 star book. As always, Mr. Cornwell is direct and to the point with his actions. Mr. Sharpe is the type of officer who enlisted men love and fellow officers either love or hate. He's direct, brash, and unapologetic for his background or the way he is. This book does take a departure from the others in the series in that rather than having Mr. Sharpe command his company, Mr. Cornwell separates them and only permits Mr. Sharpe to have his trusty riflemen to fight the French (and yes, as always, one of the Frenchmen is a nemesis for Mr. Sharpe). Interestingly, Mr. Cornwell does an excellent job capturing the relations between the Spanish and the British, showing it nicely with the actions by Sir Thomas Graham, Father Montseny, and General Lapena. I was also happy to see the return of Lord Pumphrey. While all of this makes for an excellent read, I have a hard time raising this to 5 stars and reluctantly have to give it 4 stars. Btw, for those not familiar with the series, Mr. Cornwell's story is true to the history except where Mr. Cornwell documents it in the Historical Notes chapter at the end. Also, as with any in the Sharpes series, you don't have to read any of the predecessor books. This is pure, simple, and good fun that should be enjoyed with a nice brandy after a long day."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"Several years ago I began reading Sharpe books aloud to my dyslexic husband. At the time, I was less than excited by military stories of any sort, but love makes you do all sorts of strange things, and over time I have become a fan of both Sharpe and his creator, Bernard Cornwell.\\"Sharpe's Fury\\" is a solid entry in the series, a fast-moving and enjoyable read. However, it is not a typical Sharpe book. Instead of being in the thick of battle, Sharpe observes from the fringes--which is probably fitting since, as Cornwell points out in his historical note, Sharpe should not have been at Barrosa.Even if he's not rampaging across the battlefield, Sharpe still has something to do (retrieving some indiscreet letters), and still manages to leave destruction in his wake.As much fun as it is to watch Sharpe blow things up and bed pretty girls, it isn't until the last hundred pages that we get to the real meat of the story. Cornwell is a master of describing the bloody chaos of the battlefield and there was plenty of both blood and confusion at Barrosa. It is particularly fitting that the capture of a French eagle by Sergeant Patrick Masterson be included as Masterson's real life exploits helped inspire the character of Sharpe."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"This book was boiler plate Sharpe. It lacked the craftmenship and scope of such fine books as Sharpe's Regiment and Sharpe's Waterloo which were two of Cornwell's best. I enjoyed it, however."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"I am sad. \\"Sharpe's Fury\\" was my last Sharpe novel. I'd read the others in more or less chronological order, then gone back to read this, the most recently published and inserted midway in the series.For me, there will be no more Sharpe wenches. There will be no more craven aristocrats, in commands they don't deserve, plotting Sharpe's demise, nor more admirable officers Sharpe and other men would follow through the gates of hell.There will be no more moments where the Napoleonic Wars hang in the balance, no more Sharpe treasures plundered or lost, no more intrigues with French spies.There will be no more riveting battle scenes, drawn in enough detail for the military buff but clearly enough for the novice to follow, with the human element so dramatically but naturally woven into the scene's fabric.And no more chestnuts pulled out of the fire by Richard Sharpe, one of fiction's greatest soldiers, raised from the gutter to find the only thing he does well - fight. I feel a grief similar to that felt when finishing the Jack Aubrey series by Patrick O'Brian.In this episode Sharpe and Harper, on a patrol near the border of English-controlled Portugal and French-held Spain, are separated with a few men and an injured brigadier, and end up in Cadiz, the only part of Spain not taken by France.The British ambassador there, Henry Wellesley - brother of Lord Wellington - is embroiled in scandal. The love letters he wrote to a dubious woman are being made public by unknown enemies. Called in to handle the matter, threatening as it does England's delicate relations with Spain, is Pumphrey, the fey Foreign Office spy. Sharpe, available for the moment, is detailed to do what it takes to get the letters back - to guard Pumphrey in his meetings with blackmailers, or to steal them back if need be.There are lots of good things in this book, probably the last Sharpe novel Cornwell will write. Sharpe's low background is brought to the fore: he's a thief and a murderer, but it is precisely those skills gentlemen need to protect a gentleman's honor. Wellesley's erstwhile lover Caterina Blasquez is a memorable Sharpeian wench, and without giving too much away is a key factor in the book's ending where a Sharpe antagonist gets his in a non-violent but amusing way.This book portrays perhaps better than any of the others the deeply divided Spanish public - many wanting to make a separate peace with Napoleon in return for the restoration of the Spanish monarchy, but with many different reasons for doing so. Sharpe must operate in a Cadiz that's like a tinderbox, ready to go off against the English at any time.An English night-time amphibious attack on French artillery shelling Cadiz from across the bay is well done. And while nothing in the series can top Cornwell's account of Waterloo, the Battle of Bussaco is a fine climax to this book. English troops, unassisted by their Spanish allies, face annihilation when cornered by a vastly superior French force. Cornwell pays tribute to the French in this battle scene, as one of his characters note the brave and relentless pressing of the battle characteristic of them.Adieu, Sharpe."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"I am a big Sharpes fan and have read everyone of the series. This one would not qualify as the best but is part of a long line of very well researched and written stories."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Fury","review":"I read all of the original Sharpe series in the eighties and thought that the series had come to it's natural conclusion with Sharpes Waterloo in 1990. I was very suprised to see Sharpes Devil a couple of years later and to my mind this was a book too far in the series. Cornwell was always writing other books including the excellent Redcoat as well as his nautical thrillers. When he started the Starbuck chronicles I was delighted and followed Nates adventures in the same manner as I had Sharpe's. Then, after the Sharpe series had been shown on tv Cornwell abandoned \\"The Starbuck Chronicles\\" mid-series (after four books)and resurrected Sharpe. Not to sound too cynical but the only reason for this betrayal of fans who had bought the new books and were following Starbuck could only have been money...Cornwell betrayed and sacrificed the Starbuck fans for a newer and more lucrutive market...the new Sharpe fans worldwide who came to the books after the tv series. In order to continue to cash in along came all the new books each one inserted in a different period of Sharpe's career.

The scenes for the most part are not really memorable, and the supporting characters are not really convincing. Perhaps this is my biggest complaint. Charles Dickens can keep my interest even in an 800 page book. Yet Defoe could not hold my interest in 250 pages. The only reason I could give for reading this is that it shows a primitave stage in the development of the novel."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Defoe has written of a wonderful woman with his \\"Moll Flanders\\", and he has also created a book that is entirely enjoyable while outlining her exploits and her life. Moll was quite a remarkable woman in her time. He covers her earlier life of crime and the punishment that ensued from that right up to her later days where she reformed. She made quite a few marriages, and learned and grew from these. Although most of her marriages and her intrigues were undertaken in the pursuit of money, she was actually not without passion or generosity. There is quite a bit of moralizing throughout the book, but it is totally enjoyable nonetheless because Moll was so human and Defoe has created a living, breathing heroine that is as realistic as they come (especially during this era). Quite an accomplishment, especially for a male author."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"This book is absolutely hilarious! Moll Flanders is a woman who loved money a bit too much and in turn was loved by many a man with money. The comedy in this book stands the test of time (at least for me) and in my opinion, the language is not as archaic and difficult to follow as one previous reviewer stated. There are some words that aren't in use today, but their meanings are pretty self-explanatory. If you love scandal, you'll love this book. This chick has baby after baby, sleeps with almost any man with money, and even marries her own brother! If Moll were around nowadays, she'd probably be on Springer!

A+ Defoe."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Though inevitably overshadowed by his immortal Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders is another excellent, important, and influential Daniel Defoe novel. Anyone who has not read Crusoe should of course do so first, but its fans are encouraged to continue here, as Moll has many of the same virtues.Crusoe has long been called the first real Western novel, making Moll, which came out a few years later, an early entry. Like Crusoe, it can be highly enjoyed and appreciated simply as a rollicking adventure. It is nearly as entertaining, drawing us in quickly and never letting go through a remarkable series of plot twists continuing to the very end. The novel is fast-paced and intriguing, and its sheer readability is very noteworthy. It reads almost as well as ever despite archaic spellings and punctuation. Unlike nearly all classics, it need not be drastically edited, footnoted, and introduced for comprehension. This is hardly true of even many twentieth century works, much less one of such vintage. Even casual readers who have almost no experience with classics, to say nothing of ones three hundred years old, can pick it up with practically no trouble. The documentary style and clear, concise prose that made Crusoe so ground-breaking and absorbing are continued, but Moll is in many ways even more impressive because Crusoe had the easy draw of an exotic deserted island, while this is set in contemporary England and colonial America. The attractive element now comes from Defoe's focus on society's oft-overlooked underbelly, which he knew well from hard personal experience. We get a profoundly up-close look at the poor and downtrodden, including criminals, prisoners, indentured servants, and other laborers. Moll indeed focuses near-obsessively on the low and gritty, including prostitution and incest. This fascinated initial readers and continues to do so, helped by newly acquired historical value. The plot is highly improbable - far more so than Crusoe's in most ways -, but the stark realist tone and attention to everyday detail make it an invaluable record of early eighteenth century English and American life, including the dark side most never mention.The character of Moll is also of great importance and highly lifelike despite being written by a man. Though lacking almost all conventional virtues save beauty and at times seeming to positively revel in what the era would have called deadly sin, she remains sympathetic. This is mostly because, like Crusoe, she remains resolute and optimistic in extremely adverse circumstances; the eternal values of courage, determination, and perseverance are on strong display, making her - against all odds - in some ways conventionally admirable.More important from our perspective is Defoe's penetrating presentation of women's issues. Calling Moll a proto-feminist work would be too much, but Defoe shows a truly incredible knowledge of and sympathy for women's issues for a man born in the seventeenth century. He vividly shows the hardships women faced, many of them patently unfair, and the drastic lengths they had to go to in order to ameliorate their woes even a little. Moll may be unscrupulous from most perspectives but lived in an unjust society and did what she felt necessary to survive; there is much to look up to here, and she is arguably even noble in her way. She is in any event supremely interesting, as are the issues and themes she represents.All told, while not one of literature's greatest works, Moll is a highly readable and important book that fans of Defoe and other early English novels will enjoy."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders , written in 1722, is a remarkable example of crime literature and may be the earliest example in English. The language is archaic and for the first 50-60 pages I felt myself struggling a bit but then the story and the character of Moll herself compensates for the struggle and the reward is a fascinating tale of a woman's fight to survive poverty by any means she can in 17th century England. Defoe created a character that is so grounded in flesh and blood that it seems to me that it must be based on someone he knew during his own time in prison. This is truly a remarkable achievement for it's time and it holds up very well once the language hurdle is overcome. The plot has many twists and turns as Moll Flanders relates her life story and describes her inner thoughts regarding her circumstances and the people she encounters over a period of almost 60 years in terms that truly result in a tense page turner of a novel despite the span of centuries.I could see the influence of this book on the yet to be written novels of Dickens and Thomas Hardy with their tragic feminine protagonists. This is really unmissable for any reader interested in the development of the novel in the English language. Excellent."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders is one of the few 'classic' books I have read in which a MALE author parallels the thought of a woman as the narrator. Moll Flanders is the ultimate tribute to a woman out to make a name for herself in a world of poverty, protitution, and love, who eventually learns more about her own strengths than the lessons of any morals. Moll Flanders is an embodiment of feminism... but oddly enough is written by a male author-giving the text a female and male essence of love, twists, and, of course, misfortunes."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders / 0-451-52633-3Defoe's novel, Moll Flanders, one of the first English novels follows the \\"true\\" story of a lower-class woman who eventually turns to a life of petty thievery and prostitution - partly as a means to survive, and partly in the hopes of reaching a middle-class life of relative riches and ease.This thin little novel is a fairly quick read and the story pacing moves at a quick clip as we read through the salacious and scandalous life of this matron. Moll Flanders is not particularly clever nor particularly beautiful, but she is persistent, dogged, and increasingly amoral enough to make a life for herself above and beyond desperate poverty. Through the course of her life, Moll takes several husbands, bears multiple children, and chooses to view her life with pride and detachment, rather than with the shame she 'ought' to feel. In this regard, Moll is perhaps the most modern of historical novel characters, because she views with a jaundiced eye the societal norms which would compel her to pious poverty, and because she recognizes that the 'shameful' things she does to survive, the gentry do on a much wider (if more socially acceptable) scale.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Daniel Defoe, hot on the heels of \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" came under considerable fire when \\"Moll Flanders\\" was published. She was called immoral, when, in fact, she is amoral. Churches and universities could not understand why Defoe was fascinated with characters considered \\"low\\". The fact is, the public adored her and the novel. And it continues to do so to this day.But, as I've repeated in other reviews, the Dover Thrift edition makes it even more of an attractive purchase. Well-bound and sturdy, it's the best thing you can do with the $5.00 you can spare in your pocket.

Of course since there was no original manuscript or no real Moll , except for a model for her he might of met while in Newgate prison, Defoe is creating fiction within fiction. This is just one of the many devices Defoe uses to depict Moll to the reader as a real person not just a literary creation. Moll comes to life in these pages and seems to be a person of history instead of fiction but Moll Flanders is not really a novel.Defoe's \\"Roxana\\" is the first English novel. Some would point to Robinson Crusoe or Moll Flanders yet the time before and after the Island in \\"Crusoe\\" seems to fit the Tall Tale genre and Moll Flanders is a picturesque adventure. Roxana is more of what the \\"novel\\" evolves into.Moll is born in Newgate prison. Her mother, a thief, after pleading her belly and delivering Moll into this world is deported to the colonies in America. Moll is passed around even living and travelling with Gypsies for awhile. During her early years she relies on men to keep her afloat because in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a woman alone had few good options for survival and Moll is nothing if not a survivor. On into middle age Moll turns thief to make ends meet. In one scene she is going to a house fire to see what can be had in the panic and confusion ,since she had luck that way once before, and a maid throws a mattress out of an upper story and it lands on Moll knocking her out. If they threw more goods out onto the mattress, Moll reflects she would have been \\"inevitably killed; but I was reserved for further afflictions\\".Also recommended is the excellent film \\"Moll Flanders\\" starring Alex Kingston."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"First off, it is surprising to me to read a male author so comfortable in the female perspective. But DeFoe definitely is comfortable and superb as he presents the 'memoirs' of Moll Flanders from the time that she is given up by her mother in Newgate through a turbulent and action packed life. He presents her flawed choices as reasonable under the circumstances in each case. And what choices they are!The best punch is about three quarters of the way through the book when she is starting to get on in years and is trying to better her position through marriage. He, through her, chastises women who put too little value on themselves. He/She spells out certain rules to gain control in relationships with men and how to best watch for your own interests. It struck me that this would be useful information for a young girl to read today (or any unmarried woman for that matter).If you are concerned about giving a book to a young girl that contains premarital sex, theft and a score of other things you wouldn't want her to do - don't be. DeFoe presents the memoirs as a warning, a parable if you will, and Ms. Flanders is always repentent. This is standard DeFoe style - and a wonderful story."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders was written by Daniel Defoe, the same author of Robinson Crusoe. Although the settings are different, we can see many similarities between the stories, like the implicit criticism of british society of the XVII/XVIII centuries and the importance that society gave to exterior looks.Moll Flanders can be divided in two parts. In the first one, Moll, being poor, is raised in a foster home, and, being pretty, catches the attention of the elder son of the family whose house she lives in. It is when her misfortunes begin. Misled and deceived by this elder son, she has to leave the house and be on her own. When she was a child, she wanted to be a &quot;dame of society&quot;, and that's what she desperately tries to become, looking for a rich man who will support her financialy. To catch the eyes of such men, she has to pretend she is very rich herself, and then all she manages to have are false &quot;gentlemen&quot;, trying themselves to marry a rich woman. Even then, she is able to find a man she loves (more than one, in fact), but through a series of bad luck she always looses everything.The second part of the book is where Moll Flanders transforms herself in a successfull thieve. This is a fun part, where she describes her struggle to accomplish the thefts without being caught and thrown to infamous prison Newgate. And then, the ending seemed a little too sudden to me.Defoe's book is a stinging critic to his society, and that's why he chose to write in a female first-person, self centered (there are almost no other names in the course of the story) and desperate to get to the high level of society, showing that everybody could be affected by hypocrite puritanism and moralism.Grade 8.5/10"},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"This book has the honor of being one of only two books that I have ever read that I TRULY regret having wasted my time on.

It is written in elevated language making it a difficult, but rewarding read. The novel is an accounting of the narrator, Moll's life. The focus is on how Moll deals with the hardships of her life and with being a woman in the seventeenth century. Defoe does an excellent job of showing how Moll's experiences change her outlook.Moll Flanders was written in 1683, during a time in which women were considered subservient to men. Women were expected to get married and be content with the household affairs. However, money was the key, without it one would be unable to find a husband of position that would be a good provider. If a woman, like Moll, found herself alone and herself to rely upon, she discovered that there were not many options available, \\"I found by experience, that to be Friendless is the worst Condition, next to being in want, that a Woman can be reduc'd to: I say a Women, because \`tis evident Men can be their own Advisers, and their own Directors, and know how to work themselves out of Difficulties and into Business better than women; but if a Woman has no Friend to Communicate her Affairs to, and to advise and assist her, tis' ten to one but she is undone\\" (121). Men dominated the business world and women were never taught to manage their own affairs or given the skills to enable them to make it in the business world. In fact, it was illegal for most women to do so. Without any acquaintances or contacts, a woman of this time was put at the mercy of strangers and fate. A woman that managed to be on her own was often suspected to be of ill reputation, and if she was labeled as such then life would be much harder.Moll had a hard life from the beginning. She was born in Newgate prison, then taken in by a woman she dubbed Mistress Nurse. From an early age she wanted to become a gentlewoman, \\"...what I meant by being a Gentlewomen; and that I understood by it to be nothing more, than to be able to get my Bread by my own Work\\" (15). Upon her Mistress Nurse's death she was hired a servant in a high-class home. She became the lover to the eldest son, but the younger son fell in love with her and Moll was forced to marry him. He soon died and Moll married a \\"Gentleman-Tradesman\\" who spent all of their money, and had to leave the country to escape his creditors. Being very much desolate Moll realized, \\"Beauty, Wit, Manners, Sense, good Humour, good Behaviour, Education, Virtue, Piety, or any other Qualification, whether of Body or Mind, had no power to recommend: that Money only made a Women agreeable\\" (64). So Moll passed herself off as a woman of fortune, and married again. She moved with her husband to Virginia, and there realized that he was her brother. Upon that realization, Moll moved back to England. Upon her return she met another man, and over time became his mistress. After a terrible illness he decided that he could not live in sin with Moll any longer and turned her out. Moll then was tricked into marrying a man she believed to be very rich, and he was also deceived into believing she is a fortune. Having no money, they parted ways. Moll then married her accountant. After his death she was very poor, and out of desperation she became a thief. \\"The thoughts of this Booty put out all the thoughts of the first, and the Reflections I had made wore quickly off; Poverty, as I have said, harden'd my Heart, and my own Necessities made me regardless of any thing\\" (182). After a successful career as a thief, Moll was finally arrested and sent to Newgate. There she meets up with her fourth husband who was discovered to be a highwayman. They are both transported to Virginia where they buy a plantation together and eventually grow rich. Moll thus became a Gentlewoman.In the male dominated society of the seventeenth century it was extremely difficult for a woman to make it on her own. Through Moll's experiences Defoe shows the difficult position a woman was faced with the lack of social liberty. Every plot development changes Moll slightly. Her Character almost completely changes as she becomes manipulative to get what she wants and needs to survive. This is apparent through her comments about her fifth husband before she married him, \\"I play'd with this Lover, as an Angler does with a Trout: I found I had him fast on the Hook, so I jested with his new Proposal\\" (133). The change in Moll's personality occurs slowly, but it makes her a more convincing character as well as highlights the effects of the hardships she endures. In the depiction of Moll's life, Defoe succeeds in questioning the subservient position that society forced women into in the seventeenth century.The elevated language in Moll Flanders makes it a complicated read, however, if one is able to get past that obstacle the reader is rewarded with an outstanding story. Moll's life was a true adventure. Defoe's focus on Moll gives the reader insight into the hardships of the life of a woman in the seventeenth century, as well as shows the difficulty of getting ahead in those times. In a period where women were considered to be subservient to men, Moll was an assertive woman whose life was a great adventure."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Did you see the official title of this book?

Didn't have much of a problem with the writing style, but others might.As a mom, I just couldn't get over the fact she gave birth to about 10 kids, didn't give a flying leap about any of them, and abandoned every single one of them at her earliest convenience. I have heard of a lot of REALLY bad mothers, but none that just walked away, never gave another thought to any of them - on about 6 different occasions.My modern mind wants to guess she had reactive attachment disorder since she was abandoned herself, but of course she just may be the imagining of a man who didn't really care to write about a woman's relationships with her children. (Wikipedia says he had 8 kids by the same wife and 6 survived, so he should have known of the bond a woman has with her children).It's an interesting book, but I can't fully recommend it as a story. I would recommend it for people interested in 17th and 18th century England and America."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Let Me start by saying that the Story of Moll Flanders itself is a fairly exciting One. The Story changes Venues and Circumstances so often that it only grows Dull in a few Places. It is well-written and filled with beautiful Description. However, I have never finished this Book due to two crucial Criteria:Reason 1) There are no Chapters. I find this to be quite Discouraging, as, without any Breaks, I often lose my Spot and feel like I'm not accomplishing Anything.Reason 2) Just like in this Review, every Noun is capitalized.

She was sooooo amoral, so raunchy, so do-anything that she makes even the great Scarlett O' Hara seem tame and slow moving. Moll's story covers most of the 17th century and takes us in among all levels of society, from the poorest of the poor, to the richest of the rich. Here for the meeting are highwaymen, convicts and clergy, landed gentry, disenfranchised priests, and Virginia colonists. And if you read between the lines you'll also find Moll's story has more sex plastered through it than a season worth of Desperate Housewives with half of HBO's lineup thrown in to boot. And you know what's really wickedly hilarious here? They let this astonishingly great classic be read in high school literature classes everywhere! I love it! More fornication, theft, sacrilege here than a month of junk-TV and yet it's assigned classroom material. Oh, man. The rises and falls in the remarkable life story of English literature's most durable and clever heroine make for a plot that's never boring and typically has a reader balanced on the edge of her seat to see where Moll, the ultimate survivor, is going to end up next."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Amazing story telling, it was interesting reading a life and times so unlike the one I'm living.

Despite the blurb on the back cover, she never acquires any human characteristics, besides greed and duplicity.

Moll's story is a romp, but sheds light on poverty and the difficulties of independent living during a time when the world was truly controlled by men.

We follow Moll throughout her life of poverty, five marriages, live in crime and at last she finds lasting happiness or contentment. That, of course, is brought about her repentance for the &quot;wicked&quot; life she had led. The novel is written in a format that Moll tells her story in the first person to the audiance of a journalist. If this was a movie the format would be best described as a &quot;Mocumentary&quot;. The language is at times difficult but for anyone who has read Shakespeare or other literature from that time it should not be an obstacle.

For a book written almost 300 years ago, it's still an interesting story with a surprisingly current plot: girl loses parents, becomes as a domestic with a family, family's son swears eternal devotion, gets girl pregnant, then leaves her to make her own way in the world.

If I could give \\"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders\\" a hundred stars I would. This book flows so well compared to other books of the time that it's hard to believe it's not contemporary. Although the tale is about repenting of sins, it almost fits better with the modern theme of self-acceptance. Most books from the time period are so hung up on virtue, but \\"Moll Flanders\\" is a depiction of what was most likely the reality of the times. The 18th century was definitely the first sexual revolution. Legally divorce was not common, but the lax standards on identity, death, and divorce records made divorce virtually unnecessary.I can't decide which is better \\"Moll Flanders\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" I'm leaning toward MF, but maybe that's because I've read P&P; too many times and just discovered MF. Or maybe because Moll makes the strong and independent Elizabeth Bennett look like a spoiled whiny princess."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"I found this book entertaining. Moll Flanders was the original \\"material girl\\". I enjoyed it from a novelist stand point, wondering what crazy thing will Defoe have Moll do next. If you enjoy reading classics, you'll definitely like this book."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"For a nearly 300-year-old lady, \\"Moll Flanders\\" has held up surprisingly well.She lives her life according to her terms, doesn't define herself by any of the many men she's with, circumvents society's laws when it suits her, and goodness knows doesn't let any of her children tie her down. Reading this Daniel Defoe novel from 1722 is like opening a window across the centuries to discover someone very much like us staring back. So too, it seems, is the author, whose first-person account of Moll presents her rationalizing without pity or judgment. What a shame this novel seems to come before the invention of the chapter!That was a big stumbling block for me in enjoying this novel, that it just runs without break for 300 pages. It's also very densely packed with incident. If you don't read through each paragraph carefully, you may miss one of Moll's marriages. The first 100 pages throw everything at us from a saucy maid's adventure with a pair of passionate brothers to a tale of incest taking place in Virginia (Southern Gothic 200 years before Faulkner!)\\"As covetousness is the root of all evil, so poverty is the worst of all snares,\\" avers Moll in the first-person narrative, yet it's never as simple as that. It's less poverty than fear of poverty that drives Moll to her extremes. She also is in the habit of throwing aside her relations for the prospect of a better deal. Finally, as she becomes a member of the underworld, her avarice exceeds her want to the point where even her own fence pleads for her to quit while she's ahead.Yet even as we may disdain her actions, Moll retains our sympathy. The feeling of having a ringside seat to such a character makes up for a lot of flaws, and so does her no-nonsense way of telling us what's what and letting the cards fall where they will: \\"The moral, indeed, of all my history is left to be gathered by the senses and judgement of the reader; I am not qualified to preach to them.\\"The sordid nature of Moll is a bit of a hang-up, and so is the spouse-flipping monotony of the book's first half. Once she's involved in her criminal doings, however, \\"Moll Flanders\\" becomes a fascinating, full-bored examination of how criminals operated in early 18th-century London. It's worth knowing this going in, because if you find the first part too much of a drag, you might want to skip ahead and whet your appetite as Moll lifts fabrics from mercer-houses and cleverly manages to steal a heavy portmanteau full of pistoles while keeping a step ahead of the law.My Signet edition includes an afterward by Kenneth Roxroth that suggests Defoe was using \\"Moll\\" to satirize the emerging middle class, with its desire for material gain. Defoe was a prominent Whig of his day, but I don't think it fair to reduce his novel that way. This feels more like an attempt by a brilliant and sensitive writer to take life the way he found it.While not without a moral dimension, sometimes most present in its apparent absence, there's no feeling here of being spoon-fed a moral, the way so many authors of the time did. Defoe takes pains not to point fingers or create villains. The men who have at Moll, and even the woman who nurses her into her life of crime, are not written as lacking for good points, just following their impulses where they may. At one point, Moll tells us it is a good thing we can't read what is inside each other's hearts, or we'd never learn to trust people. Insights like these are another way \\"Moll\\" has held up rather well."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders: Who was Born in Newgate, and during a Life of continu'd Variety for threescore years, besides her childhood, was Twelve Year a Whore, five times a Wife (Whereof once to her own Brother) Twelve Year a Thief, Eight Year a Transported Felon in Virginia, at last grew Rich, liv'd Honest, and died a Penitent by Daniel Defoe has been an interesting read. This is a true story taken from Moll Flander's own memoirs. This book is a story of wickedness until the last fifty of three hundred pages when 'Moll' finally becomes penitent. It then becomes a story of forgiveness and God's mercy no matter what a person's past life or background has been. Moll is a clever woman who, although wants to be honest and pure, cannot become so because of the society she lives in and what it has reduced her too. This, however, does not exempt her from responsibility for her actions, it just serves as a catalyst and partial cause of her circumstances. The bulk of the book serves as a warning that once a sin is set in motion it is very difficult, if not impossible, to stop. It is a lesson for those who are willing to read the book. I give it a lower rating because the story, although quite thought-provoking, became dull at times and was a little too graphic. Another note worth mentioning is that there are no chapters or separations in the book. It is written without any quotation marks so that dialouge is written as 'he said' 'she said.'"},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"The'plot structure of Moll Flanders is conventional: it's the usual plot about a deviant who, in the end, regenerates oneself and kowtows before conventional morals - Moll's ultimate fate being no different from that of the late Sex and the City foursome. However, what a different between Defoe's ironical ending - when Moll and her &quot;Lancashire husband&quot; settle down in Maryland to enjoy a comfortable old age out of her looting as a street criminal - and the dull Victorian-like endings of so many of our popular culture fictions - which by the way, lack entirely in genuine conviction about the values they intend to upheld!Moll Flanders is a healthy beast - someone who accepts her world as it's and makes the best out of it.It's this matter-of-fact attitude which makes most of the novel's charms, and makes today's readers refreshed!

The title caught my eye!"},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Daniel Defoe's 1722 novel, &quot;Moll Flanders,&quot; remains a fascinating imaginative work, and is in many ways more interesting than his famous first effort, &quot;Robinson Crusoe.&quot; Having seen bits of two recent film adaptations in the last couple of months on television, and being a budding 18th century scholar, I decided it was time I picked up my own copy of &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; and see the actual product on its own terms. A story no less about a castaway and delinquent than &quot;Crusoe,&quot; in &quot;Moll Flanders,&quot; Defoe attempts to set down the history of a woman with a wild and often desperate life. A character of infinitely more interiority and reflection than Crusoe, Moll gives us through a first person narrative, a look into various stations of life in 18th century England and America.The novel begins with a tip of the hat to that fine progenitor of the novel, &quot;Don Quixote,&quot; a Gines-like acknowledgment that Moll, as the author of her own story, cannot complete that story within the text of the novel, unless people can write when they are deceased. Amusements aside, Moll begins her story as Crusoe begins his, with an immediate acknowledgment of the instability of the modern self - the corruption of her own name. Born in Newgate prison, and having never known her mother, Moll finds herself among gypsies and landed gentry before settling in Colchester for the term of her youth. Here, she founds her sense of social ambition, unusual even for Jane Eyre in the 19th century, as one in which she figures to be a gentlewoman by earning her own living. Various mishaps and misadventures lead her through marriages, whoredom, and thievery as Moll attempts to find her place in the world as a woman of common birth. Early on she learns the lessons that will aid her on her journey, viz., the value of money, quick wit, and a sense of her own sexuality.While Defoe certainly does not sugar-coat the wrongs of woman in the early 18th century - delving deeply into issues of feminine helplessness before the law, the difficulties of procuring stable employment, and various reproductive issues such as adoption, abortion, and infant mortality - yet he maintains a consistent character of Moll as an extremely strong, adaptive, and resilient female character. The most riveting facet of Moll throughout is her own sense of self-worth and importance, especially in her own history. For instance, while chronicling an encounter with a former lover, Moll tells us that while his adventures are worth their own narrative, this is &quot;my story, not his.&quot; Moll's strength in the midst of doubt, desperation, and general loneliness keeps the reader's constant interest and admiration.Defoe's exploration of inter-gender relationships are worthy of note themselves for the sheer variety of social, economic, and personal situations he includes in the novel. The economic theme stands out among these, and provides a link back to the preoccupations of &quot;Robinson Crusoe.&quot; Like Crusoe, Moll is always aware of the value of her personal possessions, and conscious of how to exploit and husband her resources to best advantage. Also like Crusoe, &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; is keenly aware of the possibilities and drawbacks of English colonial ventures in America. Defoe's efforts to link all these themes to the lot of the English prison population, the family unit, and indentured servants and African slaves, are all managed extremely well within the text of the novel. For all this, &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; remains an entertaining, satisfying, relevant novel, and stands for me above &quot;Crusoe&quot; as a work of high literary value."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"'Tho the plot, being interesting in the extream, must be confess'd to be well-done, and alike the characters, being well-develop'd, plausible, and even sympathetic ('tho they be theives, felons, bigamists, and worse), must be similarly confess'd, still the writing style, being as it is extreamly archaic as well in spelling, grammar, and syntax, as in punctuation, the modern reader must be foarwarn'd: if he had difficulty with the parsing of this, the principle paragraph of this review, or finds the prospect of reading a story consisting of eight and forty more than two hundreds of pages in a like style daunting, he should give the project up as impracticable.If, on the other hand, you had no trouble with that paragraph, I daresay that you'll enjoy this book, even if, as the father of the English novel, Defoe had yet to engender the chapter break.Also it should be pointed out this may well be the first novel in which a male author attempts to write a story in which the lead character is female, and Defoe does a surprisingly good job of it."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"To fully understand and appreciate Moll Flanders you should have some understanding of the status of fiction at the time Daniel DeFoe was writing and some knowledge about the man himself. As Nancy Springer has indicated, the novel is an example of a \\"picaresque adventure,\\" a style of writing that was popular at the time. These stories glorified a new kind of hero--the ordinary person, who engaged in a series of often wild and improbable events in exotic places. The picaresque rouge was a rebel against the remains of the feudal system with its hierarchy of human worth. Such novels featured a clever, strong-minded, low-born character who knew how to survive. What DeFoe did differently is to make his character a women and have her adventures take place largely in England.The novel is also largely autobiographical. DeFoe himself experienced many financial ups and downs, yet he persevered. In fact it wasn't until he was 60 years old that he began writing novels and achieved some measure of fame and financial success. He spent time in Newgate prison and deeply in debt. He was also an outspoken political reformer who wrote more than 250 political pamphlets.Having said the above, the novel still has its faults. One is that it is written in a continuous manner with no chapter breaks. While DeFoe may have been trying to say that time is continuous and that distinctions (such as hours, days, weeks, etc.) are mere fabrications, still readers like to have books broken down into chapters. A more serious flaw is the lack of names. Apart from her first husband there are virtually no names given to the characters. Even Moll herself is not identified by the title name until well into the book and even this name is not her actual name (which we never learn). Instead characters are identified in some impersonal way (my Lancashire husband, my governess, etc.) The lack of names makes it hard for the reader to engender any sympathy for Moll and the other personages in the book. Also the action is so fast paced that it flashes by like looking through a kaleidoscope, the scenes and action constantly shifting and changing. For example, within the first 100 pages Moll is married five times, has several children, goes to Virginia, finds her mother, etc. There is no time for the reader to reflect on the tragedies that befall her, especially given that they are told in a matter-of-fact manner.The book can be divided into two parts. The first half deals with Moll's amorous life--her marriages and love affairs. The second part focuses primarily on her criminal activities. Both sections tell the story entirely from Moll's perspective. In many respects Moll is a match for Thackery's Becky Sharp. Both are low-born, both get positions in well-to-do families, both marry one of the sons in the family, both are attractive and quick witted, both scheme to get money and both have various adventures and misadventures. But Vanity Fair is written as a social commentary and Thackery uses the omnipotent story teller to advantage, even having him speak directly to the reader. DeFoe, by comparison, limits himself to having his protagonist say, in effect, now I did this, then I did that, then this happened, etc.To give DeFoe his due, the book does provide a realistic and detailed account of life in England at that time. His description of Newgate prison is but one example. Perhaps Moll's attitude also reflected the times accurately. It can best be described as \\"a woman is nothing without a man and to get a man a woman must have money.\\" Thus Moll spends the entire book pursuing both. But one can question how realistic Moll Flanders really is. She has a number of children, but seems to have little regard for them. Perhaps DeFoe, needing to rid Moll of encumbrances such as children in order to engage her in so many adventures, gave her what is an unnatural attitude for a mother. In the end he does reunite her with a son, but we should note that her motivation, at least at first, is financial not familial.All in all, the book is worth reading, but it is far from great literature."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"I think MOLL FLANDERS is my favorite novel of all time. The novel form was in its infancy at the time MOLL FLANDERS was written. In fact, Defoe is often called &quot;the father of the English novel.&quot; Actually, as a novel it's very primitive. Defoe's fiction is usually a first person narrative told by an ambitious person, recounting how he got where he is today. In Moll Flanders, Defoe presents the autobiography of a woman who rises from an ignominious birth in Newgate Prison, and a childhood as a servant. Early on, Moll learns that she is beautiful and that she is attractive to the opposite sex. What's great about the book is its delicious irony. Oh there are times when she gets caught in her own traps, she's a sly one, that Moll. It's very difficult at times to think of Moll as a fictional character. But she is, in fact, the first great female character in English prose. I never cease to be amazed that the book was written by a man. There are moments in the book that I find very moving, like when she realizes that she's no longer pretty enough to attract men without resorting to makeup. &quot;I never had to paint my face before.&quot; And of course there's that unsettling surprise she receives toward the end of the novel. This is a great and important book and hardly anyone has read it. I don't know why. I have recommended this book to probably a hundred people. To the best of my knowledge, not a single one of them has taken my advice. It's their loss. I LOVE Moll Flanders."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"An eighteenth century novel recounting the life and survival of a strong willed Moll Flanders, a woman who, abandoned as an infant, finds her way to self sufficiency, in a world then dominated by men. Through ingenius schemes she still some how always regains the illusion of imaginary high standing and good reputation throughout it all.I found Moll Flanders to be resourceful and ingenious in her methods for securing her own survival. The book puts prostitution and premarital sex in a whole new perspective. As one can deduce from this book, life was not so simple for women in the 18th century, especially if they were abandon as children, or even if they husband died and left them without means to exist. Moll takes her position as a dependent woman and finds power in her mind to devise schemes which will allow her a secure lifestyle without compromising her self.I found Moll to be a woman of character and repute, with self esteem, who made her own way in a world where women had no power, money or choices aside from their dependence upon men."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"The only thing I truely like about this tale is the insight to the times of over three hundred years ago. One is really struck by the more things change, the more things stay the same-at least when it comes to the human mind. Other than that, I really found a great majority of the book mind-numbingly dull-especially when when reach the part where our heroine becomed the infamous Moll Flanders. Nearly sixty pages of my edition (c. 1965 Dell Publishing) is devoted repetition of how Moll stole this or another and the innumerable times she'd almost gotten caught. A few incidents would have been fine, but the author seemed really taken by how these thieves scratched out their living. Given how DeFoe spent most of his life in debt, one wonders if his detail account came from of his own experience. Most of what happens to Moll Flanders while she bounced from one extraordinary event to the next stretches the threshold of believablity to the breaking point. This woman popped out so many kids and would just get up and walk away with no thought of the children-until the ONE toward the end of the story. The first half of the book caught and held my attention, but it was down hill from there."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"This human portrait of a woman is also an excellent sketch of the living conditions and the social stratification in England in the 18th century: 'the Age is so wicked and the Sex so Debauch'd'.It shows the immense chasm between a small class of wealthy people and the rest (Swift: a thousand to one). The latter were struggling for sheer survival and praying 'Give me not Poverty, lest I steal' ... to be hanged: 'If I swing by the String, I shall hear the Bell ring, and then there's an End of poor Jenny.'But both classes intermingled.As E.J. Burford quotes in his masterful book 'The Synfulle Citie':Those who were riche were hangid by the PursseThose who were poore were hangid by the NeckeDefoe's Moll Flanders: 'the passive Jade thinks of no Pleasure but the Money; and when he is as it were drunk in the Extasies of his wicked Pleasure, her Hands are in his Pockets.'Defoe paints the poor's religion as fatalism. Moll Flanders is all the time reproaching herself her Course of life, 'a horrid Complication of Wickedness, Whoredom, Adultery, Incest, Lying, Theft', but in the face of death at the gallows, 'I had now neither Remorse or Repentance ... no Thought of Heaven or Hell ... I neither had a Heart to ask God's Mercy.'Defoe's work is eminently modern, with his psychological insight 'What a Felicity is it to Mankind that they cannot see into the Hearts of one another', and 'Modest men are better Hypocrites';or, the ravages of alcoholism: 'the Drunk are the Men whom Solomon says, they go like an Ox to the Slaughter, till a Dart strikes through their Liver';and his feminism: 'the Disadvantage of the Women is a terrible Scandal upon Men', and 'Money only made a Woman agreeable.'Defoe's appeal to the reader - 'every Branch of my Story may be useful to honest People' - seems to be a smokescreen to circumvent censorship, because ultimately Moll Flanders prospers. This book is a perfect illustration of BernardMandeville's 'Triumph of Private Vices' in his 'Fable of the Bees'.Although some developments in this story are rather improbable, this superbly ironic and lively text constitutes an immortal portrait of the 'horrid Complication' to be a woman, here personified in Moll Flanders.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"This book helped me to understand the perils of being a poor woman in Seventeenth Century London. The character Moll Flanders was born poor and she had no family to support her, therefore her only ways of survival was to get married, sell her body, become a servant at very low wages. She chose to become a thief, and to always to appear to be something that she was not.It is almost like a travel book because Moll is always moving from town to town, and from life episode to next episode, across the ocean trying to find a place to be herself and not a fake representation of a good woman.Sometimes the narrator is too detailed and tells more than I needed to know, but it does seem like a woman is speaking, or writing in a journal, even though the book was actually written by a man. I enjoyed reading the book and felt some sympathy for Moll Flanders because of her struggles, weaknesses, and her ability to endure."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"As many other reviewers have noted, it takes some effort to deal with this books old english style of prose. But, what do you expect? The book was written several hundred years ago! Once you get used to it, this novel is really very interesting and just gets progressively better as it goes on. By the end you cant put it down, you just have to know what happens to Moll. I thought Defoe offered very perceptive insights into human nature in sometimes very amusing passages. The novel has this curious aspect in that throughout the novel Moll displays a deep degree of moral self-awareness but then she has this ability to essentially ignore the impact of her often outrageous behavior. I guess this was Defoe's point. We all have to rationalize our actions to some degree to make our way in an imperfect and often cruel world. You will cheer and abhor her at the same time but at least she wont bore you!"},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"I had read Robinson Crusoe earlier, and enjoyed it. So I looked forward to reading another great classic when I picked up Moll Flanders, also by Daniel Defoe. Unfortunately, it was not as good as I had hoped.Written in the eighteenth century, Moll Flanders is the story of a woman who is born in England, lives a lamentable life filled with many husbands, relationships outside of marriage with bastard children, a decade or so of shoplifting, a bit of prison time, all with success and happiness only in the last few years.As with Robinson Crusoe, the book's best feature can be found in its attention to detail. When describing her thieving experiences, for instance, Moll Flanders illustrates exactly how each encounter happened with such exactness that one could easily picture the event.Unlike Robinson Crusoe, however, this book dragged a bit more and was more difficult to follow. When reading RC, I had previously thought that Defoe's omission of any character's name was a deliberate attempt to characterize Robinson Crusoe's detachment as a character (The ship's captain was always referred to as \\"The ship's captain,\\" and nobody ever was referred to by their name). I was surprised to find that Defoe does this here, and unfortunately it made it much more confusing. When Moll Flanders refers to a man as \\"her husband,\\" I always wondered which husband it was, since she had been married many times. Because of this, the men seemed to run together and blend into a generic depiction of a man. Perhaps this was deliberate, too, but it got to me after awhile.The other problem is that this narrative is much less exciting than with RC, a man who is shipwrecked on a tropical island. Although the bits about the life of crime are more interesting, the beginning portion of her life unwinds at a slow pace.If people really like Robinson Crusoe, I think they will appreciate Moll Flanders. I think readers should go for Crusoe first and see what they think of it."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"the plot can get a little slow, but offers a good insight into English crime of the 18th century."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Having watched the movie version of this book starring Robin Wright and Morgan Freeman.

Moll Flanders is a bleak read. Everyone in it is pretty awful. Moll herself can be read in numerous ways. She is a conniving, evil women, brought low by her sins (this is arguably the way Defoe meant to portray her) or, she is a strong women, who uses the resources at her disposal to survive in a world that consistently abuses her. I prefer the second reading. Either way, the ending where Moll finds a sort of spiritual redemption seemed contrived to my sensibilities, even if that possibility of redemption is likely the reason Defoe wrote the book in the first place."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Think that sex,,violence, and scandal are only a modern invention? MOLL FLANDERS, written by Daniel Defoe in 1722, will prove you wrong. Incest, adultery, bigamy, prostitution, and thievery stain her background as she tries to rise above her birth and gain wealth in 18th century England.Moll Flander's tale is told so lightly and humorously that the reader tends to forget about the seriousness and the sadness of her situations. It gives and accurate and clear picture of English life in the 1700's. The language Defoe uses is 18th century English, yet readers shouldn't get scared away. The reading becomes easier after the first couple of chapters.So, if you are looking for a good book to curl up by the fire with, read MOLL FLANDERS"},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"This book is about a woman, Moll Flanders, who was born in a prison and raised by a governess that brought her up as a \\"gentlewoman\\".

I would almost call this book feminist, although I don't like to use that term, since it makes men run from those books. I use that term very loosely, since it really does not go into any deeper feminst issues. This book is filled with adventures and is funny and witty, although its storyline is somewhat grim. I really wanted to give this book 3 1/2 stars because it left me wanting for more, not just at the end, but throughout.

I have long been a lover of classical language. As such, I am enchanted by the engaging rhythm of Defoe's words. His dialogue is charming as he uses a tongue and accent not much different from today's but far more elegant. The plot of the story, however, disappoints me. The story is wholly comprised of events, making it nothing more than a flowery timeline of one woman's life. For me, this odd combination of excellent language and mediocre plot makes for an ultimately readable yet slightly dissatisfying novel.Moll Flanders is the story of one woman's struggle to avoid the plight of poverty in seventeenth-century England. Moll is born in Newgate prison and orphaned by her criminal mother. From there, she is taken in by a kindly woman and raised as a \\"gentlewoman,\\" and thus her story begins. Moll's childhood innocence is quickly transformed as her life turns from that of a simple servant into that of a common prostitute. She soon learns that sex and marriage are merely tools for bartering with, and love is only worth its weight in gold. Eventually, Moll turns from prostitution to stealing in order to supplement her finances, and her life goes drastically downhill from there. Her story is littered with unresolved sin and shame, until one momentous event changes her entire outlook on life and on love and teaches her what it means to be righteous.Ultimately, what sounds like an intriguing story line results only in one continuous stream of events. Defoe's style of writing, although nicely worded, is impersonal in that he includes very little about the thoughts and feelings of Moll. Everything the reader learns about the main character is derived entirely from the events that comprise her life. Although this is supposed to be Moll's story, she has no reaction to the world around her. She simply reiterates what actions she has taken on her journey through life and what the resulting consequences are for those actions. Though hardly imagined to be a complete imbecile, Moll has absolutely no thought. The only words that I hear spoken directly from her mouth to the reader are words of dialogue to another character. The banality of this style of literature is highly disappointing in my eyes.I am also highly disappointed with the content of the story. Only the first few pages and the last few pages are void of any criminal or adulterous behavior. Every other page contains a perfect recollection of one sin after the other. Although the story claims that this unrelenting wickedness should be useful to deter other sinners, I find that the continuous stream practically drowns me with boredom. Eventually, I lose track of Moll's numerous husbands and her countless thieving exploits. Any time a reference is made to her past history, I am forced to flip through the pages to find the mentioned sin as I have gotten it confused with some other of a similar nature. By the end of the story, every adventure sounds the same and every man has the same amount of money. I would have liked to see more variety in these pages.I would not discourage another person from reading this book, however. I would gladly recommend it to those who love classical language, for I find Daniel Defoe was a great author for the words he could write, not necessarily for the stories he could create. The language is beautiful and enticing, for that alone I would recommend the book. Keep track of events and people while reading, though, because everything starts to sound the same after awhile."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"I particularly loved this book. I thought it was very cleverly written. I was able to get into the character's life situations and I always wanted to see what would happen to the woman next."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"Moll Flanders is a typical 18th Century book that one would read in a class about early English novels. Daniel Defoe's so-called \`masterpiece' gets labeled sometimes as one of the first novels ever written, and sometimes the prose shows. Written from the first-person perspective of the title character, MollFlanders tells the tale of a poor social low-life who has to turn to a life of crime after five failed marriages. Readers receive a rambling narrative of colorful characters that reside in the underbelly of 18th Century London. Moll Flanders was written originally as a sordid account that was to be taken as\`fact,' because of the way that Defoe mimicked the book after a popular form at the time that interviewed criminals on their deathbed. Defoe and his contemporaries used to compile these tales of redemption or non-repentance into what was called the Newgate Records. As the reader feels bad for Moll throughout the text, readers will see her go from a life of barely getting by to marrying her brother by accident to living a life of crimethrough her own agency. A sophisticated critique of the prison system and class economics of England, Defoe's work stands the test of time for fresh commentary and readability. While most people might find Defoe's writing style to be a bit antiquated, the story is not, and will most likely reach its intendedaudience. It's still true today that those criminals who become public examples are the ones from most of the lower castes, as are most criminals in general. The biggest question in Defoe's Moll Flanders still remains unanswered: How can one move up in a society that benefits those without any sort of inherited wealth or the means to further their position?"},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"I have been trying to read this book for several months now and I can't become interested enough to get into it for more than one or two evenings a month. The story itself is intriguing but seems to go on forever, though the novel itself is quite short. Keeping all the men in Moll's life straight gets confusing. Renting the movie would be much less cumbersome."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"It is a shame that for most Americans the only knowledge that they have of Defoe's MOLL FLANDERS is that which was taken from the various movie and television adaptions. The screen Moll focuses on the superficially glitzy part of what Defoe meant to be the edifying tale of a street trollop who uses her wits unrepentingly to enrich herself without worrying about the consequences. The transition of Moll from page to screen leaves out the feeling that life was, for her, one long debit page with the cost of an item to be balanced by its functional use.Moll did not start out as an unregenerate guttersnipe. At the book's start, Defoe is careful to portray her as the innocent lamb cast adrift in a sea of unscrupulous men. The world of Moll Flanders, the England of the 17th century, was not one designed to harbor any illusions that innocence could long remain that way in the face of ubiquitous lechery and poverty. Moll is seduced, then abandoned, and at the ripe age of 16,must fend for herself. The only coin that she retains to provide herself with the necessities of life is the one that she sits on.MOLL FLANDERS is unique among fallen from virtue women tales in its structure and incessant theme that to survive in an immoral world, one must be more immoral than everyone else. The novel itself is not divided into chapters. It is simply one very long series of vignettes, extending over many years, that portray Moll as the most infamous flat character in English literature. Moll's story can be summarized thusly: Moll steals, Moll eludes the law, Moll has innumerable (and unnamed) children, Moll commits incest (unknowingly) with her brother, Moll gets caught and is imprisoned. Throughout all of this, Moll changes not a whit. Her primary defense against a very nearly nonexistent conscience is her powerful sense of rationalization. One day, she sees a young child with some valuables hanging about his clothes. She pickpockets them, telling herself that the loss of these trifles ought to alert his parents that they could just have easily has suffered the loss of that child. Moll glides through life, usually coming out on top. As she gains reknown for her ill-deeds, she takes the time to compare her lot with those other poverty-stricken women who chose a life of virtue over crime. Moll cackles at their foolishness. The only time in the novel that she shows any remorse occurs when she is finally caught. At Rhett Butler said to Scarlett O'Hara in GONE WITH THE WIND, 'You are not sorry you committed wrong, but you are very sorry you got caught.'The question that modern readers have to grapple with is the intent of Daniel Defoe in presenting a woman whom today we would call a whore-grifter. Despite the tight focus on Moll, all that we learn of her after 300 pages of whoring is that she enjoyed her life with a gusto and cared not a fig about the consequences to her or to anyone else. Morality, Defoe seems to imply, is infinitely elastic, and its ultimate use is to justify the taking of material objects that rightfully belong to others. Moll, then, is the ancestor of Madonna's 'Material Girl,' one who blithely assumes that the bill for immorality need never be paid. Perhaps Defoe's inner lesson about Moll is that this elasticity of morality does result in an inevitable, if unwanted, payoff after all."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"One of the all time best works in the annals of literature, this highly involving and rich comic novel has perhaps the best heroine of any classic book. What a great narrative style, if not altogether a good role model; still, you can hardly blame Moll for all the trouble she gets into. Defoe really gets into the mind of this memorable female protagonist, so deftly, you will sympathsize with her from the first page. A truly sublime work of art. Add it to your personal library today."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"This human portrait of a woman is also an excellent sketch of the living conditions and the social stratification in England in the 18th century: 'the Age is so wicked and the Sex so Debauch'd'.It shows the immense chasm between a small class of wealthy people and the rest (Swift: 'a thousand to one'). The latter were struggling for sheer survival and praying 'Give me not Poverty, lest I steal' ... to be hanged: 'If I swing by the String, I shall hear the Bell ring, and then there's an End of poor Jenny.'But both classes intermingled.As E.J. Burford quotes in his masterful book 'The Synfulle Citie':Those who were riche were hangid by the PursseThose who were poore were hangid by the NeckeMoll Flanders: 'the passive Jade thinks of no Pleasure but the Money; and when he is as it were drunk in the Extasies of his wicked Pleasure, her Hands are in his Pockets.'The poor's religion was fatalism. Moll Flanders is all the time reproaching herself her Course of Life, 'a horrid Complication of Wickedness, Whoredom, Adultery, Incest, Lying, Theft...', but in the face of death at the gallows: 'I had now neither Remorse or Repentance ... no Thought of Heaven or Hell ... I neither had a Heart to ask God's Mercy.'Defoe's work is eminently modern with his psychological insight: 'What a Felicity is it to Mankind that they cannot see into the Hearts of one another, and 'Modest men are better Hypocrites';or, the ravage of alcoholism: 'the Drunk are the Men of whom Solomon says , they go like an Ox to the slaughter, till a Dart strikes through their Liver';and his feminism: 'the Disadvantage of the Women is a terrible Scandal upon Men', and 'Money only made a Woman agreeable'.Defoe's appeal to the reader 'every Branch of my Story may be useful to honest People', seems to be a smokescreen in order to circumvent censorship, because ultimately Moll Flanders prospers. This book is a perfect illustration of Bernard Mandeville's 'Triumph of Private Vices' in his 'Fable of the Bees'.Although some developments in this story are rather improbable, this superbly ironic and lively text constitutes an immortal portrait of the 'horrid Complication' to be a woman, here personified in Moll Flanders.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"I enjoyed the ending of the book because I felt as if I knew Moll but I felt the plot repeated itself and she continiously did the same things.

One interesting aspect is that it's a man narrating as a woman, but the style gets a little crusty, and you can almost read the second half by just skimming the adjectives and nouns, good gentleman, good governess, horrid wretch, thief, and etc. Things go from bad to worse for Moll as she ages, and loses her money making beauty, but she eventually regains her peace of mind and some comfort through something like a stroke of luck and her re-deliverance to Virginia. Interesting that Virginia is considered a step down from the home island and a world of hard labor and servitude in the year 1683 as opposed to England.I would say that this story is a bit outdated, since it becomes just a list of misfortunes, and the premise that she is a penitent woman at the end of the story with many secrets and no confessional available is a bit hackneyed and lame. It's got it's points though and it serves as a valuable point for looking at literature of this time period. My main problem is that the story is broken into chunks of three page stories of misfortune and then another chapter starts (although there are no actual chapters) of misfortune. So there is after a whil a feeling of more of the same."},{"Title":"The Fortunes and Misfortunes of the Famous Moll Flanders","review":"It is surprising to read that women are seen as an object in exchange for money and that in order for women to move up the social ladder, beauty and a bit of intelligence are essential.

The story of St. Augustine has always intrigued me since he was certainly not a saintly person when he was young. Reading Augustine's autobiographical work,The Confessions of St. Augustine (Dover Thrift Editions)I learned a lot about him, but I felt that I really knew him after readingThe Restless Flame. This book covers Augustine's journey to find God. The more Augustine learned about Christianity, he realized one of the greatest obstacles for him was that for Christians their religion is not just faith and not just knowledge either,it is a way of life.The author has a great talent for bringing the characters in the book to life. After I finished the book I wanted to know more about the man who could write such an incredible story and did a little research on de Wohl. I found that he began writing at the early age of seven. His early books were all adventure stories, but during WWII he became very religious and decided to start writing about the saints. Cardinal of Milan, Ildefonso Schuster, came to de Wohl after reading some of his writings and told him \\"Let your writings be good. For your writings you will one day be judged.\\"If you would like to know a little more about St. Monica, Augustine's mother, I recommendSt. Monica: The Power of a Mother's Love, another great book."},{"Title":"The restless flame,: A novel","review":"Inciteful read into the mind of a great Christian thinker and an early Church Father.

Her purpose in writing this book is to &quot;help the reader become more aware of times and seasons.&quot; (ix) One of the important things about Celtic spirituality (and the reason so many people are embracing it) is that the Celts, unlike others in the &quot;Western&quot; world, saw the goodness of God in all His creation. They lived in the world and they loved it. So Shirley Toulson takes us through the year as the Celts lived it, celebrating their saints from the great three of Columba, Patrick, and Brigit to the more obscure, the great seasonal feasts--holidays--such as Beltain and Samhain, and of course the holy days as well. Well illustrated, containing maps to many of the holy places (of which the Celtic lands have so many), and lots of literary excerpts, poems, and prayers, this is a book to enjoy year after year.

Would any normal person feel any serious remorse over cleverly giving the slip to an officious cop who was trying to arrest her for jaywalking?Note that Edmundson does not simply argue that a jaywalker should meekly submit to arrest but that the obligation to do so is just as great as that incumbent upon a murderer.That's crazy.How could an apparently sane adult reach such a conclusion?In his opening chapter, Edmundson informs us in great detail that all the best intellectual and academic authorities, including, he informs us, \\"eminent professors at places like Oxford, Virginia, Michigan, Columbia, and Toronto,\\" have concluded that there exists no general duty to obey the law. He indicates that he agrees with this consensus and goes on at length to explain his reasons for so agreeing.Prima facie, this would seem to strip government of any real moral legitimacy.Edmundson cannot live with that conclusion. He therefore suggests that, although there is no general obligation to obey the laws of one's country, there is, nonetheless, an obligation to obey the concrete bureaucratic edict of any low-level governmental functionary (Edmundson chooses the phrase \\"administrative prerogative\\").Edmundson can reach this bizarre conclusion only because his long-winded discussion of the reasons why the laws of one's country may not be morally binding ignores the most important reason of all: those laws were created simply by ordinary human beings who have somehow managed to arrogate to themselves the right to enact laws to which all citizens are expected to submit.Indeed, those who make the laws are often morally inferior to, and possessing of less natural authority than, the ordinary man on the street: as Mark Twain once suggested in the case of the United States of America, \\"there is no distinctly native American criminal class except Congress.\\"However, whatever the shortcomings of individual legislators, at least general laws can be publicly debated and inspected, are supposed to apply to everyone equally, etc. None of this is true of the specific, arbitrary decision of some low-level bureaucrat.If, as Edmundson himself argues in great detail, the general law does not merit the respect and obedience of individual citizens, then surely the citizens are not morally obligated to obey the arbitrary ukases of some weaselly little governmental functionary.In part two of the book, Edmundson argues that anarchists commit a fallacy in claiming that \\"the law is coercive.\\"His arguments here are equally bizarre.Webster's New World Dictionary defines \\"coerce\\" as:\\"1. to restrain or constrain by force, esp. by legal authority; curb. 2. to force or compel to do something. 3. to bring about by using force; enforce - SYN. see FORCE\\"I have checked a number of other dictionaries which have similar definitions: clearly the idea of \\"force\\" is central to the concept of coercing.Edmundson will have none of this. You see, since governments quite obviously do use force on the most massive of scales (guns, bombs, etc.), they quite obviously are \\"coercive\\" in the ordinary dictionary sense of the word. But \\"coercive\\" has a bit of a bad odor about it, and Edmundson is determined to remove any hint of an unpleasant stench from the concept of government.So, Edmundson simply redefines the word \\"coercion\\" so as to remove any reference to the central point about force. Voila! Government is no longer coercive.Of course, this actually changes nothing. The reason governmental authority has always been morally questionable is that governments routinely use massive violence in ways (war, taxation, etc.) which would be obviously immoral if pursued by private citizens. Changing the definition of the word \\"coercion\\" cannot change the nature of the actual physical activities in which governments engage.In part three of his book, Edmundson does finally stumble upon a real fallacy, one due to John Stuart Mill: \\"Mill divides personal faults into two categories. Members of the first concern the actor's 'own good' but do not affect the interests of others...\\"This is indeed a fallacy: even \\"private vices,\\" such as smoking pot or holding bizarre religious opinions may, by the bad example they set, have a negative effect on the interests of other people, on society at large.But this is not an \\"anarchical\\" fallacy: Mill, after all, was hardly an anarchist. (Indeed, Mill expressed serious sympathy for socialism, although he knew too much economics to be a socialist without reservations.)This fallacy is instead a debating trick used by _supporters_ of government, such as contemporary liberals, socialists, etc., who try to reassure those fearful of government power that there is an \\"inner sphere\\" of \\"private morality\\" with which the government will never interfere. In practice, given the insatiable appetite of the state for power, this inner sphere tends to shrink to the vanishing point (consider the current push for \\"political correctness\\" in the US).Anarchists emphatically reject this fallacy: the central argument of anarchy is that government cannot be constrained to any limited sphere of action and therefore must be abolished.The liberal concept of \\"limited\\" government is an oxymoron.In short, while Edmundson certainly delivers (at least) three fallacies in this book, the fallacies are not due to anarchists: the fallacies all belong to Edmundson himself or to his fellow liberals and socialists.Although I myself am sympathetic to anarchism, I could easily pen a much harsher critique of anarchism than Edmundson has done. No intelligent critic of anarchism will find this book to be of any use whatsoever.If this is the best that opponents of anarchism can do, then the intellectual triumph of anarchism is truly assured."},{"Title":"Three Anarchical Fallacies: An Essay on Political Authority (Cambridge Studies in Philosophy and Law)","review":"&quot;No bare synopsis of the argument can do justice to Edmundson's profundity, the care and depth of his reasoning, and the helpfulness of his engagement with the thought of contemporary scholars and philosophers long deceased.

The first chapter contains almost a dozen different ways to embellish your beasts, from stitches to painting to quilting. Tips and techniques are given when needed, and each pattern is clearly marked in level of difficulty.You'll find Apatasaurs, Stegosaurs, Triceretops, Pteradons, Ankylosaurus, Tyranosaurus, Dimetrodon, Spinosaurus, and more! There are two plush dolls, four hand puppets, two kites, a costume, an apron and a sweatshirt with my personal favorite, the allosaur. Each project has some information on the beast.The patterns need to be enlarged, which can be tricky, since some copiers don't copy up to 157% (the ammount for Dimetrodon) on one page. Brought up to scale the T-Rex is almost a yard long! Many, like the Stego, do well with a slightly smaller size.The patterns are easy to alter, if you wish to make a Brachiasaur or even Godzilla. Just remember, there's no seam allowance on the pieces; unaware, my first Ankylosaur came out a little bulky and 'round' looking. After adding the alloted seam allowance I was able to make a sharper, more defined dinosaur.The only real flaw I can see is that the dinos drag their tails. I like my dinos warm blooded. This is easy to remedy, however, by tracing the apttern and rotating the paper until the tail is in the 'proper' position.I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to sew these extinct beasts!"},{"Title":"Sew a Dinosaur: 21 Playful Prehistoric Beasts to Follow You Home","review":"Lipson has created an intriguing set of dinosaurs in various fabric crafts - from stuffed toys to mobiles to sweatshirts.

C.","review":"It surprises me that it is necessary to argue whether or not Columbus discovered the Americas. But whatever you call it, Columbus transformed the world by what he did. Even so, Sailing to Paradise presents a case for not even the odd visit before Columbus but of a substantial intercourse between the two hemispheres during the Bronze Age. Very much like Ignatius Donnelly's Atlantis for today (although one to be taken seriously), this book compiles all the evidence of pre-Columbian contact.The thesis is this: tin and copper, needed in to make bronze, only existed in sufficient quantities in America. (The source is otherwise a mystery.) Trade was carried out and the metals (and religions) transported to the Middle East by the sea people, Atlas people or Phoenicians, and distributed. (It gets very complex.) Even megalithic stones, like Stonehenge, were built for navigation to America. When iron surpassed bronze, trade ended and so did commerce, except in small numbers. It also presents evidence of significant interaction between America and India.Presents many solid foundations for the approach to understanding history, but although sometimes convincing in its arguments, it often inserts any scrap to prove a point, firm or flimsy, and often requires leaps of faith on short evidence. Interprets almost all stories (myths, Bibles, hearsay) as relating to his thesis. At one turn saying that one thing can be taken literally, but that another must be substantially re-interpreted in order to fit it well into the picture of the Bronze-Age world he describes. Yet the only real incredible thing to accept is that every mystery is explained by this one idea.Still it is thought-provoking and self critical enough to be taken for serious consideration. Most things before 500 years ago are sketchy and always open to some debate. The further in the past the more this is true. In this sense, we are blinded by a lack of written sources, yet his argument is that this book is only to establish a basis from which to focus archaeological study. Which is true since what is provided as evidence is still too circumstantial, even if I agree with much of what he says (even if not the broad thesis).As for how the book is put together, things are often referred to casually, such as places, expecting the reader, apparently academics, to follow his line. So this book may not be easily understood by a general reader, since he is clearly presenting this theory in the line of an academic argument. Of trivial note, although there are many illustrations, one irritation was that they don't follow the text. You have to continually hunt around for them. So read this book, if this sort of historical debate or theories about Atlantis (America?) are of interest to you."},{"Title":"Sailing to Paradise: The Discovery of the Americas by 7000 B. C.","review":"Bailey's 'Sailing to Paradise' is both interesting and informative, largely due to its role as a compendium of related facts and source-document references unavailable anywhere else (at least under a single cover). Where the author sticks to actual background and archaeological evidence, the premise of the work is sound.Unfortunately, like many first-time authors of a genre Bailey doesn't end there.His theories about America being the root of the ancient Atlantis mythology appear again and again, held together with vestiges of inferences drawn from the most tenuous of associations. Later in the work these are cited as 'grounds' for making further assumptions, until the edifice of half-supported innuendo, conjecture, personal interpretation and single-source citations becomes a house of cards - ready to topple at even the slightest push. I found for example a number of linguistic and epigraphical premises (the author's) which were not only contrary to accepted canon, but entirely outside the author's own realm of professional expertise.While the book is seriously flawed as an integral work of academic research, it remains interesting and useful. Unlike the speculative works of Erich von D&auml;niken and other pseudo-science writers, Bailey takes pains to cite real authorities, correctly attributes photographs, maps, and other reference materials, and provides a unifying historical context which is (for the most part) cohesive and plausible.Within these narrow confines 'Sailing to Paradise' makes an interesting read. With aggressive editing and serious academic oversight it might well have been a seminal work of great importance. As it is the reader is left with the unenviable task of mining the book's gems from a considerable amount of largely irrelevant dross. What one takes away from it is therefore largely dependent on how much sweat-equity is invested."},{"Title":"Sailing to Paradise: The Discovery of the Americas by 7000 B.

C.","review":"If you are interested in a collection of facts about world prehistory, combined with excellent theory and a bit of speculation, you'll love this book. While the book has been treated rather poorly by some academics, as the years go by, Jim Bailey is more and more vindicated. The book's illustrations, alone, are worth pondering. The chapter on ancient scripts points to new theories on the origin of writing and of the Phoenicians. The main thesis of the book is that there was world-wide trade in metals by as early as 7000BCE (at least), and that the Sea Peoples who conducted this trade linked the Old World and the New World together in countless ways. When the Bronze Age ended, the need for copper from the New World dropped off, and oontact between the two hemispheres became so sporadic that some Europeans completely forgot about the New World, except in legend. Bailey's tone is sometimes dry and humorous, and it wasn't until my second reading of the book that I saw the reason for some of the apparently extraneous details included in some paragraphs. It is a difficult subject to tackle and organize, especially since no scholarly work has been published on this thesis in recent times. Whether or not you end up agreeing with Bailey, you'll learn a great deal about ancient history and about the effect of the oceans on human activity. Having examined much of the same evidence myself and attempted to write on the subject, I appreciate the difficulty of the task. Bailey manages to stay fairly non-polemical, too, even though he knows his detractors won't. Some people have read this book as proof that \\"white men\\" are responsible for the early exploration of the globe, but if one reads at all carefully, it is readily apparent that Bailey is proposing something much more complex. People, if they lived near particular ocean currents, were bound to take their boats around the oceans. As these people devised ever more sophisticated methods of mapping and navigation, they ruled the seas and shaped land history more than has ever been realized. I believe Bailey's explanations of Carnac in Brittany and other megalithic sites within the Celtic region are very deserving of a close read. If the book seems a bit disorganized to some, it is because it's a big subject with a lot of facts. Bailey tries to include facts that counter his own proposals for the reader's consideration, as any intelligent and scrupulous author would do. I'd love to know more about who Bailey is and where he is now (email me: athemyst@yahoo.com if you read this, Jim!).

In looking over other materials, I can now see that the Princeton Review manual is a lot less thorough, although it is clearer and more readable. Since many courses do not cover all the material on the exam, lack of thoroughness can mean the student does not get any exposure to several topics. If you are looking for an above average score, this book is certainly easier to follow, as well as more enjoyable. However, it is not for the person loking for the highest possible score.

The former teaches by showing - serving as a reference book when you are trying enhance the functionality of your VB application. The latter teaches by doing - allowing your mind to actively grasp the concepts behind API calls, structures, and pointers, instead of mindlessly hacking through APIs, tossing in variables, hoping for success. The puzzles in this book allow you to learn from your mistakes. Mr. Appleman explains his own logic as he works through the problem. For me, this is more valuable than just being told the answer as many books in this genre do.This book is vital to help train a VB programmer to become a designer, rather than a developer. It helps you understand the importance of visualizing the solution to the problem before writing a single line of code. In sports they say that you need to visualize the goal before you actually play the game. I think the same goes for coding. This book is the ideal companion for that exercise. If you are a technical team lead, go ahead and assign these puzzles to your developers so that they can not only hone their skills, but also sharpen their minds.In addition, Mr. Appleman's writing style of light bantering and humor is a nice relief from the dry technical-journalistic writing of other Visual Basic authors....this book is not a cookbook...it can be better thought of as Ingredient Book. By understanding the fundamental ingredients towards cooking up a VB/WinAPI program, it helps you become a better chef.

Seven deaths resulted out of overt negligence on the part of Oregon laws, businesses, political action committees and the farmer(s) involved. The author dealing with the personal impact of this tragedy, eventually decides to take action and attempts to pursue legal recourse. The book outlines the tremendous forces that come into play within our business/legal/political system(s) when it comes to assuming responsibility/liability for both the personal and ongoing environmental disasters that evolve out of negligence and irresponsibility. This book stirs even the apathetic into action"},{"Title":"Ever After: A Father's True Story","review":"Ever After (published in the UK as Wrongful Deaths) is the most personal of William Wharton's novels. It tells the tragic life story of the writer's eldest daughter from her childhood, through unhappy marriage and not-too-successful career in teaching to her second much happier marriage and tragic death in a traffic accident caused by grass burning in Oregon. The accident took the lives of her, her husband and two daughters. This part is poignant and most touching.The second part details the attempts of the relatives of the deceased to bring the guilty to justice and, which is by far more important, to ban grass burning in the state of Oregon. This part is even more likely to bring tears to your eyes as it is a long and losing battle. The mourning families don't stand any chance against the US political and legal system, and the local fat cats. They are cheated and ouwitted by cunning lawyers and politicians too greedy to see that their actions only add to family tragedies. Wharton's dissection of the US legal system is extremely edifying to anyone who still believes in it.Wharton presents his personal tragedy in an extremely touching way, inviting the reader to share his loss without giving up his dignity.

II. Rommen's book is a poignant reminder of what the law should as opposed to the will of the ruler, the party, the Volks, etc. This book is based on the Catholic Scholastics and especially St. Thomas Aquinas'(1225-1275) thinking. Rommen included the later Scholastics such as Suarez c. 1545-1618). Readers are shown a reasonable and logical view of law vs. the will of the ruler(s).Rommen deals with Natural Law as an attempt to reflect what religious men and women consider as a reflection of God's Law. The thinking was that since God is the Creator and author of nature, Natural Law should be an attempt to reflect God's nature rather than assigning an arbitrary will to Divine Providence.Rommen's book is clear that the two views re God's nature as opposed to God's arbitrary will are important in understanding the temptation to impose unbridled power of rulers which can lead to tyranny and evil. St. Thomas Aquinas' views are a prominent feature of the book. Rommen reminds readers that people should try to maintain a moral code that reflects God's nature. Rommen also deals with the opposing view that Original Sin means that men are depraved and can do nothing right to please God. Rommen uses St. Thomas Aquinas and the later Scholastics to counter this view. Basically, Rommen argues that Original Sin did not mean that men were depraved. He argued that men were not the best they could be, and the Natural Law not only protected people from criminals, but it also provided a useful guide for men to act justly and fairly with other men all of whom were created in God's image.These debates started c. 1300s in the disputes between the Realists and Nominalists. The Nominalists are that concepts and ideas were merely names agreed upon for philosophical debate. The Realists argued that concepts and ideas were realities and were vital to an understanding of God, Natural Law, and a just moral code. As St. Thomas Aquinas stated, the law was intended to give each man his due. The Nomialist's arguements re the lack of validity trivialized serious philosophical discussion and deprived the views of God's nature. They emphasized God's will since concepts were mere names and could not lead to Natural Law. This was a very dangerous concept since men could not make moral decisions since God's will precluded men from acting a moral agents. The Nominalists also argued that whatever evil occured was the will of God. In other words they ascribed evil to God which St. Thomas Aquinas the Suarez stated was impossible with God's nature. The Nominalist implied predestination to men whose fate and salvation were already determined before men were born. In other words, as Rommen makes clear, men were incapable of making moral decisions and had to accept evil as God's plan. This arguement was then used to condone the evil tyranny of unjust rulers who appointed themselves as God's lieutenants on earth. The implied arguement, later accepted in Protestant cirles, was that criticism of an unjust ruler was an attack on God. Rommen presents St. Thomas Aquinas' view that an unjust law was no law at all and led men to sensilessly act in an evil way. Suarez went so far as to argue that an unjust tyrant could lawfully be deposed as such a ruler set a bad example and committed his subjects to act in complience with evil.Rommen was not a phony idealist. He was clear that no ruler or political party could create heaven on earth. Rommen argued that Natural Law and an attempt to get men to act in accordance with God's nature was a reasonable concept of law which could prevent the excesses of tyranny and evil. Since rulers held power, they too were required by law to act as best they could with God's nature which admitted no evil.As mentioned above, Rommen's book was written at the end of W.W. II and was a reminder of what men suffered from blindly listening to evil rulers and political parties. The usefullness of this book could be projected to later attempts at arbitrary power regardless of political labels. One should note that the National Socialists were much less successful in German elections in Catholic regions of Germany during the 1930s, and Hitler & co. (Stalin & co. as well)hated Pope Pius XII and Catholic leaders in their domains. They knew that a relience on a reasonable Natural Law undermined their own self imposed importance. Rommen is clear about this.While THE NATURAL LAW was translated from German into English, the prose is clear. This book is a good introduction to Scholasticism and legal reasoning. The book is also valuable for thoughtful men who can refute the appeals to tyranny with better ideas."},{"Title":"The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social History and Philosophy","review":"D.S.Heersink makes a common error commited by modern sophists; and that is of presuppossing the truth of a premise on the basis of the erroneous human authority of previous modern sophists. In this case the previous modern sophists are the empiricists David Hume and G.E.Moore. This appeal to fallible human authority is not philosophy but ideology because philosophy proves its conclusions as opposed to presuming their truth based on fallible human authority. D.S presumes that Hume and Moore already decisively refuted the natural law theory(NLT). However, they have done nothing of the sort. Anyone educated in moral philosophy(ethics) as exposited by Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas knows the principles of ethics present in theoretical philosophy, specifically the scientific theory of human nature and the Aristotelian science of metaphysics as exposited by Aquinas and Aristotle. Aquinas derives moral goodness from human nature in the natural moral law; see his Summa Contra Gentiles Book III:129. This is a little known text that proves the existence of the natural moral law, not from the eternal law of God as in the Summa Theologiae but from human nature itself. In my course paper as a graduate student in philosophy I wrote on this subject and how it relates to the so-called \\"naturalistic fallacy\\" arguments against the NLT. I discovered that G.E.Moore and his empiricists/illogical positivists allies are instead the ones who commit a fallacy. They commit the fallacy of equivocation between between a real distinction and a logical(conceptual) distinction. Their fact/value distinction is a reflection of the logical(conceptual) distinction between being and goodness in general; however there is no real distinction between being and goodness in general. In reality being and goodness in general are the same and this is what allows Aquinas to derive moral goodness in the natural moral law from goodness in general as applied to the good and being of human nature. By means of the real identity but logical distinction beween the goodness and being of human nature, Aquinas is able to derive moral goodness from the perfections of human nature without violationg the logical distinction between the being of human nature and goodness in general( reflected in the fact/value distinction). Therefore in the G.E.Moore/David Hume objections to the NLT they commit a fallacy of equivocation between the real distinction between fact and value, which is false and is opposed by Thomistic NLT, and a logical(conceptual) distinction between fact and value, which is true and is affirmed by Thomistic NLT. Thus NLT do not confuse facts and \\"values\\" and there is no such thing as a naturalistic fallacy. Instead, it is Moore and Hume and their like that commit the fallacy of equivocation between a real distinction and a logical distinction. Further, contrary to Heersink's comments this book by Rommen is an excellent study in the history of NLT detailing the ancient sophists, like their modern sophistic counterparts, who rejected the natural moral law to the corruption of NLT by classical liberalism as represented by John Locke and other philosophical revolutionaries of the 18th century(they used natural law as a prop for revolution,sedition and classical liberalism). Further D.S.Heersink is seriously ignorant when he comments that only the Catholic Church's moral theology embraces Thomistic natural law. First, Thomistic NLT as proven in Summa Contra Gentiles III:129 and as articulated in his Commentary on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics and Politics and certain strictly philosophical segments of the Summa Theologiae's Treatise on Law and Treatise on Justice and Treatise on Temperance; are essentially distinct from theology because their arguments are based on reason alone. Cicero and Aristotle held to an elementary version of NLT and neither where theologians and both were pre-Christians. Aquinas frequently refers to both Cicero and Aristotle in his writings pertaining to NLT without using them as final authorities in his argumentation for the conclusions of NLT; unlike modern sophists who appeal to fallible human authority as their final word. Aquinas actually proves all the conclusions of NLT using reason alone; which Heerskink would know if he was not ignorant of the works of Aquinas. For example in the Summa Contra Gentiles Book III:122 Aquinas proves that every intentional frustration of the procreative good of human sexuality is intrinsically evil and he does the same in his disputed questions on moral evil question 15, article 3. Since every contraceptive act and every homosexual act is an intentional frustration of the procreative good of human sexuality, by aaa-I syllogism Aquinas proves by reason alone that every contraceptive act and every homosexual act is intrinsically evil. Therefore he lists contraception and homosexual behavior as species of the unnatural vice which violates the cardinal virtue of temperance. As far as abortion is concerned, while it is true that Aristotle erred on this particular issue it was not because of his NLT principles but despite them. Aquinas since he condemned contraception, necessarily condemned all abortion as intrinsically evil since every abortion is the intentional killing of the result of human procreation irrespective of when human life begins. These conclusions of NLT are rooted in Aristotle's proven conclusions of ethics, especially his theory of the virtue of temperance and that of natural justice(which Aristole in his Ethics affirms is universal and transcends every civil law and every political society). Notice in these arguments there is no reference to religious faith and Cicero, Aristotle, and also Aquinas(SCG III:129 and his strictly philosophical texts) exemplify the capacity of moral philosophers to affirm and articulate NLT without reference to religious faith. Further, the best defense of NLT is not Robert George. He is a token political conservative professor at Princeton University who affirms the \\"New Natural Law Theory\\" invented by Germain Grisez and promoted by John Finnis and Martin Rhonheimer. This theory, with absurd, ahistorical, and disastrous results, is the result of an attempt to save NLT from the empiricists criticism by Hume and Moore, by conceding their objections to classical NLT and then constructing a NLT that is the product of Kantian ethics and its divorce of practical reason from theoretical reason with Thomistic NLT. This explicitly contradicts Aquinas' own proof of the natural moral law from the theoretical knowledge of human nature as presented in SCG III:129 and has disastrous results regarding the nature of human happiness as consisting in intellectual virtue. Further, the nonsense is the empiricism of David Hume in his Treatise Against Human Nature and the illogical positivism of G.E.Moore in his Principia Ethica both of which theories of knowledge are self-contradictory and therefore logically impossible. In fact any objection to NLT on the grounds that it presupposes the reality of human nature, while accurately representing NLT, is a false objection that presupposes the empiricists denial of nature, human nature, and especially the human intellect's knowledge of nature and human nature. Similarily all denials of nature, human nature, or human intellectual knowledge of these two are based on errors contrary to philosophical physics or to scientific epistemology(includes theory of knowledge). Like the ancient sophists who opposed NLT, these modern sophists start with their erroneous theories of knowledge and fit everthing including their ethical theories into their erroneous theory of knowledge. Both are systematically and intentionally ignorant of the scientific exposition of philosophy provided by Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. As a result of their ignorance they commit massive errors in their works including a fallacy of equivocation between a real distinction and a logical(conceptual) distinction in their very assertion that NLT commits their invented \\"naturalistic fallacy\\". Finally, the best words to end on are the words of Cicero, as quoted from Rommen's book. These words indicate how far classical NLT is from modern political sophistry, masquerading as philosophy, and from the modern political ideologies of classical and modern liberalism; all of which affirm some form of legal dictatorship known as legal positivism and which denies the very existence of a natural moral law. Cicero states that \\"true law is right reason in agreement with nature; it is of universal application, unchanging and everlasting; it summons to duty by its commands, and averts from wrongdoing by its prohibitions... We cannot be freed from its obligations by senate or people... one eternal and unchangeable law will be valid for all nations and all times... Whoever is disobedient is fleeing from himself and denying his human nature,and by reason of this very fact he will suffer the worst penalties, even if he escapes what is commonly considered punishment.\\" pg. 21 footnote 12 of Heinrich A. Rommen. The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social History and Philosophy. Wow!This was not stated by a \\"religious fundamentalist\\", a category invented by modernity, but by the non-Christian philosopher Cicero. Now what is true of individuals also pertains to the political society made up of individuals that violate the natural moral law and this is the modern state; the modern state is in violation of the natural moral law because of its promotion of contraception,abortion, sodomy, and pornograpy( the crimes of the modern state) and it will suffer the worst penalties, even if it escpaes what is commonly considered punishment. Unfortunately, my nation the United States of America with its U.S. constitution has been in violation of the natural moral law from its very beginning because of its classical liberalism and racist slavery and now because of the previously mentioned moral evils affirmed by modern liberalism. As far as what texts I recommend to anyone who wants to study ethics and political science. Start with Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics and the Thomistic commentary on this strictly philosophical work. Next study the treatise that Aquinas has on happiness and the treatises on the cardinal virtues, and the treatise on law as presented in his Summa Theologiae. Finally study his commentary on Aristotle's Politics. Many of Aquinas' political writings are collected in an edition by Cambridge. Francis Vitoria is the best Thomistic commentator on matters of political science. Unfortunately, there is no single work that unites all these Thomistic texts into a complete scientific exposition of ethics nor into a complete sicientific exposition of political science. This is something that hopefully will be produced by me in the future. John F. Wippel's \\"The Metaphysical Thought of Thomas Aquinas\\" is an excellent historical work that starts this process in metaphysics."},{"Title":"The Natural Law: A Study in Legal and Social History and Philosophy","review":"The book came quickly and in excellent condition.

E. Moore in his Principia Ethica (1903), both well before this book was published in Germany during the rise of Nazism. For historical assessments, several texts do a much better job in presenting the historical rise through Stoicism and finally its demise in the Age of Enlightenment. Today, only the Roman Catholic Church, and specifically its Moral Theology, embraces Thomistic Natural Law as its bogus basis for sexual prohibitions (contraception, abortion, homophilia). If a moral reason exists for these prohibitions, it is NOT from Natural Law Theory, it is NOT from the Moral Imperative of the Harm Principle, and it is NOT from Aristotlean Ethics. The Church and those who appeal to Natural Law Theory commit the Fact/Value Fallacy, and the notion that god built a moral system on a fallacy should put this nonsense to rest.The best defense of NLT is Robert George, whose apologetics are elegant as they are dogmatic."},{"Title":"Christian Fatherhood: The Eight Commitments of St. Joseph's Covenant Keepers","review":"FACT: Four out of ten American children will go to bed tonight in a home without their fathers (Blankenhorn, David, Fatherless America, 1995).FACT: About 90 percent of single-parent homes are without a father.

The book's claim is, of course, patently false.The reasoning behind this false claim includes, among other things, an appeal to the writings of Wayne Grudem, a Protestant with a weak understanding of both scripture and linguistics whose works have been debunked time and again by better scholars.What Pope John Paul II *actually* teaches about the mutual subjection of spouses may be found in his apostolic exhortation &quot;On the Dignity and Vocation of Women&quot; (Mulieris Dignitatem):&quot;The author [of Ephesians] knows that this way of speaking [in Ephesians 5:22-23], so profoundly rooted in the customs and religious tradition of the time, is to be understood and carried out in a new way: as a 'mutual subjection out of reverence for Christ' (cf. Eph 5:21).... However, whereas in the relationship between Christ and the Church the subjection is only on the part of the Church, in the relationship between husband and wife the 'subjection' is not one-sided but mutual.... the awareness that in marriage there is mutual 'subjection of the spouses out of reverence for Christ,' and not just that of the wife to the husband, must gradually establish itself in hearts, consciences, behavior and customs. This is a call which from that time onwards does not cease to challenge succeeding generations; it is a call which people have to accept ever anew. St. Paul not only wrote: 'In Christ Jesus...there is no more man or woman,' but also wrote: 'There is no more slave or freeman.' Yet how many generations were needed for such a principle to be realized in the history of humanity through the abolition of slavery! ....But the challenge presented by the 'ethos' of the Redemption is clear and definitive. All the reasons in favor of the 'subjection' of woman to man in marriage must be understood in the sense of a 'mutual subjection' of both 'out of reverence for Christ.'&quot; (section 24)How could Steve Wood so flagrantly deny a clear teaching of Pope John Paul II? The only possible explanation I can think of is that perhaps his conversion to Catholicism was not yet complete when he wrote this book. At any rate, Catholics should follow Pope John Paul II rather than Steve Wood. &quot;Mutual subjection&quot; of wife to husband AND husband to wife is the authentic Gospel ethos."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius","review":"In calling Holden's book a &quot;popular&quot; biography, I do not mean to denigrate his scholarship. Holden has done a lot of research, but he wears his learning lightly. His biography is &quot;popular&quot; in the best sense - gracefully written, mercifully short (300 pages), interesting, and entertaining. He neither gets bogged down in minutia, nor does he oversimplify. Some of his conclusions may be controversial (and what is not controversial, in Shakespeare studies?) but Holden gives his reasons, and generously references opposing views, so that readers can make up their own minds as to the plausibility of his deductions.The book may be a little confusing to absolute beginners, and it might not contain enough detailed argument to satisfy academic scholars. But I would imagine that most everybody else would find in it a great deal of enjoyment, information, and interest."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius","review":"Some of the other reviews incite me to add yet a few more words. Holden does NOT blur fact and fiction. He consistently lables speculation and inference, identifies sources, outlines opposing views, gives reasons for his choices, and qualifies his conclusions. His reading of the plays, while brief, reaches deeply into the heart of Shakespeare's works. This is a responsible and valuable book."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius","review":"This is the essential preface to any first reading of the collected works of Shakespeare. It's the perfect introduction for the student -- and a rich summing up for an experienced reader or theater person. Despite Holden's previous oeuvre of front-table bookstore products about Prince Charles, Princess Di, Olivier, the Oscars, etc., this is a serious (though very readible) biography, which makes full use of a vast resource of scholarship. Tossing -- or, rather, kicking -- aside any nonsense about the plays and poems being the work of some mystery author, Holden presents Shakespeare's chronology with clarity, rich color and carefully examined detail. He relates the plays to what is known or can be reasonable inferred about the succeeding periods of Shakespeare's life and the developing stages of his thought. He does not idealize or fantasize. And he places the works in the context of the theatrical history of the period. The reader comes away enriched with a profound feeling for the qualities that Shakespeare's admirers so value. The plays become more accessible in the process, as does Shakespeare scholarship.

Holden provides the best explaination, based on evidence, I have ever seen about what Shakespeare was doing during the &quot;Lost Years&quot; and how he came to be in London. I learned many new things from this book, and I am already well versed in Shakespeare."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius","review":"Somewhat to my surprise, this is a first-rate popular biography of a genius about whom we know practically nothing. Not that this has stopped any number of amateur sleuths from the Baconians to Eric Sams from trying to find clues in the poems and plays. Holden's is by far the liveliest and most readable. He doesn't make the mistake Anthony Burgess did of spraying his own personality over Shakespeare in the usual tom-cat fashion; nor is he bonkers, excessively academic or portentous. If you want to discover as much as can be known or surmised about the Bard, especially the early years, then Holden's book is fascinating. His thesis that the SHakespeares all closet Catholics, and that the young WS was sent as a teenager to recusant Lancashire to teach at Sir Thomas Hesketh's house as good an explanation as any of how the \\"rude groom\\" acquired polish and knowledge of how aristocratic families lived. His gloss on his marriage, the untimely death of his son Hamnett and his growing interest in his daughters all substantiated by apt quotations.A wonderful piece of detective-work. Alongside Joanthan Bates's The Genius of Shakespeare it's a great new addition to the modern enthusiast's library."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius","review":"In William Shakespeare: The Man Behind The Genius, Anthony Holden creates a fresh, vivid, informative biographical portrait of the greatest writer English literature has ever produced. Shakespeare's life story is a colorful tale, from his childhood as the son of a glove maker, a teenager who left home to join a Catholic household in the English countryside, a shotgun wedding to spinster Anne Hathaway, turning actor with a group of traveling players, moonlighting as a stable-boy and stage prompter in London, playing small parts and co-writing plays on the London stage, living in a noble household, falling in love, experiencing the pangs of sexual jealous, catching the clap, becoming a wealthy landowner, haunted by the death of his son, worrying about his daughters' future, and eventually dying from drink at the age of 52. Holden interleaves the poet's own words with the know facts of his life to create a fascinating biography told in absorbing detail and revealing a very human Shakespeare. William Shakespeare is &quot;must&quot; reading for anyone who has ever thrilled to the words of the Bard of Avon."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius","review":"I found the book to be extremely hard to get through, wordy and boring. The entire book focuses on direct quotations from all of Shakespeare's works with little focus as to why the quotations were included in the text. The book gives the reader little of his personal life, personality, or political views, but focuses only on hundreds of people that he knew and met throughout the years giving detailed explanations of names, and their backgrounds. I found the book to be very boring, with little content on Shakespeare as a person; the book featured only comments on his hundreds of works. If you are EXTREMELY well versed with Shakespeare's works, this is a good pick for you. If you have some to little knowledge, pick something else. For the student who needs interesting information on him as a person, choose another book. I found it to be dry, repetative and only in depth on quotations from thousands of plays."},{"Title":"William Shakespeare: The Man Behind the Genius","review":"Anthony Holden's &quot;biography&quot;, if you can call it that, of William Shakespeare is so unbelievably shoddy, that it is surprising that it has been published by a reputable house. It is also sloppy, speculative, and downright unnecessary. Holden engages in irresponsible conjectures, which he fobs off as truth, when there is in fact no evidence. He departs freely from fact, but doesn't have the decency to tell his reader when he is indulging in a flight of fancy. As Michiko Kakutani says in The New York Times, this book is best read not as a biography at all, but as a work of fiction.It is ironic that Anthony Holden has savagely attacked J.K. Rowling, the wondrously creative author of the Harry Potter series, when his own writing is so slipshod and amateurish. Perhaps his real objection is that she's a woman, from a middle-class background at that, not an Oxford don like C. S. Lewis. He only wishes he had Ms. Rowling's creativity and vision!"},{"Title":"Get Wise! Mastering Math Word Problems (Peterson's Get Wise!)","review":"I had checked this book out from my local library 2x's and decided to purchase. I always struggled with word problems in school. This book gives good instructions on how to identify the type of math to use and how to break down the question, 4 -5 practice questions and the answers to everyone with an explanation of how to get the answer. It covers distance, ratios, percentages, piece problems. It covers them all. I would recommend this book not only for kids but for any adults that need to ace interview math tests. That is the main reason I purchased it."},{"Title":"The Heart of the Family","review":"'The Heart of the Family' is the third in a trilogy of books about the Eliot family, who live in the ancient and atmospheric houses of Damerosehay and The Herb of Grace. They are a talented bunch, middle-class and in many ways privileged, but also suffering and making mistakes as they struggle to make sense of life and their own sufferings. Elizabeth Goudge has a highly imaginative and siritual vision of the inner meaning of life and invests ordinary events with quite intense beauty and sweetness. I have read a dismissive comment that she writes fairytales for adults. Actually, there is truth in this, because she reduces life to its deepest significance and understands that we must have myths and symbols in our imagination which help us to grasp this meaning. Her work rewards careful reading and re-reading and one can ponder some of her sentences for a long time. Some would find her work over-sentimental, but it seems to me that she has paid a high price in terms of personal search and even suffering to understand some of the things she writes about. Her writings are not in keeping with the material spirit of the age, but contain a timeless wisdom. They are also enjoyable and entertaining to read."},{"Title":"The Heart of the Family","review":"I disagree with William Tegner, who has not apparently read the preceding 2 books and was therefore clearly at sea most of the time. This is a very good book, the third of the Eliot trilogy. It is not merely &quot;more of the same&quot; about the Eliots, but in fact is considerably denser, i.e., harder to get through, and even, dare I say it, more despairing than any other book by Goudge that I have read (and unlike Tegner, I have read many). The themes it raises are those of war, &quot;the pity of war, the pity war distills&quot;, atomic devastation, and at the more local level, those of familial (and familiar) disappointments. Specifically, Ben, the eldest of Naomi and George's children has turned away from the career they selected for him, and has also announced that he will marry, as his parents see it, &quot;beneath him&quot;. This is not a happy book, and it is tough going after the almost lyric poetry of the earlier two, but it is well worth the effort. It is Goudge at her most adult, her least fanciful. It is like suddenly reading prose where before it was all poetry."},{"Title":"The Heart of the Family","review":"The Eliot trilogy is my favorite of the Goudge books - I wish it could be adapted into a Masterpiece Theater series. The characters are complex and drawn with love, the descriptions relax me, the setting can't be better - the English countryside. Plus there are wise thoughts sprinkled throughout. A great series!"},{"Title":"The Heart of the Family","review":"This is the final installment of the Eliot trilogy. As the previous books \\"Bird in the Tree\\" and \\"The Herb of Grace\\" established the characters, we see them about 6 or 7 years later than the second book which was just after WW2 in England. Now they are in the early 50's era and struggling with real life issues which as per E Goudge-- isn't always a happily ever after. At least not yet. Some personal sacrifice is in order to bring about harmony within the family. It winds up the trilogy in a satisfactory way. Not everyone is happy, but it all turns out well. Flaws in each person are explored, the consequences of actions taken earlier are shown and everyone gets a chance to make things right.Of all the books this is the least likely to read as a stand alone, as much of the action depends on decisions made in the previous two books. However it wouldn't ruin anyone's pleasure to start here, or to just read this by itself, it's just for the full experience it would be nicer to read either of the previous two.I love this series, and eagerly await it coming out on Kindle, as I love to go back to these books again and again. When I feel a bit depressed or tired, this set never fails to set me back up to enjoying life and other people again. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Heart of the Family","review":"When I was at school a master wrote on the third page of a boy's essay, &quot;no marks so far&quot;. I felt this constantly as I waded through page after page of Ms. Goudge's luscious prose. Nothing seemed to happen, though there were platitudinous descriptions of the English countryside throughout. Or at least &quot;an&quot; English countryside, similar to that described in John Major's hapless &quot;Back to Basics&quot;.Obviously I wasn't alone. On page 226 Lucilla remarks to her son, Hilary (yes, Hilary) that, &quot;this has been an eventful day&quot;. &quot;Has it?&quot;, replies Hilary,&quot;I hadn't noticed anything particular about it&quot;. Nor had I. Perhaps I'd missed out on the &quot;spirituality&quot; referred to by another reviewer. If Hilary had too, that was unfortunate, because he is a clergyman.This is an uneventful descrition of the life enjoyed by 0.1 % of the English population fifty years ago. I presume they enjoyed it, but that did not apply to a boy who had been killed in a car accident (this is incidental, not part of the plot - there isn't one). It is mentioned in passing that he will never enjoy the pleasures of having a motorbike, &quot;playing rugger&quot; or standing knee deep watching the waves come in. No, nor playing/watching soccer, going to the movies and buying fish and chips afterwards. But I imagine Ms. Goudge &quot;wouldn't know&quot; about that sort of thing.This was the first Elizabeth Goudge book I have read. It will also be the last. It was both pretty and awful."},{"Title":"The Exotics","review":"This paperback, for those who don't know, reprints ( in color ) &quot;Pharagonesia&quot;, &quot;The Horny Goof&quot; &amp; some other sci-fi short stories by the famed french &quot;comic book&quot; artist, Jean &quot;Moebius&quot; Giraud. If you want to know the works of an aknowleged master and learn about an important chapter of the history in comics, this book is a must. The only mistake made on this paperback is that it's small-sized; the panels would look much better printed on their original sizes."},{"Title":"The Exant Remains","review":"Let me say at the outset that Epicurus is hard to understand because we have only fragments of his work.Epicurus is important to people living in the third millenium because he realized, as most of us do, that traditional religion is not very believable.In his time the Hellenistic and Roman world was about to fall into a morass of Eastern religions, spiritualism, and superstition familiar to third millenium people living amid Tibetan and Zen Buddhism, Wicca, and New Age.Epicurus has two huge virtues that make him worth reading even now.He is ferociously smart for one. Some of his insights about physical phenomena millenia before the invention of real scientific instruments are astonishing.The other is that he is unrelentingly honest and rigorous. His premise is that we only know what we can find out from our senses and our reason. This is immensely liberating from all the causistry, tradition, authority, and sentiment of both culture and counter-culture.To the ultimate rationalization for religion, &quot;Well, it is a comfort for the simple.&quot; he responds, &quot;Truth and honesty are better than comfort.&quot; He dismissed death as nothing, and proved his point by showing legendary courage in facing his own."},{"Title":"Advanced Semiconductor Fundamentals (2nd Edition)","review":"This is an excellent treatise on the theory of semiconductors which is essential in learning solid-state devices like basic pn junctions and MOS devices.

However all the books of this 'Purdue' series is excellent - they are concise, clear and advanced."},{"Title":"Advanced Semiconductor Fundamentals (2nd Edition)","review":"On a quick scan at first the material covered in this book appears intimidating.

The authors \\"hand in glove\\" approach effectively matches Dr. Laura's wit and her ability to quickly understand the \\"real\\" problem of the caller with his insightful humor and knowledge of God's word. The tone of the book looks at the the principles in both the Old and the New Testaments of the Bible as the answer to troubling changes taking place in society that are eroding the family, the basic unit in developing strong moral character. The authors ability to select the richest nuggets from the countless hours of programing he reviewed gives one a genuine appreciation of the ability of the \\"Dr.\\" to enable people see themselves and to understand their problems. His knowledge of God's word and his experience in helping people apply it to their lives supports and enhances Dr. Laura's efforts.

It gets down to the subject quickly and leads the reader through a development sequence that includes examples that are practical and that I could put to work the next day.

All I want in a book, is someone to TEACH me through step by step explanations and well thought out sample exersizes.

In a desperate attempt to return the soldiers to England, so that the British army could regroup, Winston Churchill called upon the owners of any kind of seacraft, over 30 feet long, to travel in a convoy to the sea port of Dunkirk in France, to help pick up the men stranded on the beach and to ferry them to waiting naval ships for their return to England. The naval vessels were too big to get in close enpugh to the shore, so smaller craft with a shallow draw were essential. Boating people from all over the land volunteered their vessels and the most amazing armada since the days of Drake, was formed and was either towed by bigger boats or went under their own steam. This is the simply, but effectively told story of three separate families who took part in this valiant operation. For days on end, these tiny boats plied backwards and forwards, ferrying the soldiers, with themselves being under constant strafing and bombing attacks from the Luftwaffe. It's a story of the great courage shown by ordinary people when driven to the edge by the unspeakable horrors of war."},{"Title":"Three Little Ships","review":"\\"Three Little Ships\\" has to be the best book by Lilian Harry so far.

The University of Nebraska Press reprinted Frederick Manfred's novel in 1982. It is also available in various paperback editions.Although Manfred's account largely adheres to the actual historical event, he changed the names of the key characters. For example, Manfred's Cain Hammet replaces the actual Nate Champion that organized the small ranchers' Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Grower's Association (NWFSGA) to compete with the cattle barons' powerful Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA).The title of each chapter is a character - Cain, Dale, Harry, Rosemary (Rory), Hunt, Jesse, Mitch, and others. This structure allows the author to focus on characterization as well as on the action (confrontations, hangings, and ambushes). Manfred's shifting perspectives occasionally reveal deep misunderstandings and false assumptions made by both parties, although his account is largely sympathetic to the plight of the small ranchers.Cain Hammet is a reluctant protagonist. Link Keeler, the murderer of Cain's grandpa some years ago, has recently returned to Johnson County (under the name Hunt Larson) as a deputized inspector of cattle charged with eliminating rustling. Unable to goad Hunt into a gun fight, Cain lets his hated adversary walk away. While admittedly killing a peace officer would be foolhardy, Cain's inaction ultimately makes matters worse.Frederick Manfred's Riders of Judgment was the basis for the 2002 TV movie The Johnson County War.Caution: In 2001 another respected Western author, Ralph Compton, published a novel with the same title, Riders of Judgment, that is also based on the Johnson County range war. I have not read Compton's western; the reader reviews rank it highly."},{"Title":"Riders of Judgment","review":"The book takes quite a wile to get going and then never really does. The synopsis for the book itself is also incorrect. Cain, the main character, isn't exciting or interesting in the least. A vengful killer does off some of his family members but he does nothing.

Of course, this is a MUST READ for anyone discerning a call to the priesthood and probably anyone who is a priest. It seems there is a lot of bad training of priests these days, and the author makes solid cases and arguments for why certain things should be the way they are."},{"Title":"The Priest in Union with Christ","review":"The Priest In Union With ChristThis book discusses the priesthood going back to the Old Testament and how the Levital priesthood was a precursor to the New Testament priest, so it is very Biblical in that way. However, there is also much of a culture point of view verses a scriptural point of view. For example, some pagan ideas about purgatory mold and shape a priesthood of works by the priest, including suffering, etc. instead of depending on the redemptive, substitutionary work of Christ. The culture overrides the gospel. There is a theoretical concept of the priest being Mary's son, because Jesus which is just a cultural idea. To maintain celibacy, priests identified themselves that way. Much of the perspective of the book is based on human reasoning, instead of Jesus Christ.If one studies the ministry gifts in 1 Cor. 12 and other places, one can discern the wonderful work of Christ through the priesthood.There are discussions of proper and improper dispositions of the priest when celebrating the mass, the proper form of a homily, how to be a good confessor, and how to give spiritual direction, it covers the gamut very well, but with the good, there is also the discomfort of the unscriptural teatment of purgatory and how that is applied to the priest. It contains the Dogmatic Teaching of the Church on the mass. The discussion of purgatory is unscriptural and has since the writing of the book been revised.Here is an excerpt from the book:\\"Confessor is not intended merely to rid the penitent of his vices but also to conduct him along the way of perfection and to help him grow in virtue. Such has been the constant teaching of the Saints: for instance, St. Alphonsus:\\"One perfect soul is more acceptable in God's sight than a thousand imperfect ones. So when a confessor finds a soul whose life is free from serious faults, he should take all possible care to lead such a soul into the way of perfection and of divine love. Let him bring home to that soul how deserving God is of all our love and the gratitude we owe to Jesus Christ, who has loved us to the extent of laying down His life on our behalf. He should also point out the danger to which a soul exposes itself by resisting a special call from God to a more perfect way of life.\\"Therefore, spiritual direction is one of the normal means of progress in virtue and of arriving at intimate union with God.\\"\\"St Francis de Sales says that a good director \\"must be full of charity, of knowledge and prudence; if one of these three qualities be wanting in him, there is danger. Knowledge is required of the spiritual life and of the means which lead to union with God: prudence is essential for the practice application of principles to the individual being directed: fervent charity is required so that the director inclines his will toward God and not toward himself, leading souls to God and not to himself. This spirit of sincere and fervent charity is opposed to sentimentality which is merely a pretence of love existing in the emotions and hardly at all in the will.\\""},{"Title":"Yellow butterflies","review":"Yellow Butterflies is a wonderful old book.And, it honors our soldiers!!

This biography, written by Einhard, who was a friend of the most famous monarch from the Dark Age, sheds some much-needed light into the political and military history of the period. Written soon after the death of Charlemagne in 814, Einhard tells us of his rise to power, his military campaigns, his dealings with the scheming Byzantines, his coronation as Holy Roman Emperor, and his unruly daughters. Throughout the narrative, Einhard strives to portray his King and friend in the best possible light. I highly recommend this book to any student of Medieval history, as well as to those who might have an interest in European monarchy. It is informative, easy-reading, and a great primary source for those who study the history of the period."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"Charlemagne's reign was a brief flash of light in the dark centuries that followed the collapse of the Roman empire. As king of the Franks, Charlemagne unified much of Western Europe - what today is northeastern Spain, all of France, and parts of Germany and Italy. He revived education and learning, repaired existing churches and built new ones, and helped strengthen the position of the Pope in Rome. In the year 800 Charlemagne was crowned Emperor Augustus, ruler of the new Roman empire.This new empire was short lived, but Charlemagne became legend. Einhard, a scholar in Charlemagne's court and author of this short biography, was faced with a difficult question: how does one write a balanced and honest biography of a revered king, a king that had become legendary in his own time?Einhard had few examples to follow. The religious biographies of saints were not entirely appropriate. He turned to a classical source, The Lives of the Caesars by the Roman historian Seutonius. Einhard devotes about half of his work to Charlemagne's extensive military campaigns, but his focus remains on Charlemagne the leader and Charlemagne the man, not on military tactics and strategy.The modern reader will find it helpful to read between the lines. Einhard obviously admired Charlemagne, and his criticisms are muted. Also, Einhard's writing reflects a world view very different from today.For example, Einhard in discussing the continual uprising of the Saxons says: he never allowed their faithless behavior to go unpunished, but either took the field against them in person, or sent his counts with an army to wreak vengeance and exact righteous satisfaction.Wreak vengeance? Exact righteous satisfaction? The editor's footnote explains that at the time of a revolt in 782 Charlemagne had 4,500 Saxons beheaded in one day at Verden. Similarly, after a formidable conspiracy in Germany was put down, \\"all the traitors were banished, some of them without mutilation, others after their eyes had been put out\\".Einhard provides many details of Charlemagne's character and private life. Charlemagne enjoyed the exhalations from natural hot springs. He often practiced swimming; few could surpass him in this sport. Einhard carefully describes the clothing worn by Charlemagne. He apparently disliked foreign costumes, and was most comfortable in the common dress of the Frankish people.He was temperate in eating, and especially drinking. He was particularly fond of roast meat prepared on a spit and disregarded medical advice to eat only boiled meat. He could speak Latin fluently. St. Augustine's The City of God was among his favorite books. He never developed proficiency at writing, although he practiced regularly during his later years.Einhard's biography was immensely popular and more than eighty manuscripts still exist today.My copy of The Life of Charlemagne was published by Ann Arbor Paperbacks, University of Michigan Press. The foreword by historian Sidney Painter was quite helpful in establishing the historical context. My copy includes a ninth century map of Europe, footnotes, and a genealogical table for the family of Charlemagne and Hildegard."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"Einhard's depiction of Charlemagne is one portraying his private and public life. For those of you thinking that this book was only written so that Einhard could honor Charlemagne, please look again. At first glimse this book does seem to be a superficial accounting of the life and times of Charlemagne, however, it is only after you begin to peel back the layers that the truth comes out. Einhard's depiction of charlemagne humanizes the great ruler by balancing the brutal warrior persona with his private, loving father and friend, persona. It is important to note that Einhard's book would have been read before the court, so it was imperative that the content be pleasing to those in attendance. With that in mind as well as the fact that Einhard revered Charlemagne, he manages to shed light onto Charlemagne's character and it's not always flattering. This is a biography or hagiography of Charlemagne's character. Einhard depicts a man, Charlemagne, motivated by human desires, not unlike any one of us. He was guilty of wrath, lust, gluttony, and greed and gave the church huge sums of money to be exonerated from his sins. This book shows that Charlemagne loved the institution of the church,not necessarily the church itself, because it brought him wealth and power. Charlemagne wanted to unify the cultures around him, but only after he conquered the peoples and re-settled them away from their homeland did he accept them. He smoothed the edges. He only wanted cultures that had been 'watered down'. People didn't want to be near Charlemagne, he was militaristic, oppressive, and aggressive. In fact to quote from the book &quot;Have the Frank for your friend, but not for your neighbor&quot; (43). Einhard exposes many of Charlemagne's flaws in this work, so read it with a critical eye."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"With all respect to Robert Jarvis, I must say that his review is off. Charlemagne died in the year 814, and Einhard knew the great emperor personally. Einhard's biography was written in the decade following Charlemagne's death, so readers must be aware of the style and purposes ninth-century writers had when they approached their works. Einhard's work is brief indeed, as it omits details such as one will find in Roger Collins's fine work, _Charlemagne_ (U of Toronto Press, 1998), but giving the minutiae of the emperor's life was not Einhard's purpose. Instead, basing his work on that of the Roman Suetonius, who wrote lives of Roman emperors, Einhard tried to convey what kind of man and ruler Charlemagne was. We learn here what kind of father he was--that information is not found in any other primary source. We know that Charlemagne initiated a kingdom-wide reform of education, but only Einhard tells us that the king himself was familiar with Latin and struggled late in life to learn to write. Readers who want to find the &quot;In this year, this happened...&quot; type of 'facts' in writings from the period of Charlemagne's lifetime, I suggest tracking down P.D.

Although presenting an idealized version of events, the historical accuracy of most of the book's details have been largely confirmed by modern historians. The book's modern index reaffirms this conclusion by documenting less than ten minor factual errors.The biography was obviously written to honor Einhard's former patron, but the deeds and exploits chronicled in Einhard's book are nevertheless plausibly presented in a idealized manner reminiscent of patriotic middle school textbook renderings of George Washington or Theodore Roosevelt. The book's format is continuous, breaking only at the end of a four-page preface before continuing on with an unbroken string of pages which are presented without the benefit of chapter divisions. The style of Einhard's writing tends to be wooden and Spartan - the biography tells the reader of Charlemagne's accomplishments but makes scant mention of the difficulties he faced - and any criticism of Charlemagne is obviously muted by the author's attempt to balance the idealized expectations of his partisan audience with the Roman ideal of factual honesty.Einhard's biography starts with a concise outline of Charlemagne's lineage, beginning with a brief mention of his great-grandfather Pepin of Heristal, followed by three pages summarizing the exploits of grandfather Charles Martel and father Pepin the Short. Due to an admitted lack of source material, Einhard skips Charlemagne's childhood and proceeds directly to his first military undertaking; the Aqauitanian war begun by Pepin the Short. The rest of the book's sixty seven pages are essentially divided into two parts: the first half concisely presenting a chronological, episodic narration of Charlemagne's military campaigns (confining the focus to Charlemagne's motives and decisions while largely ignoring his tactics and strategy), before backtracking to conclude with a twenty seven page glimpse of the monarch's personal and family life.The author's purpose in writing the book, plainly stated by him in the book's preface, reveal an unmistakable admiration which borders on hero worship. Descriptive phrases like \\"most excellent,\\" \\"justly renowned,\\" and \\"a very great and distinguished man\\" clearly display Einhard's to write the book as tribute to the greatest man of his age. In this he succeeds; although the book's superficial and miserly accounting of its subject's exploits leave the reader hungry for more details.The book effectively chronicles the subject's glorious life and accomplishments from the point of view of a member of his court. Simultaneously, Einhard manages to shine some much-needed light onto Charlemagne's moral stature and political machinations, in addition to providing the reader with a general military history of the period."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"This chronicle was commissioned at the request of Louis the Pious one of Charlemagne's successors, was written by Einhard, a monk, historian, and a dedicated servant of Charlemagne. His Life of Charlemagne, written between 817-830 is clearly in the vein of the famous Roman historian Suetonius' The Twelve Caesars (a text that existed at the monastery where the author worked). The work is brief, to the point, and for the most part does not include tangential information, and is biased. The bias is completely understandable and the introduction to the text points out where and why. His chronicle was written to make Louis the Pious' famous father look good. For example, one of the morally stained aspects of the Charlemagne's reign were the actions of his unmoral daughters, which Einhard carefully does not tell us about. Einhard, in short, sometimes deliberately obscures the truth. However, what is so appealing about Einhard's text is the fact that his most of his information was based off of 26 years as a servant of Charlemagne and his court, and information that he includes of actions before Charlemagne's reign most likely was gathered from sources and documents which he had access to. Lastly, Einhard's attempt at stringently following the model of Suetonius Twelve Caesars makes him connect the characteristics of great emperors such as Augustus to Charlemagne, obscuring Charlemagne's actual habits, personality etc...The introduction is ok but is mostly summary, the map is good, but the notes are scanty. A MUCH better addition would be the Penguin Classics text, Two Lives of Charlemagne, that also includes the equally interesting (although vastly different) De Carlo Magno written 70 years after Charlemagne's death."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"A nice edition of a brief near contemporary biography of Charlemagne. The author, the monk Einhard, spent decades attached to Charlemagne's court. This is, not surprisingly, a very positive account of Charlemagne, stressing his considerable achievements in extending his rule over much of Europe and his support of the Church. The introduction is by the great medievalist Sidney Painter, who indicates that Einhard based his account on Suetonius' Lives of the Caesars. Einhard's biography is notable also for what it leaves out, such as the many brutal aspects of Charlemagne's campaigns."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"King Charles the Great, more commonly known as Charlemagne, was the first truly great leader of France. His reign was one of great expansion as he created a French nation that controlled nearly all of Western Europe. Charlemagne was a great military commander and one who appreciated learning, he did a great deal to promote the relearning of so much that was lost with the fall of the Roman Empire.Einhard was one of the learned people that Charlemagne sponsored, and so in this book Einhard quite naturally praises the great king. Yet, it is historically accurate and written in 830 CE, it is contemporary to the life of the great king. Einhard's direct observation of the life of Charlemagne is a historical classic, one that should be read by all students of what we now call the Dark Ages. For Charlemagne was a rare glimmer of light during those times of meager learning and education."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"I enjoyed reading this account of Charlemagne written by a contemporary of Charlemagne. What makes this book interesting is being able to see Charlemagne through the eyes of Einhard. Yes, I know Einhard was a friend of Charlemagne and might have influenced his account but all in all, still a valuable work into the life of one of the most important men of his era. Plus I am a fan of Medieval History and find it fascinating to be able to read something like this over a thousand years later. A great easy read that is informative and insightful into this period."},{"Title":"The life of Charlemagne (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","review":"I read the book through in one sitting. It was, actually, not particularly well written, as though the writer were not overly familiar with and skilled in his craft.

From that increase in my knowledge, I give it a 3-star rating.

I would also not be able to say what made me want this book, buy it, and read it much less review it. I wouldn't even know who to recommend it to, because why this book appeals to me is a mystery, but it definitely appeals to me. I enjoyed reading Eginhard's work, it went very fast at 31 pages, but there is a considerable amount of information for such a slim book. Eginhard tells of the history of Charlemagne as he knew it, and he also attempted to tell us something of the man that Charlemagne was.

Performance.2. Self-Confidence.3. Mental Energy.4. Setting Goals.5. The Power of the Mind.6. The Good Team.7. Mental Training.It is interesting to read stories from Sven and Willi, that these \\"super-sportsmen\\" also go through performance anxiety, fear of failing, lack of confidence much like what we all go through.I realized that we are no different from Beckham, Ronaldo, Bjorn Borg except that we specialize in different fields of endeavour.Managers should read this book and apply them in the corporate world and realize that people are still people.If multi-million dollar paid players also are susceptible such mental blocks, are we to expect more from workers and executives?Motivation is every persons responsibility as well as his manager.

However, with the inside help of two other slaves, a squirrel named Felldoh and a young mouse named Brome, and with outside help from Brome's sister Rose and her friend Grumm the mole, Martin escapes.

The immediate sequel Mattimeo tells how Matthias had to go in search of his son Mattimeo who had been captured by Slagar the Fox. The immediate \\"prequel\\" to Redwall, Mossflower, tells how Martin the Warrior originally came to Mossflower Woods, helped to defeat Tsarmina the Cat, and founded Redwall Abbey. This further \\"prequel\\" then tells about the beginnings of Martin the Warrior. We have also read Lord Brocktree and Rakkety Tam.Martin the Warrior is typical \\"Redwall.\\" It is exciting. In fact, I think that it is one of the best that I have read so far. There is a strong theme of good versus evil. Yet there is also the warning against seeking personal revenge. I found no bad language and, for that matter, nothing else which I consider objectionable. Yes, there is some sadness along the way, but in the end good triumphs over evil. And yes, there is fighting, but in the last analysis it reminds that there are some things worth fighting for. Redwall, Mattimeo, and Martin the Warrior have all been made into an animated cartoon series.

Jacques is a master of painting the story in your mind and at writing poetry and riddles. As a fantasy writer myself, I often find this difficult.Another thing I enjoy about this book is that in a way it is almost a romance.

Whlie Martin is a slave he meets many and also meets some people on the \\"outside\\" that eventually help him, and become focal characters in the story.As already stated, I really enjoy the great detail that is typical of all the Brian Jacques books. I can picture all the characters and places with vivid detail. Also, you get to know several character wuite well, not just a few. Alos there is a main plot, but it definitely has several curveballs thrown into it. However, the additions don't drag on, they actually add much more interest, wnating to know what happens, and basically it doesn't feel quite as much like a \\"Disney movie\\" it's not ridiculously predictable.My main dislike of the book was that it was very hard to keep everything straight and remember which character was which. At points in the story there are three or four separate groups going independently. Since it can't be written all together, it's also quite hard to keep a mental time line. Also there were tons of character, for a moderately short book. All of the characters had abnormal names making it even harder to keep track of who was who.Overall though I would recommend this to late elementary to early middle school. So if you're looking for an adventorous story, or are a fan of Brian Jacques, this is a great book to pick up."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I have read this book six times, and found it to be my favorite Redwall book. It tells the story of Martin beore he was a legend, before he was the spirit of the abbey.Badrang was Lord and Tyrant of the Eastern Coasts. One of his slaves was Martin. Martin defied Badrang and was tied up on the roof of Fortress Marshank. During the storm at night, Rose and Grumm see Martin up on the roof. They are a mouse and mole from Noonvale to find Rose's brother Brome who is somewhere inside the fortress. In the morning, Rose and Grumm use slingstones to drive away the hungry seabirds intent on eating Martin.Martin did not die like he was supposed to so Badrang puts hin in the prison pit where Felldoh and Brome are. They escape and get split up while at sea for a while. Brome and Felldoh wash up near Marshank and Rose, Martin and Grumm end up by the Pygmy shrews' caves. There they meet Pallum. Pallum, Rose, Grumm and Martin go on a quest to Noonvale, Rose's home, for an army to rid the land of Badrang. Brome and Felldoh stay with the Rambling Rosehip players.The ending is the tragic battle of Marshank. Read the book to see if Martin wins!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"First of all...

The main characters were animals and they all could talk and had human characteristics, the author did a very good job of this. It included battles and adventures, thrills and excitement. It wasn't too gruesome and didn't explain in detail how the battles ended. Brian Jacques did a very good job in describing the battles, the adventures and the conflicts along the way."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior is a sad book kind of. Martin's father leaves him with his grand mother one day before Martin is 6 months old. About 4 seasons later Martin and his grandmother are caught by Badrang the Tyrant and made slaves. Martin's grandmother dies about 2 seasons in. The book was about how Martin escaped, created an army,and destroyed Badrang and his army. My favorite character was Martin because he was brave and never gave up. Martin the Warrior is a great book and I think you should read it."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The story Martin the Warrior by Brian Jacques is an enchanting story of the love of freedom and a great hatred between two animals. The slaves of Badrang, an evil corsair stoat, are forced to build Badrang's fort Marshank. The medley of creatures stick together through thick and thin. One slave, whose name is Martin, suffers horribly as the slaves finish a war against Badrang although, Badrang probably suffers more.My favorite character is Rose, whose character is caring and loving. Rose is a bitter contrast to Badrang who is soaked in evil and merciless. I believe that if you try hard enough you will get what you want unless it is selfish. That is the theme of this book. My favorite part is when Rose sings some bees off her traveling companions, a mouse and a mole. On the other hand, my least favorite part is when a young squirrel named Felladoh gets killed. The ending finished as a story incomplete in my own way, I like the stories to end satisfactorily, but in this one, it didn't.Although I thought it was unsatisfactory, I like the way Brian words his paragraphs. He keeps one's interest in the book like a fish on a hook. Brian Jacques gives just enough description, for example: \\"Dust rose in a golden shower of motes in the sun light filled room.\\" Though there is a lot of description, the only hard things to \\"unnerstan\\" is the dialect. The vocabulary isn't too hard either. I like the way that Martin the Warrior is written because you can see it in your mind's eye. Though this is a good book, the war-like actions would raise the age group to nine and up."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The book starts off in Badrang's fortress where Martin is a slave.

The only thing the woodlanders fear more than Marshank is it's owner Badrang, the tyrant. They fear Badrang because he takes woodlanders from their homes and make them his slaves. The slaves very from mice to otters to hedgehogs.One of the slaves is Martin (a mouse), who is left on a beach by his father when he was little. his only possession was a sword his father gave him when he was just a child. then his father made Martin promise that he wouldn't let any one steal or touch the sword. Then Badrang found him, he stole Martin's sword and made Martin one of his slaves. Now years later while all of the other slaves want to escape, Martin's only concern is to get his sword back.I like Brian Jacques's unique way of switching from Martin escaping to the slaves forming an attack on Badrang.I like this book because it is very exiting and interesting.

I've said that in my review in \\"Redwall\\", but I hadn't read \\"Martin the Warrior\\" at that time. This book has everything a book needs: action, humor, riddles, and more! This book is a must-read! The story goes like this:Martin the Warrior was a young mouse taken captive when he was just a child. His father's sword was taken from him from the evil stoat named Badrang the Tyrant. He was made a slave with many other peaceful creatures who were captured, in a dreadful castle named Marshank. When he is tied to a post on the top of Marshank to be killed, he sees that 2 creatures were living outside Marshank, a mousemaid called Rose and a mole named Grumm. They were searching for a young mouse named Brome who is Rose's younger brother and Grumm's friend. They discovered that Brome was a slave in Marshank and was trying to figure out how to rescue him. They save Martin from being killed, but Martin was partly saved by the appearance of a sea-faring stoat named Captain Clogg. Badrang and Clogg were enemies. So, Badrang had let Martin down from getting killed and concentrated on the task ahead. Martin, Brome, and another brave and rebelling squirrel name Felldoh(He is my favorite character in this book) escapes with the help of Grumm and Rose.Meanwhile, the pitiful band of slaves in Marshank had formed a plan. They knew that Martin would be back with an army and would save them. They knew that Martin would be back to retrieve his father's sword. So, they decide to be prepared. Stealing food and stealing weapons, they get ready for a rescue.Martin, Brome, Felldoh, Rose, and Grumm are separated at the sea. Martin, Rose, and Grumm, seeing that there was no point in waiting for the others since they didn't know where they were, set out to Noonvale where Rose's home was. There, Martin plans to raise an army and attack Marshank. They are captured by pigmy shrews but are freed when Martin saves the queen of the Squidjees's son.(Squidjees is the name they call themselves) The band of friends don't know where Noonvale is, but gets \\"help\\" from an old molemaid named Polleekin. Polleekin give them a rather hard riddle and they gradually solves it and reaches Noonvale safely.Meanwhile, Felldoh and Brome meets a band of travelers: a hare named Ballaw, a squirrel named Celadine, a badger named Rowanoek, and a few otters and moles. They were preformers. Felldoh boldly proposes to secretly free the slaves only with the band of travelers, Brome, and himself. The Rambling Rosehip Players(the name of the band of traveling creatures) preform a decoy play for the evil animals of Marshank while Felldoh and Brome freed the slaves. Only half of the slaves got out, the other half were recaptured.Martin the Warrior and his friends had not been able to raise an army in the peaceful Noonvale. Boldred, an owl they had made friends with, began to search the land to raise a horde.Brome had planned to free the other half by himself. He dressed himself up like a rat and entered the slave place. Telling the other evil creatures of Marshank that he was bringing them to Badrang, he led them to the secret tunnel he and his friends had used to escape. The slaves were freed, but the Rambling Rosehip Players, Felldoh, Brome, and the freed slaves were now in great trouble. Now the vermin were mad. They charged them and began to attack.What will happen to the Rambling Rosehip Players and the others? When will Martin and his friends arrive with his army?This book was just so great!

I felt like I knew the characters and was sad when the book ended. Thank goodness there are plenty more books about the loving creatures of Redwall Abbey and Mossflower Woods! This is a must read!!!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Its all about Martin the straightup Warrior. The book is sick yo, go buy it yo!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior is my favorite book by Brian Jacques. I have read all of his books and this one is the best. Matin's fighting spirit is amazing. I love when Martin gets his sword back from Badrang, It's great. Well I don't want to say to much more because I would't want to ruin the story for you."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior by Jacques tells of a young mouse who survives through unamaginable odds and becomes a hero. Yes Jacques again takes us to the magical world of animals. This extension of the Redwall series answers the unknow questions of the hero of Mossflower Woods. Those who have read Mossflower, the story of how Martin entered Mossflower Woods and saved it from the evil cat queen, must read this novel to answer their questions. This novel will also helpo those who read the original, Redwall, and thought what the life of the great hero was like. Many of the events and characters will shock those who read Mossflower because much of what you know about Marin is FALSE!!!!!!!!!! However, because I don't wish to reveal the book to any potential readers, that is all that will be said about that. If you have never read a novel by Jacques, this would be a great place to start, at the true begging of the story line, befoe the Abby and before Martin was a true Warrior. Even if the begging makes you fell lost, Jacques will pull you into his world and make you fell at home."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior, the prequel to Redwall was kind of disapointing in a way. There was something missing in this book. If you are a rabid redwall fan, like me, then you would know. Don't start on this one. Try Redwall first."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"(Actually, 12"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Out of all the books in the 'Redwall' series, Martin the Warrior is the best! The detailed accounts of the travelers, the fun Rambling Rosehip Players, and the little pigmy shrews, I loved them all! And the part where Laterose was suddenly and unexpectedly removed, wow."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"These books are so amazingly described it's astonishing. This tale is one of the best. Martin the Warrior and his friends set out to free the land of Bandrag and his horde. With the help of otters and shrews, plus many more they accomplish this unforgettable task. But the friends incounter much heartache along the way! This is a definite must read for everybody who has even read one of these great books!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"If I could I'd give this book a 6 because it was so compelling that I read the whole book in about a week! It usually takes me about 2 months to read a book that size. Anyway I liked this book because of the well planned battles and ambushes!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book is about Matin the founder of Redwall. He is a slave in Badrangs grasp but escapes to find himself on an extrordinary journey where he has to follow clues to find his destination.

I strongly reccomend it for anyone who likes the other Redwall books, but keep the tissues handy!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I think this is the best Redwall book yet! The characters are so well discribed, that you can almost see them. Even though the book is so detailed, the story is easy to follow. The book also fills the missing chapter in most of the books about Martin's life before he came to Mossflower. Martin, Rose, and all their friends are so well discribed that you can't forget for one minute that the are mice, but they also seem so HUMAN at the same time! The story is a little deeper and get's more in to life's problem's than the other books, but is just as loveable as the other Redwall books. A real work of art!!!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"It is truly the beginning of many epic novels that I hope will cotinue for a long time."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book is wonderful but at the end i was crying for the ending was sad."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT. definately one of the best ive ever read.

IF YOU ONLY GET ONE BOOK IN YOUR LIFE MAKE IT THIS ONE!!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"A classic tale of good versus evil. This is the story of how Martin the Warrior rose from humble beginnings as a slave mouse to become the champion of Redwall. This book has an action packed story line. The friends, despite being forest creatures, are larger than life. They include the mousemaid Rose, the vengeful Felldoh, and even a traveling troop of comics. They and others are pitted against Badrang, former sea rat captain, now Tyrant of Marshank.Although this is the sixth book in the series, it can be read first because the books were written out of sequence and this is the prequal to the other stories. Mossflower is the next book in the sequence.I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys fantasy or children's literature. The only reason this gets four stars is because Jacques spends an inordinate amount of time writing about food or supper-time."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"A well-written adventure about a young mouse named Martin who was captured by an evil horde that was led by Bedrang the Stoat. Bedrang was an evil stoat who wanted to create and rule his own empire by capturing and enslaving small woodland animals.Martin's father, Luke, went away to sea to fight sea rats and left behind his magnificent sword. One day while Martin and his Grandmother are talking on the shoreline a long way from their tribe's caves, a band of villainous-looking creatures attack them. Bedrang takes Luke's sword away from Martin, shackles him to his Grandmother, and then to the rest of the slave line. Next came the long march - it lasted two seasons. All Martin can think of during the whole time he is a slave is planning how to get his father's sword back and how to get himself and the others free of Bedrang and his horde.This is a story of a great adventure from beginning to end, except for a little bit in the middle when they were on the Otter's raft and the story seemed to go a little slow. I couldn't put it down until I finished reading the whole thing.I would recommend anyone my age and even adults (like teachers) would enjoy this book. I have read many of the Redwall books and would recommend all of them to everyone - kids and adults. These books teach about honesty, making and keeping friends, and how good always triumphs over evil even if it takes a little while.The other Redwall books that I have read include: Redwall, Mattimeo, Salamandastron, The Bellmaker, The Outcast of Redwall, The Long Patrol, and Marlfox."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book is good and worth the buy. Even though it is a lot of money it still is a good buy. You can listen to the book wherever you go. This book is one of my favorite books and should be shared with a a lot of people."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"MARTIN THE WARRIOR Martin asked his father if he could join him on his quest. LUKE told Martin that he needed to protect the caves. Martin was about to cry when Luke gave him his sword. One day, when Martin was walking on the beach, the evil tyrant BADRANG enslaved him. I don't want to spoil the ending for you but I have read six Redwall books - only one book, MOSSFLOWER, was as good as this book: MARTIN THE WARRIOR."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior descibes one of the best works of fictional writing in the 20th century. Brian Jacques goes out of the way again to please the many who enjoy his books. His thoughts travel to another world using mice, rats, and squirrels to bring &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot; to life. Martin, a slave in Badrang's civilzation, carries his fellow family and friends though slavery and into freedom. Reading this book brought me into the world of fiction and excitment. A must buy book. Also known as the National Bestseller!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book is about a brave-hearted mouse who is destined to get back his father Luke the warrior's sword stolen by the evil creature Badrang. Badrang is the keeper of slaves(also other animals) and is determined to be king of all. Martin and his friends go on many breath taking and scary adventures, while trying to bring freedom to all animals. This is a great book!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This has to be my favorite Redwall book and I've read them all. The characters and setting are described so you can almost picture them standing next to you. Feelings and emotions are written out in such a way that I laughed with the Traveling Noonvale Troupe, got infuriated at Badrang and cried at the end. If you have never read this book, find it and do. It's a bally ole' tale doncha' know."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I loved this book. Everyone should read it. It is gripping the way the animals in this book journey thorugh many dangerous places all for the sake of freedom and their friends. In the end I felt terribly sad at the end because it was over even though I couldn't put the book down when I was reading it. Like I said before everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Read this book, and you'll feel light-headed too. When I started it, I was already an avid fan of the Redwall series...but this one sent me into a swoon. I do not exaggerate when I say that I've read it at least twenty times - in airports, cars, dentists' waiting rooms, while babysitting, eating, pretending to be asleep...you name it. I am very much in love with this book, and it's lasted three years now...what more shall I say?"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book is the best (in my opinion) that I have ever read! It made me laugh, cry, and I sat on the edge of my seat during the battles! When I first started reading it (about sometime during October) I thought it would be stupid. A friend let me borrow it, and strongly recommended it. It took me about a month to get at least 20 pages into the book. Then in two days I finished the rest. I stayed up until even past 2:00 A.M. reading about the battle, and adventure! I strongly recommend this book, but once you get around the last three chapters, get out some tissues! It's really sad- but I won't reveal anything to those of you who haven't read! It is about a young mouse named Martin, who is a slave at Marshank, captured by the evil tyrant Badrang. He sets out with his friends Laterose the mousemaid of Noonvale, and Grumm the mole. They travel to Noonvale (Rose's home) to raise an army. From there Martin's quest continues to get an army and put an end to Badrang, and recover his father's (Luke the Warrior) sword. This book is the absolute BEST of the Redwall series, and in all other books (in my opinion) it has no equal. I STRONGLY recommend reading this tale of adventure, battle, love, and hope that will make you both laugh, and cry. DEFINITELY a must read!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I personally thought that this was the best book in the redwall series. It gives you alot of background information about the most famous mouse in redwall. It is one of the most breathtaking books I have ever read and I hope others find it as great a book as I did. It is a fast pace story that takes you back so you can see the world of many seasons ago through Martin's eyes. It starts out as a flashback like most books do. But then it tells a story like no other.It's a book you just can't put down. So I highly recommend Martin the Warrior."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"If Mossflower was Lord of the Rings, then this is surely Sparticus. In this story, our hero is imprisoned, and when he refuses to bend to the rule of the evil tyrant he is tortured and left to die as a meal for mouse-eating birds. But Martin escapes... and plans his REVENGE.I have read Redwall, Matimeo, Salamandastron, Mossflower, and Martin the Warrior so far, and my two favorites are Mossflower and Martin the Warrior. In this book we delve even deeper into the origins of the greatest hero of the Redwall series. We find out where he got his sword, who his first love was, and how he freed the slaves of his homeland and ultimately came to wander into the land of Mossflower all alone.This is a truly epic tale about true love, revenge, loyalty, and the lonely life a true warrior is destined to lead. Superbly written, action-packed, and ultimately deeply sad and heartfelt, this is a book that demands to be read and re-read.If you enjoyed other books in the series you owe it to yourself to give this one a read. If you liked Mossflower it's a definite must-buy."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This was a great book! It is the first book in the Redwall series that I have read and it has got one of the best plots. Jacques is a very vivid writer that describes the scenery and characters so well you have to pull yourself away from the book and come back to reality. I suggest that if you are even remotely interested in fantasy novels then you should really check this book out!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I have just finished this book about three or so days ago and I loved it! I have also read Redwall and loved it! I highly recommend that you read this book! If you are not a fan of Brian Jacques books you will be! The characters are richly described. Brian Jacques makes his characters overflow with life! The feasts that he describes will make you hunger as you read it! There is so much exciting things that go on that keep you on the edge of your seat with a tremendous urge to flip the page! Brian Jacques describes battles so vividly that you feel like you're an onlooker in the story. I highly recommend that you READ THIS BOOK! I am now reading Salamandastron and I think that it is even better than Martin the Warrior! My only complaint is that you can not rate this book as a ten star book!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book just blew me away! I have been a Redwall fan ever since I first got my hands on \\"The Pearls of Lutra\\", and I must say that this is my absolute favorite book of all time.Jacques has painted a beautiful picture with words. It is the tale of a creature who rose from slavery to battle the greatest power on the Eastern Sea. It is touching, inspiring, and poetically written.The characters are well developed, each with their virtues and faults. Martin is strong, fierce, and defiant, and Rose is beautiful, gentle, and brave. Felldoh is a true warrior, and Grumm is a loyal friend.I really did cry at the end of this book, I loved it so much. It is bittersweet and a wonderful adventure. I have re-read it time and again, because the themes of love, loss and freedom are so strong! I really do advise this book to anyone, any age."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book pulled me in completly. I read the first word and could'nt stop till I got to the end. It has the most beautiful descriptions of food. It has the most page turning suspense (not to mention chewed finger-nail pieces), the terrifying action (and people fainting), and a sad ending( along with soggy pages). A MUST!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The sixth Redwall novel, Martin the Warrior is the story of young Martin's imprisonment by, escape from, and war against the Badrang the Tyrant, ruler of Marshank. Martin is a young mouse, the son of Luke the Warrior. He is captured and enslaved by Badrang, and one night, after violent insurrection, tied up to suffer through a raging storm. It is then he meets Rose, a maiden mouse from the peaceful sanctuary of Noonvale whose brother Brome has also been captured by Badrang. Martin, Rose, and Brome arrange from an escape from Marshank, promising the other slaves that they will one day come back to free them all and to destroy Badrang and his fortress forever. With the help of a roving band of circus performers and a mass of willful slaves, and across a journey through the coastal lands, Brome and Martin each struggle to stay alive, build an army, and return to destroy Badrang. This is a throughly enjoyable installment of the Redwall series, Martin the Warrior provides anxiously-awaited background to Martin's character as he discovers and refines his fighting spirit, experiences peace in Noonvale, and forms a deep friendship with Rose. The book is exciting, the characters (particularly those of Martin, the warrior Felldoh, and the peaceful Brome) are realistic and inspiring, and the book tackles some of the ethical and personal problems of war and the warrior's life that the other Redwall books overlook. It is a great read, a logical lead up to later Redwall books and to the building of Redwall itself, and one of the better books in this series.Fans of Redwall will of course recognize Martin as the mouse that freed the woodlanders in Mossflower and passed on his sword in Redwall. The chance to read about Martin's life before coming to Mossflower should interest all fans of the series. The center of this book is Martin's coming of age as he changes from youth to an experienced warrior. He also sees his first glimpse of peace when he visits Noonvale with Rose, and it is that journey that will later inspire him to hang up his sword for good in Redwall. This prequel gives insight into Martin's character, his history, and what events created the freedom-loving, peace-desiring Warrior that plays such an important part in other books and remains at the heart of the entire Redwall series.Martin the Warrior does a spectacular job dealing with war, peace, and factors that drive an individual towards one or the other. Character like Martin, Brome, and Felldoh run a full gamit from peaceful healer to righteous fighter to vengeful warrior, and the book forthrightly deals with issues such as war, death, and peace. Many of the other Redwall books take issues such as these for granted, and no where else in the series are they explored in such depth. These topics give the book great meaning, encourage thought about morals and justice, and create complex and meaningful characters and storylines, especially in the case of Martin.Beyond these new aspects, the usual parts of a Redwall book are all present: unique and amusing character, good food, exciting journeys, evil enemies, large battles, cleverness, and a mixture of humor and fierce determination. Between two and three storylines run concurrently throughout the text, keeping the action moving along; Badrang and the secondary bad guy Clogg make for a challenging, ruthless enemy that the reader will love to hate. Above all, Martin is realistic, powerful character that is easy to love and to root for. Martin the Warrior is an enjoyable text to read and to reread, and one of the best of the Redwall novels. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior starts out when too travelers from Noonvale visit Redwall and tell their tale. The story they tell is that of Martin the Warrior!The story begins with Martin serving as a slave to build a fortress for the crazed, tyrant hopeful, stoat Badrang. When he sees an old squirrel being beaten, he decides that he has had enough. He grabs the taskmaster's whip and tries to strangle him with it. Unfortunantly, he is stopped and hung outside to be killed by the elements or the seabirds. During a storm that night, he cries out about his troubles and a mousemaid named Rose hears him. She says that she and her molefriend, Grumm, will try to help him. Martin survives the storm and Rose and Grumm manage to drive off the seabirds. Meanwhile, Badrang suddenly sees the ship 'Seascarab' on the cost and orders Martin thrown into the pit. The captain of the 'Seascarab' is none other than Tramun Clogg, Badrang's old 'business' partner. Inside the pit, Martin meats Felldoh, the old squirrel's son, and brome, Rose's brother. Together they manage to instruct Grumm on where to dig a tunnel to aid in their escape. They finally manage toescape while Badrang's hoard fights off Tramun Clogg's crew planning to meat in Noonvale. Unfortunantly, the boat they steal was sabotaged and they get seperated in the sea. Felldoh and Brome meat up with a traveling troupe and attempt to free the slaves in marshank. Meanwhile, Martin, Rose, and Grumm begin the perilous journey to Noonvale in which they make many new friends and create an army to free the slaves in Marshank.Martin the Warrior is one of, if not, the best Redwall book. The story is filled with adventure, excitement, humor, and tragedy. If you choose to buy the audio version, the cast is superb. Brian Jacques is the narrator and his son and friends along with several professional actors portray the characters.I would recomend this book to any one, fan of Redwall or not. In my opinion, this book would also be great as the first Redwall book you read because it's story is independant from the other books and they, sort of, depend on it."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I believe this was the first Redwall book I read, even though it isn't the first, as it is a prequal. I loved it, and went on to read all the others. It makes for a great history of Redwall to explain what happened before, but isn't just that. It is an incredible story plot, and I couldn't put it down. I'm sure that if you read the other Redwall books, but not this, you would like it even more."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This story is about a gallant young mouse and his friends stopping an evil tyrant soat. This is one of the best books I've ever read. Martin start as a slave, and grows stronger with each new friend he makes. Martin is a born reble and stands up to the tyrant soat, Bardang, constantly and gets punished sevearly for it. I recamend this book to readers of all ages. I also recomened the other books in the Redwall seiries by Brian Jacques."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Brian Jacques is deffinately amoung the best children's story tellers to ever live! ANd this work is most certainly his finest. Filled with heroic battles, wicked villains, a little romance, and good fun, this book is a safe and the perfect choice for children.The heros are just that, heroic and certainly worthy of being admired. THe villains excellently portray their sense of evil, and the language is descriptive and easy to read, while introducing kids to a higher scale of reading than \\"The Magic Tree House\\" or \\"Junie B. Jones\\".THough I am older than when I first read this book, I am still a fantasy fanatic mostly due to this series. IN fact, I even started (and I'm still in the process of) writing a book, thanks to the inspiration of these stories.THis is by far, Brian Jacques most phenominal masterpiece, hands down!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Can it get any better than this? I don't think it can.Martin is a mouse who is a slave for Badrang the tyrant. With the help of Felldoh, a squirel, Brome, a mouse, and the outside help of Rose, Brmoe's sister, Martin escapes. But Martin will not rest until all the slaves are freed and Badrang is slain.Not only are the battle seqeunces exciting, the story is great. It is sad and presents many powerful themes about war and the life of a warrior. It shows that stories about furry little animals can have more to them than furry little animals. It also shows that author Brian Jacques has become one the great fantasy authors of all time along with Tolkien, C.S. Lewis, and T.H. White."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This was one of the first of the Redwall books that I ever picked up to read and it had me hooked. The story is of a young mouse named Martin imprisoned in a huge fortress called Marshank. The tyrant ruler, Badrang, holds Martin's father's sword. Determined to destroy Badrang for all the pain he has caused him, Martin sets out on a journey to raise an army big enough and strong enough to overthrow Marshank. And willing paws are not too far away or too hard to find. Many encounters with other creatures makes Martin's army even larger and determined slaves within Marshank are out for revenge. Martin the Warrior is a tale of friendship, determination and most of all, bravery. This is the tale of a true warrior and how his legend became known through most of the lands. Buy this book and find out the heartwarming and heroic tale of Martin the Warrior! If you want to read more about Martin after this book, read Mossflower. I reccomend this book to all fantasy readers!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"When I was in 5th grade, we had a book fair in my school. I saw this book, and decided to get it. With that book, I fell in love with the series. I read Redwall immeadietly afterwards, and then the rest of Jacques' books that he had already published.I am now entering my junior year in college in the fall, and I recently rediscovered Martin the Warrior on my book shelf. I picked it up, and read the whole thing in 3 days. I was hooked! I went back out and bought a few other Redwall books, and my goal is to re-read the series this summer.For all young readers, check out this series. You wont regret it."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior is a good book, dont get me wrong, but i dont think it is as good as the first three. Fairly solid plot, pretty good characters, and setting that opens up the rest of the series.

I loved reading, and I wanted to read something exciting and thrilling. So I went to the library and tried out this one. little did I know that I would fall in love with this series.Now, im 15, and i still love the series as much as I did before. The action scenes are written perfectly, there is suspense lurking behind every page, and you just fall in love with the characters.Even now, after reading all 17 books in the series, I still consider this one as my favorite. It contains Martin, my favorite character to date.I think that Brian Jacques has became on of the definitive fantasy authors of the 90's, and even the 21st century."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I am reading Martin the Warrior right now. It is so intresting and packed with adventure and action. It makes me want to read more of the series. I love this book and I would advise you to read it."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I discovered these books accidently by seeing the PBS show Redwall with my children (13 and 9, a girl and a boy). We all fell in love with the stories and the author, Brian Jacques, who spoke at the end of each episode. We bought the entire series, at least the 16 he has written ( so far) and have spent the summer reading them. The characters just sweep you into their world and you become emotionally involved with the story of how and why Martin developed into a warrior, what it cost him and how those experiences colored his world everafter. A must read for families together. There are moral lessons in the story that even the youngest child can comprehend, because they can relate to the animal characters; as diverse a group as you are ever likely to encounter, and wish you would."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book was amazing from the first pages -- in which an enslaved mouse called Martin attacks a slave-guard at the evil fortress of Marshank and is sentenced to death by the stoat Badrang the Tyrant -- to the end where...well, I had better not tell.This book was almost non-stop action, which is rare in many books. You would not want to put this book down!! This book is possibly the BEST book that Brian Jacques has written!! There are a few sadder parts, where the pace slows down a little (but that is typical of all Jacques' books). You can read this book over and over again and find something new, a new implication or piece of irony. Best of all, instead of just two armies battling each other, Brian Jacques creates a third party -- the freebooting stoat Cap'n Clogg -- that battle both the good and bad armies.I have only one piece of advice for you: GO BUY THIS BOOK NOW, OR ELSE YOU MAY BE MISSING THE BEST BOOK IN PRINT!!!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I absolutley LOVED this book. I think it is one of the best Brian Jaques has written. Martin is my favorite character. I read RedWall in the sixth grade for battle of the books and sinse then RedWall has been my favorite series!

I have read and own all the RedWall books and love every single one."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I'd like to say this is a magical, and mysterious book that I think is the second best of them all!!

I am a very big fan of Brian Jacques and I've read every book exept Marlfox, I'm waiting for it to come out in paperback."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I thought this was a very well written fantasy book.

You can picture eveything in your mind. im geussing mossflower comes next (timewise) so im reading that right now. i cant explain it, the villians are so real along with everyone else. i need to read mossflower an marial of redwall and i will have read them all. the end is kind of sad though but for those of you who havent read it ill keep my mouth shut. one thing is though i think there should be just a picture of REDWALL at the begining of each chapter (the same picture. just one of redwall) because it sometimes gives away the ending. the diologe (i think thats how you spell it) is amazing with the mole speech and pirate talk. i meet brian jacques at abook signing and those of you who dont know he said THE LEGEND OF LUKE will be out next january. thats all i have to say."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior I thought was a great book. It's very interesting that the characters were animals. Most books are with humans. Also, the wars were neat with spears and rocks. I hope I can read the other redwall books."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"If you like the Redwall books that have wars this book is for you. most of the whole book is about war."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book is the one that got me hooked on the series. I read it first because I didn't know the published order and noticed all the other books referred to Martin, and figured this was a good place to start. And it indeed was.I found this to be the most dramatic of the series (Yes, I have read them all), and best written. I won't summarize the plot, just rather cast my opinion of it. I felt more tension reading this novel than I did any other in the series, and I suppose that is just due to its plot and setting, feeling a lot more tense than others, a darker light shines on this book. In many of the other novels the main settings (there are usually two or three) involve a home for the good guys. Not here, the main setting being Marshank, which makes much of the action much more gripping. I personally couldn't put the book down, and make sure to read through it around once a month."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I love the Redwall series because they have action, humor, and because they're nice and long! I wouldn't recommend these books for kids under the age of 9 though, they have quite a bit of violence. Brian Jacques has once again succeeded to weave an excellent plot, including furry heroes and heroines as usual! I'm very excited about this series, and I think that it is one of the best for the middle-age group! You don't have to read the books in order, but it can be very useful. I also reccommend these (series) for the middle-aged reader: -The Seventh Tower-A Series of Unfortunate Events-Jedi ApprenticeHappy reading!!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I love the Redwall series because they have action, humor, and because they're nice and long!

In my opinion, Brian Jacques is a writer with unmatched skills in creating a whole new world that, when a person reads about, is totally believable. In Martin the Warrior, a young mouse is enslaved by an evil stoat named Badrang the Tyrant. The book is about how this young mouse with the help of his good friends Rose, Grumm, Felldoh, and Brome, breaks free, raises an army, and fights back. Don't judge this book by the fact that the characters are animals, for if you make this mistake and choose not to read this book for that reason, you will be missing one of the greatest works that I have ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I love this book!

He never backs down, and never just quits. I admire him for that. If you like this one, I also recomend The Legend of Luke and Mattimeo. READ ALL OF THE REDWALL BOOKS!!!!

I especially liked the way Brian Jacques gives each kind of animal a separate and distinct culture, while weaving them all into the whole. This book is fast-paced and gripping, and never disappoints. Redwall fans should not pass it by. In fact, no-one who likes fantasy should pass it by. This book is more realistic, and at the same time, more fantastic, than most of the stuff on the market today.

This is truly one of his best ever books in the whole series of Redwall and has all the favourite themes of good against evil and giving the bad guys a jolly good thrashing! Because it is set before (and therefore out of) Redwall Abbey, it's just that little bit different, which is why it's one of my favourites in the series. Yes, there are simularities in the characters if you've read the previous books, but who cares? It's an excellent read!!! My overall opinion - Jacques is the best author to happen to this planet and I wish him great success in the continuing Redwall saga."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book is my favorite(So far).

Martin the Warrior has always been a fundamental part of the Redwall series. However, the Warrior mouse of Redwall has always remained something of an enigma to readers. Appearing as a spectre, or merely in dreams...how much information does that give the reader? Not much to draw on. Although &quot;Mossflower&quot; went some way to dispel this, it still wasn't enough. For me, &quot;Martin The Warrior&quot; changed that.&quot;Martin The Warrior&quot; gives us the long awaited background story of the Warrior mouse, and, in my opinion, is a fantastic backdrop for the other novels. &quot;Martin The Warrior&quot;, for once, gives an insight into the driving forces of Martin's psyche, tells the tale of how he took up the mantle of Warrior...We see for once how Martin came to be what he was, read about events that shaped his life and destiny...This tale of Martin's past is captivating, gripping. We feel for the hero...More than worthy of the title &quot;A Novel Of Redwall&quot;, &quot;Martin The Warrior&quot; is another fine example of Brian Jacques work. It has emotional content, adventure, excitement, a perfect plot...This is something definitely worth reading, either by the Redwall fan, thirsting for more, or just the casual reader.Rarely do I find such a good book, one that gives such insights into a character. &quot;Martin The Warrior&quot; turns the character of Martin alive and vivid...It's worth reading, even if just for that.It would most likely be redundant to further stress this point, but in closing, I would like to say, once again: This is a fine novel, a fantastic instalment in the Redwall series. I really, really, recommend it.But you've probably gathered that by now. :)"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The book Martin The Warrior was very exciting and in some parts funny.

This book of Redwall begins with a mouse from Noonvale. She relates the tale of Redwall's warrior mouse to the inhabitance of the abby. The creatures of Redwall have always been protected by the spirit of Martin and they have a great respect for him, but they never knew what he did befor he came to Mossflower, it had always been a great mistery. The story of Martin's life contains times of joy as well as times of sorrow. Even though I am a sixteen year old male I am not ashamed to admit that tears were rolling from my eyes as I neared the end of the heart worming yet tragic story of Martin the Warrior"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I've read all the Redwall books; several made me cry, but not like this one. I admit: I wept openly while reading it. It's not a particularily sad story, but Martin (who wuld later become Redwall's greatest hero) had a hard life. He was taken prisoner by Badrang the Tyrant and led away from his home on the northern shores at a young age. Once at Badrang's Palace, he was forced to work with other slaves, but his courage never failed him. Martin makes friends with Rose and Grumm, a mousemaid and a mole, who are one the outside of the palace and trying to rescue Rose's brother Brome, also a slave. An escape is planned for Martin, Brome and Felldoh (a squirrel), who are down in the prison pit as a punishment for their insolence. The manage to get free, but Martin and Rose are separated from Brome and Fellodoh at sea beacause their boat sunk. Both couples find much adventure anbd new friends as they try to raise an army against Badrang. When they finally meet again an attack is made on the palace, a battle between free creatures and a Tyrant. During the battle, the rest of the slaves are freed ands they, too, join the fight against their former captor. In the end, at the very end of the battle, a trajic and unexpected thing happens, which changes Martin forever. Throughout the story, though, tiny hints have been dropped about this unfortunate occurence. If you want to laugh, cry, and be held in suspense I strongly reccomend this touching book. In fact, I reccmend all of the Redwall books beacause each is special in its own way."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This was possibly one of the best books written by Jacques.

This was the guy who founded Redwall Abbey, the guy whom Matthias looked up to for inspiration. This guy overshadowed the main section of the Redwall timeline. This book had a lot going for it in terms of the setting, as a kind of prequel.The execution, however, is not so great. Yes, Jacques does avoid most of the pitfalls that many authors fall into when writing prequels; ie: you know what's going to happen, down to the letter. But the story doesn't come off as the strongest, with virtually no memorable characters save for Martin, who is a pretty strong lead with no posse to support his personality.This book is worth reading as part of the Redwall series, but as a stand alone isn't all that compelling.3.5 stars"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I started reading the Redwall series in 6th grade, many, many years ago. Over the years (I am now 28), I have re-read this series and picked up any new ones that have come along. I truly enjoy these books and have found something new with each re-reading. Martin the Warrior, along with Mossflower, happen to be my favorites in the series (closely followed by Mariel of Redwall and Joseph the Bellmaker).Jacques created exquisite characters and stories and this was one of his best. In Martin the Warrior we finally learn the story of Martin, Redwall's most important figure. It is full of adventure, revenge, love, honor, and friendship. It contains all of the elements of epic story telling and strikes chords deep within."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior was mentioned in Redwall and prominently featured in Mossflower. However, this book truly centers around him, and is an amazing book about the history of one of Redwall's finest heroes. I like how Brian Jacques doesn't write his books in time-linear sequence, because it's nice to get these nice background stories after a primary universe/canon has been established. Next to 'Legend of Luke' (another fabulous prequel to Redwall) this book stands as one of the best stories of the Redwall universe."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"If you liked any of the other Brian Jaques books you might like the \\"Redwall\\" series.A particularly good \\"Redwall\\" book is \\"Martin The Warrior\\".

I love the riddles, poems, and songs. Brian Jacques has a wonderful tallent!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior by Brian Jacques tells of a young mouse searching for his destiny. Yes, again Jacques takes the reader to the world of Mossflower. Now, after a long wait, Jacques tells the reader of the greatest hero in the history of Redwall Abbey, Martin the Warrior. Throughout this novel, Jacques states and restates his thesis, or reason for writing Martin the Warrior. His thesis shows that Tyrants have no place in the world, and must be taken out of power. Jacques places this statement throughout in the thoughts of the captives and of those who help them. Jacques shows, through his characters, biases for those who oppose the weak and less fortunate. He strongly values freedom, possibly because of his short time when he worked as a truck driver. Jacques writes through third person point of view to show the thoughts of everyone, the villain's and the hero's. This gives the reader a true sense of the actions that take place in the novel. The author continually sides with what a typical reader believes freedom for the common man. This work of Jacques brings another great work of rebellion and freedom to the genre. However, this story has been told many times before. Contrary to that, because of its great description and use of animals, it will continue to entertain readers for many years. Jacques ability to create wonderful stories, like Martin the Warrior, proves to rank him among the best of fantasy writers. However, he leaves many questions unanswered. Perhaps this just leaves areas for the great writer to continue in the tradition of Redwall. Many of these questions include what happened to those who moved to Noonvale. Jacques also answers many of the questions from other novels. The reader now knows the true beginning of Martin, the great warrior of Redwall. Jacques writes this novel extremely well, continuing with the greatness of those novels past. Again, the detail in Martin the Warrior paints an imagine in the mind of the reader that last a lifetime. From the description of the woods and Marshank to the thoughts of Martin himself. Jacques writes in elegance, his words flow off the pages and into a readers mind. Enough great things about Jacques's writing abilities can not be said. Jacques proves his point continuously throughout his novel. He shows the affects of dictatorship thought the characters that the readers form a bond with. This shows that he well argues his point that Tyrants must be destroyed. The questions that Martin the Warrior asks, Jacques answers clearly. He distinctly answers the questions by demonstrating the horrible affects that dictatorship, for example, have on good people. This convinces the reader that the views of Jacques prove true. The awful and great affects on Martin and those who he loves convince the reader that the views of Jacques must be followed. Jacques, however, writes this novel on the level that any intelligent person could read without much difficulty. Jacques's points move the reader into thinking much the same way as Jacques himself. He creates a bond between the reader and the hero; this bond allows Jacques to drive his beliefs into his subconscious. Jacques's greatest strength in Martin the Warrior, persuades the reader to think in the author's own way. Jacques, however, shows some weakness in his work. The greatest of those comes in his writing; his excessive use of passive verbs sometimes leaves the reader unmoved. This novel does, however, accomplish its goal of convincing the reader to fight against dictatorship and overpowering of the weak. This novel shows greatness and should definitely be read by those who follow the series. It also makes a great story for those who just want to read a great novel. The bottom line is this novel should only be read for enjoyment as its level of writing lacks greatness equivalent to those of Moby Dick and"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Zack's Rating: 97%An excellent tale about a young mouse named Martin who is captured and slaved by the ruthless Badrang the Tyrant.

Just who was the valiant hero depicted the faded tapestry at the abbey which he founded, after many years of swashbuckling adventure for the cause of FREEDOM? Why did he not pass the sacred sword of his father on to a worthy heir? There are the usual literary challenges when writing a Prequel, as the tale which comes first in Time must not distort previously accepted events.Young Martin performs many heroic deeds during his pilgrimmage to idyllic Noonvale, enlisting the selfless aid of various freedom-seeking animals, in his grim quest to remove the Tyrant from power and recover his father's precious sword. Of course we realize that this tale can not be concluded until the inevitable one-on-one mortal combat, to prove moral supremacy. REDWALL devotees will recognize many of Jacques' stylistic traits: unusual pairings of species to achieve a common goal; delightfully creative names and a cast of hundreds, ingenious tiwsts of fate, clever plots and counter-schemes; leaving us dangling as he spins three different threads at once; his humorous slang written in challenging dialect!As for me there is only one REDWALL, but I still wanted to learn more about Martin, that brave figure on the fading tapestry, who founded the abbey as a haven of peace and knowledge. Now that I now the secret from the dim mists of animal time, I can understand his inspriration on Matthias, as I savor the rest of the series. A rip-snorting yarn which will hold the interest of all ages, though overlong for children under 12. Excellent pen and ink sketches give hints at the start of each chapter and a map of the odyssey which I frequently consulted. This is one fabulous tale of fur and feathers for Freedom! If you love REDWALL or have never read any of the series, start with this one!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The best book I have ever read. The only other book I have read in the series is Redwall and this book is better. Brian Jacques compels you to fall in love with Martin and Rose, and hate their enemies as though they were your worst enemies. Reccomended for older readers with plenty of time and quiet. Also with not many people around. A very humorous story but a very tragic one. Excellent reading!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The greatest Redwall book ever written, indeed one of the greatest books ever written that I have read yet. A must-read for anybody with a liking for reading. I highly recommend buying this book."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Brian Jaques has truly written a wonderful book. The story of Martin the Warrior mouse of Redwall Abbey is finally revealed. From the dungeons of a stoat tyrant's fortress to the peaceful colony of Noonvale Martin and his friends Laterose the mousemaid and Grumm the mole have adventures to match any King Arthur story three times over."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"When I first started this book I wasn't so sure I would enjoy reading about little rodents having wars. This just didn't seem my type of book. Boy, was I wrong! I loved it. Since reading this book, I've read the rest of the series and look forward to future books. Martin the Warrior is an excellent adventure story. The characters are very imaginative and interesting, and I wanted so badly for Martin to succeed in his quest. Every time I read this book I laugh and cry, I mean cry. This is a must read for Redwall fans, and if you aren't one already, it will get you hooked!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I have not long ago finished all twelve books in this series. And they all will hold a place in my memory for a very long time. I acctualy can look back a remember the adventures and of the different charaters. It is like I was there with them the whole time. I find it hard to read other books after these ones. I even re-read acouple of my favorites ( Mattiemo, Matin the worrior, Salamastradon)Just to have some good material again. If you even seem vaugly intrested in theses books read them! After one you'll be hooked."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I have read every single book of the Redwall series and I haveto say that this one is still my favorite. It was the only book thatallowed me to connect with all the characters, good and evil. I understood their motives and their emotions. Definitely a must-read!

I think, like all of Brian Jacques books, it is exciting and fun. I like this series because you can really get to know the characters and the setting. I like this book because it reveals many of the mysteries about the Redwall hero Martin. I read about him in many books like Redwall, Mattimeo, Salamandastron, and Mariel of Redwall (to name a few), and always wondered who he really was. Well this book tells exactly that. You get to know him and some of his history. I'll keep on reading."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I thought this book was really great,because of the action and the adventure.This book was one of the better books that I read by Brian Jacques.Because the character was more willing to help other people when they need it better than the other characters in Brian Jacques out of the Redwall Series.I gave this book 5 stars out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The exiteing prequel to mossflower, in which Martin the warrior strives to regain his father's sword which the evil soat Badrang had stolen, a band of freedom fighting slaves attack Marsank Badrang's fortress while Martin and his friends Rose and Grumm go to Noonvale (Rose and Grumm's home) to raise a army to attack Marshank!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I've read every book in the Redwall series at least three times and evan though I read Mossflower before Martin The warrior ,I can imagine Martin the Warrior better than Martin's story to the woodlanders.I have fun deciphering the different ways of talking."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This is a really good book. I recomend reading Redwall first that way it makes 1,000,000 times more sense. If you are afraid of mice and other small animals ( that is what it's all about). So over come your fears. You heard it straight from the mouse's mouth! Hee Hee Hee Hee"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book is really really good. You now can finally know what really is underneath that brave mouse. The good part of it is that it is long so you can get the full effect of things. Here you again meet new characters made by Brain Jacques and they are all unique in their own little ways.i really liked this book and i think it is one of the best ones down by Mr. Jacques besides Salamandastron and the Long Patrol which are also really good.new adventures,new characters, new plots, what more could a person ask for? Here you learn the value of friendship. Yes there were some times, i mean many times ( exspeicually towards the end) where i really did cry. again these books are the \\"once you pick them up, you never put them down\\" and they have you on the edge of your seat! Again its the heart tearing, emotions rising, and imagination soaring effect when one reads his books. Don't miss out and spread the word!hint: when he says at the end that he will never tell of the story of what happened, he really ment that! i think he did know of his past and he purposly told only half of his coming in Mossflower. but that's just my opinion!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior takes place in a medieval era. In this world mice, mouse maids, squirrels, ferrets, weasels, rabbits, and even rats take the place of human characters. They become warriors, actors, villains, and tyrants. Martin the Warrior is the main character, he is a slave who was captured by Badrang the Tyrant and his horde of beasts. He has been forced to work with many other slaves. Martin often attacks many of the hordebeasts, which gets him into more trouble than he needs. Felldoh is a squirrel who has been Martin's friend since the beginning. Together they will go anywhere and do anything if necessary. Along with the two companions are Grumm and Rose. Grumm is a mole who is especially fond of cooking and digging. Whenever they are in danger he whirls out his ladle to beat enemies over the head with. Rose is a beautiful mouse maid known for her beautiful voice. Her father is the chieftain of a peaceful village called Noonvale, and she hopes to bring Martin there someday. Rose also has a younger brother named Brome who is always running off because of a disagreement with their father. His actions although they are not intentional, often get people hurt or even killed. The final characters are the Rambling Rosehip Players. They are a group of entertainers that Felldoh and Brome find. Although they are just actors they are crucial in the final battle as warriors and trainers. They are more or less the brains of the outfit that come up with ways to succeed.Martin is not a mouse you want angry. Once he makes a vow he always fulfills it. When his father Luke sails away to eradicate sea rats Martin is given his father's powerful sword that has seen battle many times. When he is captured, Badrang uses the sword for his own uses. However, Martin does not plan to ever escape the fortress Marshank without Badrang dead, and his father's sword in his hands once again. Many adventures come upon Martin, Rose, and Grumm. They go through the thick, dense marshlands, inhabited by powerful cannibal lizards. Over a gigantic mountain inhabited army of squirrels who play games with their enemies in order to eliminate them. Across a rounding steep in which small pigmy shrews live in caves that are so great in numbers that they can overwhelm the most powerful creatures.I enjoyed this book unlike any other that I've read. This is just one of the many chapters of the series Redwall. Martin the Warrior combines an intense story of action and adventure with description that will take you into the book in a heartbeat. The book allows you to bond with the characters and you never know what will happen next. The 379 pages fly by so don't be discouraged about it taking a month to read this book. The ending will make you cry as some of the greatest, brave, and caring characters duel with death and lose."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The book has very good details and makes you feel like there is a place just like the one he explaines in the book.I like the phrase that the mole wife said, \\"That liddle mousy-maid be loked in Martin's \`eart, and thurr she'm bound to stay.\\"I heard that some people loved the dialogue that the author used but I thought the different dialects were hard to read and understand.I still think this is a must read book for people of all ages.It really has a good impression on the reader and it makes me thankful for my feedom. There are great character descriptions and I could completely visualize them in my mind."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Just like any Redwall book, Brian Jacques, at the end of each chapter, changes the story to a different bunch of characters, leaving the suspense at the other end of the story for another time. With this happening numerous times, its impossible not to be hooked!In this book, Martin is a younger mouse, and was captured as a slave while he was guarding his family while his father was away (read \\"Legend of Luke\\" if you want to hear his father's adventre). He was taken to Marshank, where he was somewhat of a rebel. He was particularly mad because Badrang, the Tyrant of this (Marshank was his fortress)area, had stolen his father's sword from him. Along with mousemaid Rose and mole Grumm (looking for their captured friend, Brome) and the rest of the slaves try to escape Marshank and kill Badrang.This is a Redwall thriller, and is must for any Redwall or fantasy fan!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Once upon a time, I read a delightful series that ended. Then, I read nothing. But my friend bugged me to try and read this book for almost three months. Then I gave in. I am so glad I did.This book is a swashbuckling, action-packed adventure with real heart. You loved those charachters and waited with baited breathe for the rorsing finale. The tragic one. This book is an emotional roller-coaster, but has moments where you just wind down and relax. This is the book to enter Redwall with. Then read the orginal Redwall and Mossflower. The Redwall books are wonderful, but this one is simply the best(tying with the Taggerung)"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"One of his best.

I've read it maybe three times but I really enjoyed having a full cast to listen to. The songs are a treat-especially Rose's songs. The cast actually sings!Like all of Brian Jacques' books, you can picture what's happening in your mind. Martin the Warrior paints an absoballylutely (as the hares would say) perfect picture!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I think that Martin the Warior was an execellant book. It had all of the adventure of the other books but it was more exciting. The book always gives you little hints to what going to happen next.

I eagerly await Triss, and to get to read Taggerung, so I can know if it really is the best book. Anyway, it's really good.

SMACK! POW!!!! WOOOOW!!!!!!!!!

Jaques, or just simply fans of a great alternate-world fiction."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I think this is the best of all out of the Redwall series. With many epic battles ending with one, big, bloody battle over Badrang the Tyrant and Marshank. Martin the Warrior is in almost every Redwall book. Son of Luke the Warrior, he tries to bocome the best warrior of the land. Martin fights for peace against all searats and evil tyrants. This is a great book and I hope anyone would read it."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book really keeps you attention. I also like the virtues that the heroes display, as they keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Amazing!!! Brian Jacques really hits the high points here. Never have I ever read such a moving and exciting tale. Out of all of the books that I've read, this IS THE BEST! He has mastered the art of skillfully weaving an intriguing tale with wonderful plot complications. Thank you, Brian Jacques, for making books come alive to the reader once again."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I was hoping I could have the screen name Martin but the A.O.L staff only let me have Mart. Well what I have to say about this story is.That this was the best book I have ever read in my whole entire life.It kind of had a message that no matter how young or old you are you can still be brave and couragous."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This is the best book I have ever read, and I have read quite a few (including all of the Redwall books, even the Great Redwall Feast). I think that Martin is the coolest (well, second coolest) character in any of the BJ books. Skarlath from the Outcast is the coolest. Anyway, I make it a point to read this book about once every 3 months. I'll probably have to get a new copy soon if I'm not careful, and I should be careful, because Brian Jacques himself autographed mine!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I have read the entire Redwall series over and over again and Martin the Warrior is by far the best one in the series. I've read it 5 times and it always bring a tear to my eye. I highly suggest the whole Redwall series, but I reccomend that you read this one first. Not only is is the best one, but it explains the life of Martin the Warrior, who is the guiding spirit in all the rest of Brian Jacques Redwall books. If I could give it twenty stars I would. I may sound like a lunatic, but if you read it you will understand why I feel so strongly. SO READ IT!!!!! ^_^"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book was so sad. I cried at the end. But it so good! The way Jacques made Martin's personality is incredible. All his books are more than wonderful but this one was fantastic. Brian Jacques is my favorite author and if you want a action packed,dramatic book then I recomend Martin the Warrior for you to read."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The book was so good I read it ten times in one school yea"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The Best book I have ever read"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior is the first book chronologically in the Redwall series. It opens with Martin as a slave to an evil Stoat Warlord named Badrang. Martin, while chained to a stake in a storm vows to kill Badrang. After Martin escapes he has many adventures with his friends Rose (a mouse), Grumm (a mole), and Pallum (a hedgehog and my personal favorite). Together they have many adventures, encounters with many bizare animals, and hardships. This book is saved from mediocrity by it's colorful characters, furios battles, and humerous moments. It is a worthy prequel to Mossflower and a great addition to the Redwall series, but it is still not my favorite (see my review of Mossflower)"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I'm a great fan of the Redwall series. When the book Redwall was first introduced to me, I thought it looked dumb, but I thought otherwise after I read it. So now I just finished the 5th Redwall book I&quot;ve read, Martin the Warrior. It's hard to say which is my favorite, but this was one of them. I completly disagree that this book is for readers ages 9-12. More like 9-100! I'm planning on buying the whole set so I can read them all over again and again. I'm obsessesed! Martin the Warrior was SOOOOOOO good!! I esspesially like the details, you know, the little things. I pay careful attention to every little thing so I can picture it in my head. I like how Jacques writes fron 3rd person point of view, so you can know what everybody's thinking. Martin the Warrior is one of my favorites because it action-packed and I can't help but love the personalities of the characters. This book made me both laugh and even cry a little. Read this book!! I think Brian Jacques should get even more reconition than he does, because I have never read better books than those of the redwall series, and I hope he makes lots more! I've never been disapointed with one of his books yet, and this one is one of his best."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"For those who have read the other books in the Redwall Series, I'm sure you've all heard of 'Martin the Warrior'. Well, this book tells all about him, and where he came from before he had wandered into Mossflower to rescue the animals from under the tyranny of Tsarmina the Wildcat.\\"Martin the Warrior\\" starts of with Martin, a warrior mouse, among with many other animals made to work as slaves to the cruel Badrang the Stoat. When Martin is able to escape with another mouse named Brome and Felldoh the squirrel. Martin ventures to Noonvale with Fellodoh, Brome and his sister, the mousemaid Rose, and Grumm the mole, to try to recruit the animals there to help free the other slaves in Badrang's fortress. But they are separated while Martin, Rose, and Grumm continue onto Noonvale, Felldoh and Brome meet up with some performers lead by Ballaw the hare. Felldoh and his band create havoc against Badrang while Badrang himself is trying to keep Coggs, another stoat, from taking over his fortress.This is a good book but because I'm comparing this with the other Brian Jacquess Redwall books like \\"Mossflower\\" and \\"Redwall\\", I gave this book only 4 stars. The characters are really fun, my favorite being Grumm the mole with his curious mole accent. \\"Martin the Warrior\\" has actually a pretty sad ending compared to the other Redwall books.Also, although \\"Martin the Warrior\\" is named as book 6 in the Redwall series, if you want to read the books in order of time, this is the first book, the next being \\"Mossflower.\\" So I suggest to those who haven't read any of the books to start with this one, but as I said, it has kind of a sad ending so have the next book, \\"Mossflower\\", on hand. Have fun reading!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book is about the young Martin the warrior and Badrang the Tyrant that rules the fortress Marshank. Martin escapes with Rose and Grumm the mole, in search for Noonvale to raise an army to deafeat Badrang. This story is filled with adventures, such as the encounter with Boldred and the Gawtrybe, and one of the biggest battles of all, the battle of Marshank. This book isn't the best, I can tell you that right now, lacking something that it has in other redwall books, such as Mariel of Redwall, Redwall, and The Outcast of Redwall. This is one problem Brian Jaques always had. Such in Pearls Lutra, one mouse killed about 30 carniverous lizards without getting a scrach, and here in Marting the warrior, Felldoh the squirrel killed 5 vermin while he was dying, about 20 in all. Think of it, is that possible?"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin the Warrior is the sixth in the Redwall series and one of my favourites. The prologue is at Redwall, when two creatures, a mouse and a hedgehog, tell the story of a great, but little known warrior, Martin, son of Luke and Sayna.It begins at Marshank, Badrang the stoat's fort, where the young Martin is being worked under forced labour. When he lashes out at Hisk, one of Badrang's captains, he is sentenced to death, and is strung up for the seabirds.However, he survives the night, while his fellow captives are planning to overthrow Marshank and Badrang, and escape. Among them are Keyla and Tullgrew the otters, and the treacherous Druwp.Later in the book, he, Feldoh and Brome the mouse are thrown into the prison hole when they attack the rats, weasels and foxes under Badrang's command, only to be saved by Rose and Grumm the mole (who digs them a tunnel out).Meanwhile, Captain Tramun Clogg is waging war against his former partner in crime, Badrang, and both stoats have to battle it out, with burning of ships and all the time acting as though they are still the best of friends.Martin, Rose and co. escape from Marshank by floating down the coast in small longboats, only to realise that they have holes in them and are in danger of sinking. During the commotion they are separated and Felldoh and Brome end up with a band of actors lead by the hare Ballaw and Rowanoak the badger, and Martin, Rose and Grumm are captured by pygmy shrews, lead by Amballa.When Martin saves her squidgee from a big gannet, she releases them and awards him with her own sword, they also gain a new friend, Pallum the hedgehog.Meanwhile, Ballaw and co. are planning a rescue attempt for the creatures of Marshank, which they undertake when Clogg brings them into the walls because he believes them to be 'magic'. They, and all the slaves escape, and, from the coast, wage war on Marshank.Martin and co. meet up with kindly moles and wimpy rabbits, get stung by bees that like the sound of Rose's voice and strange weasels that cover their bodies in weeds, as well as crazed squirrels, until meeting up with a pair of owls that finally take them to Noonvale, Rose's home.Urran Voh, Rose's father, however disagrees with Martin when he asks for him to supply an army to destroy Marshank. They go back and for all in involved, tragedy ensues. In a gripping last battle, all the creatures unite and battle the evil of Badrang and his horde, with the loss of friends and foes alike. But, as usual the good beats the evil, and Martin avenges his the death of his grandmother, and, in a way, his father.This is easily one of the best of Brian Jacques' Redwall series."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"How can anyone NOT give this a 5? Martin the Warrior has got to be one of the best books I've ever read. I saw other reviews say that this book is about war, but its not! Its about fighting for freedom and respect. The sword-fights are intense and brutal, and so are the battles. If you like action, there's plenty of it in Martin the Warrior. Human characters are replaced by animals and I think that is a very good aspect of the Redwall books by Brian Jacques. The animal characters act like humans too!It starts off with Martin, the mouse (as a child) on the shoreline with his elderly father, Luke. Luke knows Martin has warrior spirit inside him and gives Martin his sword and sails away. Then one day, Martin was with his mother when a gang of searats passed by his shack and attacked Martin and his mother. Then Badrang, the leader of the searats took Luke's sword from Martin. Martin and his mother were sent to Badrang's slave camp in fortress Marshank where his mother shortly died after. After being sentenced to death, Martin gets saved by two travellers - Rose (a mouse) and Grumm (a mole). Martin escapes, but he still didn't get his sword back from Badrang. Now this is where the story begins - Martin will do anything to get his father's sword back and re-claim his family honor. He also wants vengeance over Badrang for enslaving all the innocent animals he abducted to work for him.Please read \\"Redwall\\" before reading this book, you'll enjoy this one a bit more. I must admit the ending shocked me, and I nearly cried at the end. They should change this book's reading age to 9-100 because everyone will enjoy this book! The last battle at Marshank was outstanding, but it was a bit dissapointing because the final sword-fight was too short. I read this book in 2 days, and enjoyed every page of it. This is a must-read, Redwall fan or not!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Out of all of the Redwall books I've read, I think this one is the best. Captured at an early age by a cruel stoat, Martain the Warrior is forced into slavery. When Martin's cruel captor steals his father's sword from him, Martin vows to kill the stoat. After escaping, Martin finds himself on a long, tough, voyage to conquer the cruel villan. It's a wonderful book, and I would suggest it for the first of the Redwall books, then Mossflower."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I think the book Martin the Warrior was a very exciting book. And the battle of Marshank has to be one of the best battles in all of the Red Wall stories i have read so far. the story is full of great adventures that Martin and his friends have. I think this is one of Brian Jacque's best works because it really pulls you into the story. I would recommend this book to anyone that enjoys adventure stories because this book is full of great ones."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"First, I'll let everyone know that this book is the direct predecessor to the best book in the series, \\"Mossflower.\\" Martin ends probably just a few months before Mossflower begins. I read Mossflower first, but I wish I would have read Matin first. If you are just picking up this series, try to read this and then Mossflower. By the end of those two you will feel pretty accomplished. You could read Outcast of Redwall right after that too if you really wanted because it takes off a little after the end of Mossflower. Martin the Warrior is also a very sad book. I won't give anything away, but my two favorite characters both die, so I felt pretty sad at the end even though the main objective of the book is accomplished. I would say that this book is probably the third or fourth best in the series. I think Mossflower is head and shoulders above the rest and consider it to be pretty much a perfect Redwall book, then Redwall is the second best, and I would say that both Matin and Salamandastron claim the third and fourth spots in no particular order. All of these books are great and if you are just getting into the series you should read all of these first and also include Mattimeo because it is the sequel to Redwall.I'm going to nitpick a few things here about the book so, this section could have some minor spoilers. If you haven't read the book yet and wish to go in without knowing anything, don't read this part. The one thing that I didn't really like is that Martin never really rallied an army to defeat Badrang. I expected Martin to become this figure that every free beast rallied behind to defeat the enemy like in Mossflower. However, he had a friend get the army together with less than 50 pages in the book and then just took charge of it. I know he was younger so maybe he wasn't like full blown Martin the Warrior yet, but throughout the book he proved that he was really mature for a young mouse. Also, another odd thing is that I never really could believe that an army that was literally thrown together in a few pages could fight gallantly together as a whole. It just didn't seem that plausible to me that every beast would be on the same page after only serving with each other for like a few hours. This kind of leads to an awkwardness after the battle is over too. The many different tribes just split up and it just seems weird. This is very different than in Mossflower (I know I keep referencing it) where the army is completely united in order to establish Redwall Abbey after the final battle is over. This book is one of the more violent Redwall books too (I know that the really new ones have become extremely violent but, I think it's probably the most violent of the old ones). Martin kills Badrang by pressing his own sword directly into his heart. This is a little bit more of a cold-blooded kill than what normal Redwall readers are used to. Jacques typically has the main protagonist kill the main antagonist accidentally so he/she doesn't seem like a killer. This is not what happens in Martin. Also, there is no scene at the end of the book where the vermin prisoners are told to run like wild towards some direction. This is most likely because ALL of Badrang's force are killed mercilessly. That's almost groundbreaking for Jacques as this seems to never really happen in the books. Anyways, these points are just minor flaws that do not change how good this book is. Don't let me stop you from reading this book because of anything that I said because it truly is one of the greats of the Redwall world."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This was the first Redwall book I read and I think it was the best. If you're looking for a Redwall book to buy, look no further. Buy Martin the Warrior today!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I have been reading some other reviews. Some say the book is boring, too long and predictable. Here's why I think not.TOO BORING?????? A book with scenes like, \\"The big, red-frilled lizard pulled savagely on the vine, choking Martin into silence. The young mouse tugged either side of his neck, striving to loosen the vine so he could breathe properly. Then they were off at a headlong run, pulled along cruelly with countless lizards flanking them and shoving from behind...\\" Yupper. That's SURE boring. or someone could think it was boring because of too much detail. However, if Brian jacques went and reduced the detail (I hope not) you would probably find the same person griping about the lack of detail.How would it sound if Brian Jacques just said, \\"The lizards put a vine around their necks. Then they ran for a long time.\\" That did not sound too good.TOO LONG?????? Well, it's just like I said before. DETAIL IS GOOD!!!!!!TOO PREDICTABLE?????? Okay, how many of you guessed that that they would be taken captive by cannibal lizards? And how many guessed that they would be chased up a mountain by savage squirrels? And how many guessed that Brome would dress up as a hordebeast/searat and enter Marshank? Yupper. Real predictable.This book was funny too. \\"Trefiol had an apple baked in honey. Each time she looked away, a piece of it went missing.

The storyline is so good and the book is so exciting! I also love the creation of the animal world in this book!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I think this book was great! It had intreiging charectors, and a wonderful plot that was uncompairable!! But the ending was rather dissapointing. Someone Martin cares about dies very near the end, and Martin is entirily unable to except it, I think it could have been better if the charector had simply, not died. I still think the book is worth the reading, but be prepaired for the ending to be only third best."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I would suggest this book to anyone.

They set out on a quest to Rose's hometown of Noonvale to gather an army to stop the tyrant that had imprisoned them.

He escapes with the aid of friends from Noonvale, and begins a quest for revenge against the vermin. Meanwhile, another vermin horde (searats and corsairs) arives and continously challenges the Tyrant for control of Marshank. Finally, the Tyrant is faced down by Martin himself."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Yes, I have read this book three times and it doesn't ever get boring. I own and have read all of the Redwall books that are in soft cover, and this is the best. We are talking about some greta adventures, and I think this one is the best of them all. It is a great story that anybody who likes adventures can easily get into and thoroughly enjoy."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Brian Jacques is a master of pen! You will find yourself within the walls of Redwall Abbey. Feel the cool of the stone walls, smell Mosswood's flora, sit among friends at the great feast and taste the rasberry cordial! Fall into a novel from the Redwall Series!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I dissagree with the review before me. Though I originally started reading the series as a fifth grader, it never lost its magic, even as I'm a sophomore in high school now. True, I'm not 29, but I think the characters are memorable, though I agree that there are a little too many of them. I love the way the plotlines of certain books in the series intertwine with others. You forget instantly that these characters are animals, and even today, this series ranks on my favorites list (along with every David Eddings book ever written, the Mists of Avalon, Tolkien, and His Darker Materials, for starters). Redwall is a beautifully depicted world, and the series is definately worth while to read."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This is another good book from the Redwall series. This book starts differently than the others. It is told by Abbot Saxtos. In one day, he tells the story of Martin the Warrior to some travelers who know a little about Martin.The book started at Marshank. Martin was a slave to Lord Badrang. Lord Badrang took his father's sword from Martin. One day he and some others break out from the Prison Pit. The few that break out go separate ways. Brome and Fellodoh go with the Rambling Roseship players. Martin, Rose, and Grumm are captured by Pygmy Shrews. They were made to look after the little ones. A seagull took the Queen's baby. So Martin saved him and him and his friends get to leave. They made it to Noonvale. Martin sees how many of them are willing to go and fight Badrang and get the sword back. He gets few. Then heading to Marshank, he get hundreds of animals to help fight. They meet Brome and Fellodoh. That's when the war to get back the sword begins.I recommend this book to anyone who likes animals and medieval times combined. This is another great book written by Brian Jacques. This is one of the better Redwall books because it has more action and adventure."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This is a great Redwall book! The only bad part is when characters die... Should I tell you guys?Anyways, this book is about two mice named Martin and Rose, and a mole named Grumm who loves soup.(mmm) THey're trying to free slaves and defeat the evil stoat Badrang.There a;so are two other, Felldoh a squirrel and I forget Rose's brother's name. They're with a troupe that is near Marshank (badrang's fortress).I loved this book and you should read it!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"well, first of all, i really love this book! It is about Martin the warrior and his struggles. First, he is taken captive, and then rescued by Rose and Grumm from Noonvale. Then, as they run away, Felldoh and Brome are separated from Martin and Rose and Grumm, and they all work together to raise an army to fight the evil warlord who started it all. Then, when everything is set up and Martin and people (or animals)go to the fortress with their own army, they attack! well, let's just say all goes well until about the end, when some of our beloved characters meet their ends...sniff...that's why i gave this a 4 instead of a 5. it was REALLY good, but had a sad ending. hope my review was helpful! READ THIS BOOK, IT IS SOOOOOO GOOD!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Most sequals are not that good . . . they either disapoint you or bore you. Well, Brian Jacques is one of the small amount of writers that have kept my attention the whole time, and he's done it again with Martin the Warrior. When Martin is captured by the evil Lord Badrang as a young mouse, he steals both Martins freedom and the sword given to him by his father. When he secapes, he meets some lifelong friends There are twists and turns, and some funny happenings throughout the whole story, making it a book that you'll never get tired of reading. I strongly suggest this book, because it is one of the rare books that change your thoughts on fiction books."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Martin is a strong, stoic young mouse. He is captured and put in a labor camp under the supervision of Lord Badrang, the evil stoat. Lord Badrang is trying to build a fortress by summer called Marshank! With his horde of ruthless stoats and weasels Lord Badrang treats the prisoners very badly! This Redwall book is a wonderful tale of animals having human qualities like wielding swords and battle-axes, fighting wars, building fortresses and talking in different dialects. They also have feelings. Martin challenges the guards and fights with them and sometimes refuses to work, and he also helps the other prisoners, who are beaten no matter how old they are! But, when Grumm the mole and Rose the mouse (his friends) come to his rescue anything can happen! I like this book because it has tons of descriptive words and plenty battles and bravery! This is an exhilarating fiction book with loads of action. Brian Jacques has written lots of Redwall books like Salamandastron, Redwall, and The Bellmaker! All these fiction books are the best, read them all!"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This book is very interesting. You'll want to keep reading it all the time.Martin the Warrior is a young mouse you was given his father's sword when his father left. Shortly after, Badrang and his band of pirates came and captured Martin. They forced him to be a slave while Badrang the stoat took Martin's father's sword. Martin escapes from Marshank and won't stop his quest until he gets his father's sword back.WIth the help of rose, pallum, & Grumm, with many others, he returns to the fortress Marshank.If you like adventurestories you should definetly read this book."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"I love Redwall and I've read all the books. This one, while still excellent and exciting, was REALLY, REALLY, REALLY SAD!!! I cried at the end. Read this book, but be forewarned."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"The quality of writing, the rich cast of characters, the detailed accounts of medieval welfare, and Jacques&iexcl; ability to tell a good story and make readers think all earn Redwall a place on library shelves&iexcl; &iexcl;V School Library Journal. I agree with this quote, and I would like to add that Brian Jacques is a very accomplished author. Even though the Redwall series&iexcl; books have the same plot for just about every book, in my opinion they don&iexcl;t get boring due to the fact that Brian Jacques changes the characters every book and the plot has small twists, like multiple stories going on at the same time. Brian Jacques has written a book that has nothing to do with the Redwall series, called Castaways of the Flying Dutchman.Born on June 15, 1939Two sons: Mark and David, his dog, Teddy, his wife Liz, granddaughters Jade and Hannah, brothers Jimmy and Tony.Went to St. John's SchoolRedwall wasn't intended to be a book. Brian Jacques told the story to children at Royal Wavertree School for the Blind, and his friend and former English teacher, Alan Durband sent it to a publisher.Likes to write outside in his garden in the spring, in a conservatory when it&iexcl;s raining.Writes fantasy stories. Most famous books: Redwall, Mossflower, Mattimeo, Castaways of the Flying Dutchman, and Triss.Brian Jacques has won a couple small awards for individual books, such as a Children's Book-of-the-Month Club main selection for Martin the Warrior, Salamandastron, Mossflower, and Redwall have won the Lancashire Libraries Children's Book of the Year Award. Redwall, Mossflower, and Mattimeo have won the Western Australian Young Readers' Award.I chose this author because the Redwall series is my favorite series, and because I did not know much about Brian Jacques. \\"In Redwall, a hero can be a mouse or a shrew. He can be scared, he can get hurt, he can die. People don't have to look up to him to be saved, they look to him to fight with them. They look to him because he's smart, because he's willing to pay the price. He's committed to his cause. They look to him because he is like them. He knows what's right and knows it has to be done. He'll do it or die trying. Kids learn from these stories that sometimes the characters do die. It might be their favorite character, even. They learn that heroism doesn't come easy and does not come without a cost.\\" This quote was from a biography on the Internet, and I thought it was very fitting for the series. A quote from the same website I thought was funny was, \\"I suppose there's a child inside me who wants to get out. A little baldy child with a beard. Ha!\\" In conclusion, Brian Jacques is an outstanding children's author with a lot of accomplishments."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"hee hee this book rocks the whole entire world!!!

It can be read without reading the preceeding books, however, I recommend reading &quot;Mossflower&quot; before or after reading this book. It fills in unsolved reasons and bits of character of Martin. Although, Martin's character would never be right without a little mystery...."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"Some people are ignorant of the details and adventure Brian Jacques writes because the book may be a little long. If you don't like reading or hate books, why read anything? This book was very interesting, and I loved reading what Martin the Warrior was like when he was younger. In the other books, he is a fabled, unbeatable warrior, but this book tells how he also had faults.

They're good light reading (although by this point in the series I can predict the ending by the first four pages). But &quot;Martin the Warrior&quot; is quite the best in the series, reaching for a quality it never quite touches, but still doing a good job. Although full of the token charming maids, incessant songs, and four-page ramblings on the quality of the foods, it could have almost been a heroic quest. The theme of the hero seeking to regain the sword of his father had a great deal of potential, and it was perhaps because this reaches more closely toward actual myth that it was quite hard to associate the characters with their nominal animals. Also, Jaques finally managed to kill off a protagonist! Kudos to him (Although as soon as Laterose and Martin became interested in each other, I knew she would have to be disposed of somehow. There's no mention of her in the preceding books!)"},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"This is the story of martin the founder of the Abbey. But in his earlier years.

It has an adventursome plot that is thrilling and captures your attentions to the very end. It is easy to follow, but yet not predicatable. Even though the characters are animals you can relate to them well. The ending is very suprizing. There is so much I could say about this book, but if you want to see how wonderful it really is, you should read it for your self along with Brian Jacque's other Redwall books such as Redall and Mossflower."},{"Title":"Martin the Warrior","review":"&quot;Martin the Warrior&quot; is stunningly adventureous and full of courageous charecters- inclunding peaceful Laterose, her brother Brome, and the mole Grumm. Martin himself is very strong, cunning, and couragous but can be thoughtful, caring, and loving at any time. The whole tale has the bitter hate of slavery, the resentment of the evil Badrang, the suspense of escape, the joy of victory, and the distressing loss of lives of dear friends. All is tied up in just a touch of romance. Campfur and I were soaked in tears for the death of some of the main charecters.

And the pictures were great, which is the only thing that saved this book from a one-star review. The text is awful. Many of the verses don't rhyme, and they don't follow the meter of the original \\"I Know An Old Lady...\\" properly so reading this out loud is very awkward. The \\"reasons\\" for swallowing everything are boring and the ending - why she wanted the bat in the first place - is a big letdown. If you like Catrow's pictures as much as we do, this is worth a look through.

In the early to mid 1970's this New Yorker was at a college in a small market borough in the East Midlands of England. Many treasures of literature entered my life during those years, but none more enduring that this small volume. I have read and re-read it hundreds of times, either in order or opened to a page at random.Not only is it consistently entertaining, it has proven uniquely educational. The odd and memorable stories it tells of the scribbling tribe have forever fixed the personalities of these artists, leading me to luminous authors I would never have encountered. It has also afforded me the unique pleasure of quoting a bon mot, sounding as if I had a great deal more education than I do- at least when it comes to literature.It used to be said that Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy was a short cut to erudition, because it was so rich in quotations from authors from many sources. Nowadays almost nobody would recognize the allusions from Burton, so I nominate this book as the best short cut to sounding erudite.By the way, it is incomparably superior to the New Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes, which I have found to be an immense disappointment, notable primarily for smutty anecdotes that in a better time would have been called \\"unprintable\\". Sadly, in this age, nothing seems to fall under that description. Sutherland is from a different time, a time we may yet recover, once beauty and truth become valued once more."},{"Title":"The Oxford Book of Literary Anecdotes.","review":"The great philosopher David Hume on his deathbed said to his doctor, \\" As I believe you would not choose to tell anything but the truth , you had better tell him that I am dying as fast as my enemies, if I have any, could wish and as easily and cheerfully asmy best friends could desire.'Sir Robert Walpole upon his retirement came to the Library and found himself unable to read.

My daughter wanted this book, so I purchased it for her and made the mistake of reading the first story to her without reading it first myself. She couldn't sleep all night, so then I decided to look through the stories first and found a few that were better suited for her. They were all entertaining for me, and I would recommend them to any adult that likes reading creepy stories.

Her deep commitment to Earth's story is brought to light through the lives of ancient beings, human and others, giving the reader a mind-expanding adventure into worlds within this world. The wealth of pure information in this volume is astounding. Any seeker of any discipline will find a key to that which offers them bliss. Written in the first person, Signet of Atlantis paints passionate visions of multidimensional life through the eyes, mind and heart of Aspasia, Cretan priestess; Egyptian lion goddess, Sekhmet; Ichor Egyptian astrologer; Argolid, Atlantean from Spica; Allini, Pleadian teacher from Alcyone, Inanna, Sumerian goddess of love and war and Isaiah, Judeo-Christian prophet. (There are others) In true shamanic fashion, stars and stones speak their secret knowledge of the evolution of humankind, releasing a new/old vision of life on earth for modern man- and womankind to absorb and become. The author's willingness to speak to ancient wounds, tantric energies and secret teachings, in Heart of the Christos, (Book 2) is brought to fruition and healing in Signet of Atlantis. Her courage in accepting the &quot;mission impossible&quot; of bringing this body of knowledge to light and into play in this critical phase of Earth history is a fine example for people who care as deeply and for those who may only sense that something is going on. The whole trilogy is a must read for those seeking to open their multidimensional selves to the depth and richness of this planet we inhabit. There is much work to be done to manifest the wonder and beauty of life in full consciousness and Barbara Hand Clow has brought forth a solid understanding upon which to build."},{"Title":"Signet of Atlantis: War in Heaven Bypass (The Mind Chronicles Trilogy, Vol. 3)","review":"This book was very interesting in many ways.

It's honestly insightful and very interesting, especially when you skim through it instead of reading it cover to cover! This book takes the words that we know now and takes them back to their original origin. It's so interesting to find out just how different our language has turned just over a couple of centuries. The explanations are short and to the point, which is why it kept me so interested! They don't drag on and on telling you every single thing about the word but the most interesting thing.

It wasn't a book I wanted to sit down with for an extended period of time. The first chapter was about technological terminology and it seemed outdated (floppy disks?).I set it aside, thinking that it would make a really good bathroom reading book or coffee table book.Then, one night we had a friend over and he picked it up. He skipped around in the book instead of trying to read it cover-to-cover. He spent the next hour sharing with us little tidbits of knowledge that he gained from the author.

Mr. Garrison met his goal of explaining the origination of 350 common phrases and words.

I have long been a fan of books of etymology. When I hear a word or phrase that seems interesting or bizarre, I want to know where it came from. Garrison's book, according to the synopsis on the back, \\"is sure to fascinate wordsmiths of every stripe.\\" And certainly, the book isn't a complete waste of time in that regard. The thing is, though, I've read so many books that are more fascinating and better written examples of this genre. To be fair, the author states in his Introduction that he intentionally wrote short essays about each word or phrase, so I didn't expect this to be the definitive work of its kind. The biggest problem with this book is its odd system of organization, or the lack thereof. Most books of this type are in alphabetical order. Garrison chooses to arrange his according to subject. However, within each subject heading, the order of the articles is impossible to figure out. For example, the chapter on Household Words gives us the following words, to begin with: hard-boiled, biscuit, bay window, rummage, gumbo, bring home the bacon, flour, etc. Would it have killed him to at least make it alphabetical within each subject heading? With this kind of goofy system, if you have a particular word you're looking for, you have to go to the index to look it up. In which case, it makes me wonder why he didn't make the whole thing alphabetical.Besides the crazy lack of organization, Garrison does a pretty good job of providing etymologies for hundreds of common words and phrases. As a diabetic who just started using insulin, I found the etymology of \\"insulin\\" fascinating. Want to know why it's called \\"commencement,\\" when someone finishes school? It's in here. Want to know where the word \\"garble\\" came from? It's in here. (It comes from Arabic, incidentally.) Another thing in the author's favor is that he actually dodges some of the words and phrases that are notorious for having popular made-up etymologies, such as \\"OK,\\" \\"mind your Ps and Qs,\\" and \\"the whole nine yards.\\" So many authors in this kind of genre have indulged in all kinds of theorizing, while Garrison seems to stick mostly with language that has a documented history.

For example, he explores the origins of Floppy disks. Oddly enough, they are called such because they are indeed floppy.This book is not completely useless, however. Some of the words do have interesting stories, and as such I cannot in good conscience call this book a complete waste of trees.

Ferrall (Professor Emeritus of History, Indiana University), is the story of the American Thirty-Fifth Division during World War I. This military expeditionary force was composed of National Guard units from Missouri and Kansas. Engaging in the battle of the Meuse-Argonne with no previous battle experience and only a minor amount of training, as well as a few weeks of garrisoning in a quiet sector in Alsace, this division and its thousands of men quite literally fell apart in the face of enemy forces in only five days. Historian and academician Robert Ferrall does an impressive work of original scholarship to describe what the problems were (including incompetence officer leadership at the highest levels). The focus upon this single battle offers a &quot;window-in-time&quot; perspective that will prove invaluable for a broader understanding of the difficulties of World War I era frontline combat. Collapse At Meuse-Argonne is a superbly researched and presented body of work that is strongly recommended for both academic library collections and military history buff reading lists."},{"Title":"Collapse at Meuse-Argonne: The Failure of the Missouri-Kansas Division","review":"As indicated in the previous review, Dr. Ferrell's thorough research has resulted in what, up to this point, must be considered the definitive study of 35th Division's administrative ineptness, training shortcomings, and combat operations before and during the Meuse campaign. (It should be noted that this ineptness was widespread in the AEF, and far from isolated within 35th Division.) Anyone interested in the history of the AEF should certainly examine this book. I understand that \\"Collapse at Meuse-Argonne\\" is just a small part of what will be a comprehensive study of the larger Meuse-Argonne campaign, and if the present work is any indication, every student of the First World War should eagerly anticipate eventual publication of the larger account.That being said, there are some shortcomings to \\"Collapse at Meuse-Argonne.\\" The first would be a shortage of maps. Only two are provided, one of northern France showing major rivers and principal population centers, and another showing the portion of the Meuse-Argonne sector in which the division operated, which mainly shows Route Nationale 46, the River Aire, Buanthe Creek, and the principal villages in the area. A smaller-scale map showing 35th Division's sector in the broader context of First Army would have been welcome (from the map provided, one wouldn't know 28th Division was on the left and 91st Division on the right), as would a map showing the principal topographic features in the area, such as Montfaucon and the ravine at Exermont, as well as the local transportation net. A table showing the 35th Division's order of battle and principal officers also would have been helpful.The index is also not as useful as it really should be. For instance, critical geographic locations, such as Varennes, Cheppy, Very, Charpentry, Baulny and Exermont do not appear in the the index at all. References to George Patton are indexed, but tanks are not. This is not insignificant, as at the beginning of the campaign most of the American-operated tanks were assigned to 28th and 35th Divisions in I Corps. (One platoon was assigned to the far left regiment of 91st Division in neighboring V Corps, but they accomplished little.) To those interested, additional references to tanks appear on pages 39-40, 51, 52, 57, 58, 89, 95 and 96. And, although tanks are mentioned in passing in the text, one is left wondering if any of the operational reports submitted by units of the 35th Division discussed the support (or lack of support) provided by the tanks.There are also a few minor errors. One rather niggling error appears on page 39, where Varrennes is cited as the location where Louis XVI was captured in 1796 during his attempt to escape the Revolution (it actually happened in June 1791 - and the unfortunate \\"citizen\\" Louis Capet was beheaded not long after). A bit more substantive is Dr. Ferrell's misidentification of Patton's 1st (later 304th) Tank Brigade as the \\"First Provisional Tank Regiment\\" (28, 37). As in the contemporary British Tank Corps, there were no tank regiments in the AEF. (The plan developed by Patton's superior, the underrated Samuel D. Rockenbach, was to create several tank brigades for the AEF by spring 1919, each brigade to be comprised of two light tank battalions and one heavy tank battalion. Glacial American tank production and the sudden advent of the Armistice prevented the plan from being implemented.)The style of identifying military units is also a bit clunky. Standard practice is to identify divisions by arabic number (e.g., 35th Division), corps by roman numeral (e.g., V Corps), and armies by spelling them out (e.g., First Army). Instead, Dr. Ferrell spells all of them out (e.g. Thirty-fifth Division, Fifth Corps), which makes the text busier than need be, which in turn makes it more difficult to locate citations to particular units within the text.These cavils, however, should not prevent the interested reader from benefiting from Dr. Ferrell's scholarship.

It differs from many popular books on special relativity in two respects: 1. The relativistic effects are presented in the book as absolutely real phenomena, which can't be interpreted or understood as seeming or invented by theorists. 2. The author did his best to explain the mechanisms of relativistic effects, which in most other books are either postulated or derived from Einstein's postulates so formally that a normal reader is plungrd in the ocean of bewilderment with little hope to get out of there.This book is written for those people who are looking for the gist of relativity insted of following the postulates in a blindfolded manner."},{"Title":"Let Me Count the Ways","review":"Dr. Sara comes to New England's Chandler College, recuperating from a broken heart, in a peaceful loving community.

They also point out that a good niche is easily publicized and advertised.To them, a niche is just not a small market. For example, a niche is not just serving a small community... a niche requires a commonality of needs among the customers. So, a niche would be selling to the boat owners in a small town, not selling general products to that small town. Thus, a niche has more easily identifiable customers.The chapters include:1 Niche: What's That?2 Are You a Good Niche or a Bad Niche?3 Finding a Good Niche4 Where there's a trend, there's probably a niche5 Taking Your Niche Online6 Six Steps to evaluating a niche7 Can you find a franchise niche8 How to proect your business idea9 Will you ever get noticed10 Basic steps for opening a niche business11 Go forth and nicheThis should be REQUIRED READING FOR STARTUPS.

I've discovered after reading five books that covered this topic for my book, SmartPartnering.The authors' extensive experience in publishing, and in running niche-based businesses shows.

The main advantage of a niche business is the lack of direct competition.I was first introduced to this concept reading J.J. Luna's books. One of J.J. Luna's own experiences of niche businesses is the alarm company he established in Canary Islands in 1960's. There was virtually no crime in Canary Islands until there was an increase in international trade and the seamen from foreign ships started breaking into jewelry shops and stealing the goods just before their ship left the harbor for high sees. In response to the new need, J.J. Luna ordered some alarm systems from the U.S., analyzed them and developed a system of his own. His company was the only company which can address a specific need.This excellent book by Jennifer Basye Sander and Peter Sander is about the same concept of niche business. It starts with a section describing what niche is and goes on to other chapters about how to discover such a niche idea; how to evaluate if your idea is a good, feasible one. In order to better clarify the meaning of the concept, perhaps it is a good idea to give examples of niche businesses from the book.One of them is the mother who had children with milk allergies. She experimented baking with different ingredients and ended up with a number of recipes which tasted excellent and children with such allergies could eat. When she discovered that there is an interest coming from other people with the same problem, she started a bakery specializing in allergy-safe products. She was, and continuous to be, the only one serving a small section of the public.Another one is the gentleman who wanted to get back to his teenage hobby of riding a unicycle. He discovered that there was nobody around who sells unicycles and it was difficult even to get them through mail order, and there wasn't a large selection. He launched unicyle.com as a side business but in a short time, his business grew big enough to convince him to quit his job at IBM after 23 years. It turns out there was a good number of people who are interested in unicycles, who had the same problems as this gentlemen in finding them. He had discovered a niche market.\\"Niche and Grow Rich\\" goes beyond just describing what a niche business is and how to discover one of your own and evaluating if your idea is a good one. In later chapters, it examines related topics about establishing your company, protecting your idea with trademark laws, considering going online, getting recognition, etc. Many enthusiastic would-be internet entepreneurs might find the \\"taking your niche online\\" chapter interesting. Generally, the book suggests caution and a resistance to the temptation to going online under the assumption that any new idea is sure to make a lot of money on the internet. In fact, it says that internet serves only as a brochure for many businesses and nothing more. In the case of unicycle.com it worked because the needs of unicyclist can't be efficiently served through traditional channels. There simply aren't enough riders for a small bicycle store owner to justify stocking more than one model, if they stock any at all.Overall, this is an excellent book which I can wholeheartedly recommend to anybody."},{"Title":"Niche and Grow Rich","review":"I only gave this book 5 stars for those who are new to business and marketing.

My SCORE clients will probably get something out of it. It's practical, conversational, and very basic.I think if you read this book as advising you to DIFFERENTIATE your business idea from your competition, then you will get a lot more out of it. Creating a true niche business is very difficult, and usually costly, to do. And anyone starting a new business has enough trouble trying to fit into an already established market rather than trying to invent a new one. My understanding of a niche is having your own market.The material covered in this book can be very helpful to anyone who has to analyze their business idea and figure out a way to turn it into a profitable business.

The author has presented a system that is similar to therapeutic touch, pranic healing, reiki, and other healing approaches, while making the system simple and powerful, helping the healer remain centered and empowering everyone to be responsible for their own healing. There are just a few things that could be added to help healers handle very challenging situations and integrate this practice with other natural healing methods.

I have been interested in alternative healing since my youth because they seem to be intermittent in their effectiveness based on either the practitioner and/ or the participant belief systems. As I began to read the book, I was more than just skeptical about a hand on healing approach that only seemed to require intention and deep breathing. The forward written by Dr. C Norman Shealy, M.D., Ph.D impressed me. The book began to take on new meaning as I began to practice the skills presented. Now I must tell you I did not believe any of them were going to work. However, I had almost immediate results with my mother's arthritic knee. I have seen many miracles since that time. The book explains the techniques well so that anyone can understand it. My 13-year-old daughter read the book and with out any input from my wife and I was able to pick up the exercises and do some amazing things among her peers.Further, Mr. Gordon has written a simple chapter on lifestyle and nutritional healing that is very understandable. I no longer doubt and I believe like Dr. Shealy concluded in his forward, \\"Quantum-Touch appears to be the first technique that may truly allow us to all become healers.\\""},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"All the reviews are right (with the exception of one comment in particular).

I disagree with the comment \\"not delluding you into going through any initiations\\" made about Reiki. I'm very sorry to hear that is how that reviewer feels about Reiki. It just happens to be a type of energy that can not be self taught. A person must be attuned by another person for the frequency to pass on. (I do attunements-they're not called initiations-for free if people need them). Seems you had a lot of anger about Reiki probably because you didn't like a price you were quoted. The quantum touch energy system is just as good, only different.All energy modalities are going to have their own \\"fingerprints\\" that make them unique.

Buy icecream instead."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"I have bought many different energy based books, and used different energy based therapies and exercises with great results.This book caught my attention because very positive statements were made about it comparing it favorably with reiki and qigong etc.It is well written, concise and very easy to follow. The exercises are easy to do. If you were to do the visualization, and various simple breathing patterns, you could start moving energy within minutes, and as you practice more and more then your skills will improve dramatically.With the QT exercises I can feel strong sensations throughout my body particularly in my hands and feet, and I am not an expert in this field.QT enables you to generate healing energy through your hands to work on yourself and others.There is a scientific principle called entrainment. If two items are vibrating side by side at different speeds then the item that vibrates at the lower speed will adjust to vibrate at the same frequency as the other object.Examples of this are swings in a playground that are swinging out of sync and adjust. Also, in a clock store you may notice the pendulum clocks of the same size swinging back and forth in unison.This principle applied to QT is that when you apply the higher healing vibration to an area of pain or disease (low vibration) it causes that area to reattune itself to the higher vibration, and thereby cure it.This method I find easier than Qigong for example. I am delighted with the results I am getting. This is the best book of this type I have read so far.I also highly recommend EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique) which is a simple acupressure technique which can be done in less than two minutes. Can you imagine easily letting go of emotional issues such as anger, anxiety, fear, forgiveness, sadness, stress, phobias, procrastination, trauma etc. You can research this further and download a free manual at [...], and buy various EFT books at Amazon. Hope you found this helpful."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"As a nurse-healer, I am always studying the dynamic and often mysterious process of energy-based healing. When I read Quantum-Touch, I knew I had discovered an important key to the process of accessing and directing the subtle energy which we healers use. I quickly put the information into action and feel as if the quality of my healing work has taken a quantum leap. The book is a true joy to read, never complicated, down to earth. I loved this book and after reading it cover to cover, I went out and bought 4 copies to give to my closest friends. I am now rereading it. Richard Gordon is a deeply developed healer with the ability to communicate the process of energy (life-force) science in a beautiful style. I recommend this book to anyone who has interest in developing the art and science of hands on healing."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"Quantum Touch is a must have for any serious energy healer. Being a Reiki Master of Usui I recommend this book to anyone that takes their healing art seriously.For any one who is unfamilar with the life force (prana, chi, etc.) breathing exercises (called Pranayama in India) that increase the prana or life force in ones body during a healing session increases the level of the healing in those being healed... if that makes sense. My point is, the strength and level of the healers energy level is very important to a fast and effective healing. Most reiki healers believe that all you need to do is open the channel to start the flow, I believe the channel needs to be healthy, unblocked, and super charged with life force enrgy.This book is very thorough and covers many areas of healing like distance, animals, emotional healing, group healing, etc.This book is very similar to any other energy healing method but adds to a reiki masters knowledge base. I believe even though many people call their techniques by different names, it is all using the same energy. So do not get confused by names of light, energy healing, pranic healing, or reiki."},{"Title":"Quantum-Touch: The Power to Heal","review":"Quantum-Touch is world-class healing you can learn in a weekend just by reading this book. If you have the opportunity to take a personal hands-on workshop, so much the better. The practical experience is priceless.There was one reviewer on Amazon who asserts that the photos of healing are fake. Nothing could be further from the truth. I took some of the photos that appear on the Quantum-Touch web site, (the ones showing healing scoliosis), and I can say without reservation that the extraordinary healing brought about by Quantum-Touch is nothing short of phenomenal. I have more photos of healing to share which will appear on the Quantum-Touch website as well as my own web site RebuildHealth.com.Anyone who wants to help others will find the Quantum-Touch method to be awesomely powerful, and will find the book a wonderful source of practical information and inspiration. If anything, at 5 stars it is under-rated. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Richard Gordon did not hold back when writing this book. He gives the complete method, clearly explained, and offers many options for creating a powerhouse of healing in your hands. I regard this book as essential reading for all parents and for practitioners of all the healing arts."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],x={key:0},q={key:1};function D(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",H,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",q,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",x,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const F=u(B,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-022556e7"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/25.md","filePath":"glossary/25.md"}'),E={name:"glossary/25.md"},L=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(F)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
