And, I also read it because I consider myself to be a practicing Christian, as in someone who tries to lead a Christian life everyday (not just Sunday!)This sure isn't the Christianity that I believe in, or was taught:. First, the teachings of Jesus are above compassion, empathy and caring. I can't imagine anyone practicing empathy and thinking that hitting someone is \\"Christian\\".. Second, the intrepetration of \\"spare the rod\\" is totally wrong. The \\"rod\\" in the Bible means \\"guidance\\". When it is written: Thy rod and Thy staff will comfort me that certainly doesn't mean \\"hitting me will comfort me\\". This author seems to be distorting the meaning of those teachings for some purpose of his own.It doesn't take a book (other than the good book) to understand what children need to grow to be healthy, productive adults. \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\\" and \\"As you sow so shall ye reap.\\" is pretty good parenting advice.And, \\"do unto others\\"...well, who among us wants to be hit?\\"As you sow\\"...if I sow violence I will reap violence.Very sadly, decent Christians will read this book and hurt their children because some \\"expert\\" is giving them false intrepetrations of the Bible to justify hitting their children.And, sadly, children will not experience God's love through the example of TRULY loving parents."},{"Title":"Dr. James Dobson on Parenting","review":"This book advocates abuse against children.

Or, rather, that they're terrified of them.They're terrified that they won't be able to control and manipulate their kids into becoming people EXACTLY LIKE THEM -- with the same views and attitudes, the same behaviors, the same narrow outlook on the world.And they're right to be worried -- the statistics show that a huge number of kids raised in the kind of narrow evangelistic \\"Christian\\" environment the Dobsons espouse do end up freeing themselves, learning to think for themselves, and eventually striking out on their own. (Not without pain and trauma, of course.)It is not surprising that Dobson and his ilk are particularly scared of what they call the \\"strong-willed\\" child -- who turns out to be a child with tendencies to examines the rules and regulations for himself and think through whether they are, in fact, relevant to any positive outcome. A child who is a \\"rebel.\\"Forget that a great deal of what small social and intellectual progress humankind has attained over the centuries is due to \\"rebels.\\"The whole thrust of the Dobson mindset is to nip such \\"rebelliousness\\" in the bud and substitute conformism, a conformism which will not question the validity of the beliefs he and like-minded adults wish to impose. That way lies fascism."},{"Title":"Dr. James Dobson on Parenting","review":"Why is it that people who are opposed to discipline can't spell?? Check out the other reviews.

My mother referred to it as her \\"bible\\" for how to deal with the daughter she was \\"challenged by God to love.\\" The advocacy of spanking and neck pinching for \\"defiantly willful behavior\\" led to my deep belief that I was a demon with no conscience, as my every behavior that wasnt perfectly societally acceptable was punished. I was punished this way 10-20 times a day most days, and as I got older, nearly all social connection was removed from my life because I refused to conform and began doing hurtful things I didnt even want to do just to express the hurt I felt. Now nearly 10 years of hard work in therapy later I still have intense ptsd and anxiety with anyone who tries to exert authority over me. I was traumatized by these methods of instilling fear to affect behavioral compliance and when backed up by hanging your soul's eternal damnation over your head, Dr. Dobson's message becomes nothing short of evil. The only way to raise loving children is through love. To anyone considering this book, think again. I was \\"difficult\\" not because I wanted to cause problems, but because I was curious and there was a lot I didnt understand. Talk with your kids, find out what theyre thinking, and respect them, so they have a model for respecting you. And never refuse to answer their questions to prove who is in control. No one can control another human being, thats what God gave us Free Will for. But if you respect others, adult or child, and give unconditional love you will receive love and respect in return!"},{"Title":"Dr. James Dobson on Parenting","review":"Read this book first, and then read \\"For your own good: Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the Roots of Violence\\" by Alice Miller. In it she describes what happens when you follow the advice described in \\"The Strong-Willed Child\\". She describes the child-rearing methods in place in Germany at the turn of the last century.The similarities of those methods with the ones described in this book (focus on absolute obedience by use of force) are chilling.I know from my German background the fruits of child-rearing methods that use violent methods to ensure obedience to authority. Especially when coupled with an available scape-goated minority already disliked by a majority of the population.Yes, pain and humiliation will create a child submissive to your authority in the here and now.

It is nothing more than an attempt by a social conservative to convince adults that it is OK to bully children. My readings of the New Testament show that Christ would disagree."},{"Title":"Dr. James Dobson on Parenting","review":"I found this book in the \\"free\\" pile at the local library and now I know why. I knew who Dobson was and I was not a fan, but I read the whole book and gave it a real try, knowing he was a Christian and hoping to find some valuable advice.Leaving the whole \\"hitting\\" issue aside, Dobson's advice could basically be summed up as, take a more firm stance with your strong-willed child and show him/her, firmly and lovingly, who is boss. I don't know if this advice is effective for the average child, but having a truly difficult child, I find it to be ineffective.I had to laugh at one part of this book where he describes the \\"conversation\\" he would have with a troublesome teenage son. He recommends taking the son out to breakfast where he gives an example \\"speech\\" which is several pages long. I just can't believe your average troublesome strong-willed teenage boy is going to sit there politely listening to this long lecture. He'd probably give his Dad the finger and walk-out after the first sentence or two. Actually, later on in the book, Dobson says, to paraphrase, keep this a secret, but actually a parent doesn't have much power over their teenager.He also gives an example of having a hard time getting his daughter to get ready for school in the morning. The way he suggests handling it is by establishing a point system with check-in times, in itself not a bad idea if it were linked to rewards instead of punishment, or rewards in conjunction with punishment if there were more emphasis on the rewards and positive reinforcement than on punishment (having to go to bed either a half hour or hour earlier than normal). However, his sole focus is on punishment. If she does what she's supposed to, she gets nothing. If she doesn't, she gets punished.Instead of this book, I recommend Alan Kazdin's new book (which I am halfway through) \\"The Kazdin Method for Parenting Defiant Children.\\" It is based on actual scientific research of what has proven to be effective and ineffective. Having an actual strong-willed child, I swear to you that punishment alone, long-term, is not effective for changing behavior of a difficult child."},{"Title":"Dr. James Dobson on Parenting","review":"James Dobson hits the nail on the head with this work.

I think it is absolutely ridiculous that you would blame every single one of your problems on the author and your mother.

I'm emotionally stable, healthy, living fear-free, and I'm prospering financially. The same goes for my wife, who was also spanked as a child.You mention that you have no relationship with God... Is that what you're going to tell Him when you're standing before Him someday? That you lived your whole life on this earth and didn't have a relationship with Him because you were spanked as a child? Don't get me wrong, I'm not mad at you and neither is God... but it's time that you take some responsibility for where you are right now. You can't spend the rest of your life blaming others for where you are spiritually, emotionally, and physically. I've known of people who were molested, beaten, raped, abandoned, verbally abused, etc when they were children.. yet they now take total responsibility for where they are in life. They have an awesome relationship with God and with others, and they are now teaching thousands of other people how to live a victorious life.Being spanked as a child is no reason to not love and respect your mother. That's crazy. Being spanked as a child also does not justify all of the conditions and issues that you have mentioned.You are only a decision away from a completely different life. Yes, you must change your thinking. Yes, you must associate with different people. Yes, you must do a lot of other things to change your situation... but it all starts with a decision.

He advocates hitting little children, an idea unfathomable to me. It's absolutely ridiculous that the only individuals it is legal to hit in this country are the smallest ones, the ones least likely to understand what is going on. Even more ridiculous is the fact that this man claims to be a Christian. What he really is is power-hungry, seeing children simply as he can control.I wonder when his book on &quot;How to keep your wife under control&quot; will come out... with advice on following God's word about wives submitting to their husbands, advocating a nice healthy dose of hitting to remind your wife to keep herself in line.Yes, disciplining children is important. But no, no, no - discipline does not mean hitting! That's simply what people do when they don't know how to really discipline. I shudder to think about the children growing up under Dr. Dobson's regime. Our jails are already full of them, but that's not the important part. The important part is, regardless of the eventual outcome, hitting is a lousy thing to do to anyone, especially to someone who can't defend himself and who has no way to leave the situation. And hitting is certainly the worst way to handle the &quot;strong-willed&quot; child, even more than average child.

I'm talking about actively working to fight against what he deems objectionable, things like basic human rights for all people. He is another in the army of radio personalities who reduce complex issues to slogans and blur that pesky distinction we like to make in the U.S. between my rights and your rights. Basically, he hates homosexuals, so they should be irradicated.I'm not especially surprised that he advocates spanking. Intolerant people regularly turn to violence to solve their problems.If you are a thoughtful individual who has stumbled upon this book looking for advice, and you care about finding a way to raise your child without resorting to beating, then please consider the source.

And whoever attempts it even with the best right but without inner constraint proves that he is probably not only strong, but also daring to the point of recklessness. He enters into a labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life brings with it in any case, not the least of which is that no one can see how and where he loses his way, becomes lonely, and is torn piecemeal by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing one like that comes to grief, this happens so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it nor sympathize.&quot;And so it is with Dobson. Dobson is so afraid of a child born independently, that the child may think for himself, that the child may act as a free agent, (and thus, by his very existence show Dobson to be a scam-artist, bully, hypocrite, and fellow traveler of fascists) that Dobson advocates &quot;controlled violence&quot; (with a wink and a nod to the child abuser).Dobson's goal is diametrically opposed to true, authentic healthy human development; it must be for Dobson is at his core driven by greed and hatred, judging from writings such as this tome. However, again as Nietzche points out, all James Dobsons are inevitably doomed to fail. The &quot;good Christians&quot; that result from Dobson's teachings ineveitably are drawn to the seemy section of town, to Dylan's Desolation Row, where there is at least the reaction to the wax-figure Thomas Kinkaide existence that Dobson would cram down the child's throat. Again, quoting Nietzche:&quot;Later, when the young soul, tortured by all kinds of disappointments', finally turns suspiciously against itself, still hot and wild, even in its suspicion and pangs of conscience - how wroth it is with itself now! how it tears itself to pieces, impatiently! how it takes revenge for its long self-delusion, just as if it had been a deliberate blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself with mistrust against one's own feelings; one tortures one's own enthusiasm with doubts; indeed, one experiences even a good conscience as a danger, as if it were a way of wrapping oneself in veils and the exhaustion of subtler honesty - and above all one takes sides, takes sides on principle, against &quot;youth.&quot; Ten years later one comprehends that all this, too - was still youth.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dr. James Dobson on Parenting","review":"Being a child psychologist, I often come across books that propose to give tips on raising strong-willed children and adolescsnts.

Most children don't need to be corrected with spanking (and spanking is NOT abuse if it is done correctly and not in anger). If the new parent follows the popular advice with a strong-willed child, you'll find yourself controlled by your child and your child will grow up thinking there is no right or wrong (sociopath).

Dr. Dobson himself does not recommend spanking until at least age 15 months and then very sparingly. An infant does not understand a spanking. No wonder she is so quiet, she is scared of getting hit. What you are doing is child abuse.That being said, I am not anti-spanking. I have spanked my own children. But this book says to use a switch or belt. It also endorses squeezing a child's neck to inflict pain.

By using a fictional company to illustrate an actual migration, the author has given the book a narrative flow which makes it much more readable. I hope the publishers add more books to the &quot;Gearhead Press&quot; series."},{"Title":"Spring Comes To Chicago","review":"Two years ago, I sat down with this thin book and a bottle of expensive bourbon. I remember becoming aware of my breathing as I read &quot;The Golden Angel Pancake House&quot; and soon, without having touched any liquor yet, my head started to spin. I had forgotten that words could have such power and irresistible momentum. Only Whitman had ever done that for me.The following day, I read &quot;The Bob Hope Poem&quot; in one sitting, pulled along by the language at great speed. The thing is a glorious beast of a poem, a swooping roller coaster that raises your spirits to nose-bleed heights, sends you careening downhill under 5 g's of sadness, and then redeems you with pure happiness. Never mind &quot;I laughed, I cried&quot; - you will gain a new understanding of emotion.That someone can write like this is inspiring and renewing; it reminds us why poetry matters."},{"Title":"Spring Comes To Chicago","review":"While I do not regularly read poetry, I received McGrath's first book &quot;Capitalism&quot; as a gift and have been hooked ever since. &quot;Spring Comes to Chicago&quot; is my favorite of his three. Mcgrath's descriptions of everyday events in the cocoon of his Chicago apartment in winter are delightful. The Bob Hope Poem provides a forum for McGrath's insightful and often amusing obsevations on everything from People magazine to Darwin to squirrels and gourmet pet food. The Pregancy Triptych is fabulous. I highly recommend this book (even to those who never read poetry)."},{"Title":"Spring Comes To Chicago","review":"I will be brief. The Bob Hope Poem made me start writing poetry again. This poem should be read by everyone with a 401K, every business school student, the entirety of Capitol Hill... well, the list is too long. Suffice it to say, this is a great American poem written to every American by a great American poet. Now back to my People magazine."},{"Title":"Spring Comes To Chicago","review":"I must confess two of my opinions concerning Mc Grath's &quot;Spring Comes to Chicago&quot;: 1) it is an often confusing collection of lyrical thoughts and flashy originality, and: 2) it is truly one of the most gorgeous experiments in contemporary poetical forms.I agree with one of the previous reviewers that Mc Grath immediately reminds one of Whitman and Ginsberg, especially in his use of the catalogue-length lines and his often satirical commentary on American life and living. However, he seems to lean more towards Ginsberg than Whitman, for the American Bard has not Mc Grath's and Ginsberg's sense of humor and irony. The title poem (or should I say section?) &quot;Spring Comes to Chicago&quot; is the closest to Ginsberg as this collection gets...the opening lines are especially familar in cadence to the famous lines from Ginsberg's polemic, &quot;Howl.&quot;Nevertheless, while Mc Grath's lines often remind readers of other poets (did everyone catch Williams in there too?), Mc Grath's collage of prose pieces are used in an awe-inspring and masterful way. They are not, as someone noted in a review on his &quot;Road Atlas,&quot; simply journal sketches or a rough blue-print for the spirit of this poem. Instead, they are isolated moments where philosphical, scientific, or literary speculation bring us back to the matters the poem discusses.My favorite device of the entire volume is the what I term &quot;the Squirrel stitch.&quot; Mc grath playfully and sensitively writes his meditations on the habits of these creatures, sewing a few lines here, then there--- almost as if too unite the thought patterns of the poem with a common element of praise and bewilderment.Anyway, enough of my banter. Read this collection for yourself. You will see how clearly it stands out from the muck being written and sold today. Mc Grath should stick to his guns! If he remains true to the voices recorded in the lines of &quot;Spring Comes to Chicago&quot; he is sure to do something more important and amazing in a future collection."},{"Title":"Spring Comes To Chicago","review":"I can't say enough good things about Campbell McGrath's third book of poems. It's nothing short of breathtaking. Really. I think the Bob Hope Poem is the new Howl, the new Song of Myself; it has a little of both in it. It takes on American culture aggressively, intelligently, whimsically, and more interestingly than any other poem I've seen in twenty years. I'm dying to know how McGrath does it, to tell you the truth!I liked it so much that I made it a required book in my intro to poetry writing workshop. I think it's the kind of book that gives writers a sense of what can be done with America still, what kinds of voices we're made of. It's refreshing too that the book doesn't play into that old tired routine of the obscure poet simply playing with words for his or her own amusement while we get to look on passively. Spring Comes To Chicago is much more democratic in its outlook, hopeful, even--dare I say it?--joyful. God knows we need that right about now."},{"Title":"Spring Comes To Chicago","review":"If you love poetry, this book will energize you, and if you are a writer, it will also humble you.

Edited by Dominic DiNapoli, it consists of 21 different chapters, written (or co-authored) by experts on various subjects. These chapter titles suggest some of the issues which are addressed:* Trouble-Spotting: Assessing the Likelihood of a Turnaround* Looming Financial or Business Failure: Fix or File -- A Legal Perspective* Preparing for Bankruptcy: Building the War Chest* The Lawyer's Role in Representing the Distressed Company* The Accountant's Role in the Workout Environment* Dealing with Employee Issues in a Bankruptcy Situation* Mergers and Acquisition Strategies for the Distressed CompanyAt one time or another, all organizations experience serious problems. Many of them eventually recover. The wealth of information and advice provided in this single volume explains HOW. Other organizations, unable to solve their problems, are either liquidated or acquired. This book explains WHY. I know of no other single volume which offers more and better information about workouts and turnarounds, corporate restructuring, and bankruptcy proceedings. This book can be of substantial value to those involved with a distressed organization. It was written primarily for them. However, I think this book can also be of substantial value to those whose organization is (at the moment) thriving and who are determined to sustain that success.

(and if you want more, track down the movie 'paris was a woman.')besides a good puzzle, greenwood gives the reader, in all the books of this series, fascinating australian history, insights into the first world war, the effects on australia of immigration, and changes in social attitudes. this might sound dull, but definitely is not. food and fashion are not neglected. greenwood's range of knowledge is stunning. she writes beautifully, with wonderful turns of phrase.the greatest attraction phryne has for me is this: she is an adult. she does not suffer from adolescent angst, she has worldly wisdom, and moral courage; she is compentent; she is cultured, but never a snob (who usually aren't really all that cultured or well-bred, or they wouldn't be snobs--snobbery is vulgar); she knows that poverty is not a sin, but it's no great honor either and nor is wealth. while greenwood's plots may borrow some of the fantastic elements of mysteries from between the wars, her character is realistic in her approach. even though she is a fictional character (the daughter peter wimsey and philip marlowe might have had), she's a better role model than the real women pushed by the media.but enough of that--this is a great mystery, a wonderful read, buy it right this minute."},{"Title":"Murder in Montparnasse: A Phryne Fisher Mystery","review":"not long after i first read _murder in montparnasse_ (ordered from australia--i love this series so much i paid the postage in the years it was unavailable on this continent), i saw the film \\"paris was a woman.\\" the film included interviews of people who lived in paris in the 20s, and served, among other things, to underscore how well ms. greenwood captures history, whether australian or european. from the stories of family members who fought in the trenches, i can say that she also captures the first world war extremely well.along with the murders, there are an unrelated kidnapping to solve and a domestic crisis, all handled with her usual impressive skill.as in all the thirteen or fourteen titles in this series, the plot is tight, the subplots equally well done (and resolved), the characters well drawn, the dialogue wonderful, the humor varied, the cooking superb, and phyrne fantastic. she is definitely one of the great characters in mystery writing."},{"Title":"Murder in Montparnasse: A Phryne Fisher Mystery","review":"Bert and Cec along with five other Australian soldiers are drinking and having a good time in Paris in 1918 when the seven witnessed a murder. Now a decade later, Bert, Cec and one of the other five Johnnys are concerned that someone is killing them off one at a time. At the inquest, two died allegedly accidentally when Maccie drowned in an irrigation ditch and Conger's van fell on him while he was fixing it. The three mates think otherwise as counter evidence disputes the official findings.The men discuss their belief with Phryne Fisher, renowned for her investigative skills. Phryne's inquiries into the seven and a seemingly unrelated case involving a missing fianc&eacute;e that somehow goes back to 1918 in the Montparnasse section of Paris too also links back to her own past in the same locale at the same time. Regardless of her memories, a murderer is on the loose and must be stopped before anyone else dies.MURDER IN MONTPARNASSE is an exciting historical mystery that brings to life the late 1920s and a perspective from that point back to the end of World War One in Paris. The story line engages the audience due to the star as she plunges deep into the investigation while memories of her own waif lifestyle in 1918 Paris flash through her mind and her personal woes spin somewhat out of control. The support cast either enhances the who-done-it or brings insight into what makes Phryne tick. Phryne has starred in other adventures so that anyone who reads this delightful tale will seek other works starring a wonderful protagonist.\`Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Murder in Montparnasse: A Phryne Fisher Mystery","review":"I really enjoyed the first Phryne Fisher books, but never expected them to get better and better. I enjoy books for escape and also learning. These are great books for both. I am not looking for depressing introspection on the human plight, or following evil villains being evil. Somehow Kerry Greenwood can take us thru the depths of human emotions and experience while observing from just enough of a safe distance to not be caught up in the negatives and become depressed. I think you really need to read many of the earlier books to get a good background of the cast and help put things in perspective. Keep reading them, because they get better and better. The other writer I have found just as entertaining is Alan Bradley and his Flavia DeLuce series. Phyrne is in her late 20's and Flavia is 11, but both are masters of their world. Both are early 20th century mysteries, and both are wildly entertaining and also informative. My only fear is that, having discovered Kerry Greenwood and Alan Bradley, that I might finish their works and be forced to read some less capable writers."},{"Title":"Murder in Montparnasse: A Phryne Fisher Mystery","review":"As any other lover of mysteries I sometimes discover a number of books on my overflowing shelves of the author I never read before. Hence I felt compelled to read at least one of quite a few books written by Ms. Greenwood that I possess.This entertaining novel is pretty hard to pin down. It has the flair of the times long gone, but slightly more free spirited and rounchy. The sleuth in question, Ms Phryne Fisher is a rich young women with unconventional life. She has pots of money, two adopted daughters and Chinese lover. Even in wild 1920's she would be considered a hussy. Somehow she is absolutely revered and respected in society. Money helps...The books is deffinitely not my cup of tea, but it was witty and quick read and I am planning to try another of her books in the near future."},{"Title":"Murder in Montparnasse: A Phryne Fisher Mystery","review":"This is the first Phryne Fisher book I've read (though it is not, as the other reviewer said, the first Phryne Fisher book -- it's the twelfth), and I'm wondering where Phryne has been all my life. Were these books only recently published in the U.S.?She does tend to be a bit too perfect, but she carries it off with such elan, I can't fault her for it. The book is sparkling and witty, with an intriguing plot, colorful secondary characters, and plenty of humor. The detailed descriptions of fancy clothes and food are a little unusual in this genre, but the author (and Phryne) clearly enjoys them so much, I find myself enjoying them too. There is also a dark edge, as we see tiny glimpses of what \\"the prisoner\\" (the kidnapped girl whom Phryne is trying to rescue) is enduring, and as Phryne reluctantly recalls her postwar days in Paris and the man who broke her heart.As soon as I finish this one, I'm off to find the rest."},{"Title":"Murder in Montparnasse: A Phryne Fisher Mystery","review":"If you haven't discovered this engaging series set in 1920s Australia, then you are in for a treat. Upper-crust Phryne Fisher is classy, sexy, intelligent, and just enough over the top to keep readers interested in her sleuthing, romance, and fashion!"},{"Title":"Murder in Montparnasse: A Phryne Fisher Mystery","review":"This light hearted story has a most likable, eccentric, some would say immoral, heroine, Phryne Fisher. Phryne, seemingly awash in wealth, busies herself with investigating various wrongdoings in Australia. Even though the story takes place in Melbourne, Australia, there are numerous flashbacks to memories of Phryne's time in Paris, when she was recovering from her horrifying days as an ambulance driver during World War I. Now in Melbourne, she is attracted to the suspicious murder of Australian men who were soldiers in Paris during the time she was there. The disappearance of a young girl recently arrived from a finishing school in France also arouses her interest.The book's descriptions of once besieged Paris are the most vivid. There are details of the seamy Parisian bohemian life, spiced by the appearance of famous poets, artists, musicians, and general hangers on. At one point the author even lists the items, now artifacts, that Phryne carried when driving her ambulance. This is a city Phryne obviously loved, the city where for the first time in her young life she had found \\"kindness and freedom.\\" It would have helped if we were told how and why Phryne left.The dark side of 1920s Melbourne is brought to light as well, with both police and strong arm types on the take. Phryne's days are further clouded with the upcoming arranged marriage of her sexy lover, Lin Chung. On a brighter side is the Food Reform Movement, with its efforts to teach people to forsake their typical fried food and sauces diet in favor of grains, vegetables, and fish. The Lord Mayor's Ball, a prestigious affair much sought after by Melbourne citizens, also makes an appearance."},{"Title":"Murder in Montparnasse: A Phryne Fisher Mystery","review":"Murder in Montparnasse is the twelfth book in the popular Phryne Fisher series by Australian author, Kerry Greenwood. A request from the French chef/owner of Caf&eacute; Anatole to locate a missing prospective young bride has Phryne thinking back to her time in Paris in 1918. Shortly after, Bert and Cec ask for Phryne&#8217;s help with the suspicious death of two of their mates from the war: they believe others in their group of seven diggers are in danger. Discussion leads Phryne to conclude that they witnessed the murder under a Metro train at Montparnasse of a Parisian artist, Pierre Sarcelle. Coincidentally, Phryne was also in Paris at the time, and had posed for Sarcelle. Memories both good and bad flood in. On top of this, Phryne&#8217;s plan to continue seeing the soon-to-be-married Lin Chung has Mr Butler threatening the unthinkable. This instalment has an arsonist, standover merchants, a cranky father, a ransom note, a car theft gang, lots of French food, some cross-dressing, spiked drinks and a tin of Best Seville Orange Marmalade. Phryne enlists the help of Ruth and Jane in some undercover pursuit, meets Jack Robinson&#8217;s wife Rosie and Lin Chung&#8217;s prospective wife Camillia and foils an eviction. Hugh Collins accidentally solves a crime in Mildura and Jack Robinson makes a daring food choice.

Phryne agrees that there seems to be something odd going on and wonders whether it is linked to something they may have witnessed in Paris.Phryne herself was in Paris at the time but it is part of her life she really doesn't want to recall. Current circumstances force her to confront her fears and deal with the past.Phryne also has two other cases to investigate - various attacks on a French restaurant whose owner refuses to pay protection money and a kidnapped girl who is about to marry the restaurant owner.Phyrne's adopted daughters Jane and Ruth play a part in this story with some very good detective work. I really enjoyed this book and I think it is probably my favourite in the series so far. The plot is complex and interesting and kept me guessing until all was revealed. I also enjoyed the update on Lin Chung's marriage plans and the twist that involves.I thoroughly recommend this series to anyone who likes crime and mystery stories which are a bit different from the norm.

She does no wrong unless you count grating on the reader's nerves.Of the characters, there was far too little friction/interaction between them. Everyone seemed to accept what Phryne said and did we ever find out what happened to Phyrne's servants who wanted to leave because of Phryne's beliefs? They just seemed to disappear at the end.And who names their kid Phyrne?

While directions are clear (quite precise, actually), many of the recipes include a number of ingredients, some of which may be difficult to find. However, those familiar with cooking and buying will find these very manageable. Tonno e fagiolo (Italian tuna and beans) includes a large tuna steak (\\"or two small cans of good quality tuna, about 6 oz. each, drained\\"), olive oil, red onions, fresh garlic, sherry or white wine vinegar, 4 cups of cooked or canned (she does recognize time constraints) flageolet (she informs us these are green, otherwise I know nothing about them from the book) or cannellini beans (or a mixture of the two), fresh basil leaves and small sprigs, sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.Overall, some delicious looking recipes, and some interesting combinations (\\"e.g., Rare beef salad with parsley oil and wasabi mayonnaise). In the beef salad recipe, by the way, she informs us \\"when you serve it, cut slices of beef about 1/2 inch thick: there's nothing worse than mean little paper-thin slices--it always looks as if you bought them at a deli.\\" Well!

However, some of the ingredients you prolly haven't heard of, especially if you're living in America, and even more so if you have little or no cooking experience, (such as myself). Many of the ingredients are hard to find, and could be expensive at that. Because of this factor, and the extensive preparation each recipe takes to make, (you'll even be making some of your own sauces and dressings and dips as well), I would label it advanced. However, the recipes presented are unique, beautiful and fun to to try to make for sure.

Sure there were small portions where Johnny would have an odd \\"flash\\" into something, like the serial killer, or the restauraunt that burnt down... but none of these things were essential to the storyline.It took all of my being to push myself into finishing it only because the show was cancelled without a proper conclusion, so I had to see how the original book ended for some form of closure to the series... which is amazing.I found myself constantly wondering when the point of the story would come but it just dragged along borishly.

The book is certainly darker and grittier, but most importantly, if makes sense. Where the TV show invents a nonsensical character who is part physical therapist and part sidekick, as well as a weird three-way relationship among Smith, his former fiancee, and her new husband; the book is far better written and has none of this. People make sense in this novel.Johnny Smith is a New England schoolteacher, the reluctant recipient of strange visionary powers after he emerges from a car-crash induced coma. He gains a momentary celebrity when he uses these visions to solve crimes and avert disasters. But Smith himself is unhappy, floundering in the question of why he was given such a strange gift/curse. His angst is resolved when he begins to realize that he bears the responsibility to stop a young, charismatic politician who, he sees, will evolve in the coming years into a major force of evil - a new Hitler. Smith faces a set of personal and moral decisions as he grapples with how to deal with this nemesis. \\"The Dead Zone\\" delivers on the promise of all of Stephen King's novels: an entertaining supernatural page turner that can be read in a weekend without unduly challenging a reader. Not great literature, but a great pop novel."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This has got to be one of the best books I've ever read. I really like the way Stephen King wrote this book.

When he wakes up, his legs are broken (through the book, they heal), his girlfriend has married, and he has a psychic power he didn't ask for...My two complaints. 1. The opening that introduces Greg Stillson is CRUEL! Yes, King needed something to characterize him with, but KILLING A POOR DOG? I know you can do better, and less cruel things, to characterize people with. Try a mean-hearted conversation! 2. Why is the book (and part of Johnny's powers) called the Dead Zone? There is no dead people in the Dead Zone part of his powers, just numbers and addresses. It could have been called the Unclear Zone.If you are looking for an intro to King, get this.

I kept wondering where Smith's power would lead him, and that question was answered when Smith shook the hand of politician Greg Stillson. This is where the book starts to lose its power. Smith obviously gets a vision from shaking Stillson's hand, but King doesn't tell us the exact details of the vision. Instead, King describes Stillson's life in every detail even though he provided plenty of characterization earlier in the book for us to already despise Stillson.Once you realize what Smith plans to do, you can guess as to his motivations. After the climax, King ties up loose ends by revealing the letters John wrote to his dad and to Sarah before the final climax occurred.Sarah and Johnny put an end to their relationship in a morally questionable way yet highly understandable. Throughout the book, King hints that Johnny's gift may be from God. King never really finishes that line of thought, but it does make the reader think that Johnny could live with his actions knowing he was sacrificing himself for the greater good. This is a great book except for about 40 pages that are devoted to Stillson, a character we already know enough about."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This book was GREAT! Really made me think, and that's what I look for in novels. The same goes for The Dark Half, The Tommyknockers, and Insomnia."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Usually, I have a problem putting a Stephen King novel down but with the &quot;Dead Zone&quot;, I wasn't as inthralled with it as I usually am with his books. The storyline is good but it wasn't as entertaining as most of his other books."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"to be honest i only saw the movie. but it was good and i am contemplating going through the book. It wasn't that the guy had abnormal powers that inticed me, alot of his book sare about paranormal powers. like most horror writers. what was fascinating was how king, probably intentionally, portrayed stillson as the hitler of today. he was heavily pro nationalistic, a great orator, started small and worked his way up the ranks, and was very violent. I can't say that the plot was extremely fascinating, its typical king. good, but i guess writing horror is hard when you are the no. 1 guy. with all the pressure to be perfect. but, take a look at the movie, and the book. Maybe king was trying to tell us something about ourselves. About how we would support a new hitler, a new narcissistic, violent, mass murderer. Who was a great orator, kissed babies, had his goons take care of his enemies, set his enemies up. I think king had a message beyond just anohter book. That we need to watch ourselves. That evil changes texture as political correctness changes. Hitler would never make it in todays world, but stillson would. But both were the same. Narcissistic mass murderers who were really great oraters. think about it."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone tells the story of John Smith. It is not coincidence that King used the most generic name for a white male living in America. Smith is the epitome of a guy who just wants to live an ordinary life as a schoolteacher. He has a nice girlfriend that he wants to marry and is an all around good guy. The way the book is constructed, it's pretty clear that there were two possible fates for him. One is to live this nice normal life of love and happiness. This is the one he should have had by all rights. And then there is the fate that is forced upon him when a car accident sends him into a coma that lasts more than four years. When he wakes up, he discovers a \\"gift\\" that allows him to see into other people's future and past when he touches them or even objects that they have been in contact with. This ability, along with the years he lost, costs Smith everything he wanted in life. I won't give away any more of the plot, but he is forced to make some very difficult choices that cost him dearly.The Dead Zone features what may be the most likeable character Stephen King has ever created in John Smith. He is humble, self-effacing, funny, and a genuinely nice man. As the life he was trying to build is stripped from him, as he is pushed further and further down a road he never wanted to travel, the reader can't help but feel enormous sympathy for him. The relationship between he and the girlfriend is both vivid and poignant. There are several other characters that are enjoyable to read ranging from John's father to the villain of the piece, Greg Stillson. The story is well constructed and moves along at steady pace.I've read a number of Stephen King's novels over the years and this is my favorite. It packs an emotional punch that few books of any genre have matched. It's more of a character study than a white-knuckle roller coaster ride, but what it may lack in pure horror it more than makes up for in other respects. This is a book that showcases the author's talent and I would recommend it to all."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"After having surgery and nearly losing my life I somehow managed to get my hands upon this book.(this was the second book I read after surgery)I became one with the main character in the story and as he recovered I recovered from a parallel point of view...looking back now at the time I read this book,almost two years ago,it does bring back memories,not just my painful memories,but the ones written in the story.At one point in time the pain in the book or more accurately Johnny's pain was the same as mine.That is how great the story is...it has that power over the reader...Anyway,enough about me,the basic thing about the story is this,actually I would be lying if I said that,but for simplicity sake I have to put it this way...After having an accident and recoving from a coma,Johnny was left with the ability to know things from a psychic's point of view.This story is not simply about that however,with the coma he has lost alot,though five years might not seem alot,but he did.The story deals with more than one characters and makes their information known well.This book has so many things about it that it is difficult for me to explain,for me to do that would mean for me to write down the whole book for you!But I leave you with this,The book is great,and I highly recommend it,the ending is sad though,but promising...at some times in the story I forgot about reality and started to live in the book,which seemed like reality to me.Putting things together in this book can remind us of how SK takes everyday situation and magnify them for us to see them for what they really are...This book is not too long,so you wouldn't get bored reading it,everything is perfect in this book,I have no complains...enjoy...Nigel.I have specially included this \\"clipping\\" from the internet,to help you to understand the story a little better and to help you to make a good decision about buying the book...Here goes...(Taken from wikipedia)\\"The Dead Zone tells the story of Johnny Smith, a small-town high school teacher from Castle Rock, Maine who is tragically injured in a car accident that leaves him in a coma for almost five years. When he recovers, he is heartbroken to learn that the world has moved on without him. His girlfriend, Sarah, has married another man and has a child, his mother has succumbed to religious mania, and Johnny sustained brain damage. The damaged part of Johnny's brain, his \\"dead zone\\", is somehow connected to his capacity for visualization, as well as processing addresses and numbers. As though to compensate, his brain activated a long-dormant part of the mind relating to how humanity processes touch, resulting in the psychic ability to touch certain people and objects and experience visions of the past, present, and, most frequently, the future. Because of his \\"dead zone\\", parts of each vision remain unclear to Johnny, forcing him to figure out certain things as he goes along. The full extent of what he must do, or whatever tragedy he must try to avert, is seldom clear to Johnny.Johnny uses his newfound ability to save a young girl's life, help Castle Rock sheriff George Bannerman identify serial killer Frank Dodd, and save several teenagers from a disastrous fire. Despite his heroism, Johnny considers his power a curse rather than a gift and is loathe to use it, longing for his old life. At a political rally, Johnny shakes hands with Greg Stillson, a popular but unconventional Congressional candidate from New Hampshire. Johnny sees a vision of Stillson being sworn in as President many years in the future, and of apocalyptic devastation so terrible and complete that he feels compelled to prevent Stillson's rise to power at any cost.Johnny learns that he is dying of a brain tumor caused by his coma, and is forced to take desperate action. He tries to assassinate Stillson before his vision can come true, but the attempt fails. At the crucial moment, Johnny is unable to fire his gun; his in-built refusal to kill is too strong. When the bullets begin fly, Stillson attempts to use a small boy as a human shield, and a news photograph of the candidate cowering behind a child ruins his political career.\\"Thanks..........enjoy...............Nigel."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone is quite possibly Stephen King's most moving work. Only a short way into this novel, written early in his career, the kind of sentimental and sympathetic characterizations that King would later use to great effect in the Green Mile and Hearts in Atlantis is easily apparent. In fact, he very likely succeeds better with this work than in the latter two.One thing to keep in mind if you're planning to start on this book (and I highly suggest you do so, the characters are the most real and heartbreaking that you're likely to find in a King novel) is that it is not horror and it is, in the end, an account of the life and times of Johnny Smith.To my mind, this entire story is a study for loss and the terrible, painful, necessary trait we humans have of moving on, forgetting those we have lost and... replacing them. Johnny experiences this first hand, and much of the story revolves around his attempts at reintigrating himself into a world that kept going without him and couldn't care less if he lived or died.Many are annoyed by the subplots in the story or by the rather brief resolution of the Greg Stillson story thread. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the entire Greg Stillson \\"problem\\" was placed in the story simply to aid Johnny in coming to his final, inevitable conclusion to the answer of what to do with his new, nearly empty life. Could there be any other outcome? Stillson is almost a deus ex machina in what he ultimately provides for Johnny.In the end, this is one of King's best novels. The reader can easily see themselves in Smith's shoes and can experience through him the realization of fears we all have: of being forgotten, of having the world pass us by."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I picked up The Dead Zone right after trudging through Elmore Leonard's Get Shorty. Within minutes, I knew that The Dead Zone was a far better book. My favorite thing about this book and for the most part, other Stephen King books is his ability to craft real, well-rounded characters. Johnny Smith, the hero, recieves a gift he doesn't want or enjoy, the gift of second sight. He learns to live with this gift and try to help those around him. However, he is shunned. As you read this book you will feel Johnny's pain and suffer with him as he is slighted by almost everyone who is important to him. You will fell the loss he feels as he tries to move on with his life. One of the best Stephen King books by far."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I'll never forget the first time or the tenth time I read this book. It is a true classic, a wonderful saga of human emotion, compassion, and sadness. Stephen King possesses a unique gift of touching the soft, warm places of humanity, while paralleling the dark and less attractive, deceptive sides. This book grips you from the very beginning, and you will find any other activity, other than reading, an annoyance. Johnny pulls at you in so many ways and leaves an indeliable mark on your psyche and soul. TRUE GENIUS!!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This book is an excellent book, its for everyone. Throughout it you will be mesmorized by Kings words, and it will seems as if you were in the story. King paints a beutiful picture in your mind throughout the whole story. At the begging of the book, when Greg Stillson assaults that dog, King actually makes you beggin to despise him in every way - even if your not that much of an animal lover. Kings way of writing is just marvellous. I have read all of his books up to date. And by far if there is any book of his you should read first, it would have to be The Dead Zone. -- Then maybe settle it with a little Carrie, and then some Salems Lot.So overall, a fan of reading, or not would enjoy this book. And would soon find themselves picking some of Kings other titles aswell."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I found this to be a haunting and sad story-- a love story. John Smith has met the love of his life, and is probably on the verge of tying the knot with her. His life is interrupted by a terrible auto accident that leaves him in a coma for 8 years. When he comes out of the coma, his girl is married to someone else, and the world has moved on without him. And when he awakes he has a powerful psychic ability to see the future, evidently triggered by the accident, and activated by touch.John Smith tries to adapt to his new life and his new power. The rest would be telling. However, it is fair to say that the book moves at a pretty good pace, with a decent storyline and good prose. This isn't one of those King novels that gets bogged down with far-out stuff--it is rooted essentially in reality except for Smith's psychic power. Even that is presented in a pretty believable way, not wildly different from the documented ability of psychic Peter Hurkos.This is my favorite King novel. I found it to be believable, moving, and upsetting. And a ripping good read."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I have heard this book described as &quot;scary&quot; or &quot;terrifying,&quot; or whatever other adjective you can use to describe the feeling that makes you sleep with the lights on because it makes you feel more safe. Well, it's not really scary. But, it is an excellent story. It follows the lives of two men who are destined to have an encounter that will change both of them forever. John Smith or &quot;Johnny&quot; is the protagonist and his nemesis is Greg Stillson. After having an incredible run of luck at a state fair gambling table Johnny Smith has to take his girlfriend &quot;Sarah&quot; home because she ate a bad hot dog. After seeing her to bed he takes a cab home and they get in an accident because of some drag-racing teenagers. The cab driver dies and Johnny is left in a coma...for nearly five years. After he wakes up alot has changed, his girlfriend Sarah is now married, Watergate, and other things. He has also changed. His psychic feeling has become stronger in that he can see into people's lives and into their futures by simply touching them. This gift is a blessing and also a curse because it makes him feel that he has a duty once he knows the future of someone. Greg Stillson is an ambitious politician who's &quot;apt to be president.&quot; The reader sees that he is not the most kind man in the prologue when the then 22 year-old has a revealing encounter with a farm dog in Iowa. These two characters' fates are intrinsically entwined with each others'. I really could not find any thing in this book that could be described as a fault or a weakness. The characters are interesting and the story is paced exactly right. King also raises some philosophical questions about whether or not to change the future if you could. In the end a gift such as Johnny's is so powerful and extraordinary that it ends up being a curse."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This book is probably the forth or fifth book that I've read from Stephen King. This book was more of a thriller than a horror book. It talks about a man who can see into people's lives by just touching their hands. He recieves this power after being in a coma for four years. This book really grabs you and keeps your attention for the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I am a huge fan of Stephen King, and The Dead Zone is indeed a wonderful novel. It is especially good for those who want a taste of King's excellent story-telling without the blood and guts and monsters (also try The Green Mile and Different Seasons).Somehow it fails to ascend quite to the heights of my absolute favorite King novels (The Stand, and [believe it or not] Wizard and Glass, among others). Maybe I like the ultra-bizarre, perhaps I found the pacing a bit off, maybe I just have bad taste... For whatever reason, the Dead Zone joins the ranks of the second most adored group of King novels I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I think I would probably put this up as my favorite of all King's books. It has one of the most memorable characters, John Smith, and one of the most intriguing plots.From Johnny's childhood skating accident through the end of the book, we are completely hooked by this character and what is happening to him. If you liked The Dark Half, you will certainly like the Dead Zone. Both feature essentially good people that we find ourselves really liking, but that become the central focus of the evil as well, thrown into situations that they have no control over.But one thing that makes the Dead Zone so compelling is the central question that comes...would you sacrifice your own life to save the rest of the world? Johnny's torment is very real because it is so very human. No one can easily walk into the fire, and we'd all like to think that when push comes to shove, we would make the right decision. I loved the fact, though, that even the way things are resolved sort of takes you by surprise. No easy answers or simple solutions in the end, Johnny is above all just an average man who tried his best to do right.Everything in this book is done just right, from John's relationships with other people, his reactions to his *power*, the development of the essential conflict, the final courtroom transcript to tie up loose ends. Wonderfully written, this will always have a spot on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I read this back in high school but I still remember it in great detail. King is at his best when he paints a portrait of everyday life and adds a dose of the uncanny. These characters are believable and you like Johnny and his girl at the beginning immediately. Moreover, everytime one of these great &quot;populist&quot; politicians appear on the radar screen (you know who they are!) I think of the Greg Stillson character....Is this novel prophetic?"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone is the book I would recommend to anyone who has never read a book by Stephen King because they think, &quot;he's too scary&quot; This book was written during the four or five years that King put out his best work...Salems lot, The Shining, The Stand. All are beyond classic but the Dead Zone is one of the more interesting ones in that the reader really gets to love Johnny Smith and is pulled in and totally encapsulated by the story."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone-the name in itself evokes sentiments of loss, fear, downfall and most of all-Death. Set against the backdrop of 70's politics, Stephen King explores the life of the main character, John Smith, an easygoing, quite unassuming guy who spends four and a half years in a coma. He recovers, quite unexpectedly, only to realize that he has been gifted with the power to perceive the secret thoughts and deeds of men, and at the same time predict future events. On touching people he receives abrupt 'flashes', sensing things known only to themselves. He predicts the outcome of events in the lives of people into which he comes into contact and sometimes saves them from unknown danger. Johnny is intelligent, a former high school teacher actually, yet he possesses an appealing naivete, a simple, almost unpretentious nature that draws, maybe magnetizes the reader. This also proves to be potently dangerous. Already people have started to view him as a freak, a horrifying abnormality who can eerily sense things that exceed ordinary and rational reasoning. As one person remarked he was no better than a 'two-headed cow he had once seen in the Carnival.' The story resonates with sadness and forever reminds us of Johnny's plight. His feelings of despair, heartbreak over his lost true love Sarah, self-pity and most of all self-hate. Ultimately, he wishes himself dead. The story is intensely tragic, a replica of heart- rending sorrow. The main character is, in a sense, pathetic, and very likeable. The climax dwells largely on political aspects of that era, as Johnny seeks to save America, possibly the world, from a political misfit, who, if he is elected president, signals impending doom. The name in itself 'The Dead Zone' refers to a part of Johnny's brain that was irrepairably damaged during the accident. As a result, he is unable to 'see' certain things because the dead zone blocks them out. In a way, it plays a seemingly insignificant part in the novel since it, in no way impairs his judgement and if it does, it is only to a very small degree. Perhaps, it is an allusion to the book as a whole, in the sense that Johnny's life is irreversibly changed since he no longer lives an ordinary life. He is more like a living dead. An exceptionally touching novel, a definite tear-raiser. SIMPLY STEPHEN KING'S BEST!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I am thirteen yeras old and i am an avid Stephen King fan.

Whenever he touches someone, he sees there future. The sherrif comes to him for help in catching a serial killer, and one day he shakes hands with a politician at a political rally, and sees the horrible future involving the politician.

When he comes across Gregory Stillson, a politician, he knows what he must ultimately do.This book is a great read, and I highly suggest getting it.

He takes in the common ideas of a car accident, a psychic, and a coma and turns it into a suspenseful story. It begins with Johnny Smith, a young man who loses the prime of his life to some wild teens. As the story unfolds, Stephen King will capture your breath and thoughts. The way he makes this story seem so believable is quite remarkable. The subplots are guaranteed to keep you at the edge of your chair. The suspense delivered by this book is one unlike anyother. It shows a different side of Stephen King. It shows that not all his books are of the unthinkable, but rather this book shows the true creativeness of Stephen King. Only Stephen King can make an everyday occurrence seem remarkable, as you will see as you are unable to put this spellbinding book down. Its resemblence to reality will make you wonder, &quot;Is this actually a true story?&quot; I was very impressed with the way this book was written. The description and detail made me feel like i was there to witness the talents of Johnny Smith. The nature of people also captivated my attention, as when Stephen King portrayed the persistent news reporters. We all know how they crowd the space of the famous, but Stephen King tells of the complexity of being famous, how it may actually feel. Another example is how he shows the heartbreak to see your child in a coma, the pain and agony that people go through. Overall, I was most impressed by the way this book could have been a true story. A few parts may make you think otherwise, but who is to say what is reality. Whether or not it is, this book still recieves praise from me as I rate it fairly high."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone is worth reading even if you are not a Stephen King fan.

Johnny a poor soul that longs for his once normal life before his coma of over 4 years is plagued by fierce headaches and visions of people's future. S. King is my Jesus and I read his books like the Bible. The Dead Zone is an enthralling tale of lies, decite, and a spite of terror, but the only way to get a taste of this is to read the book for yourself. -Bonappetit."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I can see why some people would have been a little put off by The Dead Zone when it came out. King was coming off an epic, The Stand, which followed the extremely successful horror novels Salem's Lot and The Shining, not to mention Carrie (which I see as more of a drama/thriller than horror). So here comes this short little political sci-fi novel about a psychic who can foresee danger. King had actually hinted at leaning towards corrupt government themes in the first half of The Stand, so the business about Greg Stillson and the deadly possibility of a man like him coming to power isn't so surprising. But at that time I don't how many fans were aware of his great affinity for old sci-fi movies and comics, so the lack of supernatural ghosts or monsters may have been somewhat of a let-down. Hindsight has shown that King was at his most visionary when imagining the future of politics and government, as so many elements of The Stand, The Dead Zone, and Firestarter now seem way too plausible in today's world. In fact, King has stated recently that a current popular politician reminds him eerily of Stillson, but I'll leave that for anyone interested to look up for themselves. The only thing that keeps The Dead Zone from being a five-star book is that the plot is a bit too loose. It reminds me a lot of King's Bachman book, Roadwork, in the way the main character seems to drift through a series of random events until coming to a realization of how he wants to finish his life and leave his mark on the world. If you can stick with King through some of the subplots, you'll enjoy a highly relevant look at the control powerful leaders have over shaping world history, and the far-reaching consequences of evil men attaining that control."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This is Stephen King at his usual high quality writing.Anything he writes is a pleasure for me in style, story, characterization; all around enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"There are already so many reviews that give King his credit with this classic. All I have to say is that its even better than original movie. Even as Christopher Walken, one of my favorites, is in the movie. King is the King of storytelling."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The first thing I want to say is that the story is very good. It is clever and keeps you wondering what happens next. King is a great writer and really paints a clear picture of every scene. At times, I found that I couldn't put this book down, as I wondered what would happen next. Unfortunately, the story does get pretty slow around halfway through it. Some scenes get drawn out way longer than they should be, and King's use of repeating sentences gets very annoying after the first few chapters. Plus, random and unnecessary political comments fill the book. They don't really matter to the story, it is just King trying feed us his point of view on Vietnam and whatnot. All this aside, the story still is good and a Stephen King fan would defiantly like this."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Stephen King's The Dead Zone is a classic tale.

Per usual with SK, there could've been some trimming done, but we fans don't much care about that snark anymore, do we? I know I'm over it. Without the extra fat, I'm not sure it'd be a Stephen King book anyway. The extra fat that coulda-shoulda-woulda been trimmed out of any debut writer's book, especially today, it burrows in and goes to work on you, in the end, enriching the tale though it may slow it down or make you sigh a bit in the reading. The terror here was in the mood, the suspense building and percolating, that modern, ungothic horror hiding right there in plain sight, in the daylight given a surreal cast, that scrim between real and unreal that SK invented.

So here comes this short little political sci-fi novel about a psychic who can foresee danger. King had actually hinted at leaning towards corrupt government themes in the first half of The Stand, so the business about Greg Stillson and the deadly possibility of a man like him coming to power isn't so surprising. But at that time I don't how many fans were aware of his great affinity for old sci-fi movies and comics, so the lack of supernatural ghosts or monsters may have been somewhat of a let-down. Hindsight has shown that King was at his most visionary when imagining the future of politics and government, as so many elements of The Stand, The Dead Zone, and Firestarter now seem way too plausible in today's world. In fact, King has stated recently that a current popular politician reminds him eerily of Stillson, but I'll leave that for anyone interested to look up for themselves. The only thing that keeps The Dead Zone from being a five-star book is that the plot is a bit too loose. It reminds me a lot of King's Bachman book, Roadwork, in the way the main character seems to drift through a series of random events until coming to a realization of how he wants to finish his life and leave his mark on the world. If you can stick with King through some of the subplots, you'll enjoy a highly relevant look at the control powerful leaders have over shaping world history, and the far-reaching consequences of evil men attaining that control."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I was a big fan of The Dead Zone tv show starring Anthony Michael Hall and couldn't help comparing the book to the show as I read. Knowing pretty much what to expect from having watched the show, the book had less of an impact than it would have if I had gone into the reading without any expectations.The television show made some, mostly minor, changes in the interest of being able to produce the show long term. I personally liked their changes better than the book itself. Walt's role in the book is tiny and he isn't even the sheriff. Johnny never impregnated Sarah, so there was no JJ. And the Greg Stillson story line, my least favorite aspect of the show, ended up being a major part of the book.Read today, The Dead Zone loses a lot of its scare potential. It's horror, but it isn't particularly traumatic. It felt a lot more like a paranormal thriller, with Johnny's psychic ability and the race to prevent a Stillson caused armageddon. More than anything else, Stephen King has the ability to really flesh out his characters, making them and not the horror the true focal point of his books. The Dead Zone features a lot of inner struggle and moral dilemma, mostly from Johnny and Sarah, but stretching beyond to Johnny's parents and Sheriff Not-Walt Bannerman.The Dead Zone isn't horrific or gory. It is thrilling and psychological in nature. It's not the best of Stephen King's works, but it is a solid King classic."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"While on a date at a carnival in Maine in late October of 1970, high school teacher Johnny Smith, barely a year out of college, engages in inexplicable (that childhood head injury long since forgotten), unbelievably lucky behavior at a roulette wheel. Later that night, he becomes comatose as a result of injuries sustained during an accident. When he eventually awakens, his ability to \\"see\\" things about persons he touches becomes more apparent. While some seek the services of this reclusive, unassuming guy, others are skeptical of his second sightedness. In spite of mental and physical setbacks, Johnny uses his power for the common good, saving lives, and even getting involved (reluctantly) in a criminal investigation. At a certain point, he determines that a particular person is a very bad man, and, seeing what the future holds, sets out to stop him. As expected, King comes up with a very scary, very original story, one I'd considered (until rereading it recently) a favorite. Interestingly, what seemed to me to be great entertainment when I read it as a twenty-something single person doesn't set as well with me as a forty-something parent. King's scary storytelling (e.g., the snot beat out of the dog near the start, a murder victim, the murderer) is a bit too much for a parental pantywaist like me, and is definitely more graphic than I'd remembered. As to my future as a Stephen King fan, give it to me in small doses please. On that note, I'd recommend instead: Night Shift, Different Seasons, or Skeleton Crew by Stephen King and The Halloween Tree or Something Wicked This Way Comes by Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"For those of us who appreciate the more literary novels King has written (e.g. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon), this is one of the best. There's tight, controlled writing; consistent characterizations; believability; and plenty of literary allusions for those of us who enjoy them. And not too many superfluous characters.Some people might be put off by the political subplot, but it's interesting to me how it presages the political strands in Under the Dome, not to mention the Tea Party movement!This is about the 20th King novel I've read, and I would rank it easily within his top 5."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Despite being a book of fiction, about a paranormal occurence unlikely to be found in real life, Dead Zone almost made me believe that this was a story about a real person. The main character's description is incredibly rich, and the sympathy that S. King evokes for him makes one yearn for a happy ending. It was one of the very, very few fictional books that ever made me cry. Not only is it an engrossing, thrilling, and a beautifully written drama, but it also asks some interesting moral questions. Dead Zone made me a fan of S. King and though I think some of his other books are even better written, i.e. &quot;The Eyes of the Dragon,&quot; &quot;The Dark Tower,&quot; it remains my most favorite, still."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I admit I haven't read many of King's books yet but this one got a little unrealistic towards the end. I mean who would vote for a guy with people riding Harley's around him?? It wasn't that bad, but the movie was much better."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Stephen King should have stuck with e.s.p. thrillers, because Carrie and The Dead Zone are really his only memorable works.If you hate Stephen King, read this...it will remind you that he can spin a good yarn, or he could before he sold out anyway."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This is the very first stephen king book I had ever read, mostly because it was the only one in my school library.

But that's ok now, i love the plot and in a way i like how it ended. I'm not giving anything away, you have to read it yourself. This was really good, and since then i have decided to obtain every single one of Mr. King's books."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I must have read this book 6 or 7 times and I still enjoy it and find new themes each time I re-read. It will not be loved by those who are addicted to the horror/weird aspects of Stephen King's books. However, it is a masterful psychological 'thriller' in the development of the plot and the main characters, with excellent insights, too, into modern life and some of it's conundrums and misunderstandings. The minor characters, such as the Vietnamese gardener, are also well developed and offer interesting and thought-provoking insights. John Smith suffers a head injury in a car crash and lies in hospital in a coma for years. Upon awakening, he can accurately 'predict' events for individual people after touching them. Not unnaturally, this causes him pain and 'agnst' and notoriety. I can't go into much detail without giving away the story, but his pursuit of one individual leads him to difficult and ultimately agonizing decsisions. I consider this novel King's 'tour de force' and would recommend it to those who enjoy suspense and the study of the human psyche - you will enjoy. (And if you can't put ti down - don't blame me - you are warned!)"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This isn't Stphen King's usual story. This is not a story of pure suspunse filled horror.

This book dealt with the famous religious fanatics, politics, and supernatural occurences most Stephen King novels deal with. However, all these things happened to the most ordinary of people...John Smith(no middle intitial). It was great how the book led you right into the action, and waited for you to catch up while Johny lay in his coma, preparing you for the unforgettable rest of the book.

After you read the book see the movie with Christopher Walken playing Johnny. After seeing the movie try to catch the rerun of the Saturday Night Live routine that Walken performs"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Whether you are a first time Stephen King reader or a die hard fan (like myself), this book will soon become one of your favorites. In the Dead Zone, King proves that he is a master storyteller rather than just a &quot;horror&quot; writer. The saga of John Smith will captivate and move you to the extent that you are transported to his world, his *mind*. The Dead Zone is an excellent book for current King fans to share with their friends, their families, even their teenaged children. I highly recommend this amazing work"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"One of the most absorbing boks I've ever read, Stephen King's The Dead Zone is sure to please almost any reader. King keeps the reader turning the pages during this book. I read it in roughly two days, and for someone like me, who usually doesn't read unless it's required, that was quite a short time to read a book of this length. During most of my free time, I found myself picking up the book and continuing to read. King creates impressive characters to whom you soon feel yourself attached. The protagonist, Johnny Smith, was one of those characters that I began to appreciate and enjoy learning of his next action. The plot is most intriguing. Though it would be doubtful that the novel's events would occur in real life, I found it so interesting that I just had to keep reading. I spoke with my teacher about the book, and she decided to read it. Several days later, she said she finished it and said she believed it to be the best book Stephen King has written. I haven't read all of his books, nor have I read that many books, but I enjoyed this book and was able to actually finish it, unlike other books I've given a weak attempt at reading. I believe anyone would enjoy reading this book."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"When Stephen King has a great idea, he does not squander it. Many writers have tackled the concept of precognition, but few have done is so masterfully. \\"The Dead Zone\\" is full of thrills, mayhem and wow moments while King is still getting warmed up.When Johnny Smith wakes up from a five year coma, he is endowed with the gift of second sight. By touching another person or a simple item, he is treated to the vision of a future event. The sky is the limit with such a concept, and King does not leave any piece of that sky unexplored.Before the midway point of the book, Johnny is saving people from house fires, reuniting a mother and son, and steering youngsters away from a horrible skating accident that has not happened yet. A reader has his money's worth before this novel is half done. Each character is vivid and dynamic, particularly those of Smith and a certain politician named Greg Stinson.The second half of the novel is no less exciting but profoundly more significant as the story unfolds. Tampering with the future is an endeavor fraught with peril, as any fan of physics can tell you. Johnny is confronted by such a challenge, forced to choose between accepting the fate of the world or embracing his gift and using it to change the future. There is a serial killer to sniff out, and even that is not as vital as his next step, which involves a truly demented man who will one day be president.The finally act of the book can be summarized by the question: \\"If you could go back and time, knowing what you know about Adolph Hitler, would you kill him?\\"It's a fun question to ask at parties. For John Smith and his dubious, extrasensory abilitiy, it's one big cross to bear.\\"The Dead Zone\\" is one of those books that will be studied for generations. But forget the acadamia for now. It's a must read novel for fans of almost any genre, and a perfect choice for those rare birds who need an introduction to Stephen King."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"There are always those who do not want to read Stephen King because they simply do not like horror novels. They do not want to read about killer cars or killer clowns, vampires or the walking dead, or any of that fun stuff that many of us absorb like candy on Halloween night. Fortunately, King does right other tales from time to time, which, ironically, tend to get their names changed when they are made into major motion pictures that refrain from prominently mentioning the authors name in their television commercials (which, of course, is how we know when it is a &quot;good&quot; movie of a Stephen King story). Of all those &quot;safe&quot; Stephen King books (relatively speaking), &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; has the virtue of still being fairly representative of King's entire body of work. That is why when people shy away from reading his work, I insist that &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; is the Stephen King book for people who do not want to read Stephen King.Like King's epic &quot;The Stand,&quot; the story of Johnny Smith takes as its genesis the idea of &quot;not the potter, but the potter's clay.&quot; Johnny Smith is just a young school teacher out on a date with Sarah Hazlett at the cheap carnival that has come to town. Things are going well for the couple when they stop to play the wheel of fortune and Johnny predicts the number that is going to up next, time and time again. The experience upsets Sarah, but things go from bad to worse: on the way home Johnny's cab is in a horrible accident and he goes into a coma. When he comes out of it five years later he discovers the world has changed: Nixon has resigned, Sarah has married someone else and there are strange new devices called Flair pens. But Johnny has changed too. Now when he touches somebody he can tell them things, such as where they lost their wedding ring, that their kitchen is on fire, that their long lost mother is alive and well. Johnny Smith is an ordinary man with an amazing gift that terrifies not only others but himself. Certainly, this is an engaging premise: if you were a mind reader what would you do?But what makes this one of King's best novels is that he ups the ante for his reluctant hero. At a chance meeting during the New Hampshire primary Johnny shakes hands with Greg Stillson, a political thug who is running a low brow populist campaign. In that moment Johnny knows, he absolutely KNOWS that Stillson is going to become President of the United States and start a nuclear war. &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; now becomes about the fact that with great power comes great responsibility as Johnny has to convince himself not only that he should act, but that doing so would be any good. The narrative/argumentative structure of this novel is one of King's best as events concerning Johnny's power lead him step by step to his fate. This is a compelling tale, well told (with the exception of an unnecessary mention of &quot;Carrie&quot;), and more than adequate evidence of why King is one of the best selling authors on the planet."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This is not the favorite book of most Stephen King fans. I know. I know. They all like THE STAND or, more recently, THE GREEN MILE. Those books are great, too, but I'm lobbying for my quiet favorite, the book I keep coming back to, the one that is not even horror in the truest sense. More than anything it's freshman-comp-one-in-class-essay-time philosophical: what if you had the power to see the future, would you kill a madman before he started World War 3? The character development and subplots in this book are so good, one has to forgive King for naively over-simplifying the answer to the question as posed. Yes, kill the madman, is his answer. The problem is that the madman in the book is predicted to start A WAR, not THE WAR, and I don't want to be nit-picky, but this is a critical difference. King's answer resonates of Sixtie's idealism: all war is bad! Maybe. Perhaps. But what if one fights a war to STOP a madman ala Hitler? Hmmm."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"'The Dead Zone' is a masterpiece written by the master himself! This is not a horror, but instead a heart warming thriller that will move you!Johnny Smith is a man with an ordinary name, who has lots of things that he cares about, taken away from him, after an accident puts him into a 4 1/2 year coma. When he wakes up, he has the power to see the future by touching a person or object. There are certain things that he can't see or will never know, such as not knowing first hand what happened, while he slept for 4 1/2 years. All of this info is stored in his subconscious or as he likes to call it, the dead zone. He doesn't like his new gift, (or curse) but feels he has a responsibility to help others. He goes through different episodes where his power is needed, until fate brings him to his ultimate task.Meanwhile a crooked and ambitious man is very power hungry. He is insane enough to cause something very terrible to happen.This is one of those books where, it is fate itself that puts the pieces of the puzzle together. This is a very touching story, that will have you feeling almost every emotion, that is humanly possible. From beginning to end the book will have you hooked. Definetly one of King's best!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"How can you trust the opinion's of some of these reviewers? For example, the person who recommends this book to &quot;STEPHEN KING fans&quot; (try to imagine his name in flashing neon letters, if you like). Or people who write all in upper-case letters, just to get attention. Or people who say that the book was confusing and therefore wasn't very good (ever tried actually thinking with your brain?). Okay, I just wanted to get that all off my chest. &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; is one of King's best early books, and John Smith, the man with the ordinary name and the extraordinary gift (or curse?), is one of his best characters. You can feel his torment of losing the girl he loved, his privacy and his dignity, all the while trying to come to terms with the terrible power that had been granted to him. A literary acheivement!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The year before THE DEAD ZONE was published, Stephen King published THE STAND, a stunning novel that is almost certainly King's finest work - which is no small achievement. If THE STAND is not King's best, however, than THE DEAD ZONE probably is. The plotline, as in most of King's stories, isn't breathtaking: a man awakens from a four-year coma with the ability to see the future and read a person's inner thoughts by touching them. It's King's handling of that plotline that makes the book so utterly fantastic. The chain of events in the book is immense and entirely unpredictable. The characters and primarily their actions are unquestionably realistic - sometimes chillingly so.The book revolves around two major points. One point is explained through a question which torments the novel's protagonist, Johnny Smith: if you could travel in a time machine back to 1932, would you kill Hitler? Would you be willing to be trapped in time and jailed (or, more likely, killed) to save the lives of millions of strangers who you don't even know? More importantly, could you, will you, are you MEANT to, change fate?This leads into the novel's second point. You may believe in God, or you may not. God you can run from. Fate, however, is inescapable. What is fate? Is it destiny, or is it what God wants you to do? Toward the end of the book, in a letter to his father, Johnny says, \\"I still don't really believe in God, not in a real Being who plans for us and gives us all little jobs to do, like Boy Scouts winning merit badges on The Great Hike of Life. But neither do I believe that all the things that have happened to me are blind chance.\\" Johnny is torn between his desire to stay out of the public eye, to live in peace and not be hounded by the press or treated like a circus freak, and his urge to help those in trouble. Ultimately, the urge to battle Greg Stillson, a politician who acts like a joke in front of the public but is privately nothing short of evil, overwhelms Johnny and leads him to make his final decision, which results in a shocking yet brilliantly fitting conclusion.THE DEAD ZONE, like THE STAND, is concrete proof that Stephen King was the quintessential writer of the 20th century. THE DEAD ZONE reflects on human society but also captures the feeling of its time period perfectly, most notably after Johnny awakens from his four-year coma to learn of all the changes in the world. It's a brilliant novel, and undoubtedly one of the finest things the master author ever wrote."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I've always had sort of weird feelings about The Dead Zone. It is a fantastic novel, yet it has never rated among my personal King favorites. Maybe it's because I envision the story taking place in a cold, harsh world, devoid of color and light. This really isn't a horror novel at all, so there are really no thrills and chills to be found until the few exhilarating moments that make up the climax of this pretty depressing story. The Dead Zone is one of King's most accessible novels, however, and it exemplifies so many of this great author's strengths. First and foremost, the man knows how to tell a story - no one does it better, in my opinion. King's magic gift for characterization is also on display here, as John Smith, a thoroughly \\"Everyman\\" protagonist comes across as quite real and exceedingly human; he's a truly ordinary man placed in the most extraordinary of conditions. King truly does the character right in the form of a truly masterful conclusion, as well.If you could go back in time to 1932 and meet Adolf Hitler, would you kill him? That's the kind of question that ultimately comes to consume Johnny's mind as this story nears its end. Would you sacrifice yourself for the lives of so many other people, virtually all of them strangers?John Smith is just an ordinary fellow; he's got a job he enjoys, he's fallen in love with a good woman, and he's as happy as he's ever been. Then The Accident happens, and Johnny wakes up to learn that his world will never be the same. He's been in a coma for well over four years, and he faces a painful road to recovery both mentally and physically. His girl has married someone else, his mother has gone off the deep end of religious zeal, he faces painful, scarring surgeries in the brutal months ahead, and he really struggles to find a reason for living in such a harsh new world. He has gained something from the awful experience, however, and it's both a blessing and a curse. At times, he can see the future just by touching a person or an object. It's a frightening power, one that alienates him even further from those around him. When word gets out, he finds himself deluged with pleas for help from people all over the country. All he wants is to live an ordinary life again, but his psychic powers make this impossible. His mother believes God has special plans for Johnny, and in the end he thinks she may be right. He alone, as things turn out, can save his country and maybe the entire world from devastating future destruction wrought by a madman.Smith is one of King's most sympathetic characters. He's one of us, really, and we suffer along with him as he starts life anew. His physical problems are horrendous, but they pale in comparison to his emotional loss. He's lost his girl, yet he can't even blame her for thinking he would never recover and thus starting her life anew in someone else's arms. He doesn't know what to think or do about this strange power he has developed; it scares people, and it scares him - yet he knows it allows him to do some good things for people. He also knows he can't run away from it. The problem is that no one really believes his predictions until they have proven themselves to be accurate. That is why he has to make the most heroic, most gut-wrenching decision of his life completely on his own.John Smith is a fabulous character, and The Dead Zone is a truly masterful modern novel. While some of the subtext of the story is rooted in the 1970s, this really is a book for all seasons. It will never make my list of King's top five novels, but it's one of the most compelling stories you'll ever read."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I think King is unfairly labeled &amp; dismissed as a mere &quot;horror&quot; novelist. The truth of the matter is that he is simply one of the greatest and most gifted popular novelists of our time. The Dead Zone illustrates this fact more than any King novel I have been exposed to. I have read just a handful of King's novels, but am always surprised at how much they stay with me after the fact. This story was no exception. The characters are exceedingly well crafted -- particularly the protagonist Johnny Smith. King is very adept at creating a sense of time and place. In this case: the Seventies in Maine, of course. The plot is fast-paced and forces the reader to focus on one central theme: If one has the power to see the future, how would one use that power? Johnny Smith (a likeable, very typical individual if there ever was one) takes a sharp blow to the head as a small boy and is doomed to struggle with that question from that point on. There are no ghosts, witches, vampires, etc. in this book. This is not a &quot;horror&quot; novel in the traditional sense, which is precisely why it will scare the living hell out of you. Just a plain man with a power he doesn't want. The results are gripping and chilling. The bottom line is that King (God bless him) makes you want to read. James Joyce is still on my bookshelf... unread. Do yourself a favor and read the first 10 pages of the Dead Zone. You will be on page 404 two days later."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Fantastic book, but the Kindle version was full of typos and missing letters, making it a bit of a distracted read.

Johnny walks up to the Wheel of Fortune, a wheel to make bets on and places his money down. Sure enough, the number spun was his number. He contunues to place bets and wins each time. To everyone's amazement, John wins five-hundred dollars before stopping. After dropping Sarah off at her home, John gets in to a taxi. At this moment, his luck starts to change. He gets in to a horrible accident that leaves him in a coma. He finally wakes four and a half years later to a totally different world. Sarah has married another man and his mother has become a religious lunatic. Even more different are Johhny's visions of the future, which he gets when touching people. This first occurs in the hospital when he tells a nurse about her house which is on fire. After this, Johnny helps solve a stirng of murders taking place in Castle Rock, Maine. Johnny's most horrific vision come afterwards. He has a vision of the end of the world when he shakes a local politician's hand.I believe that this is an excellent book with a great story line. The way the autor uses symbolism and thrilling sub-plots to move the story along is amazing. With all these subplots the story still moves along very smoothly. It remains suspenseful and entertaining until the very end. My favorite part of the book is when Johnny experiences his first vision, of the nurse's sone in a burnig house. This like many other parts of the book is very compelling. King made sure that you would never get bored while reading this book.I would recommend this book to almost anyone.

It is morbid, sad, hopeful, and wonderful - READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"*spoilers included*When discussing the best of King's early novels, many point to CARRIE or 'SALEM'S LOT.I point to THE DEAD ZONE.THE DEAD ZONE--which introduces us to a little town called Castle Rock--is simply marvellous. Taking place years before I was even born, this novel contains one of King's best protagonists, the aptly-named Everyman John Smith. John has suffered two accidents, one as a young boy, the other as a young man. As a result, he gains various psychic powers. However, he is also sent into a coma that lasts four and a half years. As John struggles to readjust, he tutors a young man, helps to capture a serial killer, and tries to stop a madman from achieving high political office--which would doom the world.This is magnificent, moving book, about the tragic story of a young man who spun &quot;00.&quot;Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"For years my mother wouldn't read any Stephen King novels because she was convinced they were all too weird. However, I did convince her to read this one and she was instantly smitten as a fan by the time she was done. The only &quot;weird&quot; aspect of this tale is that the hero is clairvoyant. His powers become hyper charged when he is in a horrendous car crash that leaves him in a coma for four and half years. When he finally wakes, he discovers that just by touching someone or some object, he can see exactly what happened or will happen to that person. The story is about all of the events that happen to him when using this new power. There is also a love story aspect, which is unusual for King. It's not a major part of the story but it is nicely done what is there. This was made into a movie starring a young Christopher Walken before he became typecast as villains and mobsters later in his career. Walken did a great job and &quot;Dead Zone&quot; is as different for him as it was different for King. Both the novel and the film are excellent and you can't go wrong with either. I recently saw the film on DVD again and it held up beautifully to when I'd seen it when it first came out decades ago."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I've always been a Stephen King fan, and this novel ranks right up there on my favourites list. The main character, Johnny Smith, is very strong and is given relatable and lengthy characterization. The format is also quite good. King allows the piece to fall as they may, showing hints of things to come, but never giving too much away. Early in the novel we're introduced to a lightning rod salesman at a bar, but this isn't pivotal until a great deal later (between 250 and 300 pages later, actually). And pivotal is it.Two things that bugged me, though. King sometimes seems to foreshadow way too much. I know it's just his style -- as I've seen this used in all of his great books, particularly &quot;Eyes of the Dragon&quot;, my favourite of his -- and I don't generally mind it too much, but he'll often end several consecutive chapters with clear indication of what happens in the next. In a society that dwells on cliffhangers to keep on reading, I suppose that is one of the reasons he's so popular, but I personally would prefer him allowing the story to tell itself rather than having to end chapters by telling us that the main characters would not meet for another four years. Sure, it gets the reader's interest, but only if the reader's supposed to be uninterested in the first place.Also, the ending fails to be as universal as it could have been. I loved the questions it raises about assassination, but by having Johnny unsuccessful, King fails to keep the question on a real level, something that could be used in consideration of Lincoln or JFK. If Johnny had succeeded without the speculation, notes and scandals associated with it all afterwords, it would have kept the motives mysterious, something which real life assassins are in many cases.Matty J"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I think King is unfairly labeled &amp; dismissed as a mere &quot;horror&quot; novelist. The truth of the matter is that he is simply one of the greatest and most gifted popular novelists of our time. The Dead Zone illustrates this fact more than any King novel I have been exposed to. I have read just a handful of King's novels, but am always surprised at how much they stay with me after the fact. This story was no exception. The characters are exceedingly well crafted -- particularly the protagonist Johnny Smith. King is very adept at creating a sense of time and place. In this case: the Seventies in Maine, of course. The plot is fast-paced and forces the reader to focus on one central theme: If one has the power to see the future, how would one use that power? Johnny Smith (a likeable, very typical individual if there ever was one) takes a sharp blow to the head as a small boy and is doomed to struggle with that question from that point on. There are no ghosts, witches, vampires, etc. in this book. This is not a &quot;horror&quot; novel in the traditional sense, which is precisely why it will scare the living hell out of you. Just a plain man with a power he doesn't want. The results are gripping and chilling. The bottom line is that King (God bless him) makes you want to read. James Joyce is still on my bookshelf... unread. Do yourself a favor and read the first 10 pages of the Dead Zone. You will be on page 404 two days later."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Stephen King is an author that can frighten you by using realistic stuff. Alot of things that happened in The Dead Zone could happen in real life. The only supernatural thing is the physic powers. Stephen King is the best author of all time."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Stephen king has the ability to cast spells. From time to time I find myself picking up one of his books for some &quot;non-academic&quot; reading. The only problem is, my mind often works harder on a King novel than on &quot;more academic&quot; writing. I like THE DEAD ZONE because it is not a traditional horror story at all. In fact, few incidents in the story are truly frightening. The most frightening things about this book are the ideas that it presents. Every thing in the book COULD happen as another reviewer stated. King often uses horror as a mask when he wants to discuss social issues. (See &quot;The 10 O'Clock People&quot; from NIGHTMARES &amp; DREAM SCAPES) THE DEAD ZONE is a prime example of this. King's social commentary is as compelling as Kurt Vonnegut's (I have a habit of comparing everyone to Kurt Vonnegut, my favorite contemporary writer) Only with King, nobody's laughing!!!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone by Stephen King tells the story of a boy named Johnny who gained the ability to see limitedly into the future. He went into a coma for a long time after being in an automobile accident. When he woke from the coma and began physical therapy, he grabbed his trainer's hand and could see that the trainer's house was burning. This was his first experience with seeing something that was not right in front of him. Johnny has several experiences where he tries to prevent something bad from happening. Sometimes people listen to him and sometimes they don't - but those that don't, regret it. Johnny's girlfriend is not a very nice character. She was in love with Johnny, but after he goes into a coma for such a long time, she marries someone else. When she sees the news article about him, she goes to visit him. He holds her hand and is able to tell her where she lost her engagement ring. The most important experience Johnny has is when he shakes the hand of one of the candidates for president of the United States and sees the problems the U.S will experience when he is elected. Johnny finds a way to prevent Stilson from becoming the president. I really did not like the character of Johnny, because outside of his unusual ability, he was a little boring. When he wasn't using his special power, his role was pointless. The character of Stilson brought action and violence into the book and made it more interesting. One of his more vivid acts was when he was counseling a young boy about his attire and took the boy's shirt and lit it on fire - then threatened to kill the boy. Overall, I would give this book a six out of ten, because there were interesting ideas in the book but I found it a little boring to read."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This is one of those books that I put off reading for a long time, but was immediately sucked in a soon as I started. King is at his best here, creating believable characters and putting them through the wringer.I really liked how he incorporated true history into the story. The only part that didn't ring true to me was that the main character, having already decided he didn't really like his power, decides to go out and use it on politicians, just to see what they are like. It is required for the story, but felt like it wasn't set up enough in the story.This book is one of King's best, right up there with The Shining, The Stand, and It."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was very well paced and creepy. The character development wasn't as complete as other King books i.e. It, The Stand, etc but enough was put into them to make each one real and believable. Every time the book seemed to tail off something exciting happened to grab my attention back. While The Dead Zone is not as scary/creepy as a lot of his other novels, it has just enough to fit into the horror genre. I would rate this book as a 4.5 out of 5."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This novel was great until the ending. Very well done. But, I was surprised the character did what he did at the end, even though I recognized his reasoning. Yes, some people deserve to be taken out, but that doesn't mean we should do it. Okay, it's just a novel, but one of King's iconic ones at that. I guess I just have to remind myself that we live in a barbaric world. I just thought King's main character had more character than that. I wonder if King ever regretted he didn't write it differently. Perhaps there are some interviews with him on YouTube ...."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I had read this book a while ago and just read it again, years later, and have to say this is still one of Stephen King's best books. I highly suggest this book. If you've never read one of his books before, start with this one!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"In his book \\"On Writing\\" King mentions at one point his disdain for plotting. He cites \\"The Dead Zone\\" as one of the few novels he has actually plotted and liked. The evidence that he has plotted is strong in this book as it is his most well written and adequately paced. For the first time ever reading a King novel I didn't feel like the book was 200 pages too long. He does very little of the needless rambling and description here that he does in many of his other novels. There was also another first for me while reading King...I didn't have to skip pages! While the actual concept of the story itself isn't as interesting as some of his other novels like \\"The Stand\\" or \\"IT\\", it is much better written and cuts the fat to a minimum. I can only imagine if he had taken a little extra time to plot the stories I previously mentioned how much more amazing they would be."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"What can I say that has not already been said about this book or Stephen King? Fast paced story, great characters, and creepy story telling. Well worth the money and an excellent read!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This book displays all of King's usual strengths. A sense of place (Castle Rock seems completely real), believable characters, and a seamless integration of fantasy and reality.Unlike some other King books, the story maintains interest right through to the end, and isn't overly long.My one criticism is that the book doesn't feel like a single piece of work, but more like 2 or 3 novellas stitched together. The last third, about the presidential campaign, hasn't much connection to the earlier parts."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The main character John Smith has a strange psychic ability -- by touching something or someone he can know their future and see into their past. It allows him to find lost objects or people, save friends from fatal disasters, and leads up to a chilling climax. Chapter one introduces the origins of the ability, a brain injury the inflames an ill-used part of the cortex, received from a fall on ice.The phrase 'dead zone' itself refers to dead areas of the brain where you can't recall details from, but John figures out ways to work around this problem when using his power. When he can't see a psychic detail, he says 'it's in the dead zone.' This is creepy. He doesn't use his psychic ability much, and views it more of a curse, but if the potential for good is great enough, he will help.The book could have been a thriller, especially with King's talents of getting into the reader's head and forging empathy. However King spends too much time on secondary characters -- John's parents (especially his mother's religious mania), his first love, his doctors, his students (he's a teacher), and the lives of the evil men John catches with his ability. The beginning is extremely slow, and the middle doesn't have John using his power very often.What really makes the book is the last fifty pages. What would you do if you met someone who would start World War III (perhaps by accident), and you knew you could stop all that with a simple murder? John Smith must answer that question.This is a Stephen King book to read once, and only once. I doubt you'll want a re-read, given the pacing issues. Great to borrow from a library."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Johnny Smith is a twenty something New England school teacher with an attractive girlfriend and a promising future.

All the occult and suspense withoutthe usual King gore (I tend to be a little squeamish).

There are many subplots in this book, some of them including a disturbing serial killer and a psychotic politician named Greg Stillson. Stephen King makes sure we hate this man, for in the prologue he brutally kills a dog, and does other evil things.This book was very suspenseful and fast-paced, although it got overlongish in some spots, and when Johnny shakes the hand of Greg Stillson, it is not clear how Johnny comes to know about certain events, but overall The Dead Zone was an excellent book, and the characters are all likable enough: Sam Weizak, Sarah Hazlett, and Johnny's dad Herb. We of course hate the psychotic Stillson. Recommended"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"9.3 STARS OUT OF 10!!!Stephen King released The Dead Zone directly after his greatest book, the epic, magnificent, The Stand. It would have been easy to come back down to earth after the last work of art, but not in this case. While 800 pages shorter then the Stand, the Dead Zone packs quite a punch. Forget about the plot twists and different themes. The best part of this story is the hero Johnny Smith and his endeavors.First year teacher Johnny Smith has everything going for him. Loving parents, an awesome girlfriend, and a pretty good job he excels at. Suddenly, a vicious car accident puts him in a four year coma, and when he wakes up things have changed. Nixon is no longer President, his girlfriend has moved on, his father is broke due to Johnny's hospital bills, and his mother has become a religious freak who is pretty close to the loony bin. Oh yeah, Johnny also has phychic flashes sometimes when he touches people where he can see the future.I feel like I may have already spoiled too much so I will leave it at that, but Johnny's story at times is bittersweet, happy, sad, tragic, and grueling. One of King's better books."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I saw the movie version of this novel a long time ago, of course, but when I read the book, I discovered that it was much, much better.

This, in my opinion, was the only exception where the movie was better than the book.

In the first part of the novel, The Wheel Of Fortune, Johnny Smith, the herion is eventually hunting down a serial killer, and this is the good part about the novel. What I would have liked even more was some more in depth insight to the killer's identity, instead of revealing him as a no name. After that, Johnny realizes that Greg Stillson is a man running for the House of Represenatives, and Johnny sees he's a bad guy. Johnny finds out through the dead zone. At this point Johnny comes to a conclusion which leads up to the dumb ending, which could have been written so much better. Greg Stillson himself is not a great villian, but then again there are to many villians in the novel to count. King should have ended this novel after 267 pages and it would have been excellent. And we all would have had some clue to what the point of The Dead Zone was."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The dead zone is so scary because it is not to far from being something that could really happen.

In the Dead Zone, King proves that he is a master storyteller rather than just a &quot;horror&quot; writer. The saga of John Smith will captivate and move you to the extent that you are transported to his world, his *mind*. The Dead Zone is an excellent book for current King fans to share with their friends, their families, even their teenaged children. I highly recommend this amazing work"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The reason I read this book was because of the TV show. I wanted to read this because I wanted to spot the differences and similarities between the two. A fan of the show may want to read this. There are certainly differences in the characters and events from the show. The Dead Zone tells of a man, Johnny Smith, who inherits visions after waking up from a coma. This book is about Johnny's struggles with seeing the past and future after his coma. This book tends to lag at times, and this happens a lot throughout the book. It is a long book, but it is also the one you want to pass time with. Overall, this is an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"i started this book on 10/12 that's when i picked it up from my teacher's libaray. this book is so interesting that i can't hardly put it down. it's a pretty long book and that is why it is taking me a while to finish it. This is my first book by stephen king and i can't wait try the others. in this book i can give you review of the book till the page i am up to. this book is about a guy named johnny who gets into a car accident and injures his head. he does survives but stays in a coma for four and a half years. when he finally wakes up he sees that a lot of things have changed around but he also realizes that he has gotten a second sight meaning that he could predict a person's future by justing touching their hand. this is the part where i am to right now. i just can't wait to see what happens. and also i think all you people out there should try it."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Johnie Smith just wants to have an ordinary life, doing a job he loves, married to the girl he loves, maybe having a couple of kids, and being happy. All that changes one night on the way home from the State Fair when a car accident puts him into a long coma and disrupts his world and that of the people around him.Johhie Smith has a sweet, kind personality that really comes out of the pages as the sense of forboding grows. He tries to live his life and go on with his original plans, but a new found talent surfaces and makes that difficult, yet he hopes it's still possible. He does not become bitter or much more cynical. He still has faith and hope in people, even through some horrifying experiences. And his new unwanted talent gets stronger and stronger and leads to not just actual physical pain, but also emotional pain as well.There are enough scary and eerie episodes in this novel to satisfy the horror fans, yet what makes this book unique in the King pantheon is the fact they're filtered through Johnie's essentially decent personality---and King makes Smith's reactions recognizable as something anybody reading the story would feel and and find familiar. The character is not a thrill seeker or a fame hound. He's got humble ambtions that anyone might recognize--and appreciate. The more horror he's exposed to--and some as a result of the change in his life---the more desperately Johnie clings to those hopes and desires, even as they recede further and further from his grasp, till he comes to several painful revelations, and that's when the story turns to tragedy. Maybe that's why it's truly a horror novel. This most decent of characters is placed by Fate into a position that he cannot bear and must fear that he won't survive.As usual the story has the King advantages---the fluid storytelling and almost effortless flow of the writing, and here the ordinary man character does not become petty as do others in the King oeuvre, because the protagonist is so unselfconsciously ordinary; the vivid imagery, and the fast moving pace---but it also suffers from the King flaws that taint some of his best books. The story suffers from visions----aside from those that afflict the lead character---and which eventually make you wonder exactly how many people in town have suffered from raps on the head. Apparently everybody in the King universe suffers from Sylvia Browne disease, where they think they're psychic, yet in King's books, their predictions come true. Even for a horror/supernatural novel, this is pushing it, and the atmosphere---which could be so much better---suffers from it. In King novels this kind of thing is used too often as some king of shortcut and here, were the protagonist not so affecting, it would have sunk the book.I give it a four to reserve the five for truly amazing works, but this book is going to be on my Kindle."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"A longtime King fan, I felt The Dead Zone simply falls short. The premise--an average school teacher awakes from an almost 5 year coma with the ability of seeing the future and the question of whether or not he will use this ability for good, is interesting, but the ending is certainly disappointing. This is not what I expected, but by no means did I feel it was a waste of time to read. Not his best, but certainly not a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Ah, the infamous Dead Zone. And no, I'm not talking about the hit USA Network TV show, either. Though it's based off of the King Novel, The book reads just a bit different than the adapting the TV screen.Still, this was something good to read and made you really understand what King was thinking about when he wrote it, you get to be Johnny Smith for a little while and feel everything he's feeling in the beginning.Now, if only someone would write media tie-in novels of the TV show, then we'd be good-to-go.--Joseph McGee, author of In the Wake of the Night, Phil's Place and Darkness Won't Rest: Phils Place II"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The idea that what's meant to be will be comforts some, who see it as a release from worry about the future, but John Smith is fated to worry about the world's future, because on waking up from a long coma he knows more about the future than he wants to. For him the very things that his ultra-religious mother cites as proof that this is God's work--the odds against waking up from so serious an accident with this \\"gift\\"--point to the randomness of life, and he just wants to get on with his. but it's not that simple because he had an earlier accident as a child and earlier flashes of second sight, and in fact in the end he becomes sure that his accident \\"never stopped happening\\". His attempts to throw himself back into his normal life of teaching just seem to result in increasingly compelling calls to fulfil his destiny. He seems to have been loaned some extra time to fulfil his destiny, which hinges on a decision of whether or not to assassinate a rising politician destined to start world war three.In keeping with the book's theme of predestination, the descriptions are usually drawn out past the point where you know what's going to happen, but King changes styles from letters to newspaper clippings to interior monologues to nice descriptions, and unlike some of King's other books, this novel never drags. Some of the references to American political history went over my head, but I like the idea of a destiny to choose to change the seemingly ineluctable path of the world. I could think of a few solutions other than the given ending but I guess it was the most dramatic option for King to choose and it was pretty satisfying. Unlike other King stories, I had the feeling that it ended where it was supposed to rather than 50 pages later."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This story will have you on the edge of your seat.

I gave him a quizzical look if only because I had been less than enthralled with this 1970's book about a man with special cognitive powers that allow him to see the future when he is physically engaged with an object or person (ie: touching them).The thing about Stephen King books, and many of the same genre, is they fail to really challenge the reader other than to try and retain certain clues and hints as to what might happen in the future of the plot. Why are we being introduced to a lightning rod salesman? Why do we see a blue and yellow filter in a vision? What is the significance of the main character's interest in meeting politicians?Well for the most part, the big hints were pretty easy to pick up on in this wide-sprawling tale. The main character's gift of predicting the future remains dormant for most of his life until a near-fatal car crash puts him into a coma for four and a half years. When he wakes up he finds most of his old life - and his old self - has wasted away, except for this newfound gift that continually astounds people, but more importantly freaks them out.I guess my beef with the book was how much of it felt like filler and fluff. Even the more exciting parts of the book didn't reallllly contribute to the so-called climax of the story. I guess in reflection the story is a lot about checks and balances - ironic since a good deal of it deals with politics. An eye for an eye and all that..the big twist kind of falls in line with other elements of the plot but I can't say it was a BIG twist like say, in Secret Window. The characters fell flat, the descriptions were tideous to get through (and were often skipped), and good portions of the book failed to ignite tension, while others forced it.I know this is classic Stephen King and I'm sure for the time it was written it was quite a remarkable, exciting book...but it felt flat and pulpy to me unfortunately, and just wasn't my cup of tea overall."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I enjoyed reading The Dead Zone, enough so to stay up to finish it. It's quite a page turner and it is an interesting comparison between the political atmosphere of the 1970s to that of today. As with then we have a war (that isn't \\"officially\\" a war), corruption in politics and a president of questionable merit (I'm being generous).The book also shows a young author still playing with different methods of story telling. The Dead Zone has about five different voices as the story John Smith, everyman, psychic and martyr is unfolds. Some of the techniques used work better than others with the strongest pieces being the first two thirds of the book and the most experimental pieces being in the last third.I can see why this book was turned into a television series. The story lends itself to that format with its episodic nature and strong visual descriptions. I have the same problems with the book now as I did with the miniseries that launched the show: the pacing between the sections of the book is rather jarring as it jumps from book to book. The first third of the story builds slowly, almost too slowly as Johnny discovers his gift and then suffers his accident. The second part where Johnny wakes up and solves the first crime is paced just right; it reads like a nice quick mystery-thriller and has a compact ending. Then the book speeds through a third section that is really two more stories: Johnny sees the future and saves some lives and Johnny sees the future (or thinks he does) and decides to end a life before that person can become the next Hitler. I really don't like the last piece in either the book or the miniseries because it's too much of a change in personality for Johnny. He rapidly transforms from a hands off, let the word do its thing, to a one man super hero / martyr without even blinking."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"\\"The dead zone\\"ByStephen King1) I have chosen the book because of the author. I have read only one Stephen King book before and that was \\"The Body\\" published by Penguin readers. Books by Stephen King are said to be great horror books, full of thrill and mystery. So I decided to read a \\"real\\" Stephen King book and looked for some books at amazon.at. When I found a book called \\"The Dead Zone\\" I was fascinated by the cover and its title.Because of the title I suppose the book to deal with the subject of death. There isn't any blurb, so the reader doesn't know anything about the plot of the book at this time. The layout of the cover confirms my suspicion of a book with a focus on death, because of the veiled face, which is slightly light up and covers the whole front of the book. The cover is coloured in black, grey and an iridescent mixture of green and blue. The colours grey and black stand for pain, fear, sorrow and death. The iridescent mixture of blue and green is a symbol for mystery, subconscious and things you can not describe in a conventional way, just like supernatural power and death.I expect the book to be a good read, but I'm afraid that Stephen King's writing style is fairly high developed and so there will be problems with understanding the text. In addition I fear that it will take me very long to read through this novel of more than 400 pages.The aim of writing this paper is to prove my development of my writing skill. I want to demonstrate that I have already improved my writing skill and my style through all the years of book reports, tests, home-exercises and the English course in Ireland.The problems I will most likely encounter might be problems with expressing my ideas in the right way. I find it difficult to pick the right word out from the large offer of opportunities of the meanings of a word. It is hard to find the correct word, which expresses my idea and fits into the sentence at the same time.Probably I will also have troubles with word order and the correct use of time, adjectives and adverbs.I'll try hard to reduce the number of mistakes.2) The plot is divided into four parts. The first part is the Prologue in which King introduces the main character Johnny Smith, when he was a teenager.Johnny was ice skating with some other guys. Suddenly he bumped into another one and fell down. He hit the ground with his head and blacked out. The impact on the ice damaged a little part of his brain. Nobody ever noticed anything and so he lived on without any suspicion, that there isn't everything alright with him. But soon he will find out that he is not that Johnny he was before. The skating accident changed his life drastically.The second part of the book is the most explained and most important one, and it is about two third of the whole novel. It is called \\"The Wheel of Fortune\\" and is about Johnny Smith as an adult.Johnny Smith is a school teacher in the Maine town of Cleaves Mills, along with his girlfriend, Sarah Bracknell. One day, Johnny takes Sarah to a local fair and gets a bad headache while riding the roller coaster. The part is called The Wheel of Fortune, because the ride on the roller coaster \\"activated\\" his powerful gift. Johnny decides to try his luck by playing \\"The Wheel of Fortune\\". As he always bets on the right number and makes a lot of money with it, Sarah gets frightened and wants him to bring her home. At the Wheel of Fortune Johnny discovered the power to look into the future the first time, but he wasn't aware of it. He brings Sarah home and organises himself a taxi. Unfortunately the taxi was involved in a horrible car accident: The taxi-driver dies and Johnny falls into a deep coma.Five and a half years later, Johnny awakes from the coma, although everybody, the parents, Sarah and the doctors gave up hope. Johnny wakes up in a special clinic run by Dr. Sam Weizak, and is surprised to realize that five years have passed and that the whole world has changed. He finds out that he has lost his job, that his girlfriend Sarah was married to another guy and got a child called Danny, and that his mother fell into some kind of a religious mania, when praying all over the years for him. But the most astonishing thing is to find out about his strange new power. He can see into the future and the past of people by touching them or something belonging to them. Certain aspects of his vision, however, are blocked, and he can't always figure out the whole picture. This is the area of his psychic vision Johnny calls \\"the dead zone\\".With his powerful gift he changes the life of everybody he gets in contact with. To give a few examples of his influence on the people around him: He saves the life of the nurse's daughter, when having a vision of a burning house with a girl in it, by touching the nurse. He also changes Dr. Weizak's life by seeing his mother living in California, although she was supposed to be murdered in the World War II.The most important role Johnny plays in the Chapter \\"The Wheel of Fortune\\" is to find out, who the dangerous murderer and rapist is, the police is searching for.In the third part, \\"The Laughing of the Tiger\\", there is a sad climax: Johnny finally finds his death, when he tries to assassinate Greg Stillson, a politician who is going to candidate for the position of the president. When Johnny shook hands with Stillson after a speech, Johnny had an insight into Stillson's soul and saw that this guy is crazy and full of hate. He also saw that Stillson will become president and that then he is going to start a nuclear war, which would leave the world in total destruction. Johnny feels in duty bound to save the world from Greg Stillson, being awake to the fact that this means his own death. He fails to assassinate Stillson, but Stillson commits suicide, when all the newspapers reported about him, using a baby as a human shield. Johnny is shot by a bodyguard.As an ending, Stephen King added the fourth part called \\"Notes from the Dead Zone\\". There we can find alternatively letters of Johnny and Sarah, as well as some newspaper articles about Johnny's power and the failed attempt of Greg Stillson's assassination, and excerpts from the testimony given by the so-called \\"Stillson Committee\\".The story is much like a roller coaster ride. At the beginning Johnny's life hits its peak: He leads a pleased life, he loves his job and his girlfriend Sarah, who he wants to marry.The car accident flings Johnny out of his tracks, so his life suddenly hit rock bottom. After the coma he suddenly has lost his job, his girlfriend, five and a half years of his life and his physical health. The short moment of the accident is the turning point of his life. His new life is stamped by physical and psychical pain and increasing isolation.Johnny's supernatural power doesn't turn him into a celebrated hero, but into an uncanny outsider. His mysterious power turns out to be the bane of his life.Johnny quickly fades, because he is getting weaker and weaker with every vision. His physical appearance gets worse, as well as his pangs. At the end of the story Johnny just looks like a zombie: his eyes were bloodshot, his face was deathly pale, he looks feeble and there were scars all over his body from the operations. You can easily foresee Johnny's death and that there wouldn't be a happy ending.I think the book deals with many problems at the same time. One of these is the predicament after a long coma. King makes us realize what it is like, awaking from a coma, which lasted a few years, and what feeling it is when the whole world has changed. All your dreams burst like bubbles and you have to start from the very beginning again. You have to find a job, you have to reintegrate into the social system again and you have to endure a lot of painful operations in order to regenerate and mobilize you by lengthening your sinews.Other problems result from problems in reintegrating into the society, especially with such a strange power. Johnny lost his sweetheart to another guy, he lost his job and his mother has gone insane. Johnny's world breaks down with one single moment, the car accident to be precise. He failed to reintegrate and so it comes to the tragic end. For example, if he just had been able to marry Sarah, there would be a different ending, because then he would have gotten something it is worth living for.To my mind \\"The Dead Zone\\" is a great book. I had expected the book to be a rather long read. I also thought that Stephen King's experienced writing-style and the enlarged vocabulary would be too thorny to read. But reading the novel was completely different from the expectations I had before. I think this book turned me into a Stephen King fan and if I only had time, I'd read other books from him. I like his style very much. He doesn't lengthen the story by all means. There are chapters, which were very long and there were chapters, which were very short, for example: \\"The dinner was a great success.\\" (See part 2, chapter 9, subchapter 9, page 139). This is the whole subchapter!I like this very much, because it shows that the contents and the idea are of highest importance for King, not to approximate a certain number of chapters or words. It seems as he just writes down what comes to his mind and as a result there were chapters of very different length. Because of this, Stephen King's books keep the reader in suspense and they never get dull. Other readers tell in book reviews that \\"The Dead Zone\\" is not his best book and that there are much better ones. To my mind it is a great story with lots of griping and mysterious facts. I couldn't put the book aside, because it reads so fluently. If people are right, when saying that there are better books from Stephen King, I can't wait to read another one of this great author's books. Even if they aren't really better, I would read them.The Dead Zone is really worth reading. You can easily identify with the main character, Johnny Smith. I would strongly recommend it to people who love to be spellbound by mystery-thrillers.I would asses the novel as literary work of art, because Stephen King managed to show the slow modification of Johnny Smith. At the beginning everything is alright, he is alive and kicking and enjoys best health. While reading, Johnny slowly modifies from a respected man of the middleclass into an uncanny outsider. It shows all the little details of Johnny's life and his iridescent character, which are important to identify with him. King managed to alter all this little details so slowly, that you do not realise the modifications. But if you reflect on the part you have read, you can see that Johnny has already changed a little bit. If you reflect on the whole novel, suddenly you can see one big tremendous change, and it scars me, how insidious such a big change of personality and appearance can be.To my mind Stephen King succeeded on the whole and I can't wait to read other books of him.It's difficult to tell you, where I have succeeded or failed. I just hope that there aren't too many mistakes and that I have improved my style and have enlarged my vocabulary. I liked to work with this book and I hope this is perceptible to you."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Like all his stuff, I looked forward to reading this and enjoyed it. It's a page turner.Not as scary as IT but still has its good parts. King's got a problem with bloat. I seem to have been able to stomach it more in my youth. Now, I just flip through chapters and STILL know exactly what's gonna happen/what's going on.The whole Sarah love story was a little lame. No real point and it didn't seem like either one of them was better off knowing the other.I don't think I'll read this one again."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"A great book with an unbelievable climax. read it now!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I had gotten this book at a local second hand shop, bringing it home, expecting the exact same thing as the movie. But, there were many quirky details different to the movie. You want my advice? Buy this book."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This book by Stephen King, the genius of horror, does a remarkable job on this book. It tells a story about a high school teacher named Johnny. On the way home from a date with this recent &quot;love&quot; ,who works with him,he gets in a terrible car accident and is in a comma for 4 and 1/2 years. When he wakes up he has a second sight and the public wants to know all about it. His love has gotten married, the world around him has changed, and he can't get away from the public. Excellent book of Stephen King expressing his feelings on hows it like to be in the public eye."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This is not Stephen King's best-written novel, but it is yummy as a story with loads of kinky ideas. It has...well...atmosphere! You do not forget this novel, and then, if you see the movie with Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen, you are guaranteed never to forget it. It has a true nightmare quality. As a writer it hs stayed with me as far as the ideas go. And when business is bad I always say I'm going through a &quot;Dead Zone.&quot; And when I say that, I am definitely referring to this book, because I'm a professional psychic whose clients, though they often ask for revelation, don't really want to hear it when it comes! Stephen, dear friend. What a fun companion you have been. Feel great, man, and know this: if you never write another word, I, for one, will always be grateful, if only for The Dead Zone."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I absolutely loved this book!! Steven King is truly a master!! I couldn't put it down!! I've read a lot of King's stuff, but I was totally unprepared for the part with the pimps and the funny-looking clown. I was laughing so hard that I almost voided my bowels. And the part with the hot-dog salesman and the nudist colony? Such humor!!! And I thought he only wrote horror!! Two thumbs up, waaaay up for this funny (yet deeply touching) portrayal of a man and his obsessions with houseplants. Thank you Stephen King!!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This might be King's best book ever. The story is intense and there are various sub-plots that are very interesting as well. A definite page turner."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Great idea and intriguing story, but it's really tough to stick with. There's very little suspense of ANY kind (not even in a Green Mile sort of way) up until the climax. If you like your politics, though, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"THE DEAD ZONE is, hands down, the best novel Stephen King has written to date. No E.C. Comics-style horror moves, no heavy-handed dialogue, none of the things that, for me, usually make him a one-time read and that's it. This story has a lead character who has three dimensions (four, if you count his psychic abilities)and tells about a good man with an obligation thrust upon him that he can't really run from. Johnny Smith and the people in his life are people we all know in one way or another, and when all is said and done THE DEAD ZONE transcends it's supernatural trappings and lets the story and the characters shine through. King has only sporadically achieved that balance in his subsequent novels, but he shows here that when he doesn't stoop to the cheap scare, he can write a powerful horror novel that stands up over time."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"but the thing was that I like the book so much that I wanted to rent the movie so I did that only because I had to see who was going to play the characters especially johnny. now I still love Steven King but I was very dissapointed with the movie I couldnt feel the movie like I could the book. But I truly give the book 5***** stars. A loyal reader S. Williams"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The best thing about this particular book is its ability to draw you easy into the lives of its characters and still have the punch to make you read it with the lights on. I compare its quality to Christine: amazingly well-written. King has the ability to make the characters come alive inside your head. I really thought this was more of a love-story than anything else. Yes, the horror is there, but done in such a way that it doesn't overpower you. John Smith is a real man (and maybe his name indicates that he is another form of Everyman) and the events that take place in his life are things that could happen to you and me. In short, I couldn't put the book down when I first read it umpteen years ago, and I couldn't put it down when I reread it for the umpteenth time last month. If you don't cry at the end of this story, something is wrong with you..."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The First thing we realize after reading Stephen King's 5th novel (and the first of many Castle Rock tales) is that the master of the macabre has outdone himself and churned out a classic. Is it horror? Here and there, but it's more than that. More a statement of its time than a book filled with boogeymen.Johnny Smith is a high school teacher that takes a tumble in a car accident and loses several years of his life to a coma. When he awakens he is greeted with the facts that his former girlfriend is married with child and his life is somewhat skewed. ...and he has brought back a gift....or is it a curse? He see things. Clairvoyance? Yep. Throw in a crooked, evil, sociopathic politician named Greg Stillson and a serial killer named Frank Dodd and you have Stephen King's The Dead Zone.This is prime King. Rich in story and feeling and coming off the effects of The Stand, Stephen King explores the story of an average man in the most extraordinary circumstances. Brilliant. Poignant. Definitely on the list of must re-read.Dig it!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The lead character of &quot;The Dead Zone,&quot; the tragic hero Johnny Smith, is one of the most memorable that King ever created. This is not a pure horror story, it reads more like the anti-&quot;Its a Wonderful Life.&quot; Smith has a near fatal accident, spends years in a coma an awakes with the ability to see the future (or at least, the bad things). He becomes convinced that a rising politician will one day set off global armageddon and tracks him across a mid-1970s landscape which even brings him into contact with a startled dark horse Presidential candidate named Jimmy Carter. Even though it may lack the gutteral horrors of some of his other novels, this is still one of King's best."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone is one of those books that will stay with you forever. It is for me - it's the first King book I read, and it's the best of his in my opinion.The characters are sympathetic and I've resisted watching the film because I have a perfect image of them in my head and dont want to ruin that image, as good as I hear the film is.I think the conflict in the story is spot on and there are some amazing twists on the way... but mainly it's just a really engaging and fast paced book that will fly by.100% recommended. If you are a fan of thrillers or dark stories, buy the Dead Zone!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I picked up this book after watching the movie The Dead Zone and this was the first Stephen King book I've read. All I can say is that this is great, not only the story but the way he put it in the book. The way he writes, the characters present in the story. Everything is impressively great! I have a very limited time and read this book in 3 days because I just couldn't stop it. This is one of those books that make you eager for the next chapter until you're done with it.The book is really terrific!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"gripping crafty storytelling in King's unimitable style. Others have said it better and more insightfully than I ever could do anyway. I just wanted to give it a 5*, even though I'm still only about halfway through it."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Stephen King has become a monster of his own fame it seems. People read his books because he's a bestselling author, because he's a \\"master storyteller\\", or because someone said to. I have followed his work since \\"Carrie\\" and in my opinion his early works are the best. The young hungry King who needed to feed a growing family and was still haunted by his demons is a much better read than the King who must \\"feed the engine\\" of the publishers.All of this is a long way to say that I believe that \\"The Dead Zone\\" is his best work EVER! The novel is more than a horror story and much more than just the work of a writer. It stands out as some of the best fiction of the 20th century. The story is simple it seems, John Smith(read as anyone)is injured in a car wreck and awakens from a coma almost five years later. Being that the years he slept were from 1970 to 1975, John missed the most jaw-dropping time ever. Presidents fell, major stars died young, and the woman he had fallen in love with married another man and had a child. Add to that the horror of the operations and work to get back at least part of his broken body and you have a great story.But John came back with something, something he doesn't want. He can, as long as he touches the person or the object(a nice way to connect him to the events), he can see the future or the past. It's a gift that haunts him and leads to one of the best endings of any King novels.Take the chance here and read this book. It's about life and the things that happen to us that we can't control, not about a boogieman.A very touching and powerful read."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Reason for Reading: I am re/reading Stephen King's books in chronological publishing order. This was my next book. I have also gotten into the habit of starting my year off with a Stephen King novel.I was really looking forward to this one. I have fond memories of really enjoying the book. I have only read it once before which was this exact paperback copy and I would have been 12 at the time. I don't really remember the story from the book, though, as I have flashes of scenes from the movie with Christopher Walken in my head, some which actually don't even happen in the book. And I was a fan of the TV series which was loosely based on the same premise as the book. So it was great to re-read the original and get the real story firmly planted in my head again.Excluding the Bachman books, up to this date \\"The Dead Zone\\" was King's first non-horror story. This is a story about a psychic and involves him solving a serial killer case and later on facing a prediction that he must decide whether he should take care of the problem before it happens and contemplates that age old hypothetical question, \\"If you could go back to 1932, knowing what you now know, would you murder Adolph Hitler?\\" The book carries a rather small cast, comparitively for a King book and we get to know Johnny, the main character, very well. He is very likable and someone we can relate to throughout the book. This book kept me up late at night as I just didn't want to put it down and had virtually forgotten how the book ended though it wasn't hard to predict. King uses very little stream of consiousness in this book; it is a plot driven novel with great character insight and a fast read. I loved it even more than I expected to! Great early King!While re-reading these books, I also like to look for the connections to previous books and found three while reading. A girl actually mentions the book \\"Carrie\\", there is a street named Flagg (a nod to Randall Flagg from The Stand) and the town of Jerusalem's Lot is mentioned. (otherwise known as 'Salem's Lot).If you are not really into horror books but would like to sample Stephen King, this is an excellent book for your first read and fans can't miss out on this classic old-school King novel."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"If the definition of a good book is one that gives the reader a powerful emotional experience, then The Dead Zone is a great one. John Smith is a popular young teacher with a bright future ahead. His relationship with Sarah Bracknell is moving forward. Life is looking good. Then John is involved in a terrible accident, putting him in a coma and shattering his life. But when John wakes up, he has gained a psychic ability. John now faces a difficult road to recovery... and the terrible responsibility of his newfound power.King's storytelling is superb as usual. The characters feel real and the story is deep and touching.Dead Zone is not the type of scary that Stephen King is generally known for, but that doesn't take away from its greatness. Its power is in its emotional nature. It's bittersweet, but highly readable and well worth the while."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This is an excellent story, crafted by a master of modern horror. I have read through it several times, and am surprised each time by some subtle use of prose or dialogue that I never noticed before. Stephen King starts the story off with a shocking event concering the main character, Johnny Smith, which instantly endears you to him and makes you care about what happens to him. As things unfold and Johnny makes decisions that will likely condemn his soul, you're right along with him every step of the way. This is a gift Mr. King has, and one I feel fortunate that he shares with his constant readers."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I am a big fan and have read every book, and this one is always the one I consider on of the best.His books are always engrossing and page turners, but this one is set apart, to me, as being more in the realm of \\"believable.\\"All he does is asks you to accept one thing as being plausible, someone having a Sixth Sense, then the book goes on from there.I had not read this one in quite awhile and picked it up again and it was just as how I remembered. A book very much worth reading if you have any interest in the genre.Very Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This novel is very gripping and will cause you to phade into your own gap of time because the pages are so defined and the story is written with utmost detail. Almost like a cause an effect situation which always seems to affect the main character (John Smith's) life. He being an incredible talented teacher and cursed with second sight because a tumor and/or an incredibly large gap in the brain he calls the dead zone. This novel portrays the life of a man who is different and/ or unique and how he is different from society. This gripping novel almost makes you feel sympathy for John- as if a coma wouldn't do that for most. His parents Herb, and Vera Smith are the fairly odd couple; Vera being religious and Herb being sane. Their are multiple scene switches (this being what I liked most) which will keep you guessing at every page because it all links back to John. The Dead Zone is an incredible novel and should be read by all."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Stephen King has done himself another piece of art. The book is riveting that as the reader read through this it urges anyone to continue to find out what happens next. It gives the idea that certain actions in life has an effect on a possible future which also tells us to enjoy it while we can cause we don't want to miss all the moments that pass. Personally, I think Stephen King deserves a lot more praise for his works. I may want to read it again as one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"You'll find that people regard Steven King books as good or bad, depending on how good or bad the movie was. And we've all seen the movies. Dead Zone is not a popular movie (Rightfully so because it's so terrible), but the book however is great. It's one of my favorite works by King. There are no ghosts, no clowns in sewers... it's a very human novel whose carachters you can feel for. though you don't hear this book noted that often, I recommend giving it a try. Read a few chapters into it. I definitely think they should remake it and have someone better play the lead role. I'd say it's the only movie I've ever seen ruined by Christopher Walken."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Johnny Smith was six years old when \\"his head connected with the ice and he blacked out.\\" A section of his brain was awakened that day and it provided him with a link to the hidden world contained in each of us, the world of secrets; the private world of what has been, what is, and what could be.Flash forward to the adult Johnny, a respected teacher at a high school in Cleaves Mills, Maine. He and girlfriend (a fellow teacher), Sarah Bracknell, expect to spend the rest of their lives together - but there are no picket fences in Johnny and Sarah's future.Johnny drops a food-poisoned Sarah off at home after a date at the fair then jumps into a taxi. Johnny never makes it home; his taxi hits a car head on, throwing him through the windshield into a coma. He doesn't open his eyes again for fifty-five months.Upon awakening he grabs the nurse at his bedside out of reflex. He reassures her, her son will be all right. Later the nurse come back to thank Johnny for letting her know. She had been worried about a medical procedure he was to undergo.The area of Johnny's brain that was cracked when he was a child has become a cavern with this second accident. He sees and feels things deeply, so much sothat it is like he is participating in them. Johnny can see the past, present and future of anyone he touches. These visions begin as flashes then build in intensity as his body recovers from its extended sleep.An unused area of the brain was stirred when Johnny's head made contact with the ice and awakened when his head went through the windshield. It is also the area where Johnny says again and again that the hidden information that he can't see lies, along with the things he has forgotten. He calls this awakened area \\"The Dead Zone.\\"The Dead Zone is the second King novel I have read and so far they are not what I expected them to be. They are chilling, but not because of some ghoulish content. They are scary because of the human quotient.Johnny's character is likeable; like most people he just wants to live his life and do the right thing. After Johnny leaves the hospital he finds it increasingly hard to just live his life. He is bombarded by lost souls looking for answers: where is my long lost brother, mother, husband, dog. Reporters hound him looking for proof he is real - or fake.Johnny's Jekyll and Hyde transformation from trance to waking world scares everyone he comes in contact with.. He despises the looks of horror he gets when he comes out of a trance. He feels isolated and believes his psychic gift is a nightmare. As the visions become more pronounced he distances himself from the few friends and family he has.Despite his forced seclusion the heartaches continue. Johnny visits his mother on her deathbed. The final words of wisdom from mother to son are \\"Do your duty, John.\\" Before she dies he gives in and promises what she asks. His mother's words weigh heavily on him throughout the remainder of the book.He lands a tutoring job and after months of mentoring , Johnny begins to believe that his true gift is teaching. Satisfaction and life purpose feel within his reach.This all changes the day he shakes hands with Greg Stillson, a budding politician. Stillson and the horrific images he witnessed never seem to leave Johnny's mind. He begins to keep meticulous journals on Stillson with his own thoughts lining the margins. One of the nagging thoughts that follow Johnny is whether he should do something or let it be.In Johnny's mind Stillson is reminiscent of Hitler. He begins to ask himself and others \\"What would you do if you could go back in time and have the opportunity to kill Hitler, would you do it?\\" In the answers of others, Johnny hopes to find alternatives to what he knows he must do. After much agonizing he decides that his only option is to assassinate Stillson, but from the beginning we know that things don't go according to plan.As mentioned earlier King is not ghoulish, but he is graphic. I found his images of a dog being brutally kicked to death and the antics of a serial killer unsettling. That being said, I can't imagine another way he could have bestowed the integrity of the characters on the reader.All of King's characters are rich and detailed. Enough information is given to set the tone of the character without being buried in description. They are people we have met and people that we know. King's imagery feels real from beginning to end leaving the reader with a sense of inclusion.I find his books not only entertaining but educational. The Dead Zone is 24 years old and still fits in with what is going on in our society. King's writing is laced with ethical, political and religious issues, never getting in the way of the story. His humourous sarcasm for society is everywhere and despite the content of the story I found myself chuckling. King is unafraid of the questions and provides the reader with his (or his characters) interpretation of the answers. It is well worth the read.[...]"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"A Review by KyleAs a young boy Johnny liked to ice skate, he wished he could play hockey with the big kids but he wasn't old enough, even though he was still going to get a taste of what it would be like. Johnny was just learning how to skate backwards when he got laid out by a huge hockey player everyone was afraid he would be dead, but he was alive and he woke up with a slight power to see into the future but it was not fully developed until he got older. An older Johnny now teaching high school was going to the fair with his girlfriend, she got sick so he took her home but he didn't know that he would not see her for the next four and a half years.This book was a great descriptive book such as this \\"Between these two was a picture of the almost totally demolished taxi, lying on its side like a dead dog.\\" Mr. King also lets you get to know the characters even before the enter the storyline, he tells the story of a door to door salesman named Greg Stillson and shows him as an evil man as he beats a dog to death. The only thing I didn't like was that it was hard to understand where he was going when he would jump off topic and talk about someone or something different such as when out of nowhere he started talking about how Sarah was dealing with Johnny being in a coma and how she started dating again.I think that this is a great book and it is a must read for adults but I would not let any children read it because it dose get sexual and there are many bad words."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"this is my favorite Stephen King novel.

Having got this from my local library, and read it in 3 days (despite my never bringing it to school), I now have started Cujo. Thank Goodness I read this first! The opening of Cujo discusses a sub-plot's ending. The sub-plot involves a murderer, and Johnny is contacted to stop him.If you haven't read any of the plot, here's a summary: Johnny Smith is put int a coma for 4 1/2 years. When he wakes up, his legs are broken (through the book, they heal), his girlfriend has married, and he has a psychic power he didn't ask for...My two complaints. 1. The opening that introduces Greg Stillson is CRUEL! Yes, King needed something to characterize him with, but KILLING A POOR DOG? I know you can do better, and less cruel things, to characterize people with. Try a mean-hearted conversation! 2. Why is the book (and part of Johnny's powers) called the Dead Zone? There is no dead people in the Dead Zone part of his powers, just numbers and addresses. It could have been called the Unclear Zone.If you are looking for an intro to King, get this. The other Castle Rock books probably spoil it.

This would be an excellent introduction to Stephen King for all 5 people in the country who have never read him."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This book is great and it comes in great shape :)It arrived before I expected but I won't complain about that 5/5"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Very nice addition to my library. I like the Library edition.It is easy to read, sturdy and feels good in my hand."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Wow, this novel was excellent from start to finish. I haven't read for a long time, because I am always so busy. I used to read Stephen King's novels all the time in high school, but ever since I graduated, I've stopped. The Dead Zone, is the first Stephen King book I have read in almost 5 years! I am so glad that I chose this one first. The story line is excellent, and the characters are very memorable! I even cried a little bit in some of it, because of how much emotion I felt from the characters and story. I would definitely recommend this book to any reader. This book got me back into reading, and I have already started The Stand! :)"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"There's no doubt in my mind that in 100 years people will be still reading and enjoying Stephen King's The Dead Zone as they did in 1980 and as they are now in 2012.The Dead Zone is timeless and one of King's finest works.The Dead Zone is the story of young teacher Johnny Smith who despite having an ordinary name is anything but. Johnny has a gift, a psychic gift. But it's not until Johnny is in an automobile accident which causes him to lapse into a four year long coma that his psychic gift is fully awoken. Johnny can see the future with the power of touch. The terrible future.With his new power Johnny must stop a crazed politician and figure out who the Castle Rock strangler is and more.Of course there's more to it then that! I didn't want to spoil anything but just give a light outlining of the book.The Dead Zone is one terrific book, being one of King's shorter books you tear right through it and are compelled from first page to the very last. What I personally loved about The Dead Zone is that despite being a bit shorter then some of his other novels you still get a true epic sense and it feels as full as any other one of his bricks.The book is broken into 3 partsWheel Of Fortune, The Laughing Tiger and Notes From The Dead Zone.You'll enjoy all three parts equally, believe me. You may even shed a tear by the final section :pJohnny Smith is a terrific character! One of King's most likable heroes. And all the supporting characters are equally as memorable.There isn't much else to say. Buy it! It's one of King's most iconic novels and well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Stephen King has written some great books and some good books in his career and I like this one a lot! It is a story about a man who is simply enjoying life and suddenly everything changes. Through fate, a dormant physic talent is awoken and Johnny is plunged into a role that he does not want or seek. There are no aliens or demons or monsters in this story, it is just a great tale of a man who can save the world from destruction. He must hurry though as his own death is nearing and he has to do the unthinkable, kill the man who will destroy the world.Johnny Smith has it all, a good job, his youth and a beautiful girlfriend. He loses it one night when he meets a semi-truck in a horrific accident. He is thrown into a coma for five years and miraculously he awakens. The medical staff at the nursing home he is in is stunned as no one expected him to ever recover. He soon finds that he has lost his former life and he is struggling to recover from the injuries and physical deterioration he experienced while in the coma.He discovers that he has a new and unexpected gift, a physic power that allows him to see visions of the past, present and future. While his power can be helpful it is also a burden and a drain on his life force to use it. He often has horrific visions obtained by simply touching someone and must live through them and try to help those that he can. He seeks isolation from others but he is put into a strange situation. What if you could change the future and save the world from destruction....This is just a spooky tale of a man trapped into making a decision to save the world. It is well written and you get an in depth character development and you will relate to the main protagonist in the story. This is one of Stephen King's best story telling books and I strongly recommend this to you!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"One of Stephen King's older books (1980), and a very good read.Slower paced them some of his books, King allows the time to develop his characters.Loved the ending... did not see it coming!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"You can definitely tell that this was one of his earlier works. I guess that I expected a different outcome. It just ended, it was almost like Stephen King got tired of writing the story and he just wanted to finish it."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone was the first book that I read from Stephen King. I'd heard about him and his books and how good he is in the terror genre, so I gave it a shot. And I have to say that I wasn't disapointed at all. It is well written, where the story builds itself throughout the book. Stephen introduces the characters in a way that at first you think \\"I don't get it. Why is this character showing up at this point?\\" but then as the story goes, everything and everyone starts to fall in its right place and the whole thing makes sense. Something that I was surprise is that this is kind of a thiller book, not a terror one."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This one is about a man who, after suffering a childhood head injury and then spending five years in a coma as an adult (what luck!), develops a psychic power. Specifically, when he touches people or objects he can see into the past as well as glimpse the future. The power proves to be both a gift and a curse, and the protagonist's struggles are interesting and believable. The story mostly takes place during the Nixon hangover of the 1970's and the theme of political corruption is dominant. King is a phenonmenal storyteller but this book occasionally illustrates why some do not consider him a first-rate writer. For example, consider this excerpt from the novel's major love scene: \\"Her fingers dug into him like spurs. Rider and ridden. Old wine decanted at last, a fine vintage.\\" If that doesn't induce a cringe, you probably need to read more. In the end, though, King delivers what you expect: a fun, easy read."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I can see why some people would have been a little put off by The Dead Zone when it came out. King was coming off an epic, The Stand, which followed the extremely successful horror novels Salem's Lot and The Shining, not to mention Carrie (which I see as more of a drama/thriller than horror). So here comes this short little political sci-fi novel about a psychic who can foresee danger. King had actually hinted at leaning towards corrupt government themes in the first half of The Stand, so the business about Greg Stillson and the deadly possibility of a man like him coming to power isn't so surprising. But at that time I don't how many fans were aware of his great affinity for old sci-fi movies and comics, so the lack of supernatural ghosts or monsters may have been somewhat of a let-down. Hindsight has shown that King was at his most visionary when imagining the future of politics and government, as so many elements of The Stand, The Dead Zone, and Firestarter now seem way too plausible in today's world. In fact, King has stated recently that a current popular politician reminds him eerily of Stillson, but I'll leave that for anyone interested to look up for themselves. The only thing that keeps The Dead Zone from being a five-star book is that the plot is a bit too loose. It reminds me a lot of King's Bachman book, Roadwork, in the way the main character seems to drift through a series of random events until coming to a realization of how he wants to finish his life and leave his mark on the world. If you can stick with King through some of the subplots, you'll enjoy a highly relevant look at the control powerful leaders have over shaping world history, and the far-reaching consequences of evil men attaining that control."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"the main character is a man with potential psychic powers. sometimes he get visions. then he falls into a coma after an accident. wakes up after a few years. his psychic powers truly awakened. there is a lot of things that happen, so i won't go into detail. mainly in this story he gets to know that a certain man will become president and start nuclear warfare. and he must stop it. there is a lot of things happening before this, as he gets to know a lot of thing. there are some good details here. and i enjoyed the basic plot. but there should be but one plot here. the other things happening are not really sub-plots, just happenings, losing their relevance as we get to know what is really important here. so reading this the first time is interesting, re-reading it has always been a downer for me. kills a little of the suspence too. a murderer has relevance e.g., but considering nuclear warfare he is a boring sidetrack. i got into the characters, nothing to complain about there. the ending worked well."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"First I just wanna say that I LOVE Stephen King novels. I think he is a spectacular author and I have read tons of books by him. However, I absolutely HATED this book. Here's why:1. It was way too long. Even for a Stephen King book. I thought it would never freaking end.2. There was no action. Or suspense. Or anything worth reading at all. There were just a bunch of pointless words.3. There wasn't enough psychic-ness for me which is what I thought the book would be mostly about.4. Just plain boring and a waste of time to read.However, I have to admit that the concept of this book is good I just did not have the attention span to read all the boring parts.

THIS IS DEFINETLY NOT HIS SCARIEST NOVEL, BUT IT STILL IS WORTH READING"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I agree with the many reviews that praise Stephen King, but I disagree that the Dead Zone ranks with his better work. Two reasons.First, I am often amazed with his other work how well it stands up to the test of time. For example, The Stand, Needful Things, and It are about thirty years old now (forgive me if one of them is more recent), but they contain only a few sentences that sound dated across some 2,000 pages. The Dead Zone does not share this particular strength. Part of the problem is inherent in the plot line of a character who is in a coma for several years and wakes up to find society changed. The changes look big to the character, and they would have looked big to a reader at the time, but they shrink in significance from today's perspective. Also, this book contains far more political references than the other books by King that I've enjoyed, and these references have a short shelf-life.The second reason I think this book is only so-so (by the elevated standard of a Stephen King work) is that I found myself skipping paragraphs toward the end. This is exactly the opposite reaction I have had to other work by King, where by the end I am using my hand to cover all the text except the sentence I am reading at the time. This particular book just isn't scary (or otherwise gripping, as in The Long Walk) the way other King stories are."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone is an excellent book about Johnny Smith, a young man who wakes up from a four and a half year coma and has the ability to se the future, or know unknown things about people. There are many subplots in this book, some of them including a disturbing serial killer and a psychotic politician named Greg Stillson. Stephen King makes sure we hate this man, for in the prologue he brutally kills a dog, and does other evil things.This book was very suspenseful and fast-paced, although it got overlongish in some spots, and when Johnny shakes the hand of Greg Stillson, it is not clear how Johnny comes to know about certain events, but overall The Dead Zone was an excellent book, and the characters are all likable enough: Sam Weizak, Sarah Hazlett, and Johnny's dad Herb. We of course hate the psychotic Stillson. Recommended"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"First off, I want all the Stephen King fans to know, that if you haven't read The Shining, Misery, It or The Stand, that you should definitely try those before you spend eight bucks on this novel. The beginning of this book starts off strong, but heading into the last 150 pages, you may feel your eyelids getting heavier, do to so much blah- blah- blah dialogue. This was my first Stephen King novel, and after reading The Dead Zone I hoped that none of King's other novels were like this. However, this book can be, at times, quite entertaining to read when King tells about Johnny's new and somewhat creepy &quot;abilities&quot; whenever he touches someone. The climax is quite surprising and I also liked the thorough backround info. about most of the main characters. This isn't Kings best work, but by all means purchase The Dead Zone if this review was helpful to you."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This impressive bit of work is about a psychic high school teacher who awakens from a coma and solves crimes.

This guy makes me want to write horror novels because I think it would help me get girls, and maybe I might get invited to a party or something. As it is now though, I know what I'm going to do, I'm going to read another one of Steve Kingsly's books. If you want to read one of them then you should beacause they are really good.

When he comes out of his coma he discovers his power with a nurse. He helps her infant-daughter to be saved from a blaze at her home when the child is alone while her mother is working. This power reveals the present. But then the power his enlarged with the doctor, Dr Weizak, a Polish Jew who survived the assault of Hitler on Poland in 1939. The doctor thinks his mother is dead. But the vision reveals she is alive, living in the US, married under another name. The doctor will call her but will not talk to her, because it was not meant to be . This power thus reveals the past and the present. This historical event and the beginning of the Shoah, at least for the Polish Jews, is essential in the dramatic construction of the book. In another case, John Smith will be able to reveal the future, and hence influence the present to change it, and along with the present to change the foreseen future. A young boy he is tutoring in English would die in an ice-hockey event. The boy is advised not to go and he doesn't go, though his father is sponsoring this event. The father does not cancel the event. The accident on the ice takes place , but the boy is safe. So John Smith can change the outcome of an event, hence the future, quite naturally by having an influence on the decisions of the protagonists in the present. This sounds like Back to the Future, but it is not the same thing because in another novel, The Langoliers, in Four Past Midnight (New American Library, New York, 1990), Stephen King shows his vision of time : there is no past because everything is eaten up by the langoliers and there is no future because the future is just the waiting for the coming present. Hence the past is death and the future is the promise of life, but life is nothing but the present. So the past is memory and the future is imagination. You cannot travel in time. But the real core of the book is his meeting with a candidate to the Senate. It appears, in the subsequent vision when John Smith shakes his hand, that he will be President of the United States and will start the final atomic holocaust, the total human Shoah, out of pure craziness, pride and egocentric selfishness. Then John Smith asks for advice from Dr Weizak and the question is : If, knowing what you know now, you, could go back to 1933, would you kill Hitler ? The answer is, without any hesitation : Yes I will kill the son of a bitch. on the ground of his medical mission to protect and save human lives. Then John Smith prepares the killing of that politician. He will not succeed and he will be killed by the bodyguard. But the politician will reveal himself as a coward by protecting his life with a baby used as a human shield. The picture of this stance published on the cover of Newsweek will destroy his political future and he will shoot himself. This last means to achieve such a goal (the destroying of the politician), the use of the press is common in Stephen King's novels. Let's quote : Firestarter (The Rolling Stone magazine), The Stand (a local TV station that is captured by US military forces), The Running Man (a TV game show that turns sour for the organizers in a clearly science-fiction book), etc. But, in The Dead Zone, the Shoah is used as the dramatic turning point in the novel, justifying the right for a citizen to kill a dangerous politician when he knows the latter shall jeopardize the whole of humanity in the future."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I have read many books, and I am amazed at how boring and pointless Dead Zone is. The book could have been 1/10th the size to tell the story (if there really is a story). Most of the book is written about irrelevant events. For example, King drones on about Johnny teaching some guy to read; it drags and drags and at the end of the day, it is utterly pointless and seriously uninteresting. Most of the book is like this. It is one of the only books I began to skim through because it was so pointless and boring."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This is the first Stephen King novel I read. I approached this book expecting a horror/thriller ride, but this book was no where close to what I had expected. The plot takes a disproportionate length of the book to build to the climax.

If you took out all the political mumbo jumbo filler, this would have just been a novella, perhaps one of King's infamous long short stories.

I'll think about Herb for a long, long time. The rest were okay, just your bland average Americans concerned about bland things."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"So far I've read \\"Carrie,\\" \\"'Salem's Lot,\\" \\"The Shining,\\" and this book by Stephen King. I also tried to read the \\"complete, and uncut\\" version of \\"The Stand\\" alongside \\"The Cider House Rules\\" by John Irving, but couldn't stand either and threw them in the trash. After reading his first four novels, I was expecting a story with some powerful force driving it like a sense of destiny. That was the case of all four of the novels that came before this. But when I started reading this story, it became apparent by the middle of the book that it had run out of gas.Basically, this is a love story disguised as some important psychic dilemma of knowing the future and preventing disaster. John Smith wakes up from a coma with the power to see the future whenever he touches someone or something. It doesn't always happen but when it does both Johnny and the person are aware something is going on through getting bad vibes. The start of the book begins with a date at a county fair that ends with a cab ride home that puts Johnny in this coma. The woman on the date, Sarah Bracknell, ends up marrying someone else and having a son before Johnny wakes up after nearly 5 years.John wakes up in the hospital and we go through the interesting journey of his recovery as well as his new power. He causes a bit of a stir at the Maine hospital he's in but just as his power is causing controversy and he gets attention for being able to legitimately sense the future, he ends up retreating to his father's house. The story takes a turn towards more narrative and this psychic power doesn't develop into anything.This happens throughout the whole novel. While going through the central storyline, King throws in a couple of baddies that do some mischief but none of those characters add much to the main story. As at the hospital, just as his powers are building up to something, he turns tail and hides out to a new location. By the time we focus on the last baddie--this time it's a corrupt politician from the post-Watergate era of the '70s--the only reason why he seems to become the final focus of the novel is, get this, simply because it's a past-time Johnny has picked up during the time of the Bicentennial campaign season. It's just a hobby the hero of this book has picked up to pique his curiosity as he goes around to political rallies shaking hands with candidates, including Jimmy Carter. One in particular catches his interest while he's tutoring a wealthy businessman's son. We observe Johnny for a couple years with notebooks of newspaper clippings and research done of the bad guy, Greg Stillson.Eventually, to make a long story short, Johnny develops brain cancer and decides to use the time he has left to assassinate the baddie in a crappy, small town-hall meeting in some broken down ski resort town in New Hampshire. And finally, in that last chapter when he has his \\"shooter\\" moment, we learn what that bad thing is that he's going to cause: a nuclear war. Before this the only thing King tells us that's violent or wicked about him is beating up a dog when he was a young man and a travelling Bible salesman. Oh yeah, he also blackmails a banker with photos of him cheating on his wife with some waitress to secure funds for his run to public office. And somewhere, he throws in an FBI agent conducting an \\"investigation\\" on Mr. Stillson who is later found dead.I may have spoiled the book for anybody who hasn't read it yet, but the problem with this book is simple: the only thing that drives this novel is \\"what is Johnny going to do next?\\" That question could lead to a great novel or this very flat, bland read. John Smith is not terribly interesting. His brief romantic connection with his carnival date, Sarah Bracknell, later Sarah Hazlett, is the only real interesting character here. But Johnny and Sarah end up cheating in the barn of his dad's farm in chapter 15, and then she's gone for the rest of the novel.I just finished reading \\"Let Me In\\" also called \\"Let The Right One In\\" by John Lindqvist and this book suffered from a similar problem as that one. Suffice it to say John Smith was as interesting as all those '80s Swedish drunks in Lindqvist's novel that kept dying and being eaten by vampires while trying to figure out how to make ends meet.I'll start \\"Firestarter\\" in a week. Hope it's better than this."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"In the Dead Zone, we find a different Stephen King then one is accustomed too. Gone is the sometimes wordy, (sorry Steve, but you knew that, right?), and clustered, apocalyptic, monster filled tales that one generally associates with Steve King, (which is a shame really, he is quite frankly a much better writer than most of those ignorant minds tend to believe, (I'm talking to you English Teachers!!!). Present here is a more restraint Mr. King, a softer, less horrific one, and the result is one the best novels ever written by Mr. Boogeyman, or any other author now that I think of it. The story of the painfully ordinary John Smith, (the name tells you how ordinary he is), and the tragic results of a car crash and the birth of his new power/curse is definitely Essential King. It's less scary than, say, Pet Semetary, or The Shining, but in my opinion, a much better read than them, (well maybe not the Shining, that kicked). Anyway, enough of my banter, pick yourself up and go read this book already!!!!- Slash669@hotmail.com"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I was excited to finally read The Dead Zone (one of the few early Stephen King novels I haven't yet read). I'd seen theDavid Cronenberg movie, so I was already familiar with the gist of the story: Young Johnny Smith is a popular teacher with a bright future when an accident puts him in a coma for four years. He awakens to find that the world has changed and he has changed. Touching another person will give him uncontrollable psychic flashes, which turns out to be more of a curse than a blessing.This felt like Stephen King's first crack at a 'mature' novel. The pacing was much more deliberate than in his earlier books. Not to say that the book is boring. Just that King invested a lot more time in developing his characters (something he'd been very good good at since'Salem's Lotat least), making them feel ever more real.Johnny's mother Vera (for example) goes through a religious mania in the book, grasping at some pretty outrageous beliefs regarding aliens and U.F.O.s. It would have been easy to make this character comic relief, even unintentionally. Yet King handles her so well, making her very sympathetic even when you become exasperated with her.The other major characters of the novel; Johnny, his one-time fiance Sarah and his father Herb are all adeptly handled.Stephen King's writing is in top form here. There's a section early in the novel where he plays a wheel of fortune at a county carnival. This scene is written with the level of page-turning intensity of a heist scene. Though The Dead Zone is less blatant about its horror and suspense than Carrie, 'Salem's Lot orThe Shininghe was still able to keep me eagerly reading. I would be totally enveloped in the book on a break at work and would be angry that my break was over.I also appreciate that King seems to have done his homework. When he writes about something, it never feels like he's winging it. For instance, when reading about Johnny's recovery from the coma he puts in enough detail to show that he has done his research and knows what he is talking about. There is enough detail of various medical procedures given to give the book a sense of verisimilitude that is often missing from horror stories. Yet he doesn't bog down in useless trivia.The Dead Zone seems to be the first novel where SK started openly linking his works. He doesn't bang the reader over the head about it, but fans will spot offhand references to Jerusalem's Lot, Flagg Street, Richard Dees and Inside View, Stovington Prep and of course we pay our first visit to Castle Rock.Yet for all the good stuff here there was something just... off about the novel. The structure of the novel seemed really weird. As I read it I felt like I was reading a novella that had been uncomfortably expanded into a novel by jamming another novella into the middle of it.In the beginning we follow Johnny and we follow a deranged Bible salesman named Stillson. Then there's a series of murders in Castle Rock that takes up the middle of the book and goes away again. Then we follow Johnny and Stillson again. The whole Castle Rock section of the book (while interesting) really it could have been cut and the book probably wouldn't have felt vastly different.King's writing is the saving grace here. Even with the trouble I had the book is well worth reading. But I can see why it isn't mentioned as often as The Shining orThe Stand."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Johnny damages part of his brain while inadvertently interfering with a hockey game. He goes down hard and blacks out. Some years later, he has a mysterious incident with his girlfriend at the time, Sarah. They are at the local fair and he decides to try his luck by playing The Wheel of Fortune. As the wheel spins, it continuously lands on the number he chooses, as the money gets higher and higher in his favor, but apparently this symbolizes that his luck is going to run out sooner or later. Run out it does, as the taxi he is coming home from his girlfriend's house gets into a head on collision with another vehicle, leaving the taxi driver dead, and Johnny deep in a coma.The Dead Zone begins strong, fast paced and entertaining. We are pulled into the surreal fascination of the carnival, the wheel of fortune, and how this is all going to play out. King uses language brilliantly in the novel's opening scenes, leaving the reader with a desperate need to find out what it really going on with Johnny. After Johnny awakens some years later from his coma, he finds out the whole world has changed. His girlfriend is now married, his dad had given up home, and his mom has gone a bit off her rocker in dealing with religious cults. All of this comes as a shock to Johnny, but the biggest shock of all is his extraordinary gift that he has. He can, by touching a person, or something belonging to them, see into their future, or see what has already taken place, but certain aspects of his clairvoyant vision are blocked, and he can't always figure out the whole picture. This is the area of his psychic vision Johnny calls \\"the dead zone\\". Most of the time the things he sees are not positive, which is a sure indicator that danger is coming. Basically there are two remaining plots from here: 1. Johnny's attempt to find a serial killer, and 2. Johnny's battle to stop someone from becoming president. I dare not give anything else away.The Dead Zone is much like a roller coaster ride, with a highly charged beginning and ending. The ending is fantastic, which makes the book much better than it would be otherwise, due to King's unflinching message coming through at the end. Aside from the beginning and the ending, the rest of the plot is fairly conventional, with not a whole lot of originality. It definitely has its ups and downs. I don't know how effective the book is in dealing what appears to be two totally different stories. One plot is about a murderer in New England, and the other is with an \\"aspiring to be\\" president, who could do much damage if elected. I think The Dead Zone would have been stronger if King would have just focused on the latter. That is where the majority of the power in the novel comes from. Yet, it does work both ways and having said that, I did enjoy reading The Dead Zone. Exciting, entertaining, and among King's better works It certainly is no masterpiece when compared to books like The Shining, The Green Mile, or Pet Cemetery. It does have one of the better endings I have read in his books, uncompromising and honest. Unless you were Johnny, you probably would have never seen it coming.Grade: B+"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I read this book and i loved it so much........I can't stop thinking abour how good it is!!!!!!!And then i saw the movie and it was Okay,BUT THIS BOOK IS A HELL OF A LOT (...)

As I was reading it, I never wanted to stop. The main character was described very well, and his actions seemed to have merit. I had no problem with the basic premise of the story. The one problem I had was his ability to sense things by touching them. If he had this power he would have gone mad with images from everything around him giving him signals from the past or future. He would of had to live in a bubble to not get totally engossed by everything. Besides that one thing that annoyed me, I enjoyed this book fully. I put that flaw aside, and read the story for what it was, and it was very good reading. The author has characters you love or hate immeadiatly, and you remember the characters when you put the book down. I always thought that if you put a book down and think about the story weeks later, then it must have been a pretty good book. This novel is one of those books. The ending took me a little by surprise, but then I thought of who the author was, and thought that to myself that the ending he came up with was approriate. A book well worth reading."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Anyone who loves Stephen King's work needs to read this book! It is one of the hardest to put down! I would recommend this book to everyone!"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone by Stephen King is a fabulous book. From the very beginning the reader is drawn into the story and is left hanging on to the edge of you seat with every turn of the page.The book is about a high school teacher, John Smith, who gets in a car accident and stays in a coma for four years. As everyone was giving up on John coming out of his coma, he wakes up. But Johnny does not come back completely normal, he comes back with something extra, which enables him to touch people, objects, anything and recieve images, words, information about the people or the people that held them.But he soon starts to despise his gift, &quot;This is my gift, this is also my curse,&quot; and refuses to use it. People send him things and want him to tell them what he sees. But then brutal murders start to occur and the local sheriff asks him for his help. He tells Johnny that he is his last resort. At first he refuses to help, but soon his own guilt gets the better of him. And so starts a mystery that will leave you in suspense and keep you wondering what will happen next.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in mystery, suspense, or things that deal with the supernatural."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I like Stephen King's writing a lot and in my opinion this is his best work. The Dead Zone is a preety good book that displays all of King's virtuoso writing talents. King knows how to write memorable and engaging characters. In the Dead Zone he creates his best progtagonist yet, Johnny Smith.Besides all the memorable characters King has written, I also like the pacing of his storytelling. There is nothing rushed or hurried, nor slow or contrived about it. It just has a natural flow to it. King might be the best natural writer on the market today. When you read King's work you almost feel like your watching a movie play out in your mind. He creates atmosphere and mood so easily and effortlessly you wonder how he pulls it off.I recommend this book if you're new to Stephen King. It's a compelling read that is enjoyable from the first page turned to the last. Also, I recommend his latest memoir, &quot;Stephen King On Writing&quot;."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The psychological thriller aspect of The Dead Zone is great. The concept is great. John Smith as a hero is great, if not tragic. What prevented the book from being great, in my opinion, was the lack of peripheral character development. Too many characters, not enough time, I suppose, which is probably a hazard of the trade. Other than that, however, the storyline was very interesting and thought-provoking, a welcome diversion from King's usual fare of gore-splattered horror (which I'm a sucker for as well). I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone is one of Stephen King's best novels, a tale rich in every way. It's well-told, with excellent characters, loaded with symbolism and shocking events (oftentimes both), and full of the plainspoken yet lyrical prose that is King at his best. There is little in King's long and excellent list of titles that can surpass this novel.We'll start with the basic story. A young teacher named Johnny Smith is \\"gifted,\\" through a car accident that leaves him comatose for nearly five years, with a strange precognitive/telepathic ability. And here's the catch, evidence of King's genius if ever I've seen it: He has to be touching a person or object for the power to work. King takes this startlingly simple (and original) idea, and weaves it into the most complex, and intriguing, tapestry of his career.King does a lot -- and I mean a LOT -- with this novel. Take the prologue, which so expertly sets mood, and tone, and character -- Johnny shows early flashes of his power, while the villain of the piece, Greg Stillson, kicks a dog to death in a dooryard outside Ames, Iowa. King literally takes you from one extreme to the other here, does so brilliantly, and continues to do so for the rest of the novel, as Johnny and Stillson are set on their inexorable collision course. But the novel is much more than that, as well. It's the story of Johnny and Sarah, who might've been his wife if not for intervening circumstances; it's the story of Johnny and his parents, Herb and Vera, a loving couple who find separate ways of dealing with Johnny's misfortune; it is the story of Johnny and the Chatsworths, a rich New England family whose son Johnny tutors ... and it is the story of Johnny and one Frank Dodd, a character as frightening as any King has created.All the way through, of course, this is Johnny's story -- and in John Smith, King has outdone himself. Johnny, in just about every way you'd care to imagine, represents us, the average person -- the name alone is a dead giveaway. (Some have said the symbolism of the name is crude -- absolutely not! King has always gone for the larger symbols along with more subtle ones.) His reactions are our reactions -- never made more clear than during the press conference at the hospital, where he looks on in abject horror at what his own power has done to a reporter there. It's a tense moment, in a novel full of them.King deals in many levels of symbolism in The Dead Zone, symbols of fate, fortune, and God's will (the three being interchangeable in King's Calvinistic view); fortune wheels, omens, Vera's obsession with the more hysterical and relevatory aspects of Christianity (she could've stepped out of a Flannery O'Connor story), the seller of lightning rods (used, much as Bradbury used him, as a harbnger of doom), the mythical resonances of Cassandra and the abiguity of the Delphic Oracle, the Biblical references to Jonah as Johnny runs from himself, his power, and finally from fate and God -- again, interchangeable from King's point of view. There is also the brilliant use of the Jekyll/Hyde mask, one of the most elegant pieces of symbolism in the novel.But let me get back to the Calvinist attitude here -- which I've mentioned a couple of times, and by which I don't mean conservative and/or repressed. Instead I refer to the Calvinist notion that everything that happens, even things like \\"luck\\" and \\"fortune,\\" is predetermined, willed by God. And though we as human beings have free will to defy or not defy our fates, the fact remains (as Mother Abigail pointed out in The Stand) that this is what God wants from us. That's the statement at the heart of The Dead Zone; it is what John Smith, King's reluctant hero (another powerful myth-figure) miust face at last, in what is one of King's most powerful novels. It is a cornerstone of an King library, and should definitely be in yours right now. Think of it as -- Fate."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Johnny Smith is a seemingly normal guy -- who becomes psychic! He's an English teacher in a small Maine town called Castlerock, and he's one of those guys that more straight-laced teachers tend to dislike as a fellow teacher, but the kind'a guy that the kids really love. He's funny, sincere, sensitive, intelligent -- something of a goof -- but an all-around really great guy. \\"The Dead Zone\\" is a very readable melodrama of his descent into a world where he can see people's future just by touching them. If he touches you and sees that you are gonna die in four days!....he can tell you not to go into work -- because he knows a gunman is gonna open fire on you and your fellow employees!That is his dilemma. And the engaging depth to The Dead Zone is that it becomes a moral dilemma of severe proportions. Because when Johnny touches a state politician and sees that this buffoon of a politician will get elected president and will cause a massive war -- the question becomes: is it better to kill this one person and save the lives of millions, or to let nature take its course and let millions and millions of people die. And of course no one would understand Johnny if he explained that he saw the future and saw that this politician was gonna cause a nuclear holocaust. King builds to this crescendo of a moral nightmare by constantly showing Johhny being torn between living up to his gift and being viewed as a tabloid psychic, a total hokester, and a creapy guy whom people don't even wanna get near. It's the story about living with an abnormal mental gift.One of the more compelling sub-plots involves Johnny's love story with Sarah Hazlett -- a woman herself torn between waiting nearly five years for Johhny to come out of a coma and getting on with her life with the very normal Walt Hazlett. It this respect, The Dead Zone blends the elements of a psychic phenomenon story and a compelling love story.All-in-all this story reads like the perfect synthesis between King's \\"The Shining\\" and \\"Shawshank Redemption.\\" And may well be a great place for folks who wanna read a King novel but don't want the blood n' guts of Cujo, Pet Semetary, Salems' Lot. On the other hand, if you want a real nightmare story The Dead Zone is not the place to start. Now, go ahead, and click that \\"helpful\\" button! Afterall, one of my major concerns in writing this review is knowing that I am helpful:~) Peace, love, and happy reading!Stacey CochranAuthor of CLAWS available for 80 cents"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I've read most of what Stephen King has read, including the outstanding novel &quot;The Stand&quot; and the amazingly suspenseful and strangely poignant &quot;The Long Walk,&quot; which remains the only novel to genuinely scare me. However, no story by King has been as compelling, as emotional, and as well-written as his 1979 gem, &quot;The Dead Zone.&quot;The protagonist is as simple as the name he is given--Johnny Smith--and early in the novel the reader discovers that he has the ability to see into the future somewhat. A bit later on, Johnny gets in a severe car accident and stays in a coma for four and a half years. When he awakens, the world has changed completely. Vietnam is no longer the central issue of America, Richard Nixon has been impeached, and a young hotshot named Greg Stillson is attempting to run for the Presidency in 1980, the latter incident being a major subplot which will culminate in a shocking conclusion.Also giving the novel its depthness is the love story regarding Johnny and his sweetheart prior to the accident, but who is married upon his awakening--the woman he loved more than anyone, a woman named Sarah Bracknell.There is also an intriguing subplot dealing with a serial killer as well as one regarding the trials and tribulations of an academically struggling football player in high school.All in all, this novel is gripping from start to finish, and its effect resonates long after it has been read. There is a big moral issue to contemplate throughout the novel--how should Johnny Smith use his powers? Johnny himself posed the question: &quot;If you could go back in time and had the chance to kill Hitler, would you do it?&quot;This is my favorite Stephen King novel, and I anticipate reading it again sometime and knowing I'll have to wipe the beginnings of tears from the corner of my eye--the ending is very powerful, you see..."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Occasionally a book will come along and it'll affect you in a place you had completely forgotten about. It'll leave a feeling behind that will encompass everything, like a hit below the belt. One of the first books I read for personel pleasure was Crime and Punishment, to this day I consider it the best ever written. Not for any real reason other than it hit me below the belt harder than any other book, and it was the first time for me. I was like a blushing bride on her wedding day...Anyway.Every so often I'll run into a book like that, that hits me somewhere that doesn't get hit too often. I won't bore you with the names of those books, but this one, this &quot;horror&quot; novel did just that. I'm not an emotional guy, but I could feel tears welling up near the end. The only other time in my life that's happened (besides when I was a little tike, ya know) was when Raskolnikov and Sonia professed their love for one another. That was powerful for a thirteen year old boy. This book was no less powerful for me, and I'm a little older than thirteen; not much, but older still. I won't reveal too much of the story, I'd hate to ruin it. God, I wish I could be more expressive, but we all have our deficiencies. I guess.Use your own judgement. If you want a book that will move you, a book that will make you feel alive, a book that you will remember for the rest of your life if you're anything like me, pick up the Dead Zone. It's as close as you'll get.At least in my experience.I've read a large assortment of books, about as ecclectic as you can get, or at least as ecclectic as I can get. My personal library is over a thousand volumes, and I've read just about every one. I say this not to boast, but to put in perspective how much I love reading. I abhor TV, and I'm privileged with the ability to read exceedingly fast. It took me three hours to read this novel, THREE HOURS! I don't know about you, but I can't say I've read a 400+ page book in three hours.I'm sure in the future I'll return to this novel many a time, but it'll never have the affect on me like the first time. It's like heroin, a good book: the first time is the best.And it hits you before you know it.Enjoy. I truely hope you buy this book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I'll admit that I was a little thrown at first by this book. I came across this one while I was working my way through a chronological review of King's literature, and this one happens to fall behind what most people consider to be his masterpiece, The Stand. To be sure, The Stand is an excellent book, particularly with regard to the method by which it blends religious issues with contemporary tone and plot matter, and there was a lot of plot matter to blend with. The result was that this book left me feeling a little empty at first. There just wasn't as much there as I was used to. This was a bit of a departure for King--his previous two novels had been a little bit removed from the more intimate, individual picture that you're given in this book. The ultimate truth, however, is that this book is not just believable, but memorable. I'm not sure how he hit the nail on the head so well with Johnny Smith, but this is perhaps one of the best characters that he's ever crafted, and I mean ever. It's often difficult to relate to the situations that show up in King's writing (really, now, how many of us have been sucked into an alternate reality by a demon living in the body of a small boy or survived a nation-slaying plague), but in this book Steve manages to blend the unknown (psychic power) with the familiar (the world we live in) with startling effectiveness. Basically, I have to give this book five stars if only because I still find myself thinking about it sometimes. The characterizations are all excellent, and the ethical issues that form the heart of the novel are certainly worth considering. Most of all, this book makes you feel as though you're actually reading about a man living in a world, instead of a world going on around a group of men. Events are written in a way that sound believable and very similar to our own world--it's worth noting that this was the novel debut of his Castle Rock setting, in a move that I found particularly interesting. The story about the Castle Rock Strangler blends effortlessly into the rest of the plot, forming a rich backdrop against which Smith's mind and predicament can be showcased. Now, it's worth noting that the movie translation isn't worth have a crap on a crutch. In fact, I think I pretty much owe that movie for the fact that I can no longer think about Smith without attaching Christopher Walken's startling features to him (even though that was not how I originally envisioned him--I thought more of a person who was, um, you know, likeable), or Martin Sheen with the book's &quot;villain.&quot; Overall, this is a fine piece of literature that I would recommend for any reader with a little bit of time available--you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone is one of the best fictional novel ever written by Stephen King. The story grabs the reader's attention and sets a good imagery because of the suspense and descriptive details. John (Johnny) Smith the main character of the fictional novel is a psychic. As a psychic, John Smith uses his powers to help save people from catastrophes. For example; He had saved the life of a student who he was tutoring, Chuck Chatsworth, from attending a graduation party that was going to be struck down by lighting. Stephen King also wrote a book called It, a very powerful and scary story similar to The Dead Zone. For those of you who are a Stephen King lover, or who want to get a glimpse of a frightening and shocking thrill, then give The Dead Zone a try. I promise you that once you have picked up a copy and have read a few chapters of the book, you will not want to stop."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Once you start reading this book it just grabs you and you'll stay hooked from start until finish. All the characters are so real and amazing. King is the true maestro of horror-thriller fiction. Unbeatable. Ignore his newer works like Gerald's Game, Rose Madder (the worst!), Insomnia or The Green Mile. The Dead Zone is THE Classic Stephen King masterpiece. I've read it 3 times over the last 5 years, and frankly I wouldn't mind picking it up again. The story is very original - the villain in the book was is so evil and real, you just pray you would never meet such a person in real life. And the main character/hero, you just emphatize with him - he who lost years of his life due to a coma and when he woke up was &quot;rewarded&quot; with a cursed psychic power he couldn't control and which he dreads. If you've read the book, you could compare it with the movie starring Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen. Excellent movie! I highly recommend this book to all fiction-enthusiasts. This book ranks among my all time favourites. Other King's books which are similarly well written are Firestarter, The Dark Half, It and Misery. I'm a quarter into his latest book - Bag of Bones. It's OK so far but nothing like The Dead Zone. You really must read it to know fully what I mean."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I have been a Stephen King fan for 14 years and still have notread all of his books. Each time I find one that I have not read yet,I open it and begin my journey. I found The Dead Zone absolutely great reading. I would recommend it to any Stephen King reader who has not had a chance to catch this one. Even though I was only about 5 years old in the early '70s, I found reading this book very entertaining and found myself easily drawn to the era. I think that alot of people have always wanted to have the ability to see into the future or know someone's true past, just as the main character, Johnny Smith, has come to possess in this book. But, have we ever stopped to think of the consequencies of having that power? The Dead Zone definetly gives you the opportunity to think about it. A MUST READ THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS! END"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I believe that Stephen King considers this his best book. I'm not sure I can go that far, but it is very good. I assume you know the plot, what with the TV series and movies and all. I just re-watched the movie (which is one of the better King adaptations, by the way) and I realized why so many King movies turn bad: King movies are about scary things - the books are about people, who scary things happen to. If you ever doubt King's mastery of characterization, read this book."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I finished reading Stephen King's &quot;On Writing&quot; and decided to read &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; next, since he wrote about its genesis at some length. What interested me in particular is that he commented that &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; was one of the only novels for which he ever wrote an outline.I could almost feel that structure as I read the book. The action is well-paced, and unlike many other King novels, it doesn't really stray too far from its purpose. From the beginning, you are almost certain of what will happen, but you are compelled to read anyway. And, of course, there's a twist. There has to be in a story like this.This book is a great exploration of the age-old cocktail party question: &quot;If you could have killed Hitler as an infant, knowing what he would do when he rose to power, would you do it?&quot;I think Stephen King may have an answer.Recommended to SK fans and suspense fans."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"It could be better? I don't know, but Stephen King could keep the story much longer if he wanted to and make all of his fans much more happy doing what they do best, read Stephen King's books!

Four stars just because it finished so fast I couldn't imagine I have read the full story."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"\\"The Dead Zone\\" is Stephen King's best novel, but it is not the best Stephen King novel.Illogical? No, not when you realize \\"The Dead Zone\\" is something of a departure for the horror maven. John Smith is called upon to deal with horrible things, and otherworldly things, but the two things are not as connected as they are in other King novels.Smith is an unprepossessing teacher whose long-forgotten childhood ability to flash on precognitive moments comes back with a vengeance when he awakens from a four-and-a-half-year-long coma with the ability to discern a person's future just by touching his or her hand. That ability lands him in hot water when he finds himself obsessed by a cagey politician whose submerged dark side threatens global catastrophe.King challenges his readers with a book that eschews easy answers and poses some fairly uncomfortable ideas about civic duty. In line with the book's Oswaldian ending, I'm surprised it's not a lot more controversial. Maybe that's a byproduct of how good the novel is.I don't think King was ever as economical a writer as he was here. Published in 1979, just a year after his gargantuan \\"The Stand\\", King covers a lot of ground in just over 400 pages, including a love story, a murder mystery, a political thriller, and much of the entire 1970s. It's rich in characterization, philosophy, and especially religion. King keeps coming back here to the concept of God and man from several viewpoints, fundamentalist, atheist, and Deist among them, reaching a vision of supernatural oversight at once loving and harrowing, and eminently sensible in King's world and ours.\\"Anything we don't understand, anything that doesn't fit into our scheme of the way things are, we just file it under S for subconscious, right? The twentieth-century god.\\"That there are things undreamt of in our philosophies is a common King theme - given his milieu he can hardly help it - but \\"The Dead Zone\\" feels like the one time he successfully folded that idea into everyday life.King's mastery of the moment is on fine display, whether he puts us in an operating room while Smith undergoes painful surgery or in a house where Smith is trying to tutor a slow learner. He also does a terrific job planting seeds, many of which we hardly notice as we rush to get back to the main story about Smith but come a cropper later on. (Ah, so that was why we met that lightning-rod salesman!) It's easy to imagine another writer, even a good one, breaking out the mad killer story into another novel, but the way King folds it into his main narrative is nothing short of sensational.And what an ending! I don't think I've read one that produced as many goose bumps, though again, not the kind normally associated with King. The only thing wrong with \\"The Dead Zone\\" is that King wrote it too early in his career; he set himself too high a bar."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"In \\"The Dead Zone\\", the master of the macabre, the prolific Stephen King mixes the supernatural with a healthy dose of adversity to create the saga of the unfortunate Johnny Smith. Smith, a Maine native was a fledgling but popular school teacher just at the onset of a developing adult life. He had met Sarah Bracknell, another teacher who had potential to be Smith's long range significant other. They went on a date to a local carnival where Smith in frightening fashion had a long inexplicable streak of good luck guessing numbers on the Wheel of Fortune. This however is where Smith's luck ran out.After dropping off Sarah, Smith hired a cab for the ride back home. Enroute the cab was involved in a horrific highway accident producing multiple fatalities. Smith, though he survived, lay comatose for 4 1/2 years. Time marched on and Sarah eventually married. Smith's parents Herb and Vera's lives gradually got torn apart as medical expenses and their anxieties about Johnny's vegetative state grew.Miraculously however, Smith awakened from his coma. He did so with the power is foresee the future. His remarkable clairvoyance was triggered when he made physical contact with either a person or an item. His neurologist Dr. Weizak speculated that this power was facilitated by a nasty head first fall Smith took as a child that had produced brain scarring. In combination with the coma, Smith's clairvoyance was born.Smith eventually got on with his life after undergoing multiple surgeries to regain control of his limbs which had atrophied badly. He became celebrated as a psychic although he was reluctant to use his gift. By chance, he encountered local politician Greg Stilson at a political rally, shaking hands with him. The vibes he received told him that Stilson, a shady crooked bully of a man who rose to power using fear, blackmail and violence would lead his followers down a path of destruction.King plays out the drama to it's inexorable tragic conclusion as Johnny Smith follows what he believes to be his calling as outlined to him by his clear vision of the future."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This book kept me up at nights until I finished it in record time. Not because it was so scary but because it was such a good story. The main charecter seems so familiar to somebody you know ,especially growing up in a northern town in the 70's. The part of the book that talks about being in the coma, and walking up and down the hallways with the dead man,THE HALLWAYS OF ALWAYS. That part still sticks with me today,and maybe the scariest thing is always being alone with death. The scope of the story was huge, save the world, but the main charecter was a small average Joe. Pure Stephen King at his finest. Normal people in an extreme situation."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This is a classic King novel with superbly written support characters especially John's father Herb, and girlfriend Sarah letting you really feel the emotions of what they are all going through.John Smith is a popular high school teacher and with a beautiful colleague as a girlfriend life couldn't be better. In fact Sarah has promised him he will get lucky with her for the first time once their date at the county fair ends. On the way out the Wheel of Fortune beckons and John is on the luckiest streak of his life. For Sarah though a bad hotdog means John's lucky streak has hit a hurdle and after seeing her home and to bed postpones their first time and gets in a cab home. The taxi never makes it there and for six years John lies a coma where everyone except his extremely religious mother assumes he will eventually die, in fact most wish for his sake that he mercifully will. They all know that even if he does awake he will be a vegetable with severe brain damage and not the bright intelligent man before the accident. Of course they are 99.9% sure he won't make it at all. Sarah reluctantly moves on with her life, gets married and has a child.One night John shocks doctors and wakes up, what is even more shocking to John is that he can see glimpses of the future through touching those around him. John has to not only learn to walk again, get his life back on track and cope with the fact that Sarah has moved on, his father has aged and his mother has gone insane but also deal with the burden of this new power. Amongst other things John always pondered the question to his students, if you came across a time machine and could go back in time, with all that you now know would you kill Hitler before his rampage of evil started? John learns a lot about people he shakes hands with and has to decide on the answer to this question for himself."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Stephen King has been known to write mostly horror. But when he writes something outside of horror (The Green Mile, Different Seasons, The Dark Tower series) they're sometimes better. The Dead Zone is no exception.The Dead Zone begins with our protagonists Johnny Smith encountering an accident on the ice in 1953 when he's just five or six years old. This incident begins his series of \\"flashes\\" where he can see certain things before they happen.Later,in the year 1970, Johnny gets involved in a car accident that puts him in a coma for four years. A lot happens in those four years, and Stephen King will touch on just about all of it. There's a man named Greg Stillson running around becoming a member of the house of represenatives, a series of grisly murders that runs rampant, and of course, The Watergate Scandal happened. When Johnny comes out of the coma in 1974 he's exposed to the changes of his world. His recovery is miraculous, but now his power has increased. By a single touch of your hand, or a photo--some sort of possession--Johnny can learn things about you. He helps his doctor find his mother, a nurse find out her house is catching fire.All this doesn't go without media attention, and Johnny gets it. As he tries to evade the media, and control his power, he begins getting packages of people wanting to know things about their loved ones because Johnny is \\"psychic\\". What Johnny can't explain is when he sees something but not the whole picture. A truth that could be prevented that gets lost in what he calls \\"The Dead Zone.\\"He helps a police officer catch a murderer, and when he meets Greg Stillson, he learns that in many many years (possibly 1992) Greg is going to send America straight to hell in a nuclear war. It's up to Johnny to prevent this from happening, but he doesn't know all the details because some of it is lost in \\"The Dead Zone\\".Stephen King is known for making good characters who are well-rounded, witty, and often remind us of people we meet in our lifetime. Johnny Smith is no different. He's a clever witty character who is always trying to do the right thing. As he comes to discover his power he can't find out if it's a God Given Gift, or if it's God Given Curse. Either way he utilizes the power.There will be plenty of moments when The Dead Zone keeps you on the edge of your seat. You'll wonder if Johnny can actually prevent some of the things that will happen. Stephen King actually does a great job of keeping this random. Because Johnny will see some things that we \\"know\\" he's powerless to stop, but he does anyway in ways that he's not even sure.If you want a little break from all the horror that Stephen King presents, then strap yourself into The Dead Zone and enjoy the ride of this psychological thriller. One of the best Stephen King books out there."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone caught me by surprise by its psychological insight, deep characterizations, and lack of superstitious evil that have been more prominent in King's later novels.King's \\"The Green Mile\\" is the only subsequent novel that has come close to evoking such elemental and emotional turmoil in the reader.The \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" of life has robbed Johnny Smith from leading a normal and quiet life with his girl-Sarah- and instead has dealt him a cursed hand: a hand that has the ability to see brief glimpses of people's lives and occasionally their futures by a mere touch or handshake.King's prose slowly drugs you into the story with deliberate, methodical pacing by showing you the eerie psychological minds of Johnny's visions and depression, the evil sicknesses of the killer, Johnny's religious zealot of a mother, the corruption and insanity of one man campaigning to one day be the president of the Unites States, and most importantly the mind of Sarah's ruminations of a lost love that could never be but should have been if only that \\"Wheel of Fortune\\" on that fateful night had dealt them a different and fair hand.Although The Dead Zone is classified as a psychological thriller, I also viewed it as a strange, eerie, and tragic love story that never came to fruition due to cruel circumstance, and as Johnny aptly put it:\\"We all do what we can, and it has to be good enough.....and if it isn't good enough, it has to do.\\""},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"... but have you also seen the movie with Christopher Walken and Martin Sheen, directed by David Cronenberg? Well I think the movie is probably just as good, if not maybe a tad better, but that is because it just works so well on the big screen and is one of the better Stephen King movies out there, although it is a little dated, great none the less. The premise of the Dead Zone is a smashing one about the power of second sight, a man wakes up from a coma and starts to see glimpses of the future where it becomes a two-fold story, the first is a hunt for a serial killer, the second is a looming crisis to do with the President. Amazing stuff right up until the shocking climax, read this and then watch the film, it is not exactly horror, more a top notch King THRILLER."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I read the Dead Zone after Mr. Kings &quot;On Writing&quot;.

The Dead Zone was one of the standouts for many reasons, such as the things it DIDN'T have:NO merry band of main characters. NO precocious children with paranormal abilities. NO &quot;phantasmal Greek chorus&quot;.I'm sure these sound familiar.

Johnny suffers severe injuries in a car accident early on and as a result obtains a \\"second sight\\"- where he can see something personal about people by either touching them or a personal object of theirs. It doesn't take long for Johnny's talent to be noticed by others. There's a touching series of episodes at first, followed by darker, deeply disturbed encounters culminating in the book's final confrontation.The fantasy/horror aspects of the story make this book worthwhile on their own. What elevates the \\"The Dead Zone\\" to greatness is its emotionally genuine love story between Johnny and Sarah. Stephen King makes a point of placing his characters in the very real world, and \\"The Dead Zone\\" is a (now) period-piece set in the American political landscape of the early to mid 1970s. Mixing fictional characters with real political figures works well here- it adds depth and dimension to the proceedings, necessary given the aspirations of the book's main villain, Greg Stillson (a local politico with some deep problems).I read this book immediately after finishing \\"The Stand\\" and I appreciated the pace of \\"The Dead Zone\\" a lot. The story was fast-moving without feeling rushed. And while the story is set in the 1970s (when the book was written) it doesn't feel dated or hokey. I strongly recommend this to anyone looking to start King's works. Between this and \\"Salem's Lot\\" these are my favorite King novels thus far."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"For some reason, my recollection of reading this book before was very vague. Therefore, I went into the rereading process without knowing what to expect at all. Boy, was I surprised. After finishing it, I think that The Dead Zone is one of King's best novels.The character development is superb and I think that Johnny Smith is possibly one of King's best developed characters. We also spend considerable time with his family members and the principle villains and these characters are all strongly developed and quirky in their own ways.The story, while not action packed, takes the reader completely into the world of Johnny Smith, a regular guy with a bit of psychic ability and some incredibly bad luck. A big part of the storyline revolves around the political climate of the 70's but it is written in such a way that it stays interesting throughout. I honestly did not experience any moments of boredom with the story.As I'm finding with several King books that I've re-read lately, The Dead Zone is not really a horror novel at all. There's a little bit of gore and graphic violence and of course King's choice of language is a bit colorful at times, but really this is a good suspense story with a bit of politics and psychic powers thrown in for good measure.All in all a GREAT novel. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Loved the tale. Johnny Smith is a character that you can relate to on certain levels. What would a person do with such a power? Stan Lee's line (is it Stan's? only Mr. Lee knows for sure) is \\"with great power comes great responsibilty\\" (or something like that) You get the idea. I digress...AGAIN classic King. Must read."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"I read \\"The Dead Zone\\" on a trip in Australia, and I got so engrossed in it that I didn't do quite as much sightseeing as I would have done otherwise - despite the fact that I'm not particularly a fan of Stephen King, or of horror stories in general.But this is no horror story. Sure, there's a psychologically sick mass-murderer in it, a sadistic Bible-salesman-turned-politician, and a man who, after an almost fatal car accident, has the uncanny ability to foresee part of the (conditional) future of people whom he touches.However, the more violent scenes of the book are brief; the real emphasis is put on character development and the moral implications of the story, such as: To what degree can a mother's good intentions get out of control and warp a child? How far are you allowed to go if by your actions today you can prevent an ill in the future? If you traveled back in time to pre-WWII Germany, would you try to assassinate Hitler? What effect does a terminal illness have on the moral choices of a person?All these are very serious issues, and they are being given serious - though entertaining - treatment in this book, without turning into moral treatises packaged as fiction.An added bonus is that the book really takes you back to the 70's. Many political and cultural changes of the time are mentioned, and since the story develops over several years, you get a good sense of these changes.Stephen King apparently considers \\"The Dead Zone\\" one of his best works, and though I'm not overly familiar with his other books, I suspect he's right.- Jacob Schriftman, Author of \\"The Crack Beneath the Worlds\\""},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"The Dead Zone is Stehen King's fifth published novel, it's a shorter novel only about 400 pages (in this virson) but it's still a great novel.\\"The Dead Zone\\" Tells the story of a man named John Smith (no last name, But who needs one right) When he was younger John got and injury while skateing, it was a small one that not even his parents remember but for that one moment that he blacked out he was plunged into the dead zone, he reall didint know it then but he would come to relize it later.Later someting happens to Johnny an acident that again plunges him into The Dead Zone.And This if from the summary in the inside of the book. \\"John Smith, who awakened from a seemingly interminalbe coma with and accursed power: The Power to see the future and the terrible fate awaiting mankind in The Dead Zone.\\"during the novel Johnny has to go through quite a few things, things he might regret you can never really tell in the The Dead ZoneOverall Stephen King has given us a great novel here one that can be enjoyed any time 5/5"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"Having read a number of Stephen King's books, \\"The Dead Zone\\" has to rank as one of the finest. A tale of clairvoyance, it keeps its readers 'on the edge of their seats'. In typical Stephen King fashion, he heralds the appearance of the supernatural whilst reinforcing the readers' credulity through habitual exploitation of commonplace settings, cliches and associations with everyday norms. Both the protagonist's and antagonist's idiosyncrasies were consistently amplified throughout to great effects lending credibility to the numerous furor and conflicts as the story unfolds. The loose ends were neatly tied together in the finale which doesn't disappoint."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This is one of the only books I have read over the years, that I can remember different scenes from it. It is not only sad, but the main character's frustrations come out so vividly. How he is able to cope through all the adversity, is what makes it a great read. I have reread The Dead Zone, at least, 6 times since it's release in 1980. Probably will again."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"\\"The Dead Zone\\" doesn't start off with a happy-go-lucky premise: Johnny Smith, an everyman ex-schoolteacher, glimpses a horrific future that only he can stop...by killing a congressional candidate. The book is bleak, brisk 402 pages, and a hell of a ride that cemented King's place in the pantheon of horror greats. I also recommend the 1983 movie starring Christopher Walken, although many of the details were changed in the screenplay."},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"After a serious accident, a man awakes from a coma of several years.Everything is different, including his own self.

Only this: the book is still the best incarnation of these creations. And it is unique among King's novels.But first, here's the setup: Johnny Smith, a popular English teacher soon to be wed to a beautiful co-worker, has a very bad ending to what started out as a great night. After courting his lady and winning big on the wheel of fortune, Johnny is involved in a cab crash that leaves him broken, comatose, and upon awakening, permenantly psychic.He's been out of it for nearly five years, and during that time, he's lost his job, his girl--pretty much everything. Even his parents are on the outs, thanks largely to the financial and emotional stress brought on by his accident. And this \\"gift,\\" this ability to see the future, torments Mr. Smith, threatens to tear apart what's left of his sanity. He's quickly famous and infamous, savior and freak, less human with each new revelation. And the final one will force him to make an easy, but terrible, choice ...The things about THE DEAD ZONE that makes it unique among early King books is that it's more dramatic than frightening, more empathetic than kinetic. THE DEAD ZONE makes it as horror, thriller, and mainstream fiction, an important step (along with DIFFERENT SEASONS) towards works in his later career that were similarly rich in a dramatic sense.(This review has been posted by Marcus Damanda, author of the vampire novel \\"Teeth: A Horror Fantasy.\\")"},{"Title":"The Dead Zone","review":"This book was very well written and very easy to grasp.

While this is definitely not a horror novel, it still ranks as one of his finest to date. The plot was very intriguing and made it hard to put down, and the characters were drawn up extremely well.

The settings provided are so realistic, one never knows whether to pour a stiff scotch, or set out biscuits for tea for refreshment when turning to page one. In ANOTHER VIEW, Pilcher shuttles the reader from Paris, to London, to the quaint, English seaside village of Porthkerris. Like most of Pilcher's work, this is an easy-to-read love story, with two distinct parts. The first tells of a daughter's unconditional quest for her father's love, and the second is a somewhat predictable, but none the less entertaining romance between virtual strangers. If there is any disappointment it is that, unlike other Pilcher novels, this is really a novella ... easily read in one sitting. Whereas the plot takes some interesting twists and turns, the great expanses of description, setting and history, so much a part of Pilcher's earlier novels, is greatly missed.

Emma formed a deep bond with her stepbrother and after many years apart, runs into him in Paris just as she is leaving to return to England and try to become reacquainted with her father.Emma's story is one of taking a second look at the people you think you know so well. What she discovers about her relationship with her father and brother is very enlightening and helps her resolve her own feelings about the new love that has come into her life.As always with Rosamunde Pilcher books, a most satisfying read and one that leaves you dreaming of the beach at Cornwall and sitting down to tea with scones and lemond curd."},{"Title":"Another View","review":"I've enjoyed all the books by this author.

She lost her mother at birth. And the only time she had the full attention of her brilliant artist father was once, when she was six, he painted her portrait. Briefly she had a brother, Christopher whom she called Cristo, while his mother was married to her father. All too soon Cristo was gone too, but never to be forgotten. Then her father, on his way to America, sent her to boarding school in Switzerland, and there she stayed until she was old enough to find a job for herself in Paris. Through all those years Ben Litton visited her a couple of times, briefly each time. He never wrote letters and he did not use the telephone. His only infrequent communications came by way of telegrams. Finally, in Paris, Emma rediscovers Christo, but then she is on her way home to her father, to determine whether she can have any kind of relationship, form any kind of family unit, with him. In London, en route to Cornwall, she meets the man of her dreams, her father's very handsome galley agent. But Emma cannot begin to dream, cannot acknowledge the love she finds with Robert Morrow, until she has learned the truth about her father. When her father leaves her alone again, she turns to Christo. But it seems that he, a young actor with a brilliant future, will treat her with much the same indifference her father has always shown her, willing to abandon her for the advancement of his career.Emma will finally get another view of her father -- a view through another window into his heart and soul -- and through that view will learn not only the truth about him but about herself as well. But will the truth that sets her free to love come to late for her to win that love?Another View was written thirty years ago. But with its timeless appeal and story line, it reads as though it might have been written last week -- and will probably read that way after another thirty years.

It opens, however, in Paris, where the beautiful, fey, and slightly muddled Emma Litton awaits her plane back to England. Having spent many years in France as a nanny, Emma now yearns for her homeland--and the fulfillment of a desire that has obviously been with her all her life: She wishes to bond with her famous artist father, Ben.Emma's sudden and unexpected meeting at the airport with her step-brother Cristo, whom she knew during one of Ben's brief marriages, but has not seen in many years, allows us to see her needy and sensitive side, even as others observe only a hip young Sixties mod.The remainder of the brief book takes place in her father's studio-cum-cottage on the seaside, as Emma settles in as daughter, housekeeper, muse, and, eerily, almost as a wife to her elusive father. Will it work? Can Emma get over her childlike fantasy of being Daddy's Little Girl and get on with her life? Will she notice the worthy young man whose heart she has captured? Or will she lose him too in her fruitless desire to create the family she never had?Without the deep substance of her later books, nevertheless, this sweet Pilcher offering is well worth reading--especially when narrated by Sian Thomas, who captures the quiet, brooding tone just right.I recommend this lovely tale to all Pilcher fans."},{"Title":"Another View","review":"Rosamunde Pilcher has long been an author who can generate stories that leap off the page with vivid characters who have real struggles and triumphs. \\"Another View\\", an early work, is a fast-paced read, but fairly common ground for any reader familiar with other Pilcher novels.The reader is immediately introduced to Emma Litton, a nineteen-year-old virtual orphan, who has always played second fiddle to her father's career as an artist.

It isn't until Emma is willing to do a little character exploration of her own, to know what she wants for her life, to be able to understand the place she has in her father's heart.\\"Another View\\" is a typical Pilcher novel, well-written with believable characters. Yet it is often too predictable and rushes to a happy-ending conclusion within the last few pages. It is a perfect quick holiday read but hardly reaches the grandeur and sustenance of Pilcher's better works, such as \\"Coming Home\\", \\"The Shell Seekers\\", and \\"September\\"."},{"Title":"Another View","review":"My wife bought this book because of the author, but set it aside when she saw the 1968 copyright. She had read Winter Soltice and is now reading Shell Seekers, and loves them both. This is my first Rosamunde Pilcher. We're in Germany on an extended visit, and I finished reading (my more manly) Grisham's The Broker, and had nothing else to read. For some reason I expected Another View to be a romance novel, but it was much more. And, the fact that it was written so long ago didn't lessen it at all. The only time-sensitive part was the excessive (in my view) amount of smoking. Everyone smokes in the book. But, of course, many did back in 1968.As a father of two grown girls, I especially enjoyed the father-daughter struggles. Of course I'm not a famous artist like Ben is in the story, but still, fathers are often taken away from their children by their work. And, often, we have regrets for that lost time.I thought the plot was well structured for the most part and I wondered if this might have been her first novel. If so, what an exceptional job for a first book."},{"Title":"Another View","review":"I've read all of her books. Wish she were still alive to write more -- I am so selfish. Love everything she has written and miss her . Son Robin Pilcher is working on carrying on his own talent with new novels and is a storyteller worth reading. Miss Rosamunde, and I am excited about Robin Pilcher's work. thanks for letting me share."},{"Title":"Another View","review":"Happy to locate this item. Received quickly and in good condition. Price could not be beat. This is the kind of item that the senior citizens of our day really appreciate."},{"Title":"Another View","review":"I love the way she writes. Such good, appealing everyday stories. Her charachters leap from the page and you feel like you could sit down and have a chat and a cup of tea with them."},{"Title":"Doohickey : A Novel","review":"Pete Hautman is able to create distinctive, often loony, characters who drive an engaging plot that wraps up all of the loose ends by its conclusion. Nicholas Fashon, around which the plot revolves, has inherited the rights to his grandfather's all-purpose kitchen gadget the Handy Mate (one of many doohickey inventions the old man fiddled around with). Getting the Handy Mate manufactured and marketed is Fashon's goal to make it big, but there are many roadblocks in his way, including a violent loanshark, a sexy female chef, and the police who suspect Fashon of torching his apparel store for insurance money. The book's humor is derived from twists in the plot and nonsensical situations between Fashon and a number of secondary characters, in a similar vein to earlier Hautman books. It is highly enjoyable, and good for a laugh or two every few pages."},{"Title":"Doohickey : A Novel","review":"After years of having no financial security at all, Nick Fashon believes he's about to have it all. He and his friend Vince own a fashion store, Love &amp; Fashion, a place that is very popular. Nick is seeing Gretchen, a beautiful offbeat woman he thinks he's in love with and she with him.All Nick's dreams go up in smoke when the store is gutted by fire. Nick was living in the apartment above the store and lost everything because he didn't have renter's insurance. The store's insurance won't pay up until they're assured arson wasn't the cause of the fire. Nick becomes obsessed with producing, marketing and selling his late grandfather's kitchen gadget, the handy mate as a way of bringing in income to the point he might lose everything he holds dear including his life.Pete Hauteman has carved out a very unique niche with this crime comedy. The author doesn't take himself to seriously so he allows his readers to have a good time while reading about characters that are funny because they get themselves into such ridiculous predicaments a la Abbot and Costello movie. DOOHICKEY is the perfect title for this special book.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Doohickey : A Novel","review":"I picked this book up because Hautman's \\"Rash\\" appeared in the \\"recommended for you\\" section of my Amazon page. Intrigued, I decided to read an adult novel by same. Hautman does a great job on his fashonista(sic), Nicky. I have seen many of his ilk skulking around Tucson. He is dead-on with all of his characterizations, and even has the talk down correctly, I can hear Yola and Robo talking now. Hautman leads the reader on, never quite telling the whole story; can a mysteriously dead grandfather's mysterious invention save the hero from financial ruin? Who will get a share in the Pillsbury give-away? Just how many kinds of salsa can you make with the HandyMate?Anyone who knows where to park to visit the Shanty has spent more time in Tucson than they are fessing up to. But I draw the line at driving to Sierra Vista for mexican food, there's too much good stuff on south 4th to warrant a drive waaay down the freeway. I just think the author wishes HE had a corvette to toodle around So. Arizona in. Janos thinly disguised as Platanos is too funny. Hey Pete, come back to Tucson and visit La Encantada, there's got to be some skull duggery afoot there. Murphy never meant faux-Scottsdale to be built in the neighborhood."},{"Title":"Doohickey : A Novel","review":"Pete Hautman has a real knack for creating off-the-wall characters and great plots. Nick Fashon must deal sexy gals, a shady lawyer (of course!), a barrio thug, and friends who desert him in his time of need. The twists and turns of this novel will keep you reading (and chuckling) with every page. It has a similar comedic punch as Hautman's other fun read, Mrs. Million. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Doohickey : A Novel","review":"Nick Fashon, the young, handsome and charmingly vain co-owner of a clothing store called Love & Fashion, with his partner, Vince Love, finds himself sole heir to the estate of his barely-known grandfather, a desert rat whose invention, the doohickey of the title, may possibly be a money-maker. This drives a plot with wacky, funny, wise-cracking characters like an ambitious Latina TV cooking show hostess, an archaeologist girl-friend, a hick lawyer who is a wannabe dude, all in a mildly twisted mystery plot.There is an awful lot of talk about mouth-watering food in the book and you'll find yourself inexplicably hungry throughout, hankering for menudo or huevos rancheros washed down with margaritas grandes. And you'll enjoy the well-described Tucson scene.Not in the same league as mysterydom's big-hitters, but worth an evening's read nonetheless.Scott Morrison"},{"Title":"Doohickey : A Novel","review":"I can't say that this book is really bad. Nor could I say that it's good. It's just okay. The main character and his girlfriend are unbelievably annoying. Nick Fashon is this sometimes wimpy guy who can't see the forest for the trees and puts way too much into his clothing and looks. Not a likeable character at all. Then there's the girlfriend who is really difficult to figure out. She behaves like no woman I know; very difficult to relate to. She's a bland character with no depth to her at all. Then, half way through the book she gets angry at Nick and breaks up with him for the dumbest reasons. A very unrealistic character. No offense to Pete Hautman, whose other books are very good, but this book was so obviously written by a man. She's quite simply a caricature of a women, or , more accurately, a stereotype of a woman from the perspective of a man who has no clue about women. If I were a man I'd have dumped her first! And for the life of me I don't know why the author would set this story in Arizona. I can't think of a more boring, drepressing setting.I was always on the verge of setting the book down and not returning to it but it kept me just interested enough to get me through to the predictable ending. I don't mind predictable endings, not every story has to be a surprise. At best I'd say it was cute."},{"Title":"Doohickey : A Novel","review":"A doohickey is something hard to describe.This book isn't bad, and it isn't great. This book isn't really a crime story. It isn't really a serious book. It isn't particularly funny. It doesn't really have a strong or surprising ending.This book is a doohickey."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"After all that has happened since 9-11, we need an inspiring booklike A Reason To Live. Wanda Summers demonstrates the great American spirit of courage and determination to survive, a will to rise up out of the ashes of despair and the pits of hell toprevail and hold on to what little of her life she was able tosalvage. A wonderfully written book about SURVIVIVING that everyone will want to read, whether we have ever been a victim ofcrime or not. It's refreshing to see a new approach to a true crime story, where the good guys win in the end. These two guysshould become the top writers in this genre. I know I am goingto tell all my friends about Wanda Summers and A Reason To Live."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I usually don't foray into true crime drama, but am I ever glad I did this time. What an inspiring story of a woman beating insurmountable odds to be a spokesperson for the rights of victims. The details of the espisodes were cleverly interwined into a story that reads like good flowing fiction, keeping one riveted to the page. All sides of the issues are well presented. Though the brutal crimes of Rusty Woomer could have left one despising him, hearing his side and learning his coversion to Christianity gave him a humanness relatable to the reader. Wanda's struggles, and that of the other's victims families are well proffered in this stellar account of unbelievable horrors defeated by the strength of human spirit. Excellent writing and excellent storytelling make this a must read."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I'm not one who normally reads a book and gets so affected byits content and characters. But this book changed my entireoutlook on crime, criminals, and the death penalty. After I read what happened to Ms. Summers and her family, I was ashamed toadmit our American Justice System was so lax on punishing criminals that it took almost ten years before Rusty Woomerwas brought to justice. For all those who wonder what happensto the innocent people who are caught up in the evil of peoplelike Woomer and Skarr, read this book. It says it all. Thesetwo writers, Billy Hills and Dale Hudson, should be commendedfor bringing such an insightful and inspirational story to thepublic, while everyone else over the last decade has been socaught up in glorifying the crime and the criminal. It is refreshing to read a story focusing on the strength of thecharacters and how they triumphed over tragedy rather than thecriminals and the blood and gore they left behind on theirbloodletting trail of destruction. I like the writing style ofthese two guys and want to read everything they have written."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I read about this book in the Walterboro Press and Standard, and had no idea it was a true crime book. It is so smooth, so thought-provoking and so interesting. I don't normally read true crime books because they are usually very boring and laced with pictures and desciptions I don't care for. But this story of Wanda Summers was so moving I couldn't put it down. I have never read about what victims go through after a crime and hurt so much for Wanda and her family. This book takes you right into he heart of the matter and lets the reader see how out of control crime has gotten, yet how soft we have become on cold blooded killers like Woomer. I am going to tell all my friends about this book. Nobody writes true crime as good as Billy Hills and Dale Hudson. They are two awesome true crime writers."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"A Reason To Live is an outstanding book. No wonder my friend recommended it to me. What Rusty Woomer and Gene Skarr did to their victims made me realize how horrible and sick people can be. They both deserved to die for what they did, and in my opinion the death penalty wasn't harsh enough for them. I want to say to Wanda Summers and her husband, Jimmy, you are two of the most inspiring and courageous people I have read about in a long time. I am happy you both never stopped loving each other and were able to move beyond this and find some well-deserved happiness. To Billy Hills and Dale Hudson, thank you for bringing this story to your readers, without you we would have never heard about Wanda. I am now waiting to read your next book. You two guys make one hell of a team."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"This book pulls no punches in telling the story of a terrible series of crimes, and the lifelong consequences for the victims, one survivor in particular, Wanda Summers. Wanda suffered a gunshot wound that was meant to kill her. Her entire lower face was destroyed. The story was written with the full cooperation of the remarkable Summers family. The focus moves from the callousness of the killers, who kill to silence those they rob and rape, to the victims themselves. This is also a story of victims rights, the prosecutor in the case was one of it's strongest champions, and has done much to further that cause. He kept their images and stories alive throughout the long appeals process. Wanda's recovery and willingness to reenter society is inspiring, her setbacks are recounted, and you realize that for each painful incident described, there were probably many more like it, and you can feel just a fraction of her suffering. She is not portrayed as a saint, just a very real, very strong woman, a mother and wife whose love for her family and their's for her, helped bring her back from an earthly Hell."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"This book is a very moving account of one woman's struggle to survive a horific crime and overcome the injuries to herself as well as the death of her friend. It is a story of her struggle to overcome obstacles so terrifying and so painful and yet triumph in the end.Dale and Billy did an excellent job on this book. Their writing style keeps you interested as well as absorbs you in the story. Also, check out their other book, &quot;An Hour to Kill&quot;....another definite read for all true crime readers.Thanks for such a moving story.God be with you, Wanda!!!!"},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"This book was definitely a testimony of the strength and determination that Wanda Summers experienced throughout the entire tragedy.

The story is so well-written I felt as ifI was right there with her, Louise Sellers, and theother victims all the time. The authors did a verycredible job of mixing the action and narrative so asto keep the story moving forward. Most true crime storieshave several sections which are difficult to read, butnot so with this one. Thumbs up for this story and theauthors. I am off to find something else they have written."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"WOW! I didn't think they could top their first book (An Hour to Kill), but they have done so with &quot;A Reason to Live&quot;. I felt as if I was at the kitchen table with the heroic victim of this story. The crime story is important, but feeling the anguish and the suffering of the victim so intensely is something I have never before experienced....This book should be required reading for all those who pass judgement on perpetrators in the justice system. This family, particularly this woman, are just as heroic as those involved in the Sept 11th attacks. And Hills and Hudson are remarkable in their storytelling. I can hardly wait for their next book!!!!"},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I rarely read true crime because I find it hard to enjoy reading about real people's tragedies. This book was different.Everybody assumes that it's all over as soon as the jury brings in a verdict. Not true. Wanda and her family lived with the attack on her for many years afterward. She was shot in the face and left for dead with no more thought than you and I would give swatting a mosquito. Her face was destroyed. She endured years of surgeries, depression, a justice system that dragged its feet, and withdrawal from society because of the stares she got.But Wanda also had love and support in her life from family and friends. Her husband Jimmy was wonderful. His life wasn't a bed of roses either, but he stuck by her side all through it. His values and sense of family earned my admiration and respect.I don't think most people would have hung in there year after year.A Reason to Live showed the crime from all sides and read like a fictional novel instead of a police report. Whenever my problems threaten to overwhelm me, I think of Wanda and Jimmy and their family. They are an inspiration to me and I wish them the best possible future they can have."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I am a huge reader, but very seldom, if any, do I read true crime stories. But this book was recommended by so many truecrime readers, I thought I'd check it out. After meeting oneof the authors on the Internet, somehow I knew I wouldn't bedisappointed.The story of the survival of Wanda Summers is an engrossing story, to say the least. What fascinated me is how in the beginning Rusty Woomer didn't care whether Wanda lived, despite her many reasons for living. Yet in the end, Wanda lived and,Rusty died, after finally finding religion and his reason to live. Oh, my, how the tables were turned.It is the authors who make this story work. All I can ever remember about true crime books are stories which spotlight thekillers, to the point sometimes it was sickening. Why should wemake celebrities out of cold blooded killers? A Reason To Livetakes the opposited position and details events from the survivors lives and how difficult they had it after the crime.I liked that approach.As stated before, I don't read true crime and was hesitant to read this one for fear ir would be cast from the same dye as other true crime stories. But these two writers crafted a wonderful story, built strong characters, fashioned a well-designed plot, then let it all unfold for the reader. I was pleasantly surprised to find such a well-written story.Five stars to Billy Hills and Dale Hudson for their efforts.I believed Jack Olsen, who said there were no more good truecrime writers left. Honestly, I believed him, until I read this book, but Hills and Hudson have given me hope that this genre is going to see some big changes."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"WOW! For the first time in a long time, I am left speechless after reading a book. I am not a big reader in this genre, but from the moment I read the first chapter of A Reason To Live and learned from Jimmy Summers &quot;the truth&quot; about his wife's face, I was hooked. I am told the first few pages sells a book, and let me tell you after the first paragraphs I was sold on this one. I could not stop reading until I found out what had happened to Wanda's face and how she had survived. Finally, after putting everything else on hold, my family, my job, etc. I finished A Reason To Live. If you are looking for a powerful story, whose plot and characters literally explode off the page and grab you, well, this is one of those. This is the first book I have read by authors Hills and Hudson, but they wrote a wonderful story. I can't recall any other story like this one, which told the story from the victim's point of view. Probably in the hands of another true crime author this would have been a different story, directed more toward the acts and behavior of the criminal, and we would have never gotten to hear the other side of the story, Jimmy and Wanda Summer's story of determination and survival. I think we need more books like A Reason To Live, which depict the &quot;true&quot; horrors of crime-the victims. Kudos to the authors for giving us what so few other true crime writers have had the foresight to do. And my prayer is that God would comfort and heal all the families involved in this terrible tragedy."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"The condemnation was neither a surprise nor was it undeserved because Ronal Raymond Woomer committed one of the most heinous strings of crime ever perpetrated in the state of South Carolina. Through the careful gathering of facts, the deliberation and the sentencing, the criminal showed no remorse. Yet his horrific actions changed a number of lives forever.The plan seemed simple. Skaar and Woomer would get directions from coin dealer Whitehead and drive to the small town where John Turner lived. After robbing the old man, they would leave him dead, take his coins back to Whitehead and get paid. If all went well, this would only be the first of a series of crimes. High on drugs and alcohol, Skaar and Woomer not only carried out their intended crime, but also went on a murdering spree that would leave bodies in three counties. In addition to theft and murder, they would commit kidnapping and rape. When on the verge of apprehension, Skaar commited suicide, leaving partner Woomer to take the fall.The worst didn't pass with the conviction and sentencing of Woomer for victim Wanda Summers. Wanda is a woman of remarkable courage, more concerned during the perpetration of the crime for her friend that for herself, and afterward more concerned for her daughter and husband than for herself. But with much of her face destroyed, Wanda not only had to survive an attempted murder and testify against her perpetrator, she had to recover afterward. While press and well meaning supporters hale the time of recovery as getting back to normal, Wanda still had to endure surgery and deeper emotional healing. Grueling and intense, recovery was slow.One of the most chilling true crime novels of our time, A REASON TO LIVE will haunt the reader long after the last page is turned. A REASON TO LIVE is a testament to both the strength of human spirit and to the power of evil. The combined talents of Billy Hills and Dale Hudson bring the criminal events, the trial and the consequences vividly to life without dwelling too deeply or too long in the grotesque atrocities committed, simply allowing the facts to speak for themselves. Despite the tragedy, the horror of disfigurement and the loss of life, these authors maintain their focus not on the criminal but on the victims and that their families, bringing their voices to the forefront, unlike typical true crime novels which focus on the criminal. The end result is powerful and persuasive, striking at the heart of the weakness of our criminal justice system thereby standing up for victims. A REASON TO LIFE is one of those remarkable novels that change the way we perceive justice and rights, as well as the way we prosecute criminals. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"A Reason To Live is a true story that will stay with you a long long time. Although I hate to admit that I forget many of the books I read, this one has not only stayed fresh in my mind, but continues to linger in my thoughts. The crimes of Woomer and Skaar are so vividly described that I felt the fear that the victums experienced. As in their first book, An Hour To Kill, Dale Hudson and Billy Hills have told the story of the crime with articulate creativity without compromising the dignity of the victums.The book relates a series of events that is wrought with drama, and is told tastefully. The primary focus is on the surviving victum, Wanda Summers. She is a living testimony of how a victum can survive and carry on with a healthy productive life. She took a shotgun blast to the face at close range, and lived to see her killer executed for it. Justice and recovery was a slow and painful journey that will make you think seriously about the consideration of victums' rights, or the lack thereof in our criminal justice system. The list of victums in this case goes way beyond merely those who died that day when Rusty Woomer and Eugene Skaar decided to rob and kill their way into drug and alcohol oblivion. The loved ones of the victums make the list much longer, and this book is about the suffering that was endured by all of them, but especially Wanda Summers. She is the lucky victum who lived. This is her story of survival and the support from her family who struggled to hold their lives together in distorted normalcy throughout the long healing of her wounds, both physical and mental. It is also the chronology of events comprised of an intricate web of legal nightmares which eventually delivered the perpetrators to their final justice. This is a very moving story you should not miss. Because it is written with the class and polish of compassionate professionals, you will recognize this work of literature as something to be savored and contemplated for a very long time."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"Hi, I am an avid True Crime reader and loved the first book&quot;An Hour To Kill&quot; by these two, This one even beat That!I highly recommend this book for everyone,not just True Crime fans, This is a Story of crime,Yet offers Much More! It is a page turning book of a horrible day of crimes,but doesn't end there. This book is also a Story of bravery ,courage,and Strength by Wanda Summers and her Family. The Book makes you cry then rejoice with the surviviors. I am not a reveiwer of books,but a reader! This is a must read for everyone, Believe me you will be touched, maddened,and Inspired.

This is definitely a page turner from the beginning to the end."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I just finished pulling an all nighter with A Reason To Live. This book is so compelling I could not put it down until I had finished every single page. Most other books in this genre rely upon gruesome pictures and horrible narratives to sell their books, but not these authors. This is my second book I have read by Hudson and Hills and they are superb writers. These two guys take the raw material from their research and weave it into spellbinders! This is the first time I have read a book that focused not only on the crime but the victim. What Rusty Woomer and Eugene Skarr did to his victims are beyond belief, and Wanda, Jimmy, Louise and the other victims didn't deserve this. After reading this book, for the first time I felt like I really understood how our American Justice System continues to victimize these people over and over again. It just isn't fair that we give the criminal so many rights, but think nothing of the victim's plights. This book is a must for all true crime readers, who have heard enough about the criminal's plight. I am going to recommend this book to everyone I know. Honestly, I have never read any true crime book like this one."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I am a reader...not a book reviewer..so I hope you will bare with me as I try to tell you my feelings about ~A Reason to Live~. I finished the book this morning and as I put it down I felt satisfied that the Wanda Summers story was told with compassion and love. She was no longer a victim but a survivor. I was swept into her life from the first page and shed tears as I read of the terrible crime that was committed against her and her family. I recommend this to all true crime aficionados like myself. It is written in a clear concise style and it has several pages of pictures.... a must with me :) I will be looking forward to the next book from this pair of authors..."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"After reading this book, I am not sure what to say. This being not only my first true crime book I have reviewed, but one of the only books whereby I was so emotionally drawn. I still haven't been able to put this nightmare out of my mind, which is why I don't like to read true crime. It is about the suffering of real people. But A Reason To Live is one of the better true crime books I have read. I suppose I should say for the benefit of my own convictions that was justice was dealt in the end, but then again, I am not so certain. Maybe Rusty Woomer was a changed man, and truly didn't deserve to die, who should have been spared the Death Penalty. But, on the other hand, nothing isgoing to ever deliver justice to these families, or Wanda Summers. How can you erase what Woomer and Skaar did to them?After pondering this thought and how the victims suffered, I have to agree with Don Sellers, Rusty's death was too easy. Inthat light, he deserved to suffer like his victims. Overall, inspite of this horrible story, A Reason To Live is one of the best true crime books I have ever read, and the only one I canremember where a victim survived to tell about it. My gratitudeto the authors for the way they presented the story, more likea novel than a true crime story, and for introducing us to these wonderful, inspiring and strong characters. May the victims rest in peace, and Wanda continue to overcome with great courage andconviction."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"Today is the nniversary of my father's passing, Cleveland Stevens, Atty. at Law. My mother and I helped Mr. Hudson with this book and I feel that he did the entire case justice and wrote extremely well. There are many sides to the story of what his daughter and wife, my mother and I, went through as we watched this case being tried, watched my father agonizing over what he knew would be the inevitable, and watching Rusty Woomer eating his last family meal with his cancer stricken mother and devoted sister. Again, there is another side to this story. The human element of the side of the guilty. The book does a marvelous job displaying Wanda's tenacity and strength. I recommend everyone read this, and if you ever want to know the inside of the other side, you will have to wait for my book! Thanks Dale for capturing such horrific and life changing events in such a great way!"},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I was born after the setting of the book, but I was intrigued to read it because it had taken place in my hometown in South Carolina. This book is based on a true story and really makes you think about life and the struggles a young woman went through to get back her life after it was ripped right out of her. She is still alive to this day, and just reading about her life changing story is very emotional and motivational. The authors of the book are also another reason I read it, and really shared her story in a way that makes it an amazing story you will just have to read. Dr. Billy Hills is an amazing professor of mine now and one of the most knowledgeable people I know, and he really wrote the book fabulously. &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; is another one of his that is similar to this, and is next on my list to reads; it was also taken place in my hometown and is based on a true story.

It is a celebration ofthe human spirit, of sorts, in that Jimmy and Wanda Summers triumphed over ever adversity they faced in this tragedy. Truly agigantic story about love, courage, and commitment of a husbandand wife, A Reason To Live will stir every human emotion--sadness, anger, revenge, and, eventually, happiness in the endwhen the Summers family is able to move beyond this horrible crime. I have no reservations about Rusty Woomer's execution--the courts found him guilty and sentenced him to ultimately payfor what he did with his own life. This is the the penalty as set forth by the American Justice System. I would recommend thisbook to anyone who wants to read a page turner--a story which is nearly impossible to put down until it is finished. I am now reading Hudson and Hills' first book, An Hour To Kill, and findthe story and writing just as enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"Wanda Summers...what a courageous young woman. This is an incredible and inspiring story of a victim who wouldn't give up in spite of being raped, shotgunned and left for dead on a cold, deserted road in Pawleys Island, South Carolina. Having been a victim myself, I can empathize with Wanda and her family, and know perfectly well what all she went through just to be normal again. America, when are we going to wake up and take notice of what happening in our society? Criminals get bettertreatment than their victims. Thanks to the writing team of Billy Hills and Dale Hudson for bringing us another good story of American justice. They are carving a niche out in the true crime genre which seems to be read and appreciated by everyone. I will be first in line to buy their next book."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I read about this book in the Walterboro Press and Standard, and had no idea it was a true crime book. It is so smooth, so thought-provoking and so interesting. I don't normally read true crime books because they are usually very boring and laced with pictures and desciptions I don't care for. But this story of Wanda Summers was so moving I couldn't put it down. I have never read about what victims go through after a crime and hurt so much for Wanda and her family. This book takes you right into he heart of the matter and lets the reader see how out of control crime has gotten, yet how soft we have become on cold blooded killers like Woomer. I am going to tell all my friends about this book. Nobody writes true crime as good as Billy Hills and Dale Hudson. They are two awesome true crime writers."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"A Reason To Live is a very moving story of Wanda Summers, who was kidnapped, raped, shotgunned, and left for dead. What happened to her was horrible, and it is hard to believe this courageous woman survived and was able to put her life back together. I wept openly as I read the details from her nightmare, the endless surgeries to reconstruct her face, and her painful recouperation to become normal again. Those of us who read this book and have not had to suffer as Wanda and her family should count their blessings. Billy Hills and Dale Hudson are superb writers with a real talent for writing such an engaging story. It is about time someone told us about the victims's side of the story and how they suffer rather than the criminal. As in most cases, the criminals continue to live in a rather convenient, self-sustaining life style while the victims struggle to return to a normal life."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"These 2 Authors have done what most can not do. They have taken a horrible crime and turned it around and proved there can be positive with the negative. This book tells of a terrible tragedy of A daily crime spree that left several dead and one woman to suffer termendous pain and suffering. They tell of the trials and tribulations that the victim goes thu. Which is the way it should be. These days to much is put out for the accused and not the victim. It is about time there were Authors that looked to the victim first! If you are looking for a Non-Put down book this is one of them!!! Billy Hills&amp;Dale Hudson have taken true-crime where it should be with the victim and at the same time keeps you intruiged with the story!"},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"Listen, I have been around a long time and read every true crime book on the market. There hasn't been a book in a long time which effected me as much as A Reason To Live. Beginning with page 1, the authors grabbed me and I couldn't let go, and I am telling you, it was like an emotional roller coaster from then on. I wanted to scream when Woomer and Skkar did the things they did and cry when Wanda Summers and the others suffered and died the way they did. At the end of the book, I stood up and cheered Wanda and Jimmy for not letting Woomer ruin their lives. My husband thought I had gone nuts, but I couldn't help it. This book is written so well it makes you do crazy things. A THOUSAND THANK YOUS goes to the authors for bringing this story to light. And I SALUTE THE COURAGEOUS HUMAN SPIRIT of Wanda Summers and the countless other victims who have suffered like her."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"This is the most well written book that I have read. I like how it doesn't go on and on about the horror inflicted. They let you get to know all the people involved and focused on their lives. It lets everyone know that there is hope for the justice system afterall. Kudos to all involved. I will read all that they write. Their writing skills are very refreshing!"},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"A Reason To Live is a easy-to-read book detailing why the American Criminal Justice System should enforce the Death Penalty. For all those bleeding heart liberals, the heinous acts committed upon Wanda Summers, her family, and the other victims by Woomer and Skaar is another example of innocent people being victimized. After hearing what Woomer had done to Della Louise Sellers and Wanda Summers, the jury foreman, Raymond Finch, said it best: &quot;We didn't think Woomer should even breathe the same air we breathe.&quot; It's about time we Americans stood up and take the courage to punish these sick individuals for the crimes they commit against society."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"From the moment I opened A Reason to Live, I found it nearly impossible to put down. Billy Hills and Dale Hudson have a way with writing true crimes that place you right at the scene as though you are watching the story unfold in front of you and you begin to feel as though you know the people involved. A Reason to Live lives up to the high standards they set with their first great book, An Hour to Kill. I highly recommend A Reason to Live as this book not only tells of the horrible crimes befallen on Horry County, but the strength and determination to live of Wanda Summers. It's also a story about love as her husband Jimmy stands by her side and fights to get his family back, no easy feat.My heart went out to this couple. They have my utmost respect and admiration. Dale and Billy--thank you for bringing me such a heart-felt story, one that I will not likely forget, and I definitely look forward to your next work."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"A Reason To Live is a wonderfully written story about Wanda Summers and her family, and how they suffered as victims of a horrible crime. Beginning with the Prologue, Hudson and Hills guides the reader through the events and lives of two misguided criminals and their crime spree in 1979, ending with the assault of Ms. Summers and her friend, Della Louise Sellers. Using the crime as the backdrop, the authors paint a suspenseful masterpiece, detailing the aftermath of the crime and the struggles and sacrifices endured by the Summers family just to survive. Before reading this story, I wasn't a death penalty supporter, but I do believe this sentence was warranted in this case. I'm not going to even think about whether the killer's &quot;jail house conversion&quot; was sincere, but I am glad he had time to make peace with God, which was something apparently his victims never got the opportunity to do before he murdered them. This book held my attention from beginning to end, andwas very well-written. I would recommend it highly as a book to be put on your reading list. An added bonus are the number of pictures the author's included in the book. Nice job, you guys!! You have outdone yourselves again."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"This book is a real page turner. It is written with sensitivity and feeling. I found myself feeling very emotional for all the victims. The crimes were all so senseless and cruel. The people involved are an inspiration to themselves and others. They have come through what could have been impossible odds and they have beaten them.The system for once didn't fail. A community was drawn together. One of the high points for me was the jury deliberations. I feel that Billy Hills and Dale Hudson have a bright future ahead for them. I am honored I was given an opportunity to be one of the first to read their second book. I look forward to reading their next book and I will not forget &quot;A Reason to Live&quot;."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I was hooked on this one from the very first page. The authors immediately began building suspense and the reader knew that something terrible was going to happen. The action is quick and decisive. It is a page turner that I read in only two sittings and kept thinking about long after I'd finished the book.The characterization is excellent. As I was introduced to Wanda Summers and her family, I felt I really knew them. They are not simply stereotypes, but impact the reader as living, breathing people.You cannot read this book without feeling the pain, incredible courage and, eventually, the triumph of Wanda and Jimmy Summers, along with the other tragic victims in the case. A Reason to Live graphically demonstrates the full impact of a vicious crime on the victims and their families. It also makes us all uncomfortably aware of just how vulnerable we all are."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"Although A Reason to Live by Billy Hills and Dale Hudson is classified as a true-crime book, the focus is not only on the crime, but on the aftermath and its effects on the one of the victims and her family. Through carefully researched storytelling, the authors portray just how far-reaching the effects of a horrific crime can be, not just impacting the victim, but the families, caregivers, legal system. The writers were very moved by this story, and they expressed that well through the writing of this book, which flows more like a novel than a re-iteration of the facts of the case. Wanda Summers is a true hero, and everyone should read this book to learn how to gracefully overcome enormous adversity. Thanks to these remarkable authors for sharing this story, I look forward to reading more of your work!"},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"The title of this true crime book is profoundly appropriate. More than the story of a woman who survived sexual assault and attempted murder, Hills and Hudson have written an intimate portrayal of several South Carolina families, whose lives were shattered and destroyed by two men on a senseless killing spree in February of 1979...all because some guys wanted to make easy money by robbing an elderly man. The determination and courage of Wanda Summers is, for me, the profile of a heroine. This is an emotional book; it made me cry. With skill and sensitivity, the authors deal with the gruesome facts of the attacks. The details of the court case move along swiftly and then the reader must learn how the legal system can be agonizingly complicated after a guilty verdict and a death sentence. There are some bizarre connections to other crimes in A Reason to Live. True crime readers will not be disappointed with Hills and Hudson's second book! Sobering...poignant...inspiring."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"From the intriguing and unusual cover to the contents of the book to the back cover -- this book is one of those books you just can't put down.Wanda's courage and strength comes shining through due to the incredible writing of Hudson and Hills. This woman defied all odds and should have never lived, much less have the nerve to tell her story to all. But she did.The story reads easily, like fiction, but you must remind yourself at all times this is REAL. Events really DID HAPPEN. In order for Wanda's suffering to have been worthwhile to share, we have to learn from her.I implore women especially to read this book and to see that we do have a way to take an extremely bad situation and right it.Another fascinating part of this book is the way Wanda's husband stood by her, throughout it all. This man has had to suffer his own grief and guilt. Another title could have been &quot;In Hell: A Love Story Emerges.&quot;Wanda is -- tragically -- not just another pretty face, she was a daughter, a mother, a wife, a friend ... a survivor.Thanks for a story well told."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"I read An Hour To Kill, the first book written by these two authors, and liked their writing style so much I bought this book. This story was a little different in that it was writtenfrom the perspective of the victim, but it was just as interesting. I like the author's writing style, as it moves the story along at a nice pace and sticks to the story--doesn't getcaught up in all the nonessential facts of the case. In this story, Wanda Summers is the focus, as she and her family attempt to survive an unthinkable crime. I won't give the story away, but will say the reader is captivated from the first page to the last. How Wanda and her family ever made it through is beyond anyone's guess. I recommend this book to anyone who wants toread a survivor's story."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"There were many expectations as to how Dale Hudson and Billy Hills would handle their second true crime book. After all, their first, An Hour To Kill, with all its controversy and popularity, would be a hard book to follow. It was no surprise however, to find that their new book, A Reason To Live, is filled with so much more than ever was expected.In Hudson-Hills style, not only does the reader get an inside detailed and sordid crime story, but also an inside look at victimization at its finest. The story, which revolves around Wanda Summers is an inconceivable story of valiancy and determination. In 1979, Wanda Summers became the unfortunate victim of Gene Skaar and Rusty Woomer, two men with no consciousness. Wanda, along with her friend Louise, was kidnapped, brutally raped and then shot in cold blood, left to die. She and Louise were not Skaar's and Woomer's first victims however, they would be the last. Shortly after their crime spree, Gene Skaar killed himself before being apprehended by police, and Rusty Woomer was arrested and charged on numerous counts.Hudson and Hills provide a spellbinding story by introducing the reader to Wanda's life of victim and survivor, which is a rarity in true crime books today. As many books mainly focus on the crime and criminal, once again Hudson and Hills provide readers with a different look at a crime through the victim's eyes. The reader has the ability to feel the emotions that Wanda has been going through years after the crime occurred. Not only the emotions keep the reader wanting more either, the facts of the case and the determination by Wanda to change victim's rights is truly an act of bravery; after so much endurance of pain and frustration through years of legal mishaps during penalty phases for Woomer.While many readers of the true crime genre wonder what happens to the victims of violent crimes, A Reason To Live makes sure the reader is satisfied with the results of the victims afterwards, instead of leaving the reader unsettled. There is no doubt that this book will also catapult among the true crime genre population with great strides. A Reason To Live is poignant and courageous and will leave you ready to read Hudson and Hills next book."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"Excellent. This book I couldn't put down, even though I tried. What happened to Wanda Summers and the other people broke myheart. Wanda is a special and courageous young woman and I hopeshe has found the peace she deserves. A BEAUTIFUL STORY!!"},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"It doesn't matter if you are a true crime junkie or not, I thinkA Reason To Live is a must read for everyone. It is more than just a true crime book; it is a book of courage, inspiration, andhuman tragedy. Wanda and Jimmy Summers, and the other victims ofRonald Woomer and Eugene Skaar were brave, God-fearing individuals, who didn't deserve what happened to them. Yet, in the same manner, the authors depicted Woomer and Skaar as suchtroubled humans that I couldn't help but feel sorry for them, too. Call me crazy, but even after reading what Rusty Woomer did,I felt he was somehow salvageable. A Reason To Live will testevery human emotion and challenge your position on the DeathPenalty. I read the first Hudson-Hills book, An Hour To Kill,and believe these two authors just keep getting better and better with each book. I look forward to reading their next book,and hope it will be as good as their others."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"This is The Best True Crime book and one of the best books I have ever read!

I look forward to reading more by these Authors!"},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"Because the book tells a true story that happened in the community where I live I wanted to read the facts. What I found in this book was much more than facts. The authors have told a story of inspiration without ever becoming preachy or sentimental. This book should be required reading for every adult. How amazing to see someone like the criminals in this story with no regard for the consequences of their acts and to see the amazing resilience of someone like Ms. Summers (whose actions had no reason to cause these circumstances)taking on the responsibility to survive, to grow, to raise her family, to be a contributor to society. How many of us would have her courage, strength, spirit to survive never mind to triumph. Thank you to Ms. Summers for letting her story be told and to the authors for telling a gripping and suspenseful tale while still respecting the victims and never manipulating the reader to feel... the reader feels the love and determination of these survivors thanks to the authors."},{"Title":"A Reason To Live : The True Story of One Woman's Love, Courage and Determination to Survive","review":"What a great true story of how a woman overcomes such tragedy. This is a true crime story but instead of focusing on the perp, Billy and Dale focus on the survivor, Wanda. She overcomes being raped and being shot in the face. Such a great way to tell a true crime story and it definitely is a twist from traditional true crime books. Nicely done!"},{"Title":"Successful gardening a-z of annuals, biennials, & bulbs (vol. 4)","review":"This was the required text book for a herbeceous plant class at the technical college I attend. The book was valuable to the more knowledgable students and exceedingly helpful to the beginning student. I used this book as a frequent reference while studying annuals. As a Master Gardener I have referenced this text for information while volunteering with the Girl Scouts and at an assisted living facility."},{"Title":"Successful gardening a-z of annuals, biennials, & bulbs (vol. 4)","review":"I bought this book as a companion book to my Sunset Western Garden book. The main reason why I bought it was because of the color photos (Sunset's book only has sketches) and I found I needed to see real photographs of the flowers when planning my gardens. For my purposes, it serves me very well allthough it seems that it contains only the &quot;popular&quot; species as far as flowers go. It also is very short in its descriptions and what type of care the plants need. It does not contain enough information on its own, but as a cross reference, it is great. I find it serves my purposes well for needing to see &quot;real life&quot; pictures of the potential flowers I want to plant."},{"Title":"Secrets For Exceptional Speaking","review":"In this book, Stephanie Hendrie shares her \\"secret\\" techniques for exceptional speaking. The book is an invaluable resource to those who have taken Stephanie's course and those who haven't as well. Stepahnie's approach to speaking is unique and very helpful for many of us who have searched for ways to improve our speaking abilities. The book is easy to read and understand. It provides many valuable insights on how to overcome fear and nervousness as well as how to create well received, polished speeches. I highly recommend this book to everyone - students, teachers, executives, managers, club and church officers, religious leaders etc. It is a great reference and resource book for those who are experienced speakers and a great guide for those just getting started as well."},{"Title":"The Amateur Cracksman","review":"A great book that's very well written, The Amateur Cracksman is a must read classic. Though it lacks moral value (A. J. Raffles steals mostly just for kicks) it has what most great classics lack, a good sense of humor. It's about Bunny, a broke journalist on the verge of comitting suicide, who seeks help from from his best friend from school. Before he realises it, he has just become the loyal side-kick of one of England's greatest thieves. As Raffles is one of the best cricket players in England, he gets invited (along with the ever-faithful Bunny) to the houses of the rich and famous of England. At night, he robs them blind. Marvelously written, its set in the Victorian period. It's packed with action and adventure, and a lot of cynnical jokes. A great introduction to classics, it is a more relaxed story than most books of it's era. Though A. J. Raffles and Bunny are not exactly great role-models for young readers, their almost devious acts are ammended by their courageous acts on the battle field. I definitely recommend reading the Amateur Cracksman!"},{"Title":"The Amateur Cracksman","review":"Around 1900, E.W. Hornung's Raffles stories were hugely popular in England. Raffles was an English gentleman who was also an amateur safe-cracker and all-around burglar with the aid of his somewhat reluctant junior partner \\"Bunny\\".Raffles and Bunny have been compared to Holmes and Watson and for good reason. Hornung's sister was married to Arthur Conan Doyle and acknowledged his debt to his better-known in-law. Taking the role of Watson, Bunny authored the recollections of Raffles' criminal exploits (necessarily published after-the-fact, however). Whereas Bunny clung (somewhat unsuccessfully) to Victorian morality, Raffles' genius could be not be bounded by mere social custom. Raffles, however, was not evil; he just enjoyed high living and supporting that life style by stealing jewels from indolent rich people struck him as entirely reasonable.Raffles, by the way, was gentleman by merit, that is, he was a world class cricket player, but did not have the family background or personal wealth to be otherwise qualified as a gentleman. At the time, this manner of entering the British elite was quite new. Only twenty years earlier, being a well-known athlete would scarcely have opened the doors to the social elite. Indeed, merely having money would not have pried open the doors either. The doors opened to such parvenus only in the aftermath of the agricultural depression that devastated the economic power of the land-based aristocracy (followed shortly by declines in their social and political power). See the excellent historyThe Decline and Fall of the British Aristocracyby David Cannadine.Like Doyle with Holmes, Hornung tried to kill off Raffles only to bring him back in response to popular demand. Unlike Holmes, the Raffles stories quickly faded from prominence. This decline in popularity may have been partially due to lingering Victorian unease with the antihero. In my mind it was also at least partially due to the fact that the stories, while quite entertaining, are not as good as the Holmes tales. Recommended."},{"Title":"The Amateur Cracksman","review":"This entertaining book is almost forgotten now, but during the first part of the century is was one of the favorite books of every teenage boy in the English-speaking world. They loved to read about Raffles, the upper-class and charming Amateur Cracksman (thief) and his adventures.Raffles himself is indeed great fun, I love the idea of an upper-class young Englishman who takes to crime rather than get a job, which after all would interfere with his high society life and amateur cricket career. The book is a series of related stories, each slyly witty and subversive, each a clever detective story in reverse.The reason they were indeed detective stories in reverse is simple: E.W. Hornung was the brother-in-law of Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of the Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Hornung wrote these stories partly as a satire on Holmes (and Watson, his narrator &quot;Bunny&quot; is a rock-stupid, dead-on parody), and partly just to annoy. It worked, Conan Doyle worried about this book's effect on the public morals!Now, who wouldn't enjoy a book written to annoy a self-righteous in-law? Especially if the book is actually good? (The book was later made into a weak film starring David Niven, and inspired &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot;)"},{"Title":"The Amateur Cracksman","review":"This book is a reproduction (including printing errors) of a book originally published in 1907. It collects short stories about A.J. Raffles, \\"The Amateur Cracksman\\". Raffles is a gentleman and a cricket player, who supports himself by carrying out ingenious burglaries. His stories are told by his accomplace \\"Bunny\\". There are eight stories here, ending with a story in which Raffles and Bunny are finally arrested. That was probably the author's attempt to end the series, but he later wrote more Raffles stories due to popular demand. These stories are quite entertaining."},{"Title":"When the tide turns;: The Netherlands' struggle against the water","review":"Quaint, middle school level review of the water works in the Netherlands, with 80 pages of photographs."},{"Title":"Berkeley (Past Masters)","review":"Berkley has one idea for which the world knows him. He is the successor of Locke who pushes British Empiricism one more step in the direction of Hume's skepticism about our knowledge of the real world. His great denial is the denial of physical reality, the materialness of the material world. The only Reality for Berkley is Ideas that are in the Mind of God.Berkley is thus not really of the breadth in dimension of the political thinker Locke or the historian Hume.Urmson does not dwell much on Berkley's life giving us the bare details and even less than that. For instance he tells us that Berkley has a wife and a son but really does not indicate anything about his personal character relation to his family etc.If the Past Masters series is to tell of the life as well as the work then this particular volume falls short.We do learn certain details about Berkley including the story of his failed American venture.Urmson is good at presenting a picture of the intellectual and scientific world Berkley found himself, and relating how Berkley's philosophy was a reaction to this world. He too tries to show how what seems to be a ' ridiculous idea on the surface' can be interpreted to make strong sense philosophically.This particular volume I am sure will be of great use for those who take interest in the close technical arguments around the subject of philosophical ' idealism.'"},{"Title":"Helping Your Grandchildren Through Their Parents' Divorce","review":"Some thing I wish that my grandparents had to help me with my parent's divorce. I still have problems because of it after over 50 years. This book is also helping me."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Sometimes I wonder if there's a point to reviewing older novels. I mean - there's obviously a point to reading them, and Ramona presents a good case for that. But after reading a book like this it's hard to imagine that others haven't read it, or something like it... until I remember that until this past semester, I'd never even heard of Ramona.For those of you who, like me, had never thought to pick this book up let me just say that it will frustrate, awe, and inspire you. The story is one that speaks of epic, sweeping love and loss, but it's buried in pages upon pages of description which, back in the day before the internet, television, and radio, would have passed for entertainment but today just feels as if it's one more thing to push through in order to get to the meat of the story.Thankfully, I read this book for a classroom setting - so three days were set aside for us to get to the meat and actually talk about the themes and ideas in Ramona.Here's what I came away from this talks with:Even in a story, such as Ramona, when the author is seeking to shed light on the issues of the time (specifically the tensions between whites, Mexicans, and Native Americans), in order for Ramona to be related to she is given \\"white\\" characteristics - i.e. blue eyes from her Scottish Father.Sweeping stereotypes are made not only about the whites (and honestly, as far as stereotypes go, they were pretty harsh but necessary ones) but also about Mexicans. Even the Native Americans in this book did not escape judgement from Helen Hunt Jackson.Jackson has no problem spending 70 pages talking about the little things - making a bed on a porch, tension-filled relationship between Ramona and her adoptive family, and so on.. but she spends less than a paragraph on a vital turning part of the story. In fact, the action and result of this turning part happened so quickly I thought I'd imagined it happening and had to go back to re-read it.I understand from our discussions the importance of a book like Ramona and I believe that it's important that it continues to be read and talked about - but more than anything, I wonder how that will be possible with the changing of our culture. We talk in 140 character tweets - so how can we expect young adults today to be patient enough to read pages upon pages of description? It saddens me to think that this story is one of many that will end up lost as a result - so if you decide to read just one \\"classic\\" American story this year, think about choosing this one."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I got the book exactly came how the seller said it was. It was fast shipping and in great condition. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Helen Hunt Jackson's two major books, CENTURY OF DISHONOR and RAMONA were on a reading list of mine when I was a graduate student back in the Upper Paleolith. I didn't like either book, but am forced to concede their value.RAMONA reminded me of trying to eat ten gallons of ice cream. It was too sweet, too melodramatic and I was lucky to avoid death by cloying suffocation from reading it.It is, however, a great example of late 19th century romance. People didn't have e-mail, text messaging, computers, TV or radio. Instead, they read! A lot of them read RAMONA and apparently enjoyed it a lot more than many of today's readers.It is dated, but that is its true value, in my opinion. Jackson doesn't step out of her skin, or her age, when she writes. Some of the dated, annoying stereotypes which roll off her pen illustrate the perceptions of the age in which she lived. For better or worse, that's their value.If you're interested in American Literature, Intellectual History, or regional literature related to California, RAMONA may be of interest to you.

One can't help but wonder at her glossed over, hisoricaly nostaligic view of the mission system in California. The Native Americans who were in this system were kept in virtual bondage and horribly abused, both physicaly and sexualy and were forced to give up the lifestyles that they had known. I think Ramona has good intention, but like Uncle Tom's Cabin, the book it was modeled after, suffers from a severe case of historical nostalgia. It is, however, interesting to read the book from a modern perspective in the sense that reform literature has certanly changeg over the years! A good read, just beware of the hisorical inacuracies."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"If anyone is actually looking for a true tale of the plight of California Indians, don't bother to look at Jackson's novel.It is inherently racist, written by a woman who doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same likes as Upton Sinclair or Harriet Beecher Stowe.On one of her visits to California, Jackson called the Native Americans she saw \\"loathsome, abject and hideous.\\" In her novel, she doesn't stray far from this inherent indignation of another race. In fact, she most likely had no idea she was being racist, another reason entirely why this book should be burned. ALternately thorughout the book, Jackson refers to the indians Ramona and ALlesandro encounter as \\"patient creatures\\" (16), \\"poor creatures\\" (20), \\"wild creatures\\" (47), \\"faithful creatures\\" (353), \\"miserable creatures\\" (324), \\"vagabond bands\\" (286) \\"like beasts\\" without the Christianizing presence of the Missions (231). are they human? possibly. are they equal to the pastoral spanish who enslaved them that Jackson venerates so much? most definitely not.Secondly, ALlesandro could be the most anglicized Indian ever. He is most assurredly an abberation, physically looked like a mexican, was the most devout catholic, lives in a house that is like any mexican villa. INdeed, Jackson remarks that \\"There were not many such Indians as Allesandro and his Father. If there had been, it would have been better for their people,\\" (327) and that he \\"almost makes one forget he is an Indian.\\" (101).also, she refuses to create an interracial love story. the whole crappy book is predicated on the fact that Ramona is half indian. only when she is indian can she fulfill Jackson's debased notion of racial determinism.Besides the myriad moral reasons why this book is so terrible, it could be the most groandiose, verbose, and pooorly written romance book EVER. the characters lack any moral ambiguity which would make for interesting characterization and are constantly marked by sweeping romantic gestures that could better be classified as trash fiction than a literary classic.You'd find more entertainment from reading the yellow pages than wasting your time. The world would be a better place if the trees from which the paper for this book came from were still planted."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Just when I had begun to despair that I might never truly fall in love with a book again, along came Ramona. From the first page, I was captured by the poetic nature of the writing. Some books can be read quickly, not so Ramona. Every sentence is crafted so carefully, every description so complete, some passages must be read over and over again just for the sheer pleasure of the prose. The plot combination of social justice and romance makes the book amazingly contemporary. The racism of this book is directed toward the Native American population and their story is a heart wrenching one indeed. The description of the startling beauty of the landscape and the lives of the characters stands in stark contrast to the breathtaking cruelty with which this nation took land from its native population. Ramona thrilled me and broke my heart. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I have Heard Ramona by Helen Hunt Jackson described as a &quot;propaganda novel.&quot; That it well may have been in its day. But &quot;Ramona&quot; has not endured all these years because of a propaganda message. This novel has endured because of the trueness of the characters--The noble Alessandro, the patient, tender Ramona, the faithful Felipe, the just, stern, sad Senora Moreno.Even the minor characters are true to form especially the jealous, vindictive Margarita, the loyal Marta, and the strutting but endearing Juan Can.I rediscovered this book in a dusty corner of our public library and devoured in in two days.A book becomes a classic when it becomes part of your soul. The love story of Ramona and Alessandro has burned itself into my heart where it will remain forever."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I just recently heard of this book, although it was a bestseller around the turn of the century, and was popular through the 20's. Modern readers may find the language and parts of the plot melodramatic and overly sentimental, but the characters are strong and memorable, the story is full of exciting incident, and the portrayal of the United States government still shocks. I grew up in California, but I had never really seen how \\"white Americans\\" appeared to the Native Americans and Mexicans who first lived here. \\"Ramona\\" gives the earlier settlers a voice. Erica Baumeister's review, quoted on the Amazon page for this book, states that \\"the book has the flaws of being created by an author who, although deeply engaged and sympathetic, had not experienced the life she was describing.\\" I don't agree--perhaps if I had grown up as an \\"Indian\\" or Mexican in those times I wouldn't find the book convincing, but as it is, it worked for me. The main characters, Ramona and Alessandro, are \\"fairy-tale-ized\\", but their story still touches, and the book still has power. Helen Hunt Jackson purposely wrote \\"Ramona\\" to call attention to the U.S.'s unfair treatment of Native Americans, but the two essays included in the Signet edition claim that, for all the popularity of the novel, it didn't bring results. For that, we have only our own injustice to blame, because this poetic messenger did her best to right some wrongs."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I thought this was one of the best books I have ever read. You will fall in love with Ramona (Majella) and Alessandro.If you are like me your heart will break, then it will heal slowly, but maybe not all the way. While reading this book you may learn some things you did not know before. If you have some spare time, read this book. But don't race through it, there is meaning in every line. I recomend this book mostly to girls. It can be read from teens up. You do not have to be fans of history to love this book."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I must admit I read this novel only to get the background on my girlfriend Majel's name. I initially held no respect for its &quot;Great American Love Story&quot; subtitle, but this book really hit me right in the chest. I liked that I was able to extract the characters' personalities from their words and tones rather than from paragraphs of third-person description. I liked that it piqued my interest in nineteenth century Californian history, especially the upsetting struggle of the Mexicans and Native Americans living there. And lastly, I liked experiencing the boundless love that flowed from the simple, strong and beautiful Ramona. A quick, colorful, emotionally satisfying novel."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Ramona, set in early Spanish/Mexican California, weaves the tale of love between the Indian Allessandro and the Mexican-Indian girl Ramona. Rich, deep characters and vivid description of the landscapes makes this novel a great piece of California historical fiction. Through Jackson's powerful illustrations, the racism Mexicans and Indians both endured at the hands of White and Mexican settlers is experienced by the reader. Yet the love story is what makes this book and Jackson's romanticism of the landscape and the main charcaters only enhances Californians' fascination with Mission Revival."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"It has been a long time since I first read this book, but the subject matter will be around for a long time to come. Bewitching love story for which at least one beautiful song has been written, \\"Ramona\\" and possibly \\"Vaya Con Dios\\". It is a love story, one whose emotion most of us will recognize; another time, another place, from our own Spring Time; woven skillfully into cultural differences, that somehow begets bigotry, born of all the little differences that make each of us unique, but also make us strange and unacceptable to others who cannot accept differences from what they have always known.The descriptions of that far removed landscape and time are marvelous. The Old early Missions, the sheep, the priests who visit the valley in the traditional way on foot, traveling on ancient footpaths to bring religion to the people (and keep them religious), all are magical in their simplicity as the author brings forth their tale. She is also one of the first to dare write of things unsavory to the average conscience. She took conditions \\"as they were\\" and exposed them \\"for what they were\\" in the treatment of people displaced.It's a setting deep within the Old Spanish Mission Country of Southern California, among the sheep ranches, and steeped in Spanish Culture, strict traditions, and unforgiving religion. Times were hard, values were strict and anyone not fitting snugly into a pre-conceived notion of a pre-conceived group was hard-pressed to find a life to live in peace anywhere. It is in this life where Ramona grows up, a child of a misalliance between the former lover of the Senora Moreno's own sister and an Indian woman - that's a twist in the story to be discovered while reading it. The Senora, for a variety of reasons you will understand as you read, agrees to take the child Ramona in to raise, although she never accepts her, because she is not blood family. The description of Ramona is captivating, long black hair of the Indian girl, dark blue eyes of the Scottish father - truly she is beautiful, but it is also apparent that her beauty goes deeper than the skin; she is beautiful of spirit as well as of the flesh.Alessandro, an Indian lad, comes to work on the ranch early in the spring to help with the annual sheep shearing. Ramona quickly sees in him something she has never seen before - someone who will accept her for whom she is, without reservation, coupled with a gentle mind and character much like her own. She falls in love with him, adding another layer of \\"difference\\" to her half-breed status.Felipe, the beloved son of the venerable, strong and proud Matriarch, Senora Moreno, who rules not only the ranch but her son with an iron hand, falls in love with Ramona himself but knows he can never take her for his own, for many reasons. Those \\"reasons\\" finally dissolve during the tragic ending of the story and what remains of the life of Ramona blends again into the home she left as a young woman - as she tried to make a new life with a stranger she has loved deeply. As she is delivered back to a life of security, she is strangely serene - but never again will she feel wild, young excitement once experienced with Allesandro, the Indian. I offer one of the last lines of the epilogue - as she finally stands \\"quietly in Filepe's arms\\":\\"...how unlike was she to that Ramona who flung herself on Alessandro's breast, crying 'take me with you! I would rather die than have you leave me!'.....\\"Ramona is well deserving of it's place in Classic Literature - a love and strife story extraordinaire."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I heard about the book while hiking at Seven Falls near Colorado Springs. HHJ was suppose to have gone to the overlook there to write, including parts of Ramona. This intrigued me and so I checked it out. I don't read much non-fiction, so I enjoyed the idea of a history based novel. It was enough of a love story for me to earn points with female friends, but enough of an adventure to keep me interested. One part of the book that I found distracting was the attempt at phonetic spelling of the Tennessee drawl of a few characters. I had the hardest time reading that, which perhaps is an excellent way of HHJ to capture the difficulty of listening to it."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Readers can follow the narrative style of &quot;Ramona&quot; with ease.

However, having said that, I found the book a thoroughly enjoyable read...overdramaticized, yes, but we can forgive it when we consider the original date of publication. However, it is the story behind the story that is most interesting. What Ramona truly is....a middle class white woman's perception of what it might be like to be an Indian. Jackson was an abolitionist turned author in the 1830's. This is her most recognized and extensive work. So the next time you read it, if you read between the lines, you will see HER innate prejudices and assumptions.

After the 1834 Secularization of the 21 missions in the chain founded by Father Serra, the California of the grandees slowly, inevitably began to fade into historical memory. Three groups were drastically affected by the disintegration of this social system--admittedly not free of innate injustice. Ruin fell upon the devout Franciscan fathers, the Hispanic hidalgos who had received vast estates from the King, and the Native Americans who first respected the land--ever at the bottom of the social chain.Depicted as the underlying moral evil of all three groups are theYankees--Americans in general, whose greed and violence destroyed innocent lives, trampled decades of royal justice and raped the landscape of Alta California with wanton violence and callous indifference. Dispersed among these recriminations and regrets the author weaves a grimly fascinating tapestry of love, psychological brutality, outraged or warped honor and overbearing pride.Senora Moreno rules her household with an iron fist and a cold heart, except where it concerns her only, somewhat nave son, Felipe, 20. A master at manipulation this dowager wields absolute power to her vast household and retainers but also behind the scenes, deferring only to aged Father Salvierderra, for whom she has had a chapel built.Keeping selfish secrets about her dead sister's half-breed daughter (who considers a marriage between a white man and an squaw valid?), she hoards both the jewels and the love int ended for the girl. Obeying only the letter of her promise to her sister, she never intended to honor the spirit of motherhood, thus condemning Ramona to be raised without affection.At 19 Ramona is lovely, sweet, gentle and genteel (thanks to her convent training) but sheltered in a simple country lifestyle, where she is kept in ignorance of the reality of the present world and her own, mysterious past. This tenuous status quo changes when the annual sheep shearing occurs, the year that 21-year-old Alessandro, the educated son of a chief, leads his band of Indians to the hacienda. Their hidden love smolders until it erupts in a passionate embrace, which is unfortunately witnessed and misinterpreted by the shocked Senora.Her outraged reaction and fierce determination to punish theculprits sets in motion a chain of events which result in both the loversfleeing the rancho. There follow years of persecution of this doomed pair, as they seek to live peacefully--in harmony with nature and man. Jackson includes heavy themes in this story: racial prejudice, the power of Catholicism, the tension between mother and son, and the regenerating force of love. Partly a novel of social protest, RAMONA--despite its semi-tragic denouement, remains a classic tale of old California, whose pathos and passion reach out to modern readers."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"This book might be the only romance novel that I've read in my life, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I purchased it for my 95 year-old mother and she expressed her joy at being able to read the print without getting headaches."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"The propaganda classic of 1884. Jackson intended to stir American sympathies for the plight of Native Americans, which probably explains the flat perfection of her Indian protagonists, Ramona and her lover/husband Alessandro. The two are hounded pillar to post by greedy American settlers, with no recourse to law and no protection from church or state.I'd give the first half of the book five stars and the second half three. What gives it five stars? (1) The setting: Old California, just after the territory has changed hands from Mexico to the U.S. Both the Moreno ranch and the Indian villages and ruined missions were fresh and alive.(2) Senora Moreno. The wily, domineering matriarch steals every scene from her pushover son Felipe and blandly-angelic foster daughter Ramona. She's complex, and Jackson does a great job getting inside her motivations.And the three-star second-half? Well, when the book has to depend on Ramona and Alessandro for interest, it gets a little dull. The good-hearted Tennessee poor-white family that shows up livens things up somewhat, if only because the reader must expend great effort to translate Auntie Ri's orthographical-nightmare dialect."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Ibi is right.

I only got into Helen and her work myself because of my interest in Emily and her world. \\"Ramona,\\" though wonderfully well-written and still readable, even historically important, is a 19th century romance, and therefore not \\"literature,\\" properly speaking, nor likely to turn up as required reading in any academic curriculum anytime soon. It's not easy for us today to imagine that age, back when the much more famous Emily Dickinson was still completely unknown, in which the too young death of Helen Hunt Jackson inspired a national day of mourning.Much of the historical interest of \\"Ramona\\" swirls around one of America's forgotten wars, much like Korea, in this case the Mexican War. To this day, Mexico still resents the loss of about half of itself to the burgeoning US, ceded to us by a corrupt pusillanimous Mexican government as essentially spoils of war, with matters considerably complicated by the discovery of gold in a huge chunk of it, California, a couple of years later. The issue in \\"Ramona,\\" however, has principally to do with the fates of the population of the vast new territory at the time, namely its Mexicans and Indians. The tragic destruction of their wealth, ancient land titles and treaties, communities, culture and even people at the hands of the inrushing American population, all under the diffident benign neglect of Washington government, barely stopped short of softcore genocide. Jackson, already a famous writer, as a young New England widow, relocated to the West for health reasons and subsequently remarried, was one of those American thinkers of the day who discovered and got interested in the plight of this displaced, distressed population as a social issue.Jackson wrote a detailed survey of the crisis, with which she bombarded congress, only to get no palpable reaction. Accordingly, she decided that what was really needed was some sort of public outcry, inspired by some sort of popular literature, after the model of her friend and fellow New Englander Harriet Beecher Stowe's \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\\" which had so inflamed the nation as to inspire the Abolitionist movement. The resulting opus was \\"Ramona,\\" the story of the doomed romance of a half breed Mexican rancher's daughter and a young Indian brave, their affairs caught up in the tidal wave of US immigration into their ancestral lands, and it's a dandy. No chick-lit here; it's a much different wild West as seen through the eyes of someone who actually lived there, written by a gal with a real gift for descriptive prose, eye for local color, and a keen insight into the inner motivations of her characters.In one sense, the book was a success; it was a huge best seller, and Emily Dickinson wasn't the only reader, by far, who adored it. In another sense, it failed, perhaps by being too good... certainly a far superior book to \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" The same general public who were enthralled by its vividness somehow never internalized its story as depicting a real national crisis about which someone ought to do something. In defense of Washington, it must be said that the tiny government of the day, what with Indian wars, Reconstruction and such, already had enough on its plate to tremendously complicate things politically for them, even without such a vexed issue as this one. However that may be, Jackson was not about to give up, continuing to tour and write about the Southwest despite her mounting health problems, which, unfortunately, killed her a couple of years later, with her dreams of social justice still unrealized. The legacy: a ripping good story that lived on for a long time after its author. Not to mention an ongoing sociopolitical crisis with which anybody who knows the Southwest at all is only too familiar."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I AM 79 YEARS OLD AND 'RAMONA' IS THE FIRST REAL BOOK I EVER READ (UNLESS YOU COUNT DICK AND JANE).

The author, herself an activist, tells the story of the injustices that were done to the Spaniards, Mexicans and Indians by the early American explorers who came to California. Ramona, who is part-Indian. becomes the heroine in a tale of love and hate. The book is one of the most famous stories ever written about early California, and there have been annual Ramona-festivals in many towns over the years. There is also a town named Ramona in southern California. Most of the characters are very well drawn, but the main character of Ramona is lacking. This does not spoil the impact of the book. As a lover of early western history in America, this book is the best I have ever read about the transition of the old world into the new. Reading it for the second time, I have enjoyed it even more."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I actually read a 1908 edition of this book but this was as close as I could find. I found Ramona to be a pretty good story but had trouble understanding why it was said to have been monumental in bringing changes to the government's treatments of Native Americans or why it apparently received such myth like status in certain parts of Southern California. I was raised in or had family in nearly all of the territory mentioned in Ramona (which ranges from San Fransisco all the way down to Mexico). I had never heard mention of the story until a local book dealer here in NC offered me a copy of it. It was only recently that I got around to reading it and I did like how well the book describes all the mountainous terrain I grew up in and miss so much, particularly the mention of manzanita trees which are so beautiful but are only indigenous to that area. Also the mention of all the missions, particularly the one in San Diego I visited so often was a nice mental vacation back home.Outside of the background, I was excited to read this book that was suppose to have been so life changing for the Native American people, as half my family falls in that category. Unfortunately, I was not struck by anything earth shattering. Jackson does talk about the government's early allowances of whites basically claiming public domain over the natives' homes and lands, which was definitely tragic but the true horror of what really happened at that time never really reaches the level it needs to to be moving. You would gain more from reading pure historical accounts or textbooks or visiting native area museums near the reservations. I found Ramona to be more of a love story than anything and even the love story was sweet but again, just short of really moving. Ramona herself goes through mental and physical maturity and it was nice to see her grow with each experience throughout the story but her love Alessandro struck me as mostly annoying to be honest. It seemed he spent all of his time in constant outrage, whining, paranoia, melodramatic smoochy love talk with Ramona, or just bat crazy. Granted his people had been through some hell, but even when things were good for him, Alessandro just never struck me as a real man secure in himself and I wondered what Ramona was fawning all over. Even Ramona at one point makes a comment that she jumped to hear Alessandro laugh because it was so rare.I saw one reviewer on another of edition of this book mention that it seemed that Jackson was trying to write how she assumed the Native Americans spoke and acted. That is definitely the impression I got too. Particularly with Alessandro but with many of the Native characters, they would either sound White-influenced or Mexican-influenced in their speech and behavior but never really Native American to me. Jackson's \\"Indian\\" dialog reminded me of the way they would make Tonto speak in the old Lone Ranger movies. Not to mention that Natives (at least the men lol) are not so open with their emotions and feelings, even with wives. There is a guardedness and stoicism that just wasn't well portrayed here.Like I said, Ramona is pretty good to get an idea of the Southern California landscape, and there are some great interesting characters - Ramona herself and especially the sassy Aunt Ri (though her deep Appalachian dialect makes for tough reading-at certain parts it goes on for pages!). The love story between Alessandro and Ramona is cute and bittersweet and you do feel for them through their joys and tribulations, but overall it just wasn't QUITE as moving as I was hoping for."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"As a playwright, I haven't been inspired to adapt a novel until I read Ramona. What works for me? The melodrama is, after all, average, and the love story...a little predictable. But there's something audacious about author Helen Hunt Jackson and her bold \\"Mother Jones\\" muckraking persona that constantly reminds you throughout the pages about the injustices committed against Native Americans. Yet, in spite of this heavy message, there's something utterly fascinating about its main characters--the beautiful Ramona, the daring Alessandro, the unforgiving Senora, even the wimpy Felipe. They create a powerful scenario worthy of intelligent, passionate drama. I, in turn, wrote the play which has been produced at PlayWright's Theater in Phoenix and at Arizona State University in Tempe.

A story that has history, romance, prejudice, love, loss, and everything in between . Please read this book. I only regret that I never read it until I was in my thirties. This is Helen Hunt Jacksons masterpiece and the attention that it gave to the treatment of Indians is remarkable."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"There is no doubt that Helen Hunt Jackson's novel Ramona is a classic -- the fact that it is still in print more than 125 years after it was first published is testament to that. The novel is primarily a love story set in Old California at a time when three cultures -- Mexican, Anglo and Indian -- were colliding. Jackson's intent was to create a story (and much of the events in the book were real-life events that she wove into her tale) that would bring the plight of the Indians to the attention of the white American population. And in that she had a fair degree of success, as her book was popular and there did seem to be some shift in sentiment towards Native Americans in the wake of its publication.All that being said, Jackson's writing is undeniably weak. Although she was a successful and popular writer in her day, to the modern reader her style is overly melodramatic. All of her characters are one-sided and under-developed. Aunt Ri, who is one of the more interesting ones, unfortunately speaks in a dialogue that is practically indecipherable. Near the end of the book, when some of her speeches go on unbroken for a page or more, I had to skip them entirely because it just took more mental effort to make sense of them than I was able to muster.Ramona, the main character around whom the entire story revolves, is just the sort of heroine that Walt Disney would begin to crank out, starting with Snow White in the 1930s. Abandoned as a child, raised in a loveless home by a foster mother who bordered on cruelty and neglect, Ramona is nevertheless sweet and good and perfect in every way. Oh, and captivatingly beautiful, also (natch). She starts out perfect on page 1 and remains so all the way to the end, and inspires near-reverence in everyone who encounters her. She is a total bore.This isn't a terrible book -- as a picture of the long-lost culture of Old California it is both effective and unique (I know of no other novels set in this time period that are so well-known as Ramona). But it is definitely not all that engaging, as evidenced by how long it took me to read it. I should have easily finished the book in two or three days but it took me more than twice that long, because I just wasn't compelled to pick up the book and read it.For those who are particularly interested and intrigued in the setting of Old California at the end of the Mexican era and the dawn of the American one, I could recommend this. Just don't expect it to rock your world, and you shouldn't be too disappointed."},{"Title":"Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 6e (Robbins Pathology)","review":"...so goes your Medicine&quot;.

It is a must have for medical students interested in pathology as well as pathologists."},{"Title":"Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 6e (Robbins Pathology)","review":"Ok, here's the deal. At a first glance, you would find this book fat and scary, but once you get into it you'll find it very amusing and interesting. I love it's general design (nice pictures and drawings), it's accurate information and it's easy -to-read format.The only problem I find is that you gotta have TIME to read it, and that thing is not so abundant when you study medicine. But believe me, once you read it, you will master pathology, and it is a MUST for a reference book, in your pathology year as well as in the future."},{"Title":"Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 6e (Robbins Pathology)","review":"This is THE textbook of pathology for students of medicine and dentistry!Pros? Well, it has all the 4 C's...1) Clear language... minimal verbosity, straight to the point2) Comprehensive ... it has all the facts the student needs to know for exams as well as future clinical practice3) Colour pictures ... not the black and white stuff but full colours to add more morphological meaning to the texts4) Cast ... I'm sure everyone wants to read a book written by authoritative pathologists?Cons?1) Cumbersome ... students just initiated into the world of pathology may find it tough to plough through the thousand over pages of text (like I did while in med school), but believe me, if you stick by it, you'll enjoy the fruits of your labour in due time.2) Some of the facts and tumour classifications may be a little out of date (latest edition published in 1999) but if you're a student, don't brood over it. Tutors would probably highlight major updates during your pathology course."},{"Title":"Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 6e (Robbins Pathology)","review":"I refer to this book time and time again as a physician. It was the best book I read in medical school and it is still relevant to me now.

I have no book in my library that I use more of. It is well illustrated, with good text on all manner of diseases and mechanisms you don't want to be involved in.The only down point is that the chapters are not indexed, so that you know what the title headings in each chapter are, but not which page they are on. A bit of a hassle when you need to find something quickly."},{"Title":"Robbins Pathologic Basis of Disease, 6e (Robbins Pathology)","review":"If you are an ordinary medical student like myself this book is too detailed and has everything there is to know about the subject.

This textbook covers all the pathology needed for medical students and then some. The book is very well structured; the first eleven chapters cover the mechanisms of disease (general pathology) with the remaining chapters covering organ system pathology.

I broke 260 and am now a first year resident at my first choice for neurosurgery (and I would only settle for the most prestigous programs).If you have have high aspirations and want a competitive residency in NeuroSurg, Plastic, Derm or Radiology then you must master this book and memorize the pocket companion also. It is so much more thorough than the BRS and retains some element of succinctness. There are no path questions on the boards that you won't be able to get if you memorize Robbins Pocket Companion book from cover to cover.That is the key, Memorize, Memorize, Memorize then Regurgitate, Regurgitate, Regurgitate and you too can pick where you want to do your residency like I did.This book rules for obtaining a competitive edge over your fellow classmates and other students around the country who try to get by on review books and the lecture notes.Good Luck on Step 1.

Robbins illustrates those mechanisms with easy-to-understand ways. No confusion, no frustration. I also wannna criticize the &quot;Basic Pathology&quot;.

If you want to explore the hidden beauty that Maui has to offer this is the book for you. We especially enjoyed that sights around West Maui and the tips on the road to Hana."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"Based on other Amazon customer reviews, I bought this book and \\"Driving and Discovering Hawaii: Maui and Molokai.\\" The latter has great photos, but we ended up using Maui Revealed exclusively. I have only one quibble--noted below.This guide is what a guide should be: informative, accurate, thorough, helpful, often funny, with its own personality. We have lived and travelled on six continents working for the USG (Foreign Service and Peace Corps before that), been to locales as remote as the Bolivian jungle and Sao Tome (off the coast of central Africa), and are veteran travelers. Even my husband, who has become somewhat jaded remarked after one stop \\"Wow, that book is REALLY good!\\"For example, on the drive up Haleakala to the crater, they advise taking the short Leleiwi trail which most people \\"blow by\\" on their way to the top. As promised \\"five minutes to the end and the crater itself suddenly explodes into view.\\" That tip alone was worth the price of the book, and there's lots more than that to recommend this volume.In another instance, they suggested visiting the Four Falls of Na'ili'ili'haele. The directions were perfect (p. 234): \\"the trailhead is 6/10 mile past the 6 mile marker on Hwy 360 across from some tall Cook Island pines. There's a dirt turnout on the right and a gate.\\" It continues \\"At first the trail can be slippery and awkward as it goes down through bamboo, across a ditch, through more bamboo, then right to the stream. After you boulder-hop across--important--follow the trail as it hugs the bank upstream to the left.\\" Here comes my one quibble with the whole guide.I am 45, and moderately fit and nimble, though a bit leery of slippery rocks. I was wearing grippy-bottom sneakers. The bit about slippery through the bamboo was dead-on accurate. But, their description makes it sound easy to \\"boulder-hop.\\" No way. If I had reef shoes (sneakers designed to let the water flow through), crossing the stream would have been easy the day we were there in February. However, the placement and steepness of the boulders was such that I wasn't sure if I made it across that I could make it back. And, we had our 9 and 5 year olds with us. There is NO way we could make it with them.In pretty much all of their descriptions, plan on doing some scrambling and locomoting while seated, then be pleased on those occasions when you don't have to. But if you are travelling with anyone under the age of 14 or 15, or someone who isn't physically fit or willing to clamber around gripping rocks with fingers to get up or down, it just isn't as easy to reach some of the cool places mentioned as the authors make it sound.That said, if anyone I knew were going to Maui, I'd tell them this is the guide to get. I enjoyed the Driving Guide, and am glad for the high quality pictures I can share in it with folks at home, be we honestly didn't use it while there. Stick with Maui Revealed!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"There are so many good things to say about Maui Revealed, the outstanding guidebook for the Hawaiian island of Maui, that to list them all, the review would need to be as long as the book itself! Suffice it to say, this is the one to buy. After a quick intro explaining the basics of how the book was put together (which shows the authors' hard work and total dedication to their subject matter), and after a short but very informative history of the islands, Doughty and Friedman start, appropriately enough, with a section called The Basics. In other words, what do you need to know about Maui in general even before making the trip? (One hint: No cruise lines operate between Hawaii and the mainland; better plan on flying!) Next, Maui is divided into seven sections (West Maui, Central Maui, Hana Highway, Southeast Maui, Haleakala & Upcountry, South Maui, and Offshore Islands, including Kaho'olawe, Lana'i, and Molokai; Molokini, the crescent islet that is a snorkler's paradise, is covered in the South Maui section), and each section is covered in VERY thorough and exhaustive detail. Then, there are separate chapters covering beaches, activities (golf, kayaking, hiking, etc.), adventures (ex. Hike in a lava tube), island dining (yes, includes luaus!), and finally, recommendations on where to stay in each section on the island. In their assessments, the authors are often brutally frank (their best bet for food in Hana: \\"I don't know, what did you bring with you?\\"); trust me, this will work to your advantage. In my own travels, I found the Hana Highway section to be the best and most useful (thanks, guys, my wife and I would never have found the paradise of Nahiku without it!), and their information is almost always dead-on accurate. (Yes, folks, the road from Hana to the delightful Tedeschi winery is somewhat difficult, but we had no trouble in our convertable. However, please be very careful; it wouldn't hurt to have some basic emergency gear on hand for the trip.) All this, plus useful maps and some of the most gorgeous photos you will ever see, make Maui Revealed a must-purchase for anyone planning to spend a week, a month, or half of forever on this lovely island. Get it ASAP and the truth about the undisputed playground of Hawaii will be revealed!!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"We have dozens of travel books and Maui Revealed is by far the best travel guide we have ever used. The book tells you everything you need to know about where to go to see the most spectacular sights in Maui, what companies to use for any activities you might want to do in Maui, where to eat, and where to stay. The book told us step by step how to get to Maui's hidden waterfalls or the best snorkeling spots (like go 45 feet past phone poll #18, or 1/2 mile past mile marker 5) when these sights are not clearly marked from the road. We were very satisfied with the companies recommended by the book to use for scuba diving and the biking trip down the volcano. We recommend that anyone going to Maui bring this book with them."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"This is a great guide book. My wife and I used it for 12 days recently visiting Maui and found it incredibly helpful. The dining reviews are right on the mark (though one great place, Lahiana Fish Co.-is not in this edition), and the tips to get around the island are very helpful. We found the great banana bread and some little special places that were recommended. I can't imagine visiting the island without this book, and apparently others could not as well. We saw many copies in other people's hands. This is the only guide book you need when visiting Maui!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"I completely concur. This book is great. It will take you to spots you'd never find without it, and every recommendation was correct. This is the only book you will need. Don't waste your money on anything else.

It was terribly confusing to follow and so syrupy and wordy and authoritative. It oversells itself and really gives tourists the wrong impression.

Hawaii's newspapers and community meetings are filled with dilemmas on how to avoid numerous injured travelers as well as continuous trespassing on private land and destruction of natural and cultural resources. In virtually every case the misled tourists were carrying this now-infamous \\"blue book.\\"The restaurant reviews are also surprisingly unbalanced, though that is a more subjective and less dangerous matter.Avoid at all costs."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"This book is disrespectful to the culture, environment and residents of Maui on very many levels.

Next time we'll spend more time at the bookstore researching our options instead of relying only on online book reviews."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"If you care about Hawai'i, you won't want to invade all our secret places. Now, because so many people have the \\"Blue Book\\", as Hawai'i Revealed is called, we locals can no longer enjoy the places we used to treasure, because of the hordes of tourists now invading them.Please, think twice about buying this book. If you buy it, and do what the authors tell you to do, you'll be helping to turn our islands into the exact thing you're trying to get away from. Keep Hawai'i as it is."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"I agree with the reader from New York. This book contains more negative information than positive. It was disorienting and presented a picture of Maui that was less than real. Our style of travel (budget and independent) didn't fit into these authors' way of thinking. For the tour bus crowd."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"This is a hard one to review, because while this and the others in the series are wonderfully organized, expertly written and unbelievably detailed, they also reveal the deepest secrets of the Hawaiian Islands, previously only known to locals.First, the positives. You won't find a better tour book for Hawaii, on or off the islands - period. This goes for every book of the series - Maui, Oahu, Kauai and the Big Island. Doughty and Friedman expertly steer you around the islands, avoiding the crowds and avoiding the tourist traps (like the bike ride down Haleakala). You'll get tons of practical touring strategies, like, for example, on Maui, taking the Road to Hana later in the day and spending the night in Hana so you can have the Seven Pools to yourself for a few hours in the morning. That's just one example from the series; each and every book is loaded with this kind of pragmatism, so even on your first trip you'll feel like a seasoned visitor.Every aspect of your trip is covered in the books, from the sites to see and avoid, the restaurants to hit, the best hotels, camping options, and island history. Every type of traveler from the luxury $1000 per night tourist to the canvas tent hiker will find useful info. More than anything, while realizing how much of Hawaii is truly still hidden to you in the almost uninhabitable reaches of the jungles and volcanic residues, you'll still feel as though you're seeing as much of it as any outsider can see.Now for the bad. Because Doughty and Friedman live on the islands and have explored every hidden waterfall and pool, they are privy to spots on the islands that even many locals are unaware of. And naturally, many of the areas are located on private property. This however, doesn't seem to bother the writers. After giving a detailed description of how to access a remote waterfall on private property (stuff like, &quot;Park on the pull-off a few hundred yards after mile-marker 23, and scale the guardrail. You should see a path that winds down into a bamboo forest. At the bottom of the path, go *left*, not right, away from the river...&quot; etc.), they follow it up with a limp disclaimer, like &quot;Technically, this is Hawaiian Forest and Game property, but we've been hiking on it for years without a problem...&quot; The bottom line is that while the places they tell you to go are private and amazing, by definition these magnificent spots can't last. Because they've been revealed (as the book titles promise), a hidden location that may have previously had only a few dozen visitors per year now gets five or six visitors a day, thus destroying the serenity and privacy of the location, ruining what is the reason for going there in the first place. So it's somewhat of a self-defeating book, since by revealing these remote locations they are also condemning them to extinction.Lastly, these books are quite popular and already the hidden waterfalls and trails are not so hidden. More than once I hiked a mile or two through rough, muddy terrain and rushing rivers to reach a waterfall, where I found a soccer mom, an over-weight dad in flip-flops, and two four-year olds frolicking in the pool, one of the inevitably clutching their copy of &quot;Maui Revealed&quot; or &quot;Oahu Revealed.&quot; That sort of detracts from the sense of adventure I built up on the way there. In addition, some of the private property areas that he says have no signs posted now have &quot;Keep Out!&quot; signs posted in response to the hundreds of trespassers following Doughty and Friedman's advice. So be aware that some trails they mention as remote and tolerant of hikers may now be *very* intolerant to trespassers.While this book is an incredible guidebook and you *should* use it to plan your Hawaiian vacation, ultimately, let your conscience be your guide as to where you do and don't venture."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"We just returned from our trip to Maui and felt that the book was VERY useful for beach info, some trails and snorkeling info. We stayed in B&amp;Bs the whole time, so I cannot comment on the lodging reviews. But the &quot;activities&quot; (esp. whale watching tour on Pacific Whale Foundation and snorkeling at Molokini) and &quot;adventures&quot; descriptions were very good and accurate. They had pretty good info on the Road to Hana, but I suggest that you pick up the audio guide (cassette or CD) for $20 offered at the Kiosk at the Shell station in Kahului. Can't miss it, it is on the SE corner at the beginning of the Hana Highway. (something not mentioned in the guidebook).The only problem we had with the book were some of the restaurant suggestions. They gave an &quot;ono&quot; (meaning delicious) to a mexican restaurant in Kihei-Maui Taco, which was just about some of the most bland Mexican food I've ever had. (Taco Bell is better than this place). So, the caveat is to take some of their restaurant ratings with a grain of salt. Unless they say you will always have a great meal at a place, be prepared that you could be disappointed, because these are just two people's opinions of a particular place. There were sometimes that we were disappointed because the food did not turn out to be as good as the book indicated.Otherwise, I would recommend this book.

The authors go to great lengths to make sure that you get accurate reviews of the hotels, condos, restaurants and activities. When we were in Maui we made sure that the book was in the jeep at all times so we could reference it. It really came in handy for our trip to Hana. What was funny was that when we would stop at some of the recommended stops, we would see people with the same guidebook! The best thing about Maui Revealed is it's honesty (and the humor is pretty good too!)."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"This series of books is incredible in the level of detail they go into with respect to what to see and what little nuances you should know about that you won't find in Frommer's etc. If you want to have a great time without having to think or worry too much about planning, get these books for whatever islands you visit (Kauai was great, too). You can be &quot;informed spontaneous&quot; on your trip this way. Basically, go wherever you feel but have easy access to what's fun and interesting in that area so you feel like you're on vacation but still don't feel as though you missed anything you might have liked to see. We were joking the entire trip about how the authors either go to the extremes to keep these books updated, or that nothing really changes in Hawaii.

I had visited Maui in 1998 and was so impressed that I wanted to go back asap. Reading this book reminded me of my last trip, and inform me of more activites and locations that I didn't get a chance to do. I read this book in two sittings and felt as if I were there again.

You will be guided to the coolest places to explore and enjoy. We especially like the Big Island and went to lots of off the track spots listed in the book, Hawaii, the big island revealed. I have purchased all of these guide books."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"My husband and I decided to honeymoon in Maui; neither of us had ever been to a tropical island and the destination was highly recommended to us. Two of our friends had gone to Maui a month before we did and brought this book with them--they raved about it so much that we all passed an enjoyable evening together before we left during which they sticky-noted the MUST SEE places in our copy of the book. (For the record, the waterfalls they recommended on the road to Hana were spectacular.)I read the book cover to cover before we left and it gave me a great overview of the island's geography, attractions, and unique qualities. I am just back from the vacation and ready to return, and I will probably get a copy of their book for another island because of the \\"big picture\\" they so superbly provide. What regions are best for this or that, how far different locales are from each other, the general lay of the land, that sort of thing--I've never read a guidebook that gave me that kind of information before.The drawback to this book is on the specifics. Maybe I'm too much of a \\"city gal\\" (I never really considered San Diego that cosmopolitan) but their recommendations for food and cultural experiences were a little too provincial. For example, the authors write that the \\"odd and bizarre add color to Pa'ia like no other Maui town\\" and recommend people watching as a main attraction. Now, I think that Pa'ia has the best shopping on the island (far more interesting than Lahaina, which is junk shops interspersed with fine art galleries) but a few guys with long braids and girls with ankle bracelets do not a people-watching location make. Nor is putting fish on pita bread culinary cleverness (tasty though it might be).The real problem with Maui Revealed, however, is its overexposure. Even the guy sitting next to me on the plane had the book. At one point during our vacation, a local volunteer at one of their carefully described snorkeling spots stopped us at the trailhead just to explain how the ecology of the region has suffered in the past five years because of the sudden increase of foot traffic and swimming in what was once a sheltered cove. It was ten in the morning and we were persons number 40 and 41 to start on that trail. On a weekday, off season. He convinced us not to go (we were numbers 12 and 13 not to go after he talked to us--he was collecting data) and gave us a recommendation of where to go instead. I can't compare it to the Aquarium (a Maui Revealed spot) but the snorkeling where we went was amazing--we went back to it on another day, too.Besides overpopularity, the other drawback I found were vague directions that could have gotten us into a lot of trouble. There were two hikes we followed at the authors' recommendation, both of which resulted in us getting quite lost and me somewhat afraid (my husband says he didn't think we were really that lost). The first was a trek up the hill of Pu'u O'lai in Makena. They said something like you have to traipse about a 100 feet through the forest until you find the trail. We never found it. The other was a hike to a quadruple waterfall path on the road to Hana (across government land no less--my guilty conscience flared up when I heard the helicopters overhead!). Maybe we are incompetent woodsmen but we actually lost the path three times on our way to the second waterfall (this in a bamboo forest so dark that our flash photos just look like black shapes) and I came out of there filthy with mud and sporting some rash on all four appendages! (Trust me, it's no heat rash either.) I don't think I'll go on anymore revealed adventures.Yes, the book is great for newcomers to the island of Maui who want background information about this destination, especially when they are deciding what neighborhood to stay in and what kinds of attractions to see there. I do not recommend using this book to set your specific itinerary. ALthough we started out with this plan, we had fabulous luck actually talking to locals once we got there, like Ephraim at Onelui Beach, Sai the waiter at Pupu Something Restaurant, the girl at the snorkel shop, Hyper Miqe at the trail to the Aquarium, and Tasia the hitchhiker, and Sheldon the four-year-old who instructed us not to put flippers on our ears--not one of these folks steered us wrong. We could not have planned a better vacation."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"I was extremely impressed with this book! Great maps to use while on the island (maps are on the inside covers and also in side the book - won't easily tear or get lost). Great aerial photographs of their top picks for best beaches, along with great detailed descriptions of them (all the info you need on the beaches: snorkeling, wind, sand, people, facilities, accessibility, etc.). Fantastic descriptions of the things to do and see in each area of the island, describing your drives &amp; stops on the highway down to the tenth of the mile! Wonderfully descriptive explanations of all the available island activities: snorkeling, boat tours, parasailing, helicopter, submarine, etc. - This really helped us decide which activities we wanted to do, and more specifically, which activity company to go with (Example, the snorkel on Molokini boats are described to a &quot;T&quot;, which boats stop in the best spots, who offers the best lunches, etc...very good detail!) Buying the book gives you a password code to their website, which offers more information on lodging, since they couldn't fit every hotel's review in the compact book size. I wish there was more information on dining choices, but as they mention in the book, it just changes too much and there are just too many."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"I bought this book after I reached Maui. Reason: I was overwhelmed by sales pitch of my hotel staff and travel agents. I didn't know where to go and what to do. This is when I spent a couple of hours in a book store and picked up Maui Revealed.Maui revealed is thick but very, very informative. You really don't need to spend more than an hour going through the book and planning your trip.Maui Revealed lays bare the innermost secrets of Maui. You will find yourself driving on secluded roads to hidden waterfalls and oasis. You may be alone in the most beautiful areas because other tourists don't know about it!In 6 days that we stayed in Maui, I knew exactly what to expect and where. Eating places, tourist spots, waterfalls, beaches, activities like snorkling and scuba diving, parasailing and even shopping centers have been revealed in this book. You can even find out how much you will spend for lunch if you go to a particular restaurant.How detailed is this book? According to a recent news on CNN, Maui residents were unhappy with the authors because they revealed too much about Maui in this book!!!Now that's something!CONCLUSION: BUY IT!! \\"Maui Revealed\\" will help you plan a perfect trip and save money and time as you will know what to do and when."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"If you've never been to Maui, and want to know virtually every place to go, this will provide you with that information. Once you have that info, the burden is placed on your shoulders to use it wisely. Getting to or playing at many of the spots mentioned involves risk to your body due to flash floods, loose rock, and slipperly trails. Some spots are on, or can only be reach thru, private property.Granted, residents have been visiting these same spots for years. The difference is that it's no longer just a few kids on the weekend, it's hundreds of people every day, many of whom are apt to be litigious. It would seem that the authors have absolved themselves of any responsibility if you end up on the wrong side of nature, the law, or the locals.My suggestion would be to stick with the Moon Publications book."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"I used over ten guidebooks, and this was by far the best. It was particularly strong in rating activities and providing detailed suggestions and hints for getting the most out of the activities (e.g., biking, scuba). It had all the hotel evaluations online, so did not clutter the book. It had no B&B recommendations."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"I read every guidebook I can get my hands on before I go on vacation. Of the pile I took along, this was the worst for snorkeling. My main problem with this book is its tone. It was trying to be too authoritative on every topic. Snorkeling experts they are not. There is a much better book out for snorkeling called SNORKELING MAUI by Malewowski. The maps are much clearer, there are far more places to snorkel and it is much better written."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"We have used this book the last three times we went to Maui. We have always found it a great guide. We have liked the recommended restaurants and sites. We used it for dining, site seeing and excursions. I would definitely recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"I have been to Maui four times, but with this book the last trip was much more memorable. We spent some time in Hana finding the secret swimming holes. I skinny dipped at a private waterfall--there is no way I would have been able to do that with something I found in a more mainstream guidebook, cause it would have been packed with people.The other activity that this guide book recommended in Hana was going for a ride in a powered hang glider. It was one of the most amazing things I ever did--flying through the clouds of Hana, looking down to see the waterfalls and literally being able to touch the clouds with my hand--it was like a dream, and I would not have known about it except for this book.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is VERY confusingly structured. It is structured more by activity than location. So all the best beaches are together, all the best snorkling, etc.I was constantly flipping back and forth trying to figure out where the thing I had read about earlier was. I would prefer to pick an area then have all the secret spots, restaurants, etc in that section. I found that this book AND Frommers make the best combo--Frommers for restaurants and hotels, Revealed for activities."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"This is one of the most spot-on useful guidebooks that we've encountered in all our travels. Every day of our recent visit (to three locations on the island) we found ourselves referring to it so often that it soon earned a permanent place on the front seat of our car or in our backpack. Wherever we went on the island, the most relevant information (and orientation maps) were easy to locate and chock full of useful details and insights. If you intend to explore the more out of the way locations, like hiking trails, however, it would also be wise to rely on detailed topo maps.The authors are frank and honest in their assessments of Maui's welter of accomodations and restaurants; and we soon learned their opinions were consistently accurate and worthy of heed. Their website, moreover, offers excellent supplemental reviews and updates on various accomodations and restaurants. Overall, this is a remarkably comprehensive and useful guidebook to Maui, which almost any visitor will find worthy of using. We first heard about it from Maui residents."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"The second edition of this guide really surprised me, and in a good way. I run a small Hawaii travel business and I purchased the guidebook under the assumption it would fill a few small holes in my knowledge on Maui. Instead it introduced me to a lot of information and places I wasn't even aware existed. I am very pleased with this guidebook and it has become a useful tool in organizing my next research trip. I have decided I'm also going to purchase more in the series of their books, as this one really is top notch and delivers the information in a very clear and concise manner than anyone can use. The maps are fantastic also, some of the best available; mainly because of their detail and the fact they actually show the mile markers on the roads.If you've been to Maui a hundred times, or if it's your first time going, I don't think you can go wrong with this book. They introduce the island on beginners terms, but also guide you like a pro if you are one. The book has more information than you'll likely ever need in a single trip, but hey, that's what the next trip is for. They cover both the large and the small in this book, and I really like that. I was worried about the over-exposure factor of the book at first, but ultimately I feel they covered everything equally and didn't focus just on previously hidden things. In other words, the magic of Maui won't be harmed by this book's popularity as long as we all use common sense in preserving the nature of the places we discover and visit. Their sense of humor is also a nice touch in my opinion, and reflects what is truly Hawaiian Style. Job well done in my opinion and I recommend this book to all those traveling to the Valley Isle. A lot of people own this book for a reason, you should too."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"If you find yourself going to Maui or any of the other islands (all covered to some extent by Wizard Publications \\"Revealed\\" series) and you're interested in relatively inexpensive activities focused on the outdoors, these are the guidebooks for you. First of all, the books are packed with accurate, detailed, easy-to-read, appropriately arranged maps. In most cases the maps are supplemented with photographs that help you double-check that you're in the right spot. If you like to head out on your own and do your own thing, it's easy to map out a game-plan and go for it. Secondly, the well-written guides are based on a \\"no-nonsense\\" approach to travel: straightforward common sense advice about safety, culture, history, activities, prices, weather and even the crackling noise you hear when you snorkel. One of the most significant challenges in writing a guide book about anything is that in order to present accurate, detailed information, you have to become an expert. Once you become an expert, however, it's easy to forget what it was like when you didn't know squat. Maui Revealed is a guidebook written by experts for use by us amateurs. It's an environmentally conscious, culturally aware, budget-minded, brutally honest guide to Maui.Only Shot At A Good Tombstone"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"I discovered this book on my first day in Maui and it was very helpful guide for my trip. To contrast this to Fodor's Hawaii, which covers all the Hawaiian islands: Fodor's devotes about 75 pages to Maui, and this book provides 300 pages of background information and tips. It has detailed guides to each section of the island covering sights, activities, beaches, hotels, dining and more. The introduction gives a history of Maui and the \\"basics\\" gives overall background information and great local maps are sprinkled throughout.To give you an example of the valuable tips: we got information about a great magic/comedy show in Lahaina that was rated the best entertainment on the island--and I thoroughly agreed. Lots of budget tips like where to get quick meals and snacks reasonably at Kaanapali, details on lots of activities, suggestions for best snorkeling/windsurfing beaches. A few minor issues--the authors' dining awards, onos (delicious in Hawaiian) seem to go to some cheap eats places that were just mediocre (Cheeseburger in Paradise in Lahaina is an example). The description of the danger of the downhill biking from Haleakala volcano to the sea was so vivid I almost cancelled my trip. Luckily I checked with some locals who assured me that if accidents happened everyone on Maui would know, and I went on the trip and had a great time. Overall though I would rate the information in this book very highly.In their introduction to this book, the authors stated their goal of providing information to bring independence to visitors in exploring Maui. With my insiders information from this book, they succeeded, I felt like a local.

This is a very very well laid out book with wonderful maps, that tells it all in a very funny, straight forward, yet highly informative way and lets YOU make the decisions. A must for someone who like to make there on plans. Right up there with any lonely planet book. It you want the \\"do this see\\" type book then buy a Foders. Again great book for those who love to make there on plans."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"We took an April 2004 trip to Maui and this book was very helpful. It's best to buy it a few weeks before your trip so you can easily prepare your itinerary. The authors went to great lengths to give the reader useful, practical information to make a trip to Hawaii one to remember. The information about the beaches and Lahaina was extremely helpful to us.Even though we weren't particularly crazy about the Road to Hana, there were many scenic places off the beaten path that we could only find thanks to this book. It was very useful to us in Hana as well by helping us find a good restaurant (there are none) and a general store to stop at for munchies and souvenirs. The maps in this book are easy to find at a moment's notice.The authors really did their homework and you'll find that anything you need to know about Maui should be found in this book - from restaurants to activities to tips that only a local would know. If you're going to Hawaii, you need a guidebook of some kind to help you plan your trip or else you'll really regret trying to do everything on the fly once you get there. Even if you only plan to sunbathe yourself for the week on any of Maui's breathtaking beaches, you'll find that this book can help you to find the &quot;perfect gem&quot; beach that will make your trip unforgettable.We also bought the Ultimate Guide to the Big Island (equally helpful) and wished there was an Ultimate Guide to Oahu."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"This is the absolute best touring book. We spent a whole week in Hana and used it every day!!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"These Hawaiian locals have a series of books covering each of the major islands (we used the Maui and Kauai books). They contain far more information than any of the Hawaii guidebooks--extensive reviews of hotels and restaurants, as well as recreational activities. What makes these books stand out is their coverage of hidden or off-the-beaten-path sights. The book directs the reader to hole-in-the-wall shave-ice stands and to waterfall overlooks three telephone poles from the intersection with some road. We bought several books before going, but this was the one we kept in the car--it took us to many places that we might have missed (and other tourists did miss), but are grateful that we saw. It also comes with a link to a website for post-publication updates, which unfortunately we failed to check before leaving."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"My biggest complaint is the way the book is organized and its terrible directions.

It missed so many of the good places we later found out about. It also fell short when it came to seeing the coastal area around Kaupo which to us was the most pristine of all, virtually free of tourists. Also there were very few places to take our children. Basically, there's not enough content and way too much space loaded with opinions."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"While this book is an excellent resource for getting the most out of your trip to Maui, it is hampered by marginal writing. At times the authors seem to ramble and fall back on a cutesy sense of humor that grows very tiresome, very quickly. In short, this book is not well written and probably could be made excellent with tighter editing."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"My husband and I just went to Maui for our first time.

I've told alot of people about this book and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"I went to Maui for 3 days and followed many of the recommendations to a tee. The Road to Hana was helpful in locating beaches and waterfalls that other guide books don't include, so you will be able to enjoy with few, if any, tourists. The mile markers on the maps help out greatly! I wish other maps included them.I found a Maui Drive Map (which you can get for free at convenience stores, gas stations, car rental offices) was helpful alongside the guidebook so you know where you are relative to the rest of the island.I think that many other reviewers thought the secluded areas weren't so secluded because everyone buys this book! I did notice that people in those &quot;secluded&quot; areas had this guidebook in hand. So everyone was part of the Maui Revealed readers' club...I would definitely recommend this to first-timers. Unless you're in Maui for a week or more, you won't be able to see all the sights this guidebook recommends.

Their maps are INCREDIBLY accurate (truly helpful in negotiating some of the \\"roads\\" you can find on Maui), and the recommendations for places to eat never steered us wrong. And some of the places that they talked about (on the road to Hana, for example) were things that I'm SURE we would have missed otherwise -- and were some of our favorite moments.It's well written, and has lots of interesting features and factoids; I can't imagine going to Maui without it.

This is really an outstanding guidebook written by local people. It has no advertising. And it has its own website to update readers on developments after publication,and to give an in depth look at hotels and restaurants.But because it is an excellent book,I was surprised by two obvious errors. The brown tree snake,a native of New Guinea,is a very dangerous reptile. It's not too likely that if one were actually sighted in Hawaii that someone would call the Pest Hotline as suggested rather than 911. Maui roads are well below mainland standards. The authors' implication that the &quot;paved roads only&quot; restriction of the rental car companies can be safely disregarded could make an expensive vacation even more expensive.Most European travel guidebooks have at least two errors per chapter. Two per book is a pretty good track record.

We each had guide books from Lonely Planet, Rough Guide, etc., but one person's Maui Revealed was the book we all ended up using. Every time we wanted to do something -- whale watching, surf lessons, a luau, etc. -- Maui Revealed had an opinion on the easiest and best way to do it, and it often seemed to be right.Rather than just listing phone numbers and names, Maui Revealed offered opinions, which was rare in the genre and incredibly valuable.Would be five stars except the directions were often pretty vague. Not clear why, but we occasionally found ourselves lost when following the book's descriptions of where to find certain beaches, hikes, waterfalls, etc. Didn't dampen our enthusiasm for the book, but did prove occasionally frustrating."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"We picked this book up on our lay-over to Maui at the San Francisco airport bookstore. We would have been lost without it; it allowed us to explore independently without relying on the touristy activity vendors. The authors never steered us wrong & we had tons of fun...enough said."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"This was our first trip to Maui, and we wanted to make sure we didn't waste our time getting lost or end up with a bad experience. It was hard choosing a guide book at first, but after reading all these great reviews about Maui Revealed, we decided to give it a try. And I must say, it was the best money we've ever spent on a guide book! The details are incredible!The Road to Hana definitely wouldn't have been the same without the book. We took the book's advice and skipped some of the crowded areas to explore the more hidden places. The detailed directions and maps were easy to follow (especially with the mile markers!), and without a doubt those hidden trails and waterfalls were always where the book said they would be.Whether we were in Hana or West Maui, South Maui or Central, Maui Revealed always gave us wonderful advice and great direction. Never before have we enjoyed a trip so much, and we're definitely going back again with Maui Revealed in hand. We recommend this book to anyone who goes to Maui, whether it be their first trip, or one among many.We did however find some things that weren't quite up to par. The hotel and restaurant guides aren't as helpful as some other guides, and we ended up using Fodors and Frommers online to get the most recent reviews and rants. If you don't intend on using other sources, we strongly urge you to get all the current updates on this book from their website, for it has been a couple of years since it was published. But we still recommend this book, and will continue to use it for future trips to Maui!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"My officemate who went to a conference in Maui last year recommended this book for my honeymoon. Just got back from Maui last weekend and I am so excited to recommend this book to anyone going to Maui. My husband and I didn't have much money, so this book helped guide us to the experiences that wouldn't zap us of cash.We particularly liked the directions and recommendations to the Fishbowl and the Aquarium. These snorkel spots required trekking over in some places raw lava. These little coves just north of Le Perouse Bay were even more awe-inspiring than the pictures in the book. There were people at these very remote snorkel destinations--and those people all had a copy of Maui Revealed. While my husband and I took so much care to protect the coral at these coves, some people we saw there just broke off so much coral I could cry.I agree with someone's comment that most of the hikes/treks in this book are for people over the age of 12 who are in good physical shape. I wouldn't recommend many of the suggested snorkel spots for those with children under 12. I saw one woman sitting along a trail (who had a Maui Revealed book no less), who could go no further with her hip replacement. Take heed.We followed the directions to beaches, and for many we were the only people at the beach (in May)! Just imagine paradise all to yourself. The book helped us decide that the bike tours down Haleakala might not be right for us. We decided to drive up, watch the sun rise, and then drive down. Savings: about 150 dollars or more. Sunrise experience: 100% delight, and some good photos too.The book's help in locating waterfalls was great, too. While driving around West Maui (which I feel is far superior to the Hana drive: it's got a surrealistic feel to it that nibbled on my and my husband's artistic vein, those stacked rocks up on the roadside and the cliffs were amazing), we were able to see the &quot;Lonely Falls&quot; which we would otherwise have missed.The Hana drive is going to be bustling with people no matter where you go. People do just follow other people--even to more remote spots. Those four falls mentioned in the book did have several other Hana-trippers basking in the falls. A few of these people I had seen at the Aquarium the day before carrying around Maui Revealed books. Perhaps the others just followed?This book is good--I'm recommending this book highly to our best man in the wedding and his family who's leaving tomorrow for Maui. We used this book to help us find snorkel spots, to find good snorkel rentals, to plan our Haleakala trip, to plan our Kaanapali and Lahaina visit, to beach crawl the South Maui beaches (big beach just kicked it--so beautiful), to avoid the many money grubbing average luau's, and to find some good restaurants, etc.I don't understand how someone could call this book for the &quot;tour bus crowd.&quot; This book really tells you how to do it yourself, which is the antithesis of the whole &quot;tour bus crowd&quot; mantra, is it not?"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"This is a great guide book. As other comments posted have shared, it has a lot of useful information on sights to see and places to hike that are kind of secret, and it has a good selection of inexpensive and moderately-priced restaurants on all sections of the island. The reason I especially loved it was the information provided for snorkeling. Many travel books give information about good dive sites in their area. However, this one also includes pretty extensive information for snorkelers too. They made it possible for us to have great snorkeling each day during our precious-little time on the island. Although the best sites require an bit of an arduous hike, they were as fabulous as the book described. P.S. I, too, loved the Warren and Annabelle show. It's great magic and also hilarious."},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"Wished I had purchased this book instead of Frommers. Very detailed, beautifully done. A must for anybody going to paridise!"},{"Title":"Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook, Second Edition","review":"In addition to the positive comments made by other reviewers, let me add two more. First, this book is VERY accurate. That means you are going to find your way to the real Nakalele blowhole (the one that shoots 40 feet in the air), not to the anemic one nearby which we found pictured in other guidebooks. We had the strange experience of actually guiding some locals to the correct site... (I disagree with the Top 1000 Reviewer who feels this level of accuracy is a fault in a travel guide). Why do the authors of &quot;Maui Revealed&quot; care so much about accuracy when compared to the other guide book writers? We don't know, but if you find two guidebooks disagreeing on something, and one of them is &quot;Maui Revealed&quot;, you can be sure that &quot;Maui Revealed&quot; has it right. (According to the preface, their plan is to publish a new version every two years, and I can confirm they do interim updates on a website they list in the book).Second, the authors have a very entertaining and fun style. Why should a guidebook be dull? Time and again we found ourselves laughing as the authors take a magnifying glass to some piece of Maui life. After complimenting a certain remote fruitstand on their fine smoothies, the authors added &quot;We must have passed this stand 20 times before we ever found it open. When we mentioned that [in the first edition] they were shocked. They're *always* open during business hours, we were told. OK, fine. They're *always* open. (Except when they're not).&quot; We laughed when we first read this particular description of what &quot;open&quot; means, and laughed again when we came across this same fruitstand at 2PM on a weekday... and found it closed!"},{"Title":"The hasty heart: Comedy drama in three acts","review":"The Hasty Heart is a terrific play. Written in 1944, it is about a group of wounded soldiers who are asked to befriend a young Scot. He was wounded and one of his kidneys was removed and the other is defective. He has only a few weeks to live. He believes he has healed from his injury and does not understand why he is being kept when his regiment has left.(This is not a spoiler as it is stated in the first moments of the play) He is a very surly person, who does not make friends easily. The play was considered to be one of the best of 1944, and it still holds up. It was made into a film in 1949 with Patricia Neal, Richard Todd and Ronald Reagan. And as a cable tv movie in 1984? starring Perry King, Gregory Harrison and Cheryl Ladd."},{"Title":"Back Home in Williamson County","review":"I've only seen the 1986 &quot;Project of Homecoming&quot; done by Lyn Sullivan but having spent many joyous times in Williamson County, Tennessee at my grandmothers during high school, I was delighted to see the project &quot;bring to life&quot; the simple pleasures and larger than life people who make up such rural communities. Neglected for too long because of limited funds, information access, and motivation, the small towns of America tell the more important tales of common hardworking folk who helped to make America the fine country it is. The small country towns of people unique to the backroads of America have long been its strength and goodness, often reflected in surviving years of potential conflict in harmonious cooperation that many in the cities might emulate to reduce the crime rates even further. As small towns, everyone must always have a place - or move - and if they move, they usually leave all family ties behind, so they've learned to accommodate each other instead, accept their weaknesses, not dwell upon them, and to appreciate their strengths instead in a communal dignity most city dwellers are not aware of despite the fact that they are often highlighted in the lyrics of country tunes. A very welcome, first class anthology of historic importance for revealing the beginnings of America's rural towns and counties. I love the pictures. It shows how innovative and inventive America people are when they've a mind to do it! Rascals and scallywags, to boot!"},{"Title":"Back Home in Williamson County","review":"It is very difficult these days to find the more obscure historical information of the important kind - the stories. After extensively searching for history on the area of South Williamson County known as \\"Callie\\", I finally found a full 2 pages dedicated to it in Ms. Pewitt's book (for those curious it's pages 45-46!)! Her writing has created for me an image of this area filled with Community Dances and Foot-Stompin' Fiddle Music from a time-gone-by. As an added bonus, the pictures in the book add even more life to the history, and I was thrilled to find one about Callie. We should all be grateful to Ms. Pewitt for her excellent work!"},{"Title":"The Legislative Branch of Federal Government: People, Process, and Politics","review":"The Legislative Branch of Federal Government: People, Process, and Politics is an in-depth, user-friendly reference that meticulously spells out precisely how the legislative branch of America's federal government works. Chapters describe how the United States Constitution set up the federal legislature, its roles, functions, and powers, its structure and process, the people who serve within it, its politics, and its interactions with the other branches of federal government. In addition, nearly half of The Legislative Branch of Federal Government reproduces historically significant documents and speeches, from writings by John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and Alexander Hamilton to The Civil Rights Act, key trials in American history, and more. An up-to-date resource worthy of the highest recommendation for public library collections."},{"Title":"My first 500: A sexual autobiography","review":"Admission: I am not finished with this book yet; I am on number 490. That said, here is my review: Rachel English wrote \\"My First 500\\" in 1977, and was an actress in the early nineteen-seventies. After checking www.imdb.com, however, I doubt she will ever be remembered for her acting, and Google pulled up barely a page of references, including two references to interviews with her in Penthouse and Gallery magazine, both in 1978. So perhaps her best legacy is this book, if you can find it. It is a chronicle of English's sexual exploits from losing her virginity in 1959 to her five-hundreth sex partner. Starting with number 40, she and her then-husband (number 39) began exploring swapping and swinging, then orgies, and eventually joined two sex clubs in which she was very active until about partner number 309. Many of the entries during this period are strings of sexual partners, mostly male but often female, encountered about five to ten per night on her weekend escapades at the swing clubs and orgies. Most of the entries after this were people she slept with the the television and movie industry, often to land jobs, and later also in exchange for car repairs, etc., and supplement her income after she and number 39 divorced. By this point she felt so sexually free that giving pleasure was her main focus, and money just a well-needed bonus, and she didn't consider herself a prostitute by any means. She was also an active nudist and shared her philosophies of sexual freedom and nudism with many people.For me, this book is a snapshot of a time that is gone. While females took birth control pills or used diaphrams, English does not mention condoms once, and STD's only make an appearance once, in an STD scare one weekend at one of the sex clubs. Also nudism and sex clubs seemed to be more accepted and less underground at the time. There also seemed to be a pretty positive, loving vibe at the clubs in English's descriptions. It is also a bit of an artifact in that trading sex for favors, especially parts in movies and TV shows, seemed to me to be a bit more prevalent during the time period that English chronicles. The casting couch seemed to be an accepted part of life back then, at least in English's life.I liked this book because I am interested in the swinging scene, and English had a lot of experience with it. The descriptions of sex are thorough, but not very long. I would definately not call this pornography, where every aspect of the sexual act is dwelled on and emphasized to arouse and titillate. Nor would I call it erotica. I have read Anais Nin's Little Birds and Delta of Venus, and there is a voluptious, sensually engaging, picturesque, and even intellectual quality in her works that is missing in My First 500, and they are much more descriptive. I would file it under smut, \\"obscene or offensive material,\\" with my tongue in my cheek, but only because it is a light read. I think English's positive attitude about healthy sexual freedom in the book saves it from being obscene or trashy. The book does get just a little monotonous around two-thirds the way through, but it picks back up again after English leaves the swinging and orgy scene. Read this book if you are interested in the swinging scene, especially what it was like in the 1970s, or if you feel you are or want to be sexually liberated and want a little inspiration or even titallation. I am sure there is much better smut and definately better erotica out there; even more informative books must exist. But for a new reader in these subjects like me, this was an entertaining and decently satisfying book."},{"Title":"National Gallery of Art, Washington : Great Paintings of the World","review":"Anyone with an interest in art should add this book to his/her library. But it is not the book that is important, also. It is the wonder of a visit to the National Gallery of Art in Washington that was the reward of having purchased this book and invested the time to study it intently instead of just putting it on a coffee table to gather comments.

Remember to ask if the clear vinyl band is included when buying (the revised doesn't have it)."},{"Title":"National Gallery of Art, Washington : Great Paintings of the World","review":"This book is one of my favorites, and has been for many years. Its beautiful color illustrations are grouped by the period and country in which they were created. The book presents works (mostly paintings) from many countries (mostly Western) beginning in the Byzantine era, extending up until the early twentieth century. Many of the works are accompanied by art historical abstracts which offer insight for both the inexperienced and learned art enthusiast. This is a great book to have around as an extensive survey of Western painting."},{"Title":"National Gallery of Art, Washington : Great Paintings of the World","review":"This is a large book full of pictures of beautiful artworks. While there are some photos of sculpture and some of drawings, the bulk of what is reproduced here is painting. While many pages have multiple artworks, there are also quite a few where the painting is given a full page for more close observation and study.The quality of the reproductions is quite good, if not quite superb. The captions and text describing the art and artists are very good and most helpful for the general reader. The book opens with several articles on the National Gallery and its history and policies.The plates are organized chronologically and by the national schools of their times. The earliest artworks are circa the 13th century and concludes with works of the 20th century.You could spend many days enjoying this glorious selection of art and still find many more days of study before you exhaust all that is offered in this fine book about a great national treasure."},{"Title":"National Gallery of Art, Washington : Great Paintings of the World","review":"By nature, I am not overly fond of \\"coffee table books.\\" I do own quite a number but seldom do they ever find a place on any of my coffee tables; rather, they are stored on shelves with the rest of the bookish flotsam I have collected over the years. Of the four books that I do have out in the open, this is one of them. If nothing else, it is so large (696 very oversized pages) that it could be used as a defensive weapon if needed...if of course you could lift the thing. Now that being said:I have spent many hours reading through this wonderful collection of primarily paintings found in our National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. These paintings start with offerings from the Byzantine era and work there way through in chronological order up until the early 20th Century. Each painting has been very well photographed (more about that later) and is accompanied by a brief description and vital statistics such as measurements, artist, surface used, era, year painted (if known) and date of birth and death of the artist, etc. The book offers compact briefs on many of the paintings and quite a bit of history can be gleaned from these numerous offerings.Now no book of photographs of paintings can come anywhere near equaling the quality or impact of seeing the work of art first hand...in the original. I don't care how good the photography is...it just is not going to happen. But if you are an individual like myself who does not have accesses to these paintings (I have never visited the National Gallery and have no intension of doing so in this life time), then photographs are the next best thing. The paintings represented here are well done. I have seen better quality in books which are more specialized, but for the massive number of works represented here, I am quite satisfied. Yes, many of the paintings posted here would be much better represented if the prints were larger but of course there are limits on such things. You get a very good idea of what each school of art is trying to represent and a good insight to the artist's work.Reading and browsing through this work year after year, month after month, gives the reader a sort of mini art history/appreciation lesson and much can be learned. I find myself reaching for this thing more than I care to admit to and simply enjoying brief moments with each and every page. Like another reviewer here, this is one of my favorite books to kill time with and I always walk away a bit richer for the time I spend with it.The neatest thing about this work is that you do not have to be an art expert to appreciate and enjoy it. The test is not made up of the pretentious clap-trap you so often run into with books of art. So often you run into books of this ilk which read more like wine reviews; filled with ramblings which no one has a clue as to their meaning but fear to say so because they do not want to appear unwashed, uneducated and uncouth. I like simplicity in this sort of thing and the fewer obscure adjectives, the better.All in all, this is a book worth owning. I treasure my copy. (Note: If one of my kids happens to read this review, be aware that most of the pages are annotated with my scribbling and the resale of this work will be nil, so you might as well keep it and enjoy it because you certainly are not going to get much out of it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"National Gallery of Art, Washington : Great Paintings of the World","review":"This big, beautiful book should be on any art lover's shelf!

Overall quality of the reproductions is excellent, and the explanatory text is very helpful, and aimed at the intelligent beginner level. You could learn a lot about art history just by perusing this book and reading the material on your favorite artists, or your favorite period, such as the Impressionists, the high Renaissance, or the Dutch masters. If you actually read it cover to cover, you'll know a lot. Organized chronologically, this makes it easy to use. The book mainly covers paintings, but the museum has a fair amount of scuplture too, but I don't know if there's a book that covers that. Perhaps that book would be on the Hirschorn Museum, which is the part of the Smithsonian that has the sculpture. I recently had the chance to visit the National Gallery again after 30 years, and I was equally impressed just as I was the first time.

This would be a good book for one to bring on a visit to the National Gallery of Art. Like Kenneth Clark, Walker writes clearly, and when talking about the paintings it is hard to keep writing tight. I would say that knowing the historical details of each painting one views will make viewing the painting more memorable, since the visual impression would be connected to a small web of historical facts.\\"From architecture that has dignity, splendor, permanence, people seem to gain an enhancement of their own personalities.

In the 1984 of Orwell, there is not much home, only rumors of an opposition, an opposition which may only exist as an excuse to persecute and victimize. In the 1984 the technology is use to overwhelm his hero who seeks freedom.Orwell was a member of a trend that lost hope in the cause of socialist revolution, and believed that the Soviet Union and the Nazi government of Germany were the same thing. It was the wave of the future, bureaucratic collectivism, James Burnham the former Trotskyist named it as he fled to the anticommunist ranks of the National Review. It couldn't be stopped, Nazism, the corporate society, and Stalinism would all grow into what Orwell depicts in 1984.But now, 20 years after 1984, the bureaucratic regimes in Eastern Europe and China and the former Soviet Union have been pushed aside, and great avenues for free political life, the exchange of ideas, and struggles by workers for union rights, by oppressed nationalities for freedom from discrimination, even without the kind of revolutionary leadership that emerged in Hungary in 1956 or in Cuba in 1959.Technology has proven a weapon for working people and others fighting for their rights, not something by which tyrants can rule through. For Soviet dissidents the first big explosion in the discussion and circulation of ideas came with the advent of the photocopying machine that spread texts and reports against the bureaucracy across the country. Today web sites for unions fighting the coal bosses in Utah, fighting to organize textile workers in Miami, or fighting to defend coal miners in China, reach out around the globe.As the world seems to be heading into an economic criss marked by aggresive wars by Washington and resistance by working people we can expect not the bleak sunnless future that Orwell painted, but a festival of freedom for working people fighting the bureaucracies in Eastern Europe, the USSR, and China and the billionaires in North America, Japan, and Europe.However, what will live forever in this book, what lives more strongly in every other thing Orwell wrote is his ability to picture a real man, not a hero, not a perfect man, living a real life, hoping, fearing, wanting, messing up in little things, searching for bigger things. Read 1984 and regardless of its political pessimism, its author had a clear hold on what is like to be an ordinary man or woman trying to hold onto life even when it all seems too big to conquer."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"I decided to buy this because of the reputation of the author and both of the books as being &#34;classics&#34;. What a disapointment. I do get the point of trying to describe totalitarianism vicariously through the farm animals, but this is boring. I started reading it fast just to get it over with. 1984 starts out by dragging on and on. Finally, it starts to pick up about midway through. It has been stated that Orwell was trying to finish this book while on his 'death bed' and it shows. Whereas the beginning dragged on the ending certainly gives the feeling of being rushed. But, I have read it now and I will forever know where the terms &#34;Big Brother&#34; and &#34;Doublespeak&#34; originated. The book seems redundant because we see all of it in our daily lives right now with the doublespeak (a.k.a. lies) told to us everyday from politicians and news organizations alike. Maybe that's why I don't like the book - because we already live this stuff everyday, and it's telling me things that I already know."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"I cut out the forward since I believe the person to have written it to be an atheist and as a Christian I didn't want that and I didn't want to lend it to friends with that in there.The stories where scary and told stories of massive oppression.However they should be a lession to us as well of what can happen when certain people are allowed to go power mad and violate your God given basic rights that we all have.When things like The 7 Commandments Of Animalism are changed around,added on to, no matter how small can mean big trouble.We in the US for example need to remember our Consitutional rights and when they are violated we need to speak up and stand out ground of not letting this happen. Even today here in the US there are people in the government that have \\"pleged\\" to uphold the Consitution yet when that is done and over with they make up \\"loop-holes\\" or try to change around the words when they speak of it to suit they're own selfish needs and take advantage of people.These storys may have been fictional but they are based on the truth of something that can really happen and sadly still happens today in this world (ex.North Korea).We must stand up to defend our God given rights.

Now that the 20th Century is over and Communism and most forms of Marxism are considered obsolete, I read it again and gained new insight. For some reason, idealistic movements always have the great man or men (Marx and Trotsky in this case. Lenin is missing) and their brutal practitioners (Stalin). Orwell is of course a master and a necessary warning to those who are idealists. Reality is the real dictator. Perhaps that is why the democratic tolerant state is so important, but not for the obvious reasons. It is the only state that allows its representatives and its citizens to properly sense reality. Whether they act accordingly, well that's a separate question."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"\\"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.\\"Under Big Brother's omniscient eyes, Winston Smith tried to ignite his only freedom, the freedom to believe in \\"obvious\\" truths, but by the novel's end, at the caf&eacute; Winston was unsure what two plus two would make, a sign that O'Brien had successfully reintegrated a \\"lost soul\\" and Winston had become like his friends and neighbors, unable to question and thus unable to revolt. What sends shivers down our spines is not the various tortures O'Brien performed, but after these tortures, Winston's total capitulation&#61630;mind, body, and soul&#61630;to Big Brother. When the mind kowtows to external authority and ceases to reflect and question, then the individual had successfully metamorphosed into a machine.Winston, by editing previous documents to conform to Oceana's present position, such as whether Eurasia is friend or foe, had helped the regime's guardians, who like O'Brien believed \\"who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past,\\" mold the citizens' minds. But Oceana, like other totalitarian regimes, also turned to the indispensable tool, fear, to chisel its citizens' minds and hearts to its agenda's shape and form. To stimulate fear and rouse its citizens to a common cause, it would when necessary create fathom enemies, either Eurasia or Eastasia, even though these totalitarian regimes also had similar ideologies, or rather, like Oceana, no ideologies.Under 1984's dystopian sky, Winston must bow, not only because of Big Brother's overwhelming power and presence, but also because of Winston's inability to form any ideologies. Even though he wanted to think freely, he lacked the training and thus the analytical mind to counter O'Brien's offenses. In the end, his mind followed the path of least resistance.Orwell's 1984 is a dark apocalypse of sub-human society where homo-sapiens had replaced machines to operate an efficient hierarchy, an apocalypse which any people would usher wherever and whenever they ceased to question \\"intuitively obvious truths.\\""},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Keeping in mind both of these works were written in the 1940's, George Orwell comes across as visionary.Animal farm details an uprising by farm animals against their owner. Initial elation at their new found freedom turns to a somber, sorrowful existence of work, work, work with very little to show for it. The self proclaimed leader, Napoleon the pig, creates evil in the form of another pig who he runs off the farm. The need for fear is realized as a weapon used to control. Napoleon becomes more isolated and rules with an iron fist. The workers work harder and harder in the hopes of the bounty promised them by Napoleon. In reality, the lives of the majority have changed little between pre-revolution and post-revolution. Eventually, no one can distinguish between pigs and humans. All animals are created equal, but some are more equal than others.1984 - wow, what an absorbing read. A post-apocalyptic England is the setting for a dark tale of warning. We follow Winston as he struggles with the indoctrination handed to him 24/7 by Big Brother. War is peace, freedom is slavery and Ignorance is strength is the mantra for this dark, controlled world. The past is constantly changing as per the dictatorial orders and the proletariat are ruled by fear and summary justice. Again, the need for a constant threat is used as a form of propaganda which controls the masses as, they are led to believe, they are kept safe by Big Brother. So many parallels with recent world events.Reading both these works, readers notice similarities with what they see today. It's hard not to see elements of the story, especially 1984, in society today. The constant fear we see banded about, the promise of better times in return for hard work etc etc. Personally, I found myself wandering inside my own mind and equating what I was reading with my own life here in America. Orwell certainly seemed to have a crystal ball and, whether or not this is purely a musing on Orwell's part, it is certainly prophetic.The text is easy to read. Orwell strikes a marvelous balance between giving us just enough description to put us at the scene but not too much to leave us yawning as background overwhelms the narrative. The reader always knows where the protagaonist is in space and time. Also, we always know who the subject he or she is. Masterful stuff from a great author.Excellent work on Orwell's part."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Well, what can I say?

Mostly, I listen to the classics.Where did the terms \\"big brother\\" and \\"big brother is watching\\" come from? They came from the book 1984 by George Orwell.1984 is one that I read in high school because I was required to do so and learned little from it -- it seemed complex and the teacher kept talking about the threat of communism. Now, the sound is more relevant, the words more precise, and the democracy we have seems to be more delicate and vulnerable to the dangers proposed by Orwell.1984 talks to the impact of the full use of technologies we have available today. For example, today it is possible to have two-way video and two-way audio transmissions in/from each home. What if the government provided those technologies to everyone to help improve our security, our physical fitness, and our economic well-being? Of course the government would be on the other side of the two-way part. That was the promised use of these technologies in 1984. As the five-year plans in Russia demonstrated, government controlled goals over such things can describe socio-economics plans and processes which are not obtainable, much less desired. What happens to love and romance and intimacy? These are elements of our privacy and human needs addressed by the government in 1984. What happens to individuality and creativity if the government is in constant two-way communications with all citizens? The book is intense and intellectual. The individual reading the book to you is effective providing us the feeling of the various characters. I liked it all.The bonus with this audio book is you get Animal Farm, too. Although a fantasy and not possible (as 1984 is possible), the lesson is genuine and relevant. We must listen to what our government is doing, read 3rd party reporting, and push back on changes we feel are wrong. It seems intuitive. It is not. The crowd may be against us, not because they disagree with our logic but because they lack all the information to participate in the discussion. And to get all the information takes time and objective reporting. The book has animals speaking, thinking, teaming, and warring. It provides no solution. It provides us a sensitive look at how silly and dangerous we can be in the governments we support, whether in Seattle, Moscow or Tokyo.Orwell was brilliant. He thought through some of these things for you and made them consumable. You will enjoy and be frustrated by listening to his stories. He wrote precisely. He shared his view of the role government might play. I liked his word choice, his grammar, and his character development. There are several surprises in both books waiting for you."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"After having read both 1984 and Animal Farm multiple times, I purchased this hardbound book with both titles.

I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"This is a very nicely published edition of both of George Orwell's landmark novels. Many of us were required to read these in school, but they are all the more meaningful in today's political climate. While the left may tend to want to cite these novels the most (the Patriot Act as \\"Big Brother\\"), there is probably more ammunition for the right, particularly in today's politically correct culture. Think former N.O.W. executive and conservative lesbian Tammy Bruce's book \\"The New Thought Police\\". A good historical/political read regardless of your political persuasion."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"George Orwell was a genuis and if he were alive, he wouldn't have to be spinning in his grave right now, watching the world of '1984' descending upon our heads.For those of us who read it before '1984' it was a frightful tale of a possibly impending future. For those of us who grew up after '1984' it's more of a big \\"So what?\\" as it isn't nearly so different from the current reality as it ought to be, unfortunately.These books are very entertaining, mind you, and very well written; but they were not written to entertain, but to instruct. I would suggest you read them with an open mind and for entertainment, the first time, and then go back later and read with the understanding that he intended to highlight some of the more despicable aspects of society and the world at large."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"George Orwell's classic works warning against the rise of the State as the arbiter and guardian of human well-being are more pertinent now than ever. While the threat of Communism is receding, there is an American intellectual love-affair with socialism that ignores the quagmire that Western Europe has become and remains well after the fall of the Soviet Union.In easy to understand, simplistic storytelling, Orwell traces the replacement of one system of domination and exploitation with another in \\"Animal Farm\\". And astute followers of current events as well as history will note more than a few startling prognostications in \\"1984\\". Relegating these books to the Cold War period does not do them justice or adequately account for the many guises that human avarice and greed for power can take.These stories should be mandatory reading - not just in school, but throughout our lives as reminders of how quickly and easily freedom can be replaced with slavery."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"This comment concerns 1984 as narrated Richard Brown.

They are both frightening novels about what happens when your nation goes down the road to Communism. &#34;Animal Farm&#34; tells us of the Russian Revolution in the form of a fable with different animals taking the places of historical figures such as Lenin or Stalin. &#34;1984&#34; shows us what a world of the near future might possibly look like if the entire world became Communist.

After reading the book, I can quite easily see why it is a classic.Orwell paints a splendid picture of a world that we would like to avoid, and in doing so he raises our consciousness to the far reaching implications it has in a modern society. It is a beautifully written reminder about the dangers of conformity, in the face of imposed authority, and dishonest media."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Animal Farm and 1984 are both so well known (and incidentally one could check other editions for more detailed individual reviews) I shall limit myself to saying this about the works themselves: both are very powerful and 1984 ranks among my top books of all time. As for the edition itself, I would suggest to someone who is interested in either of these novels and does not yet own a copy of them to buy this edition. Even if you have a copy of one, I for example had the signet classic of 1984, this is still a good option. You get an attractive hard cover that conveniently has both the novels for a decent price.

Animal Farm should be required reading in all public schools."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Quite simply 1984 is one of the most brilliant novels of the 20th century. The main character, Winston, is an allegory of every low level bureaucrat working within the Stalin regime - constantly asked to numb the senses, dull the mind and commit blatant deception in favour of the all controlling party. Devastatingly moving, the book covers a desolate existence without ever becoming utterly depressing. It will engage you in one of the most interesting stories ever written. The story about the story is as interesting as the story itself. George Orwell, dying of tuberculosis, wrote the story in his final months, culminating in his final flourish and his finest work. One shall always wonder whether we were denied the peak of his talents or whether his imminent death inspired it. Either way, 1984 is a book that shall never succumb.George Orwell demonstrates how to economise length and still wallop the reader with powerful symbolism and satire in the story of Animal Farm. Indeed, the satirical nature of the book is plainly evident to anyone who knows about the Stalin regime and without even a hint of subtlety, the story demonstrates the obvious weaknesses of socialism. Interestingly, I read in Christopher Hitchens' Arguably that the faithful car horse Boxer was an allegory of Jurgis in Upton Sinclair's novel The Jungle, uttering these same futile words \\"I will work harder.\\" The similarities of Animal Farm and The Jungle are also present in the societal hierarchy where to quote Hitchens \\"no honest person can ever hope to win.\\" Animal Farm is an easy read and is deliberately devoid of complex language, seemingly making the worst of dictatorship child's play. It is without argument one of the most important books of the 20th century.This particular packaging, with Christopher Hitchens' introduction and lovely hard covering, adds real value to the reading experience."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"I enjoyed reading both of these George Orwell novels, but found them distressing at the same time, especially 1984. I remember watching the movie on TV fifty years ago, but reading the book has ten times the impact.It's amazing how well Orwell could project into the future and describe so well the very things we are experiencing today, the loss of freedoms, the micromanaging involvement of the government into our daily lives, the Thought Police, control of what words were permitted, constant survaillance in our lives, continually rewriting history to fit the political agenda, Doublespeak, Doublethink, etc.Now, after reading 1984, I found many news items triggering mental images of what was contained in this Orwell novel.

Its satirical look at Communism is priceless and timeless. Unfortunately, for those younger readers who have limited memory of the old Soviet Union, they may find some of the skillfully crafted yet subtle satire difficult to recognize.As to 1984, it is also well worth another visit to \\"Big Brother,\\" \\"newspeak,\\" and \\"Ingsoc\\" (English Socialism of the future time).

So when Stalin came to power and the dream of communism crumbled to a very different reality Orwell was very disturbed. The novels Animal Farm and 1984 were both written in response to the failure of socialism in Russia.1984 - The novel is always dark. No happy beginning, no happy middle and no happy ending. It follows the story of Winston Smith. He lives in a society in which the government can at any time monitor anyone. Hidden microphones and cameras are omnipresent. He doesn't love the government, which is the only crime recognized - a thought crime. It is important to read this book before throwing around terms like \\"Orwellian\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" It has been so influential on society that it introduced these terms which are now used by people who haven't read the book.Animal Farm - A less shocking variation on the theme of corruption, told in the form of a children's story. It tells the story of animals who overthrow the oppressive farmer and found a government based on the principle of equality: \\"All animals are equal.\\" The pigs are more intelligent and so have the leadership roles in the new Animal Farm. There is a pig counterpart for Trotsky and Lenin and Stalin and every other leader of Russia from the revolution until the 40's. The plot to Animal Farm parallels the history of Russia.

Big Brother is a metaphor for Big Government, and Big Gov't has only one goal, absolute power over the citizenry. It's a scary vision of what happens when the masses relinquish control over their lives for the crumbs of the ruling oligarchy. Orwell was a communist who saw first hand the excesses of Stalin's Russia and the cult of personality which developed around him.

These are the books that are being used this very day as as play-by-play guides on how to subvert a people.

Much worse, than when I was a young lad, and reading these as mandatory homework in school.If you are a young person today, and have not read these books; my first question is why? If you want to understand a lot more about our political situation, read them both. Pay particular attention to &#34;doublespeak&#34; and &#34;face crime&#34;. On a more detailed note, when I first read these books back in the early 70's, the &#34;face crime&#34; thing seemed a little far fetched back then. The technology just wasn't there yet. A few months ago, I was reading about a new technology that will enable computers to examine facial expressions via camera. The computers will pick up what it thinks is a look of nervousness or stress in an individual, and alert the all watching eyes. The first people to use this tech, will likely be the TSA.

Both \\"Animal Farm\\" and \\"1984\\" transcend their genre and truly speak to the human condition. This edition puts both together in a perfectly bound book that's light and sturdy. The introduction by Christopher Hitchens, truly a disciple of Orwell, is almost worth the price of the book. Hitchens gives a wonderful overview of Orwell, and the troubles he had getting these classics published.When I was reading this I had numerous people admire the book itself and give me their stories of reading Orwell. One example was at a small grocery store by my house. The owner and I often make small talk and one day he noticed I had this book with me. He picked it up and flipped through the pages and just smiled, then told me, \\" 'All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.' I read this as a boy. That's the heart of this book!\\"Orwell has touched so many lives.

He has a mildly British accent (totally understandable to Americans), a pleasant voice, a good reading speed and I feel like he \\"gets\\" the story. I have read the book(s) several times and bought the audio thinking it would be decent entertainment for a road trip. Next thing I know I found myself sitting out in my car for 25 minutes after arriving at my hotel transfixed by the power of the reading. Some parts of 1984 that had never caught my full attention before were illuminated by hearing some other voice than my own speak them. For example, I have always loved the phrase \\"We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.\\" and wondered what kind of tone would these words would be spoken in. Should this phrase be spoken like a vow or promise? Should it be spoken like a flat fact? Should it be spoken with a smile, a frown, a far off look? This narrator chose the musing tone of a foregone conclusion, like a thoughtful old gentleman saying \\"We will have biscuits with our tea tomorrow.\\" I totally approved. I have not yet listened to Animal Farm, but based off the quality of 1984 alone this was an excellent purchase by my standards.\\"Sanity is not statistical.\\" 1984"},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"It should be mandatory in our schools to read both of these excellent books.

In America, it is easy to forget that a very significant portion of the population struggles against just the sort of totalitarian political machinery that Orwell describes. The addition of an insightful introduction by a life-long fan, the late Chrsitopher Hitchens, reveals that Hitchens' anti-totalitarian beliefs were shaped in large part by an early introduction to Orwell. As someone who has always heard of Orwell, but never read any of his works, (even though I have a bachelor's degree in English), I am equally amazed at these books' importance; and, that they are not required reading in any secondary or post-secondary education of which I am aware.

In \\"Animal Farm\\", it was quite interesting to use animals as the characters because even children could understand its strong message, even if not fully comprehending its value at a young age. In \\"1984\\" Orwell was WAY ahead of his time with his description of corruption within the government and the unbeknownst oppression of its people.

Both Orwell novels seek to point out the shortcomings of socialist governments by satirizing the roles of Europe's leaders of the WWII era in Animal Farm and by issuing a dire warning of what could have transpired, and still might, if such totalitarian regimes hold sway in his disturbing portrayal of life under an all-seeing, all-controlling dictatorship in 1984."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"George Orwell is a great author with an interesting take on things. you get two books in one and save room on your bookshelf.

It is decentralization of power from the human being, in all aspects of one's life, to a higher power, a bigger cause, communism (more so in Animal Farm; but it would be error to say that it is just politics Orwell is hinting at) called the great Lucifer because all was given to the collective body and not to God, now God is the great Lucifer because we give ourselves to the collective body of something that we can not prove, so Science is the great Lucifer, producing weapons to kill the world a million times over, toxins to poison us a million times over, are all forms of giving to a collective body the nature of death? Is it the giving to a collective body that robs the soul of its power? Is it giving oneself wholly and utterly to something other than one's own self the conduit of decent into the investment of despair. 1984 sees men and women working their themselves to skin and bone to achieve a greater good that never emerges, the ultimate failings masked by a strict authoritative regime, BIG BROTHER, the power all seeing and ever controlling, rewriting history, editing the world around them, at war with this nation one minute and switching to another the next, neighbours up and vanish and protagonists invest in each other for but a fleeting glimpse of love only to be captured by the THOUGHT POLICE for engaging in illegal activity, men at the top of this society using torture and mind control to enforce a pathology of unquestionable and undeniable supremacy of all the power to the BIG BROTHER system, and that this is the system and that is why they are alive at all, at which point we question if it is worth living at all to which Orwell delivers a resounding, no, of course it is not worth living this life, why bother at all, and that this is a piece of work that must be understood by everyone and anyone who can read and is certainly mandatory reading for anyone in least bit interested in politics or political science.Unfortunately however we tend to vote in military commanders, lawyers and extreme capitalists into government and then ask why it is all going down hill.The problem is there is no terminology in the English language to describe the act of one human being killing their unborn future children by process of setting up a bad management system with a legal body incorporated into that system before they die. This prison kills, yet it is justified. 1984 is maybe that word, filicide being the closest English equivalent."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"The book came in even better condition than I expected!

Even if you're just looking for 1984, this edition is to be commended; it comes with a fine introduction by today's leading Orwell enthusiast, Christopher Hitchens, and the reward of including Animal Farm requires very little in the way of additional effort or expense on your part. At 80-odd pages, you may as well pick it up in the same volume, and you're virtually certain to be glad that you did.I'm not alone in being of a generation that was first required to read Orwell in my student days (Middle School, in my case.) It seems that there was a lot of literature churned out then, accessible to if not directly aimed at children, with the horrors of totalitarianism as its theme. In addition to reading Orwell, we were also reading Huxley, Bradbury, and Verne -- the youth-oriented John Christopher books being yet another example. The generation that lived through Nazism and Stalinism clearly wanted the younger set to be aware of the horrors that could be, and to remain on guard against them.It doesn't seem to be quite that way anymore. Orwell's name is invoked today, but often in trivializing contexts: \\"Big Brother\\" is now a brain-numbing reality show, and \\"Orwellian\\" is a convenient and often hysterically-applied charge to political opponents. Some complaceny does seem to be inevitable: we are now further removed from the days when the likes of Hitler and Stalin killed tens of millions. Still, regimes arise that are nearly as horrific on a local scale, from Pol Pot to Saddam Hussein to the Taliban, and are real enough that Orwell's book is no joke. Orwell deserves attention if for no other reason than to sensitize us to the bad form associated with invoking his name in a trivializing context. There was a political ad on Youtube last year from an Obama supporter that cast Hillary Clinton on a giant Big Brother-like screen. I'm not in the least a fan of Senator Clinton, but associating her image with those of 1984 -- as was also done in an infamous Apple Computer ad -- trivializes Orwell's message in a deplorable way. Orwell wrote his novel to warn against real dangers that his generation lived through, and which others might yet, not as a marketing ploy to be used in selling either computers or nearly indistinguishable democratic political candidacies.The main reason I am writing this review, however, is that re-reading Orwell in my 40's is a stark reminder that his novels are more than political parables, but are worthy literature. I hope that those reading these reviews will be aware of this, and not shut their minds to a rewarding literary experience.As a kid, I was able to perceive the pedagogical intent of these books, but less so was I able to appreciate the literary artistry. 1984 in particular passes the Nabokovian test of creating a fully believable, if terrifying, alternate world. Beyond that, on nearly every page, Orwell leaves an image that just might stay with you forever. Small wonder that so many of the terms in 1984 (\\"Big Brother,\\" \\"Newspeak\\") have burrowed their way into our lexicography.Orwell was a man of the left who understood something that many of his compatriots did not; that what had arisen in the Soviet Union was a regime unprecedented in its horror (arriving before, and ultimately outlasting, its horrific mirror image, Hitler's Third Reich.) At a time when others on the left simply refused to believe in the reality of the USSR, he looked at it unflinchingly and wrote what it was really about.Also, in childhood, I was not able to fully appreciate that Orwell's books simply weren't negative-utopian nightmare-fantasies, but paralleled actual events in the USSR with chilling accuracy. I knew, at some level, that he was satirizing certain events and characters in the Russian Revolution, but only in adulthood was I able to closely recognize nearly every episode and character in Animal Farm. Those familiar with USSR history will find it all here in the two books: the rewriting of the past to reaffirm the infallibility of the Party, the sudden reorienting of national propaganda to suit the latest twist of foreign policy, and the complete elimination of all references to those unfortunate souls decreed never to have existed.Truly, the thing that makes 1984 terrifying now, is not what was imagined in the novel's construction, but what was real in its sources. It exaggerates even relative to the Stalinist state -- but not by much. It is this recognition that makes it a chilling read today.1984 is the more vivid and evocative of the two novels. Excepting one passage (Goldstein's dreary history lesson about 2/3 of the way through) it is riveting almost throughout its 300 pages.A few notes for younger readers: The moral of Animal Farm is not that Napoleon was simply a bad apple, but rather that the system adopted by the Animals ensured that ultimately such a tyrant would dominate. (I find the end of Animal Farm to be something of a false note; in the end the pigs prove no better than, and resemble, the humans they replaced, but this understates the tragic reality that the USSR was worse still than that which it replaced.)As I close, I leave you with one random question about 1984: how come it never occurs to Eastasia and Eurasia to combine against Oeania? Given that Oceania keeps flipping its allegiance from one to the other, you'd think they'd ultimately catch on and both decide to attack Oceania at the same time.Silly questions aside, this book is highly commended. Worth re-reading again, especially if you only have read Orwell when as immature as was I."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Because most people will review the actual book(s), which in this case are classics and I feel do not truly need a review, I will review this edition.

I'm so glad this is the volume I bought. I know I would have gotten the same *words* in a flimsy paperback, but this was a really nice read.I read both novels again. It has been... 20 years?

Nothing else is included, but you don't need anything else. The readers are wonderful. Very clear voices with nice inflection that doesn't distract from the story. Both these books are classic reads, so if you'd like reviews on the content of the books, I'd suggest you look up the paper editions as they are heavily reviewed and provide a lot of information.This version is unabridged so the same information should apply. As a matter of fact, much of the information is easier to understand when listening to it rather than reading it off the page - particularly the introduction portion which I normally just skip over to get to the story was very interesting and much more thought provoking to listen to than I would have expected.The sound is crystal clear and the product is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Simon Prebble and Ralph Cosham both do a fine job of narration.

I am a naturally optimistic person, but after I read either one of these books I am forced to take a more warily critical look at the government and media.

Because the pigs are the cleverest of all the animals, they establish themselves as the \\"leaders\\" (although, their motto is \\"All animals are equal\\") Two pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, are consistently fighting with each other on how the farm should be run. Eventually, Napoleon trains some dogs, and they run Snowball out of the farm. After that, Napoleon basically turns the farm into a dictatorship under his rule. Towards the end of the book, Napoleon changes their motto to \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\".1984- In this society, based in what was once London (in the story, it is called Oceania), Big Brother controls everything and everyone. Almost every citizen has telescreens in their houses that can not be turned off. Not only do the telescreens broadcast all the time, but they also receive, so citizens could be watched, although you never know when they are watching you. The protagonist of the story, Winston, is a rebel of sorts. He purchases a diary, and writes in it (a crime punishable by death). Eventually, he ends up having an illegal romantic relationship with a woman named Julia. And, well, you'll have to read the rest, because I don't want to give too much away. It is a great read, although, there is a part towards the middle-ish end of the story where Winston is reading \\"The Book\\" (a book given to him by the \\"botherhood\\", the underground movement against Big Bother)That part is a bit dry, but it picks up after that.As far as the Kindle version I bought, I was going to go with the hard copy, but I went with the Kindle edition instead so I could read it instantly. I defiantly don't regret it, but there are some misspellings in the Kindle version. I'm not majorly picky about spelling, so it didn't bother me too much, but I feel this something that needs to be mentioned. If misspellings are a major issue with you, don't get the Kindle version. (although, I'm not sure about the spellings in the hard copy version either, but chances are, there are less). In my opinion, these both are stories everyone should read."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Many of us were assigned these books to read in school by thoughtful teachers. All of us should read them. In both, George Orwell gives us the tools to see exactly what liberty means and why we cannot afford to lose it.In \\"Animal Farm,\\" the fable is sufficiently removed from human experience that you can read this one to quite young children, just as you can \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" or other classics which say more each time you read them as you grow up. Even a first-grader could see the relationship of the politics of the barnyard to the politics of the playground. The jeering refrain of \\"Surely you don't want Jones back\\" can easily be recognized as the propaganda fallacy called \\"Reductio ad Hitlarum.\\" Whenever the ruling pigs ran out of useful things to say, they fell back on slogans which meant nothing, but which could be molded to mean whatever they wanted them to mean in a given circumstance.The completely classic \\"All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others\\" is one we must keep in mind whenever politicians start using words as if they mean the reverse of what they do mean.1984, too, has its beautifully classic lines. The main characters are all members of the Ingsoc Party (English Socialism). It is not until well into the book that we learn they are only some 15% of the population; the rest are proles. The proles are easily dismissed as insignificant: \\"They can be granted intellectual liberty because they have no intellect.\\" Use that line the next time someone tells you it's not important to educate our entire population to the best of their capabilities.When the main character, Winston Smith, attempts to placate his tormenter by saying \\"You are ruling over us for our own good,\\" he is scorned as \\"stupid, Winston, stupid.\\" The party big shot responds with one of the most chilling lines I have ever read: \\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--forever.\\"Through the medium of conversations in the lunch room of the \\"Ministry of Truth,\\" Orwell is able to tell us much about the creation and preservation of a totalitarian state. One key is the control over language which the Party exercises: \\"Newspeak.\\" One of the people working on the Newspeak dictionary explains it to Winston: \\"You think, I dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words. But not a bit of it! We're destroying words--scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. We're cutting language down to the bone.\\" He brags that very soon \\"all real knowledge of Oldspeak will have disappeared. The whole literature of the past will have been destroyed. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Milton, Byron--they'll exist only in Newspeak versions, not merely changed into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory of what they used to be.\\"Putting these two in a single hardbound volume and adding a thoughtful introduction by Christopher Hitchens was a stroke of genius on the part of Harcourt Books. It will make it all the easier for professors of political science, literature, history, psychology . . . indeed, if it was not such a contradiction with regard to books so dedicated to liberty, I'd say make them required reading."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Six decades later, his work still speaks to us.

This is some SERIOUS high quality binding. The book looks great. The spine is black with classy white lettering and looks great on book shelves. The front and back cover have the parchment look. And the quality of the paper is high. No cheap 'see-through' newsprint looking paper here. And most important, it's standard, tight spine binding, not the cheap library style binding (where the pages on the outside spine kind of have the wave pattern).For those who don't have a copy but like these works, buy this edition. For those who have a copy of either book and want to trade up to a serious collectible version (like me) do so! This is the best looking version I have seen yet.There is also a lovely introduction by Christopher Hitchins and a nice appendix about Newspeak (from 1984). I won't spend too much on the actual books themselves except to say that these are two of the greatest modern classics in the English language. 1984 is among my favorite novels and it is a very relevant novel in today's society. Along with Fahrenheit 451, I think these two dystopian novels show a future which is very possible. Animal Farm is a little less relevant today since the USSR went away, but it still is chilling nonetheless to view a kind of parody on a totalitarian state.These are novels that I enjoy reading multiple times. And 1984 is the one novel that at one point actually made me jump and say \\"Oh [insert appropriate expetive here]\\". If you've read it you probably know the part. (We are the dead.) And let's not forget room 101. Seriously one of the finest novels ever written and the arguably the iconic Dystopian novel, the one that gave rise to the term \\"Orwellian\\". Buy and read multiple times. But I seriously cannot rate this edition highly enough."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"Nineteen Eighty-Four, by George Orwell, is a novel set in a Dystopian World War II era. In this imagination of a future from someone in the Ninteen forties, Oceania, where the novel takes place, is under a totalitarianistic rule. Big Brother, the dictator, is seldom, if never seen, and there exists three classes below him - the Inner Party (high ranking officials), Outer Party (Middle Class), and the Proles (proletarians, bottom class). Winston Smith, the protagonist, is a cynical historical record forger for the government. He despises his job, Big Brother, and also the totalitarian regime. One day, he happens to meet Julia, a revolutionary like him, and forming a forbidden (by the government) relationship, they rebel the government by night while working by day, maintaining their double life. I thought the book was very eruditely written, a masterpiece of George Orwell. Orwell's style conveys as much as there is needed to know, enough to grasp a solid, tangible picture of the scene going on, and then some in more opulent situations. He even manages to word feelings that humans have a hard time describing, using the momentum of the scene to convey these feelings, a remarkable feat. During the \\"Two Minute Hate\\", one of the events in Nineteen Eighty-Four, as a reader I could see the rancorous, primal, enmity that was going on in the scene. Orwell even manages to imbue what seems like his own political opinions and conclusions in the guise of a book written by Emmanuel Goldstein, one of the unseen characters of whom was ousted by the Inner Party and drenched in rancid propaganda who is rumored to be alive and operating a revolutionary group. Additionally, Orwell sets up situations so well, it's almost as if the reader can picture the grime on the walls of Winston's apartment, or the omniscient glare of the telescreens (one channel televisions that have camera and microphones to observe citizens). Another one of Orwell's strengths in writing is his ability to set in themes that run throughout the entire story. Themes of oppression, repression, lack of freedom, and also the manipulation of truth and power are evident throughout the entire story. Everywhere, from the Proles to the Inner Party, readers can see that their freedoms are limited - though the characters may choose what to do, they are severely limited in what they're allowed to think - any thought against the government is known as \\"Thought Crime\\", and according to Winston Smith, \\"Thought Crime doesn't entail death. Though Crime is death\\". Another major point of Orwell's tale is how the characters are set up. Winston Smith seems at first a bit contrived as one of the \\"only people sentient in the flock of people\\", yet still displays his own signs of originality such as his cynicality and original thoughts. I felt that Winston's actions are pretty justifiable, more than for the reason of the author demonstrating governmental brutality. Winston secretly despises the party, and therefore has his own thoughts, feelings, convictions. Having the tenacity to rebel against the government as openly and as dangerously as possible without getting himself killed takes a lot of guts. Moreover, he accepts the fact that he's already dead from the day he committed thoughtcrime, so he adopts a \\"all out\\" mentality. Julia's actions, however, aren't as independent as Winston's, or at least, as readers, we do not see how much more her personal life is besides her relationship with Winston. Though I would say her actions and mentality in rebelling with Winston are justifiable, readers do not really get to see her own independent thought or actions like they do Winston's. Overall, the things that I liked most about the book is the pacing and 'feel' of the book. There's a certain way the syntax moves so that as a reader, I can see the colorful language, and yet have no need to stop and think about any potential ambiguity. The reading of the book slides easily and smoothly, and the range of emotions felt is flawless and very real. When Winston felt enmity towards Big Brother, I felt like throwing a book or something at Big Brother. When Winston felt apprehensive, or nervous, I could understand the furtiveness he was feeling as he wrote his diary, also an action banned by the government. The book, overall, was a delightful, harrowing read that will thrill and challenge the minds of any sci-fi or retro enthusiast, or even mild horror enthusiasts."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"These are books 2 and 3 in my 2012 quest to read 25 books that are most often targets of banning attempts.

I'm sure this will be a recurring theme, but it saddens me that I never read it earlier. As with any book review, I do not want to spill the plot, but suffice it to say that the (potential future) world Orwell paints in vivid detail is not always a pretty one. Both these books should serve as a reminder of what could happen if we let it.These are two very thought provoking novels.

They are housed in cardboard pockets, so care is needed when removing them to prevent scratches. The first \\"Animal Farm\\" disc opens with an 18-minute introduction on the original release of the novel during the same month when the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki took place. Coincidentally, some thought (and many historians today believe) the atomic bombs were as much a message sent to the Soviets (the Russian Revolution and Stalin's Purges, of course, were parodied in Orwell's novel) as an attack on Japan to end WWII. It also explains why \\"Animal Farm\\" is considered a \\"fairy story.\\" The introduction was mildly interesting, but hard to follow at times, and seemed longer than it needed to be as I was anxious to hear the story. There is no introduction for \\"1984.\\"Simon Prebble (\\"1984\\") and Ralph Casham (\\"Animal Farm\\") give excellent readings that bring life to the stories.

Animal Farm is speculative fiction. The main characters are a pig named Napoleon and another pig named Snowball. Snowball and Napoleon were the leaders of the farm once it turned into Animal Farm.\\"The pigs did not actually work, but directed and supervised the others. With their superior knowledge it was natural that they should assume the leadership.\\"Napoleon didn't talk much and wasn't introduced until after the rebellion. He had a reputation of getting his way. Snowball was more talkative and did have a part in the initial rebellion. Snowball was a persuasive speaker.One of the big themes for Animal Farm was leadership and corruption. When the animals decided to rebel against Mr. Jones they wanted to be free with no leadership nor corruption. They thought it was a great idea. So, all the animals got together and rebelled. The first year it was great. They changed the name of the farm from Manor farm to Animal farm, they set up a set of 7 rules and got more crops then they did the previous year with Mr. Jones.Napoleon and Snowball and the other pigs were the leaders of the Animal Farm. Napoleon and Snowball never got along. They always fought and wanted different things for the farm. That is until one day Napoleon ran Snowball off the farm using nine dogs. And from then on, whenever something bad happened, they would blame Snowball for sneaking in in the middle of the night and doing it.Napoleon corrupted the farm. He let the pigs have special treatment and turned all the rules around and talked to humans and made deals with them and got money to buy things for the farm. All of this was was not to happen according to the original rules.This book is one big metaphor on how the government works today.I really enjoyed this book. It was a good easy read, it was simple and got to the point of the story. Orwell really drew you in."},{"Title":"Animal Farm & 1984 (Collected Stories of the World's Greatest Writers)","review":"I had to read Animal Farm in school, but I reread it.

The metaphor of house construction (renewal from chaos) is too disjointed and the sense of 'completion' (safe from the elements) too distant from the self-absorbed lives of the three protaganists. (They all confront 'loss') Gadol writes the book like a play, but the absence of threat and external horror (other than the weather and iits punishing unpredictability)lessens the tension of the 3 linked lives. The heterosexual love sequence is ludicrous - the 2 male leads (who are strangely unaware of each other's physicality) connect not at all. Gadol is a wonderful, inventive writer when he has a plot to drive - here the plot is reflection and hot Californian sun, and the book gets lost in the heat."},{"Title":"Closer To The Sun","review":"I enjoyed THE LONG RAIN, and decided to read Gadol's earlier novel.

The book covers the period from 1917 to 1929, so it goes beyond the revolution itself and into the first five years of Bolshevik rule. The books fairly well structured and not at all confusing - and the author does a remarkably good job of distilling the complexities of the Revolution, the Civil War and the early years of the Soviet Union down into a book this size.Overall, a good intro and overview.

However, the real benefits of the translation are the excellent introduction and in excess of 260 pages of notes on the text making significant references to previous translations such as those of Zielinski, Reitzenstein, Festugiere, Mahe and Fowden. 'Hermetica' will be a fascinating journey for all those interested in Egypto-Hellenistic philosophy or for those searching for an alternative to the rigid orthodoxy of some other religious systems. However, there is little here for those who seek to become a spell-casting magus - this is Hermetism, rather than populist Hermeticism! In the thanksgiving at the end of Asclepius, the spells which were present in the Papyrus Mimaut and also in Nag Hammadi Codex VI.6 are omitted. These central texts of Hermetism are learned, philosophical treatises as opposed to popular, occultist writings - &quot;a blend of theology, cosmology, anthropology, ethics, soteriology and eschatology.\\"Most readers will probably find some degree of confusion within the Corpus Hermeticum. Different authors of the various treatises appear to have taken part in Peripatetic-Platonic-Stoic debate within the surviving texts. Much of the previous criticism however has focussed on the Egyptian - Hellenic argument; Hermes Trismegistus being a syncretic fusion of the Greek messenger of the gods with the Egyptian Thoth (pr. something akin to T-HO-TI). Just to be confusing, the character 'Tat' is also a variant of Thoth is some of the Corpus' texts. Linked with this Peripatetic-Platonic debate is the Corpus' attitude towards dualism which should be a distinguishing feature between Hermetism and early Gnostic Christianity - but sometimes isn't all that clear-cut. Further complications arise through Copenhaver's extensive references to the Chaldean Oracles.The texts open with POIMANDRES, 'the shepherd man' (poimen aner) although some still search for a Coptic root. The nature of 'true reality' (see Plato's 'Timaeus') establishes itself as the central focus in the very first line of CH I. It is Mind which will free the soul from the fleshy darkness of its bodily incarceration. The texts then move on to the universal discourse between Hermes and Tat opening up a Stoic - Peripatetic debate on whether there is a void or non-entity without the Cosmos. A third alternative is presented : that the surrounding space both encircles and moves the Cosmos.The most Peripataetic of texts according to Zielinski is CH IV in which activity is clearly seen as positive and passivity as negative. There are some indications of common authorship between I and VII although a number of Western translators have found evidence of strong Judaic influences in VII. CH VII also introduces the metaphor of the 'chiton' (vestment, cloak, shawl) as a symbol of the body which fed through into the writings of Philo, Plotinus and the Valentinian Gnostics - this must be shed for the soul's ascent. The tenth discourse introduces another image of the chiton. Unlike the chiton of CH VIII, this garment must be acquired to rise and to take on a demonic cloak. With a good mind the soul can pass on to something greater, but to nothing lesser.Within the 17 Greek treatises the Stoic concept of 'sumpatheia' (the organic unity of the Cosmos) is only mentioned specifically once in CH VIII although its influence can be elsewhere. Scott suggested that one of the latest of the extant logoi was XIII, the diexodikos logos, on account of its dependence on CH I and XI. This is essentially concerned with \`palingenesia' which Buchsel sees as the Stoic opposite of ekpurosis - the great conflagration into which the currently existing Cosmos would disappear only to be restored under apokatastasis.The historical development of translations of the texts has given them rather illogical numberings. In theory CH IX should take place immediately after the Latin Asclepius - as the latter is a translation of the 'perfect discourse', the 'teleios logos' rendered by Lactantius as the 'Sermo perfectus'. It is an exposition of the discourse on sensation which clearly rejects the Platonic position in favour of a more Stoic interpretation. Thanks to Adrien Turnebus' translation in 1554 there is no Corpus Hermeticum XV (Ficino's translation ended at XIV).Mind only appears as interlocutor in CH I and XI. CH XI is also distinctive in that aion (eternity) appears 27 times within the text and only 3 times elsewhere. Aion was the supreme deity of Westernised Mithraism and is connected with Zrvan Akarana, Saturnus and Kronos, with Orpheism, in philosophical terms with the Stoic heimarmene (which appear elsewhere in the Corpus), perhaps even with the Phoenician Ba'al Shamin, and - in astro-magical texts - with the 'holy Agathos Daimon'. There is also the Aion of the Chaldean Oracles, which - according to Lewy - is 'not only a divinity, but also a noetic hypostasis'. Here, as in CH XIV, there is only one maker. This is a direct rebuttal of the Gnostic position and, internally, of the position outlined by I and XIII.Asclepius (or Imhotep in the original Egyptian) is most likely a collection of fragments from other texts. The Hermetic praise of human dignity stops distinctly short of the physical and sexual aspects of the human condition. Asclepius is far more apocalyptic and laden within divine retribution than the Corpus. Copenhaver finds references to the Egyptian apocalyptic story of Potter's Oracle in his predecessors' translations centred around a Khnum, a ram-headed creator-god. But the message in Asclepius is clear, Egypt - this \`image of heaven' - will forget its Hermetic ways and \\"will be filled completely with tombs and corpses\\" and \\"the reverent will be thought mad\\".We should all try to learn something from Hermetica, for beneath the complexities is real truth.Then he said to me : \\"Keep all in mind that you wish to learn, and I will teach you.\\" Saying this, he changed his appearance and everything was immediately opened to me... (Corpus Hermeticum I)"},{"Title":"Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and Introduction","review":"This is a fantastic translation of the Pymander or Corpus Hermeticum and Asclepius. Since it's the only one I've read, I don't know how to compare it to others. This text was apparently rediscovered by the court of Cosimo di Medici in the 1400's, probably obtained from some source in Harran. Texts such as this were at the forefront of the syncretic mysticism and platonic/classical revival of the Italian Renaissance. This text might be something like a pagan hellenistic answer to scriptures or very obscure mystical and gnostic texts which describe very esoteric ideas that can only be understood through some kind of experience. On many levels it is very compatible with Christianity, Judaism or Islam because it may represent a kind of philosophical precursor of these religions from late antiquity. Even many of the early patriarchs of the orthodox christian tradition understood this compatibility and considered this text to represent a kind of sanctified pagan tradition or philosophy of sorts, which they actually used as proof of the validity of christianity. They did this by arguing that since pagans could come up with ideas so close to christianity, that this supported a belief in the new faith. For this reason, on the level of mundane theological and philosophical history, this text is very important for an understanding of how early christians and other monotheists viewed their relationship to paganism in a world that was still very pagan. The notes in this book are also extremely helpful and worthwhile."},{"Title":"Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and Introduction","review":"Much like the Chaldean oracles, the Corpus Hermeticum is a vital document for all those who have an interest in the eclectic thought of the period covering the first centuries AD; this recent edition is certainly worthy of being added to the library of the scholar and curious reader alike. It includes the seventeen Greek treatises which have been brought together over the centuries as the Corpus Hermeticum, in addition to the Latin \`Asclepius', which is by far the longest piece of them all. No Greek or Latin text accompanies the translation, but Copenhaver provides extensive notes, many of which directly address specific points of the translation and pick up where studies in hermetism had left off. In these notes, there are numerous references to previous editions of the Hermetica, especially to the work of A.D. Nock/A.-J. Festugi&egrave;re (in French) and of W. Scott (in English). The introduction also does a good job of describing both the context in which these pieces emerged, and the way they have been read and edited in the following centuries."},{"Title":"Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and Introduction","review":"Although I enjoy the poetic spirit of Walter Scott's translation, this is undeniably a superior translation and is important for reasons aptly mentioned by other reviewers. I think this is the definitive translation. Superb."},{"Title":"Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and Introduction","review":"The legendary \\"Corpus Hermeticum\\" (CH) is a motley collection of religious, philosophical and magical texts, composed during the Hellenistic period in Egypt. The main character is Hermes Trismegistus, a mythical figure based on the Greek god Hermes and his perceived Egyptian equivalent Thoth. In Europe, the CH became widely known during the Renaissance. Today, it's mostly associated with occultists and New Age believers.The CH is highly eclectic. It resembles Plato's dialogue \\"Timaeus\\" and later Neo-Platonism and Gnosticism. There are similarities with Orphic hymns and the Sibylline oracles. Some scholars also believe that it contains authentic Egyptian influences. Many Christians have been mystified by the utterances of Hermes Trismegistus, no doubt because they occasionally resemble the creation story in the Book of Genesis or sound \\"monotheist\\". One Church Father, Lactantius, used the CH as a source of prophecies about Jesus Christ (!).The last couple of decades, the New Age movement have in made ideas similar to those of the CH part of popular culture. Due to this, the Hermetic message sounds pretty old hat. God is both transcendent/\\"monotheist\\" and immanent/\\"pantheist\\". The soul is immortal and somehow divine. The body is a prison for the soul, and souls are trapped in it because of desire for the world of matter. Ideas resembling reincarnation and karma are also taught. The main characters frequently get mystical visions and theophanies. The goal is to become deified.Sounds familiar?This book contains translations of Corpus Hermeticum I-XVIII and the Latin Asclepius. \\"Only\\" the more philosophical texts of the CH have been included. The more practical treatises on alchemy or astrology have been left out. The introduction and the notes are very scholarly and probably of less interest to more spiritual readers. The actual translation is only about 100 pages long, most of the book containing footnotes dealing with obscure issues of translation or parallels in other ancient literature. (The notes are almost esoteric!)\\"Hermetica\\" is obviously intended for scholars, but might have some interest for the general reader as well, provided he or she is interested in alternative forms of spirituality, which often seem to resemble the ideas expounded by the Thrice Great Hermes."},{"Title":"Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and Introduction","review":"I actually found the translation accessible, though a bit dry. I will also agree with the other reviewer that facing page translations would be an excellent addition. However, aside from this.This work is a translation of the entire Greek \\"Corpus Hermeticum\\" and the Latin \\"Asclepius\\" into Modern English. These works were arguably critical in shaping the European Renaissance, and have had a profound impact on Western thought.In addition to the translation, the introduction is very well done as well. There is a wealth of information here which contributes a great deal to the scope of the work.Finally, what can I say about the notes? The notes are about twice as long as the text, and provide a great deal of insight into the various other forms of works.For anyone interested in studying this topic, this edition is absolutely essential. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and Introduction","review":"Modern \\"occult\\" and \\"channeled\\" works pale before the spiritual sublimity of this all-time Greco-Egyptian classic. In my opinion the Corpus Hermeticum is one of the most galvanizing expressions of spirituality to emerge from the Western tradition (along with Plotinus' Enneads). This is a superb translation of an amazing ancient text."},{"Title":"Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and Introduction","review":"The Hermetica is a corpus of mystical-theological-philosophical literature on diverse themes which was originally believed to have been supernatural wisdom passed down to man by the mysterious Egyptian deity Thoth. It was initially thought these works pre-dated the Bible and also the works of Plato and Aristotle, though it is now accepted they were written in about the 3rd century CE.The Hermetica contain thirteen diverse discourses between divine figures or teachers and various initiates. They cover several themes, including God and his relationship to humans, the relationship between the world and the divine, practices of mystery religions, the nature of true reality, mystical Gnosis and ethics. At times the literature can rise to beautiful heights, but at many others it is deeply incoherent and overall, the Corpus is not self-consistent and often contains contradictory notions about the world and the divine.Nevertheless it is an important document from the ancient world and worth studying by anyone interested in this time."},{"Title":"Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and Introduction","review":"Copenhaver's new edition and translation of the Greek corpus hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius provide the interested reader with an immensely readable and professionally done English translation, as well as a solid introduction and copious notes.Copenhaver intends to replace Scott's classic edition and translation, and claims to improve upon what he sees as the rather idiosyncratic Greek and Latin texts which Scott put together and from which he translates. But the extent to which he succeeds is difficult to judge--read on.The one, major drawback of this volume is that while Copenhaver offers extensive endnotes which fill in--to some extent--for a full critical apparatus, he does not give us the Greek and Latin texts. Without these, it is difficult for a professional scholar or an informed general reader to evaluate Copenhaver's work for him/herself.In fairness to Copenhaver, it was never his intent to produce a work that could be used in the way I describe. In one sense, then, he succeeds magnificently at what he set out to do. But the addition of facing page texts in the original languages (provided in Scott's classic edition) would have made this book much, much better--and much more useful to a wider audience. Although the size of such an audience is not exactly vast, it may well be greater than Copenhaver imagined.In short, it's an excellent text for anyone interested in the Hermetica who does not read Greek or Latin. It is a very good text for students and scholars who will find much in Copenhaver's insightful editing, translation, and commentary, but may feel disappointment over the missing original texts and will only be able to use it within its obvious limitations. If he ever puts out a fuller edition with the Greek and Latin, I'll be first in line to buy it."},{"Title":"Hermetica: The Greek Corpus Hermeticum and the Latin Asclepius in a New English Translation, with Notes and Introduction","review":"With the publication of the massive editio princeps, \\"The Ancient Egyptian Book of Thoth\\" (2005) by Professors Richard Jasnow & Karl-Theodor Zauzich [see my Amazon review], Professor Brian P. Copenhaver's treatise (1992) is a much demanded text in the library of anyone choosing to study Late Egyptian culture and/or the Corpus Hermetica.This treatise is not New Age nonsense; it is superb ancient Greek scholarship. After the publication of Garth Fowden's treatise, \\"The Egyptian Hermes: A Historical Approach to the Late Pagan Mind (1986), it was felt in the scholarly arcane world of Egyptology that the magical book of Thothic wisdom was needed.Those who have been bred on classical scholarship in their youth, Greek & Latin, will enjoy its pertinent attention to philological details.This book must be purchased and added to your classical library, if you possess a morsel of self-respect in your self-conscious identity as a competent scholar of ancient languages.This book is the real deal---it does not pander to the vulgar taste of mediocre minds! It is an ansolute delight to read, study and contemplate. How was the Age of Magic formulated after the great achievements in Greek science, mathematics & technology from the Sixth to Third Century BCE [Before the Common Era]? It was this magical mentality (a regression in the advancement of human thought) that slowly dominated which permitted the vulgar Age of Christianity to arise. A study of Egyptian Magical culture from 200 BCE to CE 300 tells the tale!John E.D.P.

This translation is good for academics writing a thesis on the subject. To the layman it is completely unreadable. I've read plenty of dry historical texts in my time, and this one ranks up there with the dryest. Much of the book is reference material, also unreadable. Elitists scorn translations written so people can actually understand them, but for my money (a new or even used copy of this book here is, for a paperback, rediculously expensive), I'll take a translation where my eyes don't glaze over every other paragraph. Yawn."},{"Title":"Socrates, the man who dared to ask","review":"This is an excellent account of the life of Socrates, retold for older children. The author provides a surprisingly sophisticated glimpse of Socrates' method and philosophical concerns, drawing on several of Plato's dialogues and Xenophon's Memorabilia.

Very informative aond concise about the true meaning of life and how to live it."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I enjoyed it so much that I also purchased another one of the author's books, \\"A Promising Man,\\" with the hopes that it will be just as good as \\"Asking for Trouble.\\"I must say, though, that for me to enjoy this book, I had to divorce myself from the movie that was supposedly based on this book as well as stop comparing it to \\"Bridget Jones's Diary,\\" one of my favorite books and the book that also got me into reading chick-lit to begin with. There are some parts of the book that can be found in the movie \\"The Wedding Date,\\" but, overall, I found the book to be much different than the movie, which is not a bad thing at all. When I first bought the book, I was expecting the book's plot to completely follow the movie, and when it didn't, I was a little disappointed. I was so disappointed that I stopped reading midway through and had no intention of completing it. However, several years after I saw the movie, and several years where my disappointment was able to vanish, I picked up the book again, and I started to see its own original charm.I enjoyed reading about the characters, and I found the writing, dialogue, and plotline to be engaging and humorous. I also did at first find it annoying in trying to understand the British references and the abbreviations made throughout the book, but with the Internet so accessible nowadays, I easily googled the terms and found their meaning.The main character, Sophy, does spin a web of lies throughout the book, and, most often than not, seems properly described as being a \\"headcase,\\" which is often the result of her insecure and paranoid personality, and which many readers found annoying, making it difficult to find Sophy likeable. However, with these web of lies and Sophy's neurotic personality, I found myself laughing with her and quickly turning the pages, wondering how she was going to get herself out of the situation she put herself in.One thing that at first kept me from fully enjoying this book was thinking that it was also going to be exactly like \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\". \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" is one of my favorite books, but I found that I could not compare that book with \\"Asking for Trouble.\\" Though they are both in the realm of chick-lit, they are both different books with different storylines, and they each have their unique, enjoyable moments.Overall, this is a good and relaxing, funny read that captured my attention from beginning to end."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Sophy's sister, Belinda, is getting married, and as expected, Sophy receives an invitation for her and her boyfriend, Dominic to attend the wedding...one problem; Dominic doesn't exist.

Can Sophy keep her lies straight, and her hands off the attractive Josh, or will disaster befall her?This is a cute, quick read. Sophy is a little whiny and her way of speaking is annoying, but overall I enjoyed the novel and the connections between the characters. Great for the beach!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I loved the movie The Wedding Date, which is loosely based on this book. I'm a sucker for romantic comedies. I was looking for something light and fluffy and this was perfect. This book is definitely very funny and is a quick, easy read. You do have to have a handle on your British slang though or you won't think it's funny at all. Sophy, the main character, is the kind of girl you'd want as your friend - she's smart, funny, neurotic, self deprecating - I loved her character and the conversations she has with her girlfriends in the book reminded me so much of those I have with my girlfriends. The book is NOTHING like the movie though. The similarities are that the main character hires an escort to accompany her to her \\"perfect\\" sister's wedding and that her sister and ex have a relationship - but the similarities end there.

I got this because I liked the description and when I needed a break from the deep, loaded books, I picked this one up and was pleasantly surprised. I expected the typical girl falls in love with guy story, but it was well beyond that. Enough twists and unexpected surprises that kept me shocked many times throughout the book. I really thought I'd always know where the book was going, but many times I sat here thinking, \\"Man, I didn't see that coming!\\" I also enjoyed the writing stye and laughed many times through.My only complaint is that the editor wasn't very good. There are so many grammatical and spelling errors, even words missing (small things that probably no one else would pick up normally). And the author has a tendency to use the exact same phrases over and over again when describing things, so I'd be thinking, \\"Didn't she just say that exact same thing?\\" and indeed, she would have.This was my first Elizabeth Young book, but I plan to read others."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Oh, this was a pretty cute chick lit book - of course, it does seem to be the exact plot of a movie I saw on TV once, The Wedding Date (I think), but with more family drama added in.

As a woman in my 30's I could easily relate to Sophy. Male or female I think there are times in a persons life you might easily get sucked up into what Sophy is going through. Of course you probably won't go to the links she did. I found Sophy fun and the first person account was like you were sitting at brunch with her telling you what had happened. Just like you'd do with your best friend. The story is simple Sophy has told a little lie to her mother about a boyfriend that doesn't exist just to make her happy. Enter Josh/Dominic the escort that every girl wants to take home to mother. Someone handsome, personable and appealing to parents you want to impress with how great your doing even if you aren't. Sophy's character is not a typical size 6 or lesser beauty, she's a little plump and currently in dating slump, so she decides this is the only way to keep her mother happy while attending her sisters wedding. Lies start adding up though and Sophy stumbles. What comes next? Well, I'll leave you to find out. It's a fun read that I enjoyed thoroughly.

As the book progresses, she learns that she was putting her own character strengths aside and focusing too much on her appearance, which apparently was passable in the first place!

It's very romantic, and some of the scenes were hilarious, particularly when Sophy was trying to keep track of all her lies. I thought the ending was bit predictable, but didn't detract from the book. Definitely recommended for anyone who enjoys a good chick-lit book. I haven't read anything else by this author, but I'd like to after this one."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I can't lie, I bought this book because I so desperately wanted to see the movie--being that I'm a HUGE Debra Messing fan. I was shopping one day, the book caught my eyes, and since the movie has not yet been released on DVD, I decided to do something that I hadn't done in a long time--read a book before watching the movie (that way I can complain, and nitpick later about how different the book was from the movie).I expected \\"The Wedding Date\\" to be charming, and a good read, but I didn't expect to not be able to put it down. \\"A good read\\" is an understatement for this adorable love story, that takes you through so many crazy twists and turns you can't help but crack up after every other page.Sophy Metcalfe is that paranoid part of all of us, who believe we're never going to be able to find love--and will spend the rest of our lives watching others travel off to romantic weekends, while we silently pray for quick and painless death.Josh Carmichael is that guy we hopeless romantic women all hope is out there for us, waiting to assure us that there's nothing wrong with us, but just the bad seeds we've managed to waste our time dating.Having said all that positive stuff, I will now have to mention the negatives...hey, I have to be fair, there's always bad criticism along with the good, right?#1. Being an overweight woman, myself, I can most definitely sympathize with Sophy, in feeling so down about her body...but do we really need to hear about it on every page? Every other sentence it seemed focused on her \\"wobbly bits\\". It's funny and cute at first, but after the first few chapters, it gets to you so badly...#2. I love a good challenge when it comes to abbreviations, or initials, but not when it comes to you at least one time a chapter, and it's hopelessly undecipherable. All the \\"WLTM\\"s and \\"FGF\\"s made the story very impersonal to read, and took away from that feeling of me actually living Sophy's life, and going through what she's going through.

I don't want to give much away, because there are so many twists. Just read it and enjoy."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Of all the books I have read in the past year this was by far the most stupid of them all.

My god, this woman should have &quot;Oh, what a tangled web we weave...&quot; tattooed on her forehead. She tells a never-ending series of ear-shattering whoppers about her non-existent boyfriend Dominic, her equally non-existent boyfriend Ace, and her ex-boyfriend Kit. She lies to her roommate, her parents, her sister, Josh, the guy she hires from an escort service to play Dominic, to Kit, her ex-, and to every major and minor character who crosses her path, with the sole exception of Tamara, who finds her out, and to whom she spills her lying guts, and to the real Dominic, who doesn't really count, because she never calls after he leaves a message on her machine. The whole plot of this book is strung on a web of lies so thick it stops being a tightrope and becomes more like a mine field of explosive and conflicting prevarication, you can't even explain it without becoming hopelessly mired in the muck yourself.The worst part is, she doesn't learn her lesson, even after the big truth explosion. Nope, Sophy just feels miserable for a while, then tosses out more lies and just weaves new traps for herself. Despite the pathological lying and the prerequisite Bridgett Jones weight obsession, however, Sophy does manage to get herself her own \\"happily ever after.\\"In some inexplicable way, however, I'd have to say I liked the book. The plot was well-constructed, and the characters were convincing. I even connected with Sophy in the rare moments when I wasn't yelling at her to just tell the truth for once. I'd say, buy it, but beware."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I could not put this book down - usually a good thing. It WAS interesting and I enjoyed it...for the most part.But after I was done with it the flaws in it really stood out even more.The main character, Sophy, is just really bitchy to the man she says she likes (Josh, aka the faux Dominic). I don't see how he could fall for her when she is sniping at him all the time.Plus, as another reviewer mentioned, Josh's character is very underdeveloped. We don't get a sense of \\"who\\" he really is.All of Sophy's lies were just over the top and came to be almost unbearable to read about. You just wanted to shout at her to \\"Tell the truth already!\\" And again, how could a man fall for someone who is so wrapped up in her own lies??? It was so unbelieveable. Sophy was almost unredeemable as a likeable character. And on top of that, she obsessed constantly about what she thought Josh was thinking instead of ever actually coming right out and asking him. (And of course, to further the story she was wrong every time.) I guess that is what one gets for ASSUMING things in the first place!I don't know whether to recommend this book to you or not. I'd say if you are really that concerned that you won't like it, just borrow it from the library or a friend."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"&quot;Asking For Trouble&quot; deals with Sophy who invented a boyfriend named Dominic Walsh just to satisfy her mother and to keep her from badgering her about getting a boyfriend. The lie soon got out of hand as her sister, Belinda will be getting married and everyone is looking forward to see &quot;Dominic.&quot; Out of desperation, Sophy hired someone from the escort agency to accompany her to the wedding and of course, to pretend to be &quot;Dominic.&quot; As Sophy spent more time with this guy, Josh, from the agency, she can't but felt attracted to him. Her family adored Josh and he did a great job in acting out the &quot;Dominic&quot; role. Before long, Sophy realized that she was in a mess as she had to tell more lies to cover up her original lie.The secondary characters in this book were very well-developed. Sophy's family was very much part of the storyline as they were integral in bringing Sophy and Josh together. It is very much a &quot;family drama&quot; type book. The storyline is no doubt predictable and not exactly original but it is still very fun to read as the plots are well-written and quite funny. Some readers might not like Sophy as she can be quite neurotic especially around Josh. This is also not one of those books that you start reading and immediately drawn to the plot and characters. But as you continue, you will get more absorbed in the plot."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Debra Messing and Dermot Mulroney were \\"Kat\\" and \\"Nick\\".Yes,Duplicitous Is a great word to describe Why \\"Kat\\" in the film did what she believed forced to Follow through.By not keeping the same names as the characters in book and tweeking readers into \\"false\\" feelings of the same book to film is not my cup o' tea.The film,based on this book is a \\"bit o' crack\\".{Fun for those not knowing the British slang}.Film is witty,a great Supporting Cast w/Holland Taylor,Amy Adams and a slew of British Actresses&Actors many will recognise and Delight in trying to recall where they were seen and what Film{s}.Glad I read review prior to purchase of Book.Film is a more even easy to follow Reasoning of Events.Top Notch and Own the Film..."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Saw the film The wedding date, which I greatly enjoyed, especially Dermot Mulroney, and was anxious to buy book film was based on i.e. Asking for Trouble. Found the book a load of rubbish with very little to do with the film."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"very slow reading unless your english and know the slang. I found it not very funny at all and would not recommend this book if your looking for an up lifting read. Love Amazon though and the way everything was handled but the book I found boring."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"This is the first time that I think the movie was better than the book. That is disappointing to say since the book usually have more details."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I bought this book after seing the wonderful movie for the 6th or 7th time. I was waiting expectantly for it to arrive from amazon only to get disappointed soon... As all previews reviews have stated, the only similarity between the book and the movie is that a single girl hires an escort to act as her boyfriend at her sister's marriage somewhere in england and they fall in love.For one I prefered the storyline I saw on the screen (but that's a personal preference). But what I seriously disliked is the way the writer expressed herself. It just seemed as if she was trying too hard. Trying to hard to appear modern, hip, fun and empathetic to those overweight girls outhere, when judging by the book cover the writer is neither young/modern or overweight. The result being all those abbreviations that drove most people nuts -I seriously doubt that if I go any party/bar and ask for a V&T; everyone is guaranteed to understand what I mean- and the overuse (or perhaps abuse) of the words cow, pig, piglet. It seemed more like a lack of imagination or creativity than modernism to me. The dialogues didn't flow effortlessly, the humour was rather forced than witty (i.e. Josh:I like curvy women; Sophy: you're calling me fat???).In short: nice idea, bad writing style. A good editor could have erased all those \\"cows\\" and upgraded it to a 4 star rating. Not a bad read, I did finish it in 4-5 days which is soon when you have a work and 2 small kids, but felt like a waste of time afterwards. I just don't think anyone is likely to sympathize with Sophy or her family while reading this book. And when I don't care for the protagonists, it usually means I don't care for the book as well.For those of you who are new to chick lit; there are better authors out there. Shophie Kinsella, Marian Keyes, Jill Mansell, Emily Giffin are a good start."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book. I read it in 3 days! The movie didn't do it justice!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I usually stick to such kinds of books... light, easy-to-read and fun.And I must confess I had a good laugh with this one.Of course it is difficult not to remind you of similar books (like Bridget Jones and the like) but somehow Sophie manages to be cool the same time she is desperate for a man.She manages to remain decent and not at all pathetic. She handles her private \\"drama\\" very subtly, mostly because she thinks she is a lost case.And the whole scenario-setup is quite intelligent.A nice-to-read book.Can be \\"eaten-up\\" in 1 day!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"When I first picked this up I was enticed by the cover more then the summary. A story about a nearly 30 English girl who fabricates boyfriends for her mothers benefit was not my cup of tea. As I read further into it, Sophy's &quot;wobbly bits&quot; became endearing and I had a sudden interest in learning more about what this unusual character had to share. Although I enjoyed the often witty banter between her and her british buddies, I felt the story line was weak and predictible. If you want a quick read that provides no real surprises and an ending even your dog could guess, order this book right now!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"The way the storyline played itself out over a short time period really pointed out how Sophy, the main character, was stressed out about her sister's wedding and her need to please her mother. This book was enjoyable and keeps you wanting for more. The ending was a bit predictable, but it does have a nice surprise twist in the end. All in all it was a fun book to read and will make sure to read more of Elizabeth Young's books."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"As the book unfolds Sophy becomes a more complex character. Ther reasons for her need to rearrange the truth become more clear as the story progresses. As a reader you will want the best for her. And in the end, she gets it as she turns into a woman strong enough to face the truth. A fast read that you won't want to put down."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I loved this book it kept you guessing. I liked the fact that the twists kept coming. It wasn't like one twist and everything happened as exepected. I read the last 200 pages on the last day. It just got to good. I was just amazed with how everything just kept developing. I could see this making a good movie. Just because so much happens. I'd go see it."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I beg to differ with the majority of reviewers here. I found this novel to be a chore to read. Unoriginal plot, witless dialogue, boring characters, predictable outcome -- I can name several more flaws that made this book such a bore. There are some cute moments in the story, but not enough to make it interesting. The heroine often wondered if hiring an escort to pass as an ex-boyfriend of hers at her sister's wedding made her desperate. I think we all know the answer to that! I do not want to discourage others from reading this book -- after all, just because I found it boring doesn't mean others will..."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Sophy Metcalfe is in a bit of a predicament. She has told her family that she is involved with the perfect man - Dominic. Now she and Dominic are invited to attend her sisters wedding, the catch THERE IS NO DOMINIC!! Now, forced to come up with a plan Sophy's roommate suggests she hire and escort....Enter Josh, the perfect Dominic. Although Sophy is nervous she hires Josh to be Dominic. He attends the wedding with her acting perfectly, and while Sophy is always a bit nervous when he touches they pull off the lie... but the wedding is an entire weekend affiar so they have tons of time to get to know each other. Sophy is uptight at first but little does she know super cool Josh is nervous as well...This books is so fun. Sophy is a riot... what has she gotten herself into!? The entire situation is so funny you'll love it. Young is excellent at character development.The new movie \\"The Wedding Date\\" with Debra Messing is ROUGHLY based on this novel. I was dissappointed with the movie but I LOVED the book. There are many differences in the book and not just sublties, many of the differences are huge."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I agree with one reviewer when she recognized right off that she didn't like the female lead. I thought she was nasty, didn't have a sense of humor and another thing, why would Josh like her? She completely spent most of the first part of the book whinning about not having someone to take to the wedding, then the second half of the book whinning about taking Josh. Somehow I feel sorry for Josh's kids if he were to marry the whinning heroine of this book. I skipped through most of the second half and read the end. Don't waste the time or money on this book. Also have read this author's first book, and felt the same. Gave this a second chance because the story sounded fun...it wasn't...what a shame."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I read it after watching the movie. They were very close in proximity.It was good reading for a rainy day. Good for relaxing and some laughs."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"What is one to do when one has lied to one's mother? Lie some more, of course! And that is just what Sophy does.Sophy is a 30ish Brit chick who has lied herself into a pickle. She has promised her guilt-tripping mother that she will bring her beau to little sister's wedding. The problem is that her beau was concocted falsely to appease dear Mother. So what does she do? She calls an escort service! And the reader takes a wild ride.There is little new about this plot. The storyline has been reworked many times. There is not a whole lot original about the characters. Sophy is a caricature of the other Bridget Jones clones currently on the market. Her love interest is so imperfectly perfect that it is is almost laughable. And yet, I enjoyed this book.Author Elizabeth Young may not be the most inventive of writers but, aside from a very s-l-o-w start, she maintains the reader's interest and throws in enough amusing twists and turns to send the story on its merry way. Especially enjoyable are the witty banter she writes between her characters.On the warning side, this book is very British. I hope I am not the only American who felt lost in some of Young's reference to British life and experience. Some Americans may feel a little lost at times. The editing is also spellcheck sloppy. It is too often obvious that some wrong words slipped through the editing process, thus confusing the prose. Lastly, the story starts very slowly. Those who stick with it are well-rewarded, but beware the slow start.Aside from those warnings, this is a good formula romantic comedy novel that, while somewhat heavy on profanity, refereshingly refrains from the graphic sexual description used by too many current authors. As a bonus for romance readers, it packs a delerious romantic punch near the end of the book. A nice read."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Elizabeth Young's first novel is a triumph, and a testament to the fun, stay-up-all-night indulgence of a good romantic story with real, endearing characters. In one six-hour stint I made it through to the end, but found myself going back three or four times to absorb the joy and laugh at her jokes.Asking for Trouble is a great read and great fun too. I can't wait for her next one!!!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I bought this book because the movie \\"Wedding Date\\" was a great \\"girly\\" Movie! And I love them!!! The book started a bit slow...maybe, I had to adjust to the British culture...but then I was soooo into it! At various points I was laughing very loudly!! A great fun book! I loved the banter and \\"Play\\" between Sophy and Josh. Can't wait to read another book by Elizabeth Young!!! And I'm passing the book along to my younger sister! She'll love it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I enjoyed the English charm and humor of this book. Sophy and Josh seemed so real, I could relate and understand everything they did. Elizabeth gave her characters a lot of life and freshness. This book is not at all like the movie at all, its better!enjoy!!!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"This novel suprised me.The back jacket summarization sounded corny and completely [dumb], but when I started reading the book i came to a few conclusions:1. Sophy is an every-day girl. Too many books in this genre seem to keep making the main protagist a 'perfect' woman physically with just a [messed] up life. Sophy doesn't fit the that catagory and happily talks about her chubbiness.2. She's in her 30s. Again, too many books seem to concentrate on '20 somethings' as if 30somethings didn't exist.3. All the little plots and twists and turns are finished at the end with no dangles. Good because it answers everything, bad because it doesn't leave room for more.The main complaint in this genre is that many of the authors are British and do tend to use British jargon in their books. Such as American jargon would seem silly for a Brit to use to appease American readers, it is equally silly for an American to use Brit jargon just to appease European readers. Seeing as those who complain have access to the web, either look up a British Jargon website as there are many, or figure out what they mean, as most of them are self-explanatory . If the sentence \\"She is pushing a trolley in the supermarket\\" doesn't clue you in that she is pushing a shopping cart, either you are being intentionally daft or you are just plain stupid.Bottom line: Cute, somewhat more realistic and down to earth than most in this genre, good writing, great read."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I'm surprised that this book has gotten so many stars so far. I thought it was terrible. The main character of the book, Sophy, was so irritating. She's a bitter and angry person which I found absolutely annoying. I'm surprised Josh found her remotely interesting. The story in the end was a bit over the top, too unrealistic and stupid. Another thing that bothered me were the acronyms that the author used. They were too unclear and not easy to understand. It was a waste of time reading this book. I'm surprised I even made it to the end."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I highly enjoyed the snarky narration and the British slang. The only trouble I had was with an occasional abbreviations or cultural references. As in many books, most of the 'mess' in this book could be avoided by communicating honestly, not to mention a boost in the self-confidence department. The main character is teeming with paranoia but, luckily for her, all of her lies don't completely ruin her life."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"As an English as second language reader, this book is simple and easy to read. Elisabeth Young really presents a simple, enjoyable and can not wait to the end book.I have seen the movie, and I think contain between movie and book are not the same. However, both have own attention point.I bought the book because I have seen the movie earlier.For me, I still prefer the movie. Maybe if I read the book first, my opinion can be different."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I was disappointed with this book. The main character, Sophy, described herself as &quot;not a doormat&quot;, yet why is it then that she can't stand up to her own mother? Oh, I know...then there would be no premise for this far-fetched story. If she did have a backbone, she could have easily told her mum that she didn't have a boyfriend and that suited her perfectly well, thank you. Instead we find a woman (little girl, more like) who builds lie upon lie to appease her mum's fragile sensibilities, and are expected to believe that any man hired to be her date would find that incredibly attractive. Not likely. I might also add that it is not likely that he was won over by the way she constantly &quot;hissed&quot; at him, though perhaps he had a masochistic side that we were not privvy to. As a matter of fact, that would explain an awful lot. Like why he was always so eager to help her whenever she needed a hand after their &quot;date&quot; was over. I didn't know paid escorts cared so much. And why he was always the prince among men. I found little that I could dislike about him, which I think one would be able to in any well-rounded character. Although I'm a sucker for romance, there was little romance to be found. It seemed to be formulaicly tossed in throughout the story more through obligation than necessity. Most of their attraction took place in Sophy's mind, and that was mostly the &quot;he's so cute&quot; variety. Old flames seemed to pop conveniently out of the woodwork at just the right (or is it wrong) time. The more I read, the more contrived the story seemed. If you don't mind reading a story that could not believably take place with charcters as flat as the pages, this book might be right up your alley."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Oh boy! Where to begin?! As entertaining as this book was, it was full of overblown and downright crazy lies! If you don't mind spending several days wrapped up in lie after lie, then this is *the* book for you.The main character, Sophie, was one of the most hard to like characters out there. She had *just slap me* written all over her. Quite annoying, she was! From what I gather, she wasn't a happy person and was quite the frump. Josh, her lie and love interest, was a confusing character. I even had a tough time trying to make out what his real feelings were. I felt like I was guessing through most of the book. The end results just didn't match up to how his character acted throughout the book, in my opinion. Tricky, if you ask me.I also was kinda bothered by the fact that too much emphasis was put on Belinda (Sophy's sister) and her troubles. I felt that entire hoopla wasn't really important to the plot. It overpowered the situation, in my opinion. For about half of the book, I was wondering if Belinda was the main character. I know that she wasn't but my point is, I almost felt like I was reading 2 stories in 1 and they just didn't mesh all that well for me.As you see, Asking for Trouble wasn't a *hit* for me."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I just can't believe that another reviewer considered this book to be a poor imitation of Bridget Jones's Diary. Asking for Trouble is incomparably better and funnier than anything Helen Fielding has ever churned out. Every page sparkles with humor and wit; there is wonderful chemistry between the hero and heroine; and all the secondary characters are marvelously drawn, esp. Sophy's housemates and her loving but intrusive mother. Elizabeth Young's novels are a real antidote to all the silly, fashion-obsessed, poorly-written dross out there in the world of chicklit."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"well, i was pretty disappointed for the first 300 pages or so. then, i couldn't put the book down. it was very slow at first with a very wordy dialogue. however, when i got through about 3/4's of the book, it picked up like a whirlwind and proved to be a lot of fun and worth trudging through til the end.sophy started with a simple &quot;fib&quot; to keep her mum happy.....and then it spiraled out of control. she couldn't stop the charade and it finally stopped her. it was a bit much with all of the sidestepping she and josh did throughout(for a LONG time). i was happy with the last 1/4 of the plot. the ending made it fun.her sister, belinda, had a great twist. and......blood is thicker than water.don't let the slow, wordy beginning stop you from finishing this read."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"you'll probably like this book. I've read lots of the Bridget-esque books, and this is my favorite so far. Likable characters and a kooky plot .... a fun read!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Excellent novel - thoroughly enjoyed it however it definitely was not as per the movie - The Wedding Date - on which the movie was based. Bit disappointed in that respect however was a good book. It would appear however that I now have to purchase another book to get the Wedding Date movie book"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"So this book is about a thirty-year-old Sophie. She is not married, does not have a boyfriend, so she sort of ends up inventing one. It starts out as a little white lie to her mother. But then her parents starts asking her to bring him to meet them! By various discussions she finally gives in and promises to bring her \\"Dominic\\" to her sisters wedding so she hires a man from an escort agency to play this Dominic she has invented. You might guess that not everything goes as planned..but how it turns out, you'll have to find out yourself!Liked the beginning a lot, thought it was funny. Liked the end bit as well. In the middle there was maybe a part too long where I kept waiting for something to happen, or something more. Don't get me wrong it was not bad or anything. I would have given 3,5 stars if possible, maybe. Well anyway ended up with four stars. It made me smile a lot, laugh a little as well. Quite easy to read. At some parts I felt glued to the book for wanting to read and read and read. But it did not last for the whole book (not the middle). Light reading, fitted perfectly for a summer read for me. Just what I needed right now! In the end there were some pretty electric moments between two characters that I quite enjoyed! So nothing special, but enjoyable, a light and easy read."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Sophy Metcalfe tells a lie to her family about her non-existent boyfriend - Dominic.Her sister, Belinda, is getting married. So of course Sophy has to conjure up this made up boyfriend. She then hires an escort through a friend. Josh Carmichael is more than he seems as an escort server.Young's writing and humor is quite good. I've read this book too many times to count. The romance and interaction is both light and cute.The only downside was Sophy's self-esteem. She complained too much about her being overweight it even made the Hero annoyed."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"A good book, recommendable for a lazy summer day. I couldn't put it down - if only to find out what the next plot twist would be. At times its a little much, but as it is a entertainment only type book it does its job quite well."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I really got involved with the characters in this book and when I only had 80 pages left to read, I couldn't put it down to get to bed on time! I look forward to seeing the movie, The Wedding Date, which is based on this book."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"This is a poor knockoff of Bridget Jones."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"this book is fabulous! it's hilarious and the heroine is not your usual dasmel in distress, she's ver easy to relate to. the plot is fantastic and pulls off a happy ending without being corny! i love this book!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I bought this book for two reasons. The first reason was because of the main character: a pleasantly average, size 13 femme named Sophy. Sophy is an independent, (seemingly) intelligent woman who also gives the impression that she is very comfortable with her feminine sexuality. (No shy blossoms here!) All of these factors seem to make for a superb HEROine, right? Well, what kind of fun is it when every five lines she's whining about her \\"wobbly bits\\"?!? Also, even though the story is centered on the one major lie (i.e., \\"I have no boyfried so I'll make one up and hire an escort to play pretend in order to appease Mom\\"), Sophy begins to pile on lie after lie after lie! Reading about her trying to sort through all of her fibs and keep her truth from her fiction just makes you feel sorry for the girl. And I don't mean \\"She-Just-Spilled-Wine-On-Her-White-Dress\\" Sorry, I mean \\"Look-At-Those-Poor-Starving-Kids-Living-In-Squalor\\" Sorry. As the previous reviewer said, it's outright pathetic!Another reason I bought this book was because I though it would be funny. The only two characters I actually liked, Alix and Ace, were rarely on the page long enough for me to enjoy their presence. Those two weren't exactly hilarious, mind you, but they were more tolerable than Sophy's whining.When I wasn't feeling the need to reach into the book and shake some sense into Sophy, I was too busy trying to convert UK to US slang. I imagine reading this book would be akin to someone outside of the US reading a book filled with phrases like \\"bling-bling\\", \\"metrosexual\\", and \\"hizz-ouse.\\" Fo'shizzle...It was that bad. Maybe this book just wasn't intended for a universal audience. At any rate, one would need to be fairly familiar with the culture of our friends from across the pond in order to fully comprehend what is going on the story.Until next time...Angel H.P.S. Will someone please tell me what on earth is a \\"prat\\"???"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"This is the first \\"Chick Lit\\" book I ever read... and now I have read it 5 times! I absolutely love it, and it has hooked me on chick lit FOREVER! The heroine is hilarious! I love how she overanalyzes everything... women everywhere do. The plot is origional and has some very good twists.This is the book that I hold all other up to and think, \\"Will I have close to as much fun as when I read 'Asking for Trouble'?\\""},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"The book was okay, but I really loved the movie. There are major differences in the book that completely change the tone. First of all, she's British and more closely resembles Bridget Jones than her movie counterpart. You see a lot more of her friends in the novel.Also, she seems thoroghly preoccupied with her weight. She is not described to look anything like Debra Messing, but rather an overweight \\"squishy\\" girl, which is completely fine, but it is not fun to read abotu her obsessing about her weight while downing a box of chocolate cigarettes.The writer is British, I believe, so it has more of the British slang, which at first is a little confusing. It's not Thackeray, mind you, but don't expect any American tones.Their relationship is more drawn out, which is fun to read.Still, what I remember most was how we envision all the characters (Domonic included) as a little chunky. They aren't size 0 models, we get it! Now get over it!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I picked up this book thinking it would be a light, easy, enjoyable read. I have to admit at times it was all of those things, but other times this book was quite annoying. The author often uses British jargon and random sorts of acronyms such as \\"STM\\" that I found extremely annoying and completely random. I was never a fan of the whole \\"Bridget Jones\\" thing and maybe that's why all of these reviewers who liked Bridget Jones also liked this book. I will admit that overall, the story was kind of cute, but I really wouldn't have minded if it was about 150 pages shorter. Furthermore, I have read many incredible books and by NO MEANS would I rate this book 4 1/2 stars on average. I guess that you have to take it for what it's worth, which is a light-hearted read, but also keep in mind that at times, the main character seemed somewhat pathetic to me and unlike other readers of this book, I could not wait for it to end so I could start something better."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I had to write in response to the reveiwer of 2002 who found the book tiresome. Not true! Yes, the plot is simple and perhaps even overdone, but you don't read the back and think you're getting anything super original.If you're looking for a fun summer read, pick up this book! Sophy is a great character...self-effacing and lovable."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Although this isn't a book that will really make you think, it is very intertaining and funny. If you like authors such as Jane Green, I think you would like this too. A cute book, read it in less than a day :)"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"While the book was somewhat difficult to get into initially- I found myself unable to put it down half way through. Young's description of Sophy's mother is absolutely perfect and is as clear and real as listening to my own mother over the phone. The ending was unexpected- yet she seemed to gloss over the details a bit. There was some real potential for certain events mentioned earlier in the book (i.e. Maggie's married daughter's marital issues) to progress into a more complex story line- this never happened to my dismay... I would have to say A Promising Man was more gripping- but the mother made this book come alive. Definately worth a read."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Cute book, will be looking for other books by this author. Nice, easy, quick, hilarious read. Quirky British slang throughout. V. Bridget Jones Diaryesque."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"&quot;Asking for Trouble&quot; is a very entertaining book. I loved the main plot idea, i.e., Sophy needs a date for her sister's wedding, so she hires an escort. Hasn't every single woman at some time wished that she could show up at a big event with a gorgeous, adoring man on her arms? Sophy's people are suitably impressed, to the point where she needs to bring the hunk back again and again: one white lie breeds another. However, the novel is predictable. I suppose that novels of this genre will never end with unrequited love. That fantasy is probably part of the reason we like them so much."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I just wanted to correct part of a review that I submitted for Asking for Trouble. The other excellent book by Elizabeth Young is &quot;Fair Game&quot;, soon to be released under a revised title of &quot;A Promising Man and About Time Too&quot;. Asking for Trouble is by Victoria Corby (and very good too!)"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I'm so glad that Elizabeth Young is finally published here in the US. She's a wonderful and witty writer, writing romantic comedy with the best of them. It's NOT Bridget Jones all over (not that I didn't love BJ). This is pure Lombard/Gable stuff, with witty dialog and funky plot twists.... Sophy is every woman - she just wants to make her family happy and keep herself on track with her career and just happens to need a date for her Perfect Sister's wedding. (OK, I am getting a bit tired of the perfect sister clich&eacute;, but at least Sophy does love her sister and doesn't hate her mother.) Josh is just wonderfully written as a guy who seems too normal to be an escort (he is!) and the auxiliary characters really move the story along. ..."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I usually stick to the authors I know, afraid to spend the money on someone I'm unfamiliar with, but this was a great read! I read it in one day. I just could not put it down. Let my mother borrow it and she loved it too. No comparison to Bridget Jones, much much better. I'd love to find more fun books from Elizabeth Young!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"This book was fantastic, I stayed up way past my bedtime and spent the next day bleary eyed at my desk! But it was very worth it. The main character Sophy is every girl's girl, in that I could relate to all her hang ups about men and her body. I felt I was going through every thing right along with her. Again, great book and very fun reading. Elizabeth Young is spot on!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Plain good fun. Definetly worth buying and reading. A feel-good read."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I adored this book. It had me laughing and frustrated and I never wanted to put it down. I loved the characters and how vivid their surroundings were. I was quickly brought into Sophy's world and was just as curious about Josh as she was. She was a lovely character, quite real and I found I had things in common with her, which is a plus in a novel. Elizabeth Young had a certain knack for modern romance with humorous twists. In the end it left me sad to put the book down...for good???A great summer read that'll have you laughing out loud."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Great book! It made me go out and buy all Elizabeth Young's other novels. I have reread them all waiting impatiently for the next one to come out! I love the humour and the personalities. The best of the Brits - I think."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"What a cute and funny book to read. I watched the movie first and knew that the book must be much better, so I ordered the book. It was quite different from the movie and much better actually, very enjoyable light reading."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"This was my first read by Elizabeth Young. Really enjoyed it. There's way more to the story than what was in the movie, the Wedding Date. But hey, let's not discount that scene against the car with Dermot Mulroney. As soon as I get a chance I will read another Elizabeth Young book."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I read this long before it was thought to be a movie - so sight unseen (the movie that is), a great read and seriously funny! MUST READ FIRST and hopefully, you and I won't be disappointed by the movie as I know it can't get the entire point across!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"In Asking for Trouble, we are introduced to the main character, Sophy. Sophy is a 30-something Londoner who has created an entirely fictional boyfriend named \\"Dominic\\" to keep her nagging mother happy. The trouble arises when Sophy's younger sister gets married and Sophy must bring the fictitious \\"Dominic\\" as her date. The very desperate Sophy hires an escort to pretend to be Dominic for the wedding and that's just where the trouble begins!This book was too funny. Sophy gets herself in a really big mess with the fictional boyfriend. I laughed out loud at some of the situations that arise and could see myself doing something so hair-brained. The book was extremely entertaining and I would recommend it to any lover of \\"Chick Lit.\\""},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I read this book in the summer of 2003, and enjoyed it so much I had to read it again! Say what you want about the genre getting old, if you like to laugh out loud and enjoy reading about screwy-but-smart characters who get their happy endings, this is book you will enjoy!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"First, I need to say that this book was quite funny! I laughed out loud more than a few times, but honestly, it was a bit verbose and slow-moving for the first 100 pages.Sophy Metcalfe did not just tell one little lie; she allowed this one elaborate lie to just escalate to unbelievable proportions! Although it was fun to see her get tangled in this mess, at times I felt like it was all a bit too much. It was a stretch that she was able to not only continue the initial lie for so long, but build on it until it was almost to slapstick/sitcom levels of humor.I enjoyed this book overall, but I think it could have been even better with a bit more character development of Josh. I wanted to feel giddy and excited about him too (like Sophy), but I didn't have an opportunity to get to know him well enough.I'd recommend this book as a good summer read, but with one piece of advice--don't give up too soon when reading it. The pace picks up midway and the storyline does improve greatly."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Lately I've been on a chick lit binge, and after getting this book from the library, devoured it over the past couple days. The strong, conversational narrative hooked me from the start.One thing I didn't like, though, is that the author uses the second person (i.e. \\"you\\") at times. It was like the main character, Sophy, was stepping out of her story for a moment to point a finger and say, \\"Hey, are you getting this?\\" Also, it was a bit disconcerting that Sophy kept mentioning wanting to commit suicide, even if it was supposed to be a joke. I think she must've said she wanted to stick her head in the gas oven or eat broken glass or drink herself to death about a dozen times.And what I still don't understand is, why does Josh (the hero) even fancy Sophy? She only spent a few days with him, and spent most of the time either yelling at him, dragging him into family messes, or being nervous and jittery. I don't think having the main characters constantly fight is a good source of conflict. It got tedious because it only brought out Sophy's immaturity, and Josh's extreme, almost saint-like patience in the face of dealing with an underconfident, extremely neurotic, jealous woman. How many guys would actually put up with this behavior from a self-obsessed stranger they just met? Wouldn't they get a big headache and run screaming in the opposite direction? Lust might be explained as the motivation, but it still doesn't make sense that he would go to all that trouble when she keeps pushing him away.I love rom-com and screwball comedies, but this isn't anything like \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" with Cary Grant (calming force) and Katharine Hepburn (always getting into trouble). The difference is that Sophy's character is somewhat less sympathetic. She can be mean and grouchy and of course is a big liar, so in the end, I'm wondering if she really does deserve this great guy.Overall, the story was entertaining and the writing was sound, but the characterization and narrative left something to be desired. And yes, as other reviewers mentioned, there is a lot of British slang. Since I'm a big Anglophile, I enjoyed trying to decipher it, but other people might find it distracting. I do think this book is worth reading if you love chick lit and rom coms, but if you're looking for a protagonist who is as charming and optimistic as Bridget Jones, Sophy Metcalfe may not be your gal."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"The first few chapters of this book are a bit daunting but worth getting through! This actually turned into a quick read just as I was about to give up on it. I thought that the story (and the twist at the end) was great. Some of the British slang can be tough to decipher but anyone who has read other books in this genre should be able to keep up with most of it. Overall, a fun read!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"1,000 words are not enough to describe how great this book is, but I'll give it a shot! While the blurb on the back sounded promising, I expected another post-Bridget Jones funny-yet-predictable novel.I bought it anyway, and was pleasantly surprised to find a well-written, fast-paced, and truly hilarious novel about a heroine I could really relate to. The book's tone is conversational, as if Sophy is your best girlfriend, and you're dishing over a couple of vodkas; as a result, I liked her and found myself waiting anxiously for the next plot twist to unfold.Even though Sophy's white lie(s) spin(s) wildly out of control, I didn't think the plot and its many twists were at all contrived or predictable. Sophy's character rang quite true to me, as did everyone else's.In the ever-expanding universe of contemporary women's fiction, I think this book is a breath of fresh air. While Sophy is no less charmingly neurotic than Bridget and her &quot;sisters,&quot; I feel that Sophy's character is deeper, a bit more developed, less breezy, and, as a result, more human. She acknowledges, and agonizes, over her faults, and seems to grow as a person through her experiences.The characters' relationships strike me as more complex and authentic than other novels, perhaps because of Ms. Young's attention to detail in crafting their mannerisms, speech, etc. She also creates a sense of history, in describing events and people from Sophy's childhood, which are traced to the present.Finally, the situations, dialogue and descriptions are often so unexpectedly funny that I laughed until I cried. I could not put this book down. You'll love it, too."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"After watching the movie \\"The Wedding Date\\", which is based upon this book, I felt like I'd missed something. It was a cute idea with amusing possibilities, but the movie was poorly executed. I figured I might as well give the book a shot. Usually books are better than movies, right?Over all, I preferred the movie. Aside from a few moments of laugh-out-loud humor, most of it is pretty dry and bland. It drags on and on, with a good 100 pages to even get to the wedding. After the wedding, the book just kind of meanders, as if the author realized she couldn't possibly make it convincing that these two are so infatuated with each other after one afternoon. She could have meandered to 1000 pages, and I still wouldn't be convinced.The book's biggest problem is the \\"heroine\\", Sophy. She is--as she often says herself--such a cow. Oh, and she's also fat.She's a raging b*tch towards Josh, who is technically doing her a rather nice favor, wouldn't you say? But she's constantly snippy with him, completely paranoid, and always assuming he thinks the worst about her. Plus, she lies on a consistent basis, especially to him. Yet he still likes her, despite all this...and despite the fact that she's fat.Any skinny, pretty woman is automatically a b*tch and a man-stealing cow. Maybe this is due to Sophy's fat-o-vision? Because of course, unlike those skinny pretty women, Sophy is too fat for a man to find her attractive. She's dead certain that as soon as someone a pound or two lighter walks onto the scene, Josh will be on them like white on rice. Isn't that lovely? But in spite of that, too, he still likes her. And despite the fact that she's fat.Are you sick of me stating that Sophy is fat? Is it getting on your nerves? Because if it is, then this book will make you want to tear your hair out. I've been overweight for the greater half of my life, and I have self-esteem issues, but unlike Sophy, my every thought does not center around my weight. Of course, I, at least, would be justified. How the hell does Sophy, with her 36C chest, qualify as fat? Seeing as how she's about 5'10\\", a 36 inch underbust is not even close to fat.Here's a little tip to the chick lit authors of the world: it's okay to make your herione overweight so long as you don't HARP ON ABOUT IT LIKE AN OBSESSIVE FREAK!Completely unsympathetic as a character, it's impossible to feel bad for anything Sophy goes through, as she tends to reap what she sows. And the utterly predictible ending was completely unbelievable. Lovely idea, completely wasted on a Heroine From Hell and a \\"plot\\" held together by bubblegum and elastic bands."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I really loved this book. If you're expecting the same story as in \\"The Wedding Date,\\" which was loosly based on this book, don't worry. You can enjoy both without any plot spoilers! Elizabeth Young makes you laugh out loud as you follow a \\"desperate\\" young woman on her quest for a decent date to her sister's wedding. There are twists and turns that all lead to belly laughs and deep sighs! What a great story!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I picked this book with a bit of hesitation but after the first few pages I was hooked and I absolutely loved this book. Sophy is the first character that I've read of that isn't 22 with a size six waist, a perfect family and the perfect little life and career. She's a realistic, 30 something, size 14 English girl trying to keep her parents, or mother, out of her love life so she tells her what she wants to hear. But I found myself laughing out loud with this one or just chuckling. It was highly enjoyable, I read over half the book in one night, and absolutely enjoyed every page. I couldn't put it down and once I was finished, I wanted to read it again. Yes, he ending was a bit predictable but all the same, it was still a wonderful book. I highly enjoyed it and look forward to other books by this author!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"A familiar voice on the BBC, Jasmine Hyde is the perfect actress to bring sassy, saucy, prevaricating Sophy Metcalfe to vivid life.

Whatever the title, it's fun.Sophy is a successful young career woman - according to her mother the operative word here is single woman. Mom will give her no peace until she puts that Mrs. in front of her name. So, to get a little breathing room Sophy invents a suitor, Dominic, who is, of course, everything her mother could ever long for in a son-in-law.

She hires a date for the wedding from an escort service, which doesn't turn out to be such a bad idea after all. But, there are lots of twists and turns in this road to romance, thanks to Sophy's predilection for falsehoods.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"What an absolutely fantastic fun read. This story reminds me of a cross between Bridget Jones and the Shopaholic series in its humor. I laughed out loud at the way things progressed through the story. It also shows how sometimes one little white lie can turn into a huge white elephant. What happens when you tell your mother you have a fabulous boyfriend that doesn't exist and you have to produce him? Well Sophy (with a Y not an IE) hires one but, ack she is actually really attracted to him and this has her confused. There are a couple of other story lines running through also.

When I heard it was based on a book, I went out and bought it right away!I loved this book just as much as the movie! It wasn't anything like the movie except for the hiring-an-escort-to-take-to-your-sister's-wedding part. Their were other great characters and a lot of funny moments. When you are a busy mom like me with a stressful job, its nice to escape into a light-hearted story like this one."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I love all Elizabeth Young's books and this was no exception. A previous review clearly doesn't agree with the majority and asks 'what is a part?'. A prat is a stupid person - which pretty much speaks for itself! It is a shame if you don't enjoy books written in English - in the UK we often have to put up with books written in 'American' with phrases we don't understand. It doesn't detract from the enjoyment of a fun and well-written book. I hope disappointing reviews and problems over language differences do not put anyone else off reading what is a really good read."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Ask for this one by name! It's a witty romp of a tale revolving around the main character, Sophy. Sophy's a 30year old singleton who makes up a boyfriend to please her mother. Her foibles and wacky antics from that point on will keep you captivated til the last page. One lie leads to another in a domino effect and after a while even Sophy can't keep track of her lies. This tale is a quick, predictable read, but it's enjoyable. It's the perfect 'vacation/going to the beach' book."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"&quot;Asking For Trouble&quot; deals with Sophy who invented a boyfriend named Dominic Walsh just to satisfy her mother and to keep her from badgering her about getting a boyfriend. The lie soon got out of hand as her sister, Belinda will be getting married and everyone is looking forward to see &quot;Dominic.&quot; Out of desperation, Sophy hired someone from the escort agency to accompany her to the wedding and of course, to pretend to be &quot;Dominic.&quot; As Sophy spent more time with this guy, Josh, from the agency, she can't but felt attracted to him. Her family adored Josh and he did a great job in acting out the &quot;Dominic&quot; role. Before long, Sophy realized that she was in a mess as she had to tell more lies to cover up her original lie.The secondary characters in this book were very well-developed. Sophy's family was very much part of the storyline as they were integral in bringing Sophy and Josh together. It is very much a &quot;family drama&quot; type book. The storyline is no doubt predictable and not exactly original but it is still very fun to read as the plots are well-written and quite funny. Some readers might not like Sophy as she can be quite neurotic especially around Josh. This is also not one of those books that when you start reading you will be immediately drawn to the plot and characters. Instead, as you read more, you will get more interested in Sophy's life and how everything turns out."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I loved this book! The storyline was so original but the characters so lovable. I had to force myself not to read it all at once so that I can savor the delight of reading it longer!!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Asking for Trouble is an amazing book with humor, love, and lies tangled together. It all starts with a simple little lie by the main character, Sophe. That one little lie, however, isn't enough because that lie soon begins to multiply. Soon, Sophe is so in-over-her-head in lies that she has to stop and start telling the truth.This book is so easy to relate to and teaches us that if you tell somebody one little lie, then you will start telling more and more. It teaches us that lying never gets anybody anywhere, and the truth is much better.This book is so good and intriging that you won't be able to put it down, and I garentee that you won't be bored for one second!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"\\"Asking for Trouble\\" is a wonderful read.

What woman pushing 30 wouldn't get her mother off her back by inventing the perfect man?I laughed out loud at this book several times ... even when I wasn't alone in the room. The chemistery that develops between Sophy and Josh is so good, you can't help but fall in and hope for more even after reading the last page. If Elizabeth Young ever sees this, please write another book soon. Three is not enough."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I purchased this book after seeing that it received some great reviews from other Amazon customers. Basically, I did not enjoy the book very much. I found the main character, Sophy, to be annoying. She appeared to be sloppy, bitchy and the constant mention of her \\"wobbly bits\\" made me sick to my stomach. The escort/love interest charcter Josh/Dominic was very underdeveloped, as was the \\"best friend\\" character of Alix.The book was very slow until the last few chapters when it finally got interesting. I spent a lazy weekend in my apt reading this book. It was a quick read, but I got the feeling that at any point I could just toss it aside and not give a crap about what happened to any of the characters."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Okay, I had high hopes for this book because almost all the reviews were totally glowing. But this is one of my least favorite books. For me, this was a book that I had to hurry up and read because I wanted it to be over. The book was terribly dissapointing to me because it committed the worst book sin of all...I hated the main character. I did not like her at all. I didn't think she deserved to be happy, and I was actually disappointed with the happy ending. I don't see how anyone could love this book so much, I think the main character is a total witch, and I wasn't pulling for her at all, which totally ruins a book no matter how good it may otherwise be, not that this book has anything else going for it. Having said that, please dont waste your time with this awful book. I seriously did not like the book and I can't be the only one...so please take a chance on another book, just don't waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I read this book because it was recommended by a book cataloge that I highly respect, but now I wonder if they even bothered to read it themselves. The main character annoyed me from start to finish, the \\"love interest\\" seemed anything but interested, and the plot was just a drawn out version of a million sit-com and romantic comedy story-lines. I found myself skipping whole pages toward the end, just to get through Sophy's uptight, self loathing rants and boring repetition.The book was mildly funny, and I enjoyed the British Colour (although I must admit to not understanding half of it), thus the three stars. I would recommend it as a light beach read."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I started reading the book at 9pm lastnight and stayed up until 530 am when I finished it. I could not put it down. I kept telling myself that I would just finish one more chapter then go to bed. I one more chaptered myself to the end. Sophy could have been me or anyone of my friends with her insecurities and typical girl body issues. I kept shaking my head with some of the thoughts about herself and thinking my god I have felt that way more than once around a man. Maybe because I read this book coming off of a few contemporary romance novels I would have only changed the ending bit. Or I at least wished that the authour had an epilogue. I wasn't ready to give up on the characters and wished there was a bit more. But all in all this was a fun read and well worth the purchase."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Sophy Metcalfe's mother has a 1950's mentality; she wants Sophy to marry. Without building on the relationship between mother and daughter, Ms. Young, the author, weaves her story.Sophy finds Josh Carmichael aka \\"Dominic\\" from an escort service. To appease her mother, she passes him off as her beloved. What unfolds is all too predictable. This might not have been a dreadful book if it wasn't so reminiscent of Bridgette Jones' Diary. Bridgette had a weight problem; Sophy has a weight problem. Bridgette craves cigarettes (\\"fags\\"); Sophy craves cigarettes (\\"fags\\"). Bridgette is jilted by her former lover; Sophy is jilted by her former lover.What is missing is originality and prose so witty, we can't stop laughing. If you're looking for a refreshingly comical novel, this isn't it. Re-read either of the two Bridgette novels or try Susan Elizabeth Phillips for a true romantic comedy extravaganza."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I am so glad I ignored the bad reviews. The writing is witty, the families totally dysfunctional, the girls pleasingly flawed and the men appropriately 2-dimensional. All a great backdrop for a silly reverse-Pretty Woman kind of story. Sophy needs a gigolo to keep a lie going -- but she (sigh) falls for him! Can it be that he's really NOT what he seems? Will she learn to stop being so controlling so she can get a REAL man (who can tell HER what to do, for a change)? Will she ever be the perfect daughter her mother has guilted her into pretending to be? You get the picture...at first, though I laughed at the witty comments, I kept saying &quot;yeah, right&quot; in my head and almost put it down. After a while, though, as the plot thickened and the back-stabbing, bitchy one-upmanship began, it had me hooked. I did not stop til the last word. All I can say is -- thank God men aren't like this!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I think that the book is for pure comedy entertainment. For those who have had a bad day, or a stressful week, I recommend this book to help you relieve some of that tension, and bringing you laughs.

However, as you read further you will find her as a warm woman starving for love."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I thought that the book was very romantic, and had enough unexpected twists and turns to keep me up late reading it. I agree with some of the other reviewers that Sophy could get a tad annoying with her criminally low self-esteem, but she was for the most part a very real, flawed and funny character. If you like the Brit Chick genre, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"O.K. so she lied a little. Then she lied alot.

This is a very charming, fun chick lit romp and it stands alone on its own merits nicely. It's a funny story of crossed signals, good intentions, and witty romantic farce. No heavy reading here, but it's well done and I'd recommend it highly."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"If you've read Bridget Jones, Bridget Jones Edge of Reason and everything else by Olivia Fielding and are left wanting a bit more then you'll enjoy this book. Sophy Metcalf of \\"Asking for Trouble\\" and Bridget Jones could plausibly know one another,frequent some of the same pubs and bum a Silk Cut from one another in the Ladies'. However, if you want to relive Dermot Mulroney and Debra Messing's dreamy \\"Wedding Date\\" you're bound to be disappointed. Both the movie and the book are based on the same premise: A loveably neurotic heroine lies about having a wonderful boyfriend and rather than 'fess up, she hires a hot male escort to impress her family at her sister's wedding. That is where any similarities between the two stories part company. The names aren't even the same (Why does Hollywood DO that?!) But it is a light and fun read and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys big bottomed British girls who nervously indulge in alcohol, candy and cigarettes but get the cute guy at the end."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"A silly premise, a silly heroine and a predictable outcome. Nevertheless, I devoured this is one sitting. Vacuous books by British authors are so much better than those by American authors; I'm not sure if it's because British colloquialisms are so much more clever than American ones, or perhaps the heroines in their books are more likeable and easier to relate to. Whatever the reason, it would be diffucult to dislike this book as long as you're not expecting a classic work of literature and are just looking for some rainy-day escapism."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"By now we've all seen the trailers and TV spots for The Wedding Date. I haven't seen this movie, though it looks escapist enough to try and catch. What I have purchased is the book that the film is based upon, Asking for Trouble. This book has, of course, been repackaged under the new name The Wedding Date, but don't let that deter you. This novel is exceptionally written and a ton more laughs than the movie seems. Needless to say, Hollywood has changed so many areas of this story that it holds little resemblance to the novel.In the novel, main character Sophy is a \\"Bridget Jones\\" type character. A slightly overweight, quirky London resident living with two equally quirky flatmates. She is human and real. What she is not is Debra Messing. :-) Anyway, Sophy has made up a false boyfriend, with whom she is \\"practically engaged.\\" Sophy's mother is of the competitive sort, with her snobby next-door neighbor playing the role of rival. Sophy introducing the world (okay, her mother's circle of \\"friends\\") to her boyfriend would solidify her position as queen of the group.Needless to say, this is a story filled with things not being what they appear. This principle gives this story depth, because it is more realistic. How many times in life have we thought this ourselves?I also find it interesting that the main character's name is Sophy -- a derivative of Sophie which comes from the greek word for wisdom. This word was derived from Sophocles, an early philosopher. Sophy admittedly is not so wise (She's lying to everyone afterall); however, several key parts of the story are revealed through her thoughts and actions. This is most importantly a story about gaining wisdom of oneself. The author, Elizabeth Young, does an excellent job of revealing this to her readers.This novel was a page burner... I couldn't put it down. I definitely recommend this read. If you have seen the movie and came away dissatisfied, don't discount this novel! You'll find what was missing and so much more right between the black and white pages of The Wedding Date (aka: Asking for Trouble) by Elizabeth Young"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I admit it. I am addicted to romantic comedies, even when they let me down, like this one did. There is nothing wrong with Asking For Trouble, but there is nothing that distinguishes it either, save for the rather unique story. Instead of your generic girl meets boy and is interested in him, etc. story, Asking For Trouble offers the girl hires boy to act as boyfriend, etc. storyline. The humor is at best mildly amusing--there is nothing in here that is going to make you laugh out loud. Additionally, Sophy, the protagonist who hires Josh to impersonate her nonexistant boyfriend for a family wedding, is pretty annoying. She lies constantly and that behavior was frustrating to read about. Asking For Trouble is not, however, a bad novel. Elizabeth Young writes well and the story hangs together. There is just nothing terrific about it."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I was excited to find this book still available.

I remember feeling frustrated waiting for the plot to catch up with my imagination!I found there was far too much clunky dialogue which broke up the flow of the book. At times it felt like you were reading a manuscript, not a novel. Reading this took a real effort - I couldn't escape into her world and I found it hard to identify with the character at times. I would read three pages and then realise not one word had sunk in - never a good sign if you have to re-read.I found her references to childhood and reminiscing stories tedious and irrelevant! These did not add any depth to her character not were they even mildly amusing. Instead they dragged the plot and pace even further, filling even more pages with copious clunky dialogue.The book did improve in the last 30 pages when things finally started happening, but Bridget Jones this definitely ain't."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"This book was made into the movie \\"The Wedding Date\\" with Debra Messing as the delightfully sarcastic Sophy who has to produce a charming, successful, ideal boyfriend to show up with at the wedding of Sophy's \\"perfect\\" sister Belinda."},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"Although the book had its charming moments, it was too long. As I read I felt an increasing sense of dread about what Sophy was doing. It was almost painful to watch her lie constantly while digging herself an even bigger grave.

If you read the book before seeing the movie, you might be more impressed than I was, but overall I found it bland and very unbelievable. Watch the movie- it's a bit more understandable and a much better version!"},{"Title":"ASKING FOR TROUBLE","review":"I WANTED TO ORDER THE SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS MOVIE BUT I COULD NOT LOCATE IT.

Sometimes entertaining, but not enough for me to either reccomend or send on to one of my friends. I did finish it because I try to finish all the books I read, much less buy. I enjoy the Chick-Lit fic to the max, but this is by far not one of the best. Granted, it's not one of the worst either, but read it only if you're on a long trip.

I guess he did get in, so that gives him some credibility in writing this book. Of course, he was also gone after one semester (I don't remember if he actually flunked out or if he just withdrew before he could flunk out). He also once accused people in our histology lab of stealing his jacket because they were trying to saboutage his chances (it was actually just sitting on another table about 20 feet away).I can't even say \\"William was dumb, but at least he was a nice guy.\\" He wasn't a nice guy. He was kind of a jerk.I haven't read this book, so I have no idea if it's any good (Occam's razor would say no). But I can safely say that people who have to leave medical school after one semester should *not* be giving advice on medical school to anyone. At least he didn't write a companion book on how to succeed in medical school - or maybe he did, and it's just the blank pages at the back of this book.There are a lot of guides on how to get into medical school - please buy a different one."},{"Title":"A Guide to Medical School Admission","review":"I would like to tell UCCF to go straight to ... but what would I have to gain by stooping to his or her level.I did write this book.

I am currently Board Certified in Family Practice and I have completed a Fellowship in Women's Health. My current position finds me on faculty at the St Francis Family Practice Residency Program at the University of Tennessee.

We can not expect too much from one volume commentaries. But this one does it's best in details and expositions. Yes, it's weak points may be in the fields of exegeses but in many places the writers told us more underlying details that we could not find in other one volume commentaries. We think this book is the best one volume commentary in the market now. We are using it a lot in advancing our knowledge in bible study. The new edition is coming soon!!! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"This is a spectacular commentary, and what makes it even greater is the authorship is completely African Scholars. The additional 50+ articles brings so much light to a contextualized gospel from the perspective of African Pastors on the front line. This is not only a great piece of literature it is a breakthrough in publishing that symbolizes the shift of the center of Christianity to the Global South. A must have for all interested in viewing scripture from a non-Euramerican perspective."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"I was disappointed that the commentary, although written by African scholars, is not very African. It seems that Western conservative education affected too much these brothers and sisters.I wanted to learn how Africans have faced issues of spiritual power (Keener's recent book about Miracles does a much better job- his wife is African-), I wanted to learn what redemptive analogies were used and can still be used to take the meaning of Christian discipleship deeper into the hearts of Africans. I wanted to learn more about the individuals and cultures from Africa that take such an important place in the Scriptures.I know this commentary has not been as widely used and received as expected. I believe this is the reason:Written by Africans it does not give Westerners, Asians, Latin Americans (and maybe even Africans) what we were looking for: Africa's contribution to understand better the Word of God.Since this is a very commendable work, I hope someday it will be reviewed to add these essential insights."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"I found the book useful but biased with a certain social agenda promoting popular earthly interpretations rather than biblical exegesis."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"It is helpful to have perspective away from the northern hemisphere. This one volume gives me a view into the Africian culture of which I have a bit of experience. The brevity does not cripple the insight from the variety of authors. I like the constant reminder of the communal aspect of the ancient near east along with recognition of the rich heritage we have from previous generations. This is a welcome change to other commentaries with the words studied through the centuries."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"I have found this book to be very informative and helpful.

When I first got it my plan was for it to enhance my bible study times, that it has done. BUT after reviewing the book and its contents I realized between the articles throughout this is the perfect devotion tool. My time with God has never been the same, now when I am stuck I ask the Holy Spirit for guidance and then get my ABC and keep it moving.Today before church I decided to write a review for ABC (Africa Bible Commentary) and before writing I skimmed through so that I can remember the thoughts I had when I first used it back in December 2012. It was on page ix that I got my revelation. A question \\"what can the ABC be used for\\"? on the list it said devotion all I could do was smile. I'm ashamed to say I have never read the whole bible, (hey don't judge me)smile. Anyway with ABC that is my goal, to read it and then have ABC as my companion.Let me add I am not a scholar, seminary student nor ministry leader. I am a lay person who loves the Lord and want to understand His nature and keep His word close to my heart. If that is your goal then this book will help its a library of sorts that will help you in understanding (exegesis) the bible, you will also find wonderful articles on poverty, HIV/AIDS, conflict management and a host of other topics within each book of the bible. Part of the vision for this Commentary is \\"to make the Word of God speak relevantly to African realities today\\".

I use this commentary to supplement my scripture reading. I'm currently reading through the bible again (for the third time). I read a chapter in the bible, then I read that same chapter in the Africa Bible Commentary. I'm amazed at the insights I glean from the authors. I am a seminary graduate so I'm familiar with most of the scholarly commentaries. This one has become one of my favorites. It's on my nightstand, right beside my bible. It's written so clearly that the average person can read and understand it. I particularly enjoy the essays it offers on a myriad of subjects. If you want a better understanding of scripture and you don't want to go to seminary to get it, this book is for you! It will expand your understanding of scripture and have you wondering why you hadn't run across this jewel of commentary sooner!"},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"THE AFRICA BIBLE COMMENTARY represents the first one-volume Bible commentary produced in Africa by African theologians to meet the needs of African pastors and leaders. As such, it interprets the Bible in light of current African cultures and concerns, with section-by-section interpretations providing a useful guide of interest not just to African residents, but to world Bible readers who will here find plenty of different insights and ideas.

As soon as I got it I sat down in an easy chair and read for two hours. What a book."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"I did not find this commentary to offer a particularly African viewpoint in its analysis."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"I just returned from a mission trip in Uganda and was delighted to see that my first ordered copy had arrived when I returned from Africa. For me, the commentary has such a refreshing and inspired passion for the faith that excites the soul. It has become my first stop in sermon preparation. I find the scholarship first rate, but also the \\"heart\\" for pastoral applicability is equally evident. Having experienced the African faith up close may tint my perspective slightly, but that's probably not a bad thing in this case.As an Episcopal priest, I find this commentary to be not only a treasure chest of wisdom, but truly enjoyable to read. The articles are very informative, interesting and appropo to African social and religious issues and they easily translate into our own cultural context.Life in much of Africa helps one better understand many of the biblical customs and contexts because the lifestyle, especially in remote areas, is very similar. I think that this closer connection to our biblical roots cannot help but provide a more personal reflection of the meaning of the texts. The evangelical slant will probably turn off some Americans, but this is the reason that the fastest growing segment of the worldwide church is Africa. Personally, I prefer to be humbled and learn rather than prideful and judge.After familiarizing myself with the commentary, I have purchased eight more copies of this book for the Ugandan clergy and host families that extended their hospitality to our team. I also bought one for my son, who is a senior at Duke Divinity School. Even though it stretched my book budget, this is without a doubt, money well spent."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"The Africa Bible Commentary is an attempt to provide a particularly Afro-centered commentary on the whole Bible by over 70 scholars. It is a very interesting book, in parts. Issues such as AIDS, poverty, slavery, polygamy, etc. are covered from a Christian perspective that opens a window into some of the specific concerns and convictions of African Christians. The weakness of the book is that it is fairly lightweight in the exegetical treatment of the text itself. I did not find it a very useful guide in interpretation; but it did provide some interesting perspective on various social and ethical issues facing Christianity today. All in all, the commentary did not live up to its reviews and advertisments."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"The \\"African Bible Commentary\\" is written by and for the Evangelical Protestant Community. All 70 African scholars signed the statement of faith of the Association of Evangelicals in Africa. Thus readers receive a comprehensive and culturally relevant conservative theology applied to African Christian living.It truly is a unique book--the first one-volume Bible commentary produced in Africa by African theologians to meet the needs of African pastors, students, and lay people. However, African American believers, and for that matter, all Christians, will find this book refreshing and encouraging, as well as biblically informative.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , Soul Physicians, and Spiritual Friends."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"This is a great effort by African scholors from all over Africa to educate African people about Christianity. \\"In Africa, Christianity is a mile wide and 1\\" deep.\\" (Quoted from the ABC.) For me, as a non-African interested in supporting ministry for the Maasai in Kenya, it is a way to understand the Bible from a new point of view. Excellent, incredible work."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"This commentary has been very helpful to our African church leaders and overseas missionary partners working in Africa. This is the book they request we bring on our annual visits, so we know they are using it. It's the first of it's kind - the ABC is not a critical, academic, verse-by-verse commentary. Rather, it contains section-by-section exegesis and explanation of the whole Bible, as seen through the eyes of African scholars who respect the integrity of the text and use African proverbs, metaphors and stories to make it speak to African believers in the villages and cities across the entire continent."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"It is most amazing that in an Africa beset by tribal conflicts there could be such unity among those who call themselves Christian leaders to put together a book like this. It is a testimony of what God's love in people can do to make life different for them as they strive to teach others the Way. The book is well done and uses much from African culture to help us understand the Bible better. I love the use of African proverbs in explaining the Bible. I use it every day in my personal Bible study."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"After serving in West Africa on the mission field for a short time, I can instantly see the value of this book both for African scholars, those who teach and work with them, as well as a multi-cultural introduction to the Bible. Excellent insights, some of them seem to recycled Western ideas, but also shows the universality of the teaching of Scripture. Evangelical, Bible-believing, solid, well-thought.

I have a great deal of respect for both the academic and spiritual strenghts of the writers. This has been a prized addition to my library."},{"Title":"Africa Bible Commentary: A One-Volume Commentary Written by 70 African Scholars","review":"An important book of biblical scholarship reflecting one major stream of African Christianity. For me, however, it was a significant disappointment to discover that the choice of commemtators strongly reflects historic Western church divisions. There are no Roman Catholic, Coptic Orthodox or Ethiopian Orthodox scholars represented among the 70 contributors. It is written from, (and to?) evangelical Protestant communities. All the contributors had to affirm the statement of faith of the Association of Evangelicals in Africa. For some readers this may be a reassurance. For me, it is a sorrowful narrowing of the full breadth of African Christianity. I find this an ecumenical opportunity missed and had hoped for a more generous interpretation of African Christian life. Nevertheless despite this missed opportunity I appreciate this book as an important work by evangelical African scholars. However, those looking for a contribution from African Catholic or Orthodox scholars will need to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Mariah Carey 2004 Wall Calendar","review":"I actually bought this calendar at her concert in August and the moment I saw it, I knew I had to get it!

I hate to sound bossy, but you've got to read this book!"},{"Title":"My Big Sister Is So Bossy She Says You Can't Read This Book","review":"MY BIG SISTER is filled with both humor and heart. The author is able to make us care deeply for Effie and her troubles as well as laugh at the predicaments she gets herself into as she lets her big sister boss her around. Effie is also lonely, and hungry for a new best friend. Her search for someone to fill the hole in her life is poignant and hilarious, and had me wanting to reach through the pages of the book and offer to be her new buddy. As Effie struggles to break out of her role as an easily bossed, somewhat naive little sister, she has to learn to take charge of her life and come to terms with the recent losses that have occured. She does this with humor and pluck and her unique voice shines brightly in the great, humorous tale!"},{"Title":"My Big Sister Is So Bossy She Says You Can't Read This Book","review":"This book was about a girl named Effie and her troubles with her sister. I really enjoyed this book. I can relate to Effie's bad experiences with her sister and I can relate to her being very sad when her grandpa died. I think that The author could have done a little better when she was describing everything and could have made some of the characters a little more lively. I really liked how the author made Maxey sound really rude at first, but then she gradually got nicer and eventually was very nice to her sister. I think that this book was geared to all fifth, sixth, and seventh grade girls. Overall I really liked this book and I recommend it to all girls!"},{"Title":"My Big Sister Is So Bossy She Says You Can't Read This Book","review":"To begin with, I do like this book. I don't think I would if I were an actual fourth-grader, though. It's just a bit too complex, and I don't think most fourth-graders are as observant as Effie is. Hence, it's not believable that the narrator is really a ten-year-old.I also know that every time I laughed, I laughed at Effie the stupid ten-year-old and not with her. The tone of the book encouraged me to. Not good, considering this book is aimed at fellow ten-year-olds.Finally, the ending feels incomplete. Maybe if the author added something about the older sister's bossiness, but as it is, the title and the beginning has nothing to do with the overall content of the book. Yeah, so Maxey is bossy and it all started with a pack of lies. So what? Not very conclusive."},{"Title":"The Best Free Things For Seniors","review":"I really have to say that I don't usually like these kind of books, but this book really has a lot of good information in it !

Brazelton's book, by contrast is both pragmatic and philosophical, giving parents much more depth on this subject. I loved reading this book; I found it to be engaging, interesting, and very relevant to raising my 2-year old.In particular, some things that impressed me:* The author has great insight into infant and toddler behavioral development (in fact, he has great insight into parental behavior as well). This background gives parents some inclination for what is going on with their child, and is useful in crafting responses to various behaviors that are observed in the early years of a child's life.* The book is comprehensive, touching on most aspects of parenting in the first three years.* The book is extremely well organized. It serves well as both a reference, and a cover-to-cover read.I do agree with other reviewers who have said the author is opinionated. I think this is a good thing -- and I gained more and more confidence in the author's opinions as I went along. Most new parents will do well to have a \\"starting point\\" when forming their own opinions. As an example, Brazelton discusses at length the importance of establishing boundaries with infants and toddlers, as this will help the child to feel competent and secure as they continually gain new dimensions of independence which both excites and scares children. But this is balanced with the moderating view that parents minimize negativity by not making big deals of things that don't really matter. This is related to discussion on what it means to \\"spoil\\" a child. To this end, Brazelton advises: (1) do sometimes let the child get frustrated when trying to accomplish a new task by themselves -- this is a feeling they're going to have to learn to manage, and (2) establish boundaries so the child has a good sense for his own competence."},{"Title":"Touchpoints-Birth to Three","review":"I was still pregnant when I received this book as a gift. I thought it was \\"hokey\\" and not relevant to my situation. When my daughter was 8 weeks old, I finally cracked the book open. Wow. Wish I would have done it sooner. It explained my baby's fussy time and other things that was affecting her day. She is now 6 months old and I read ahead to recognize her behaviors and to get prepared to deal w/them. I love this book and recommend it to all new mothers!

Dr. Brazelton is still my favorite for his comprehensive, authoritative, yet non-judgmental, realistic advice. He has a tremendous understanding of the needs of children, in a way adults typically can't understand. In addition to addressing each stage of development in \\"Touchpoints\\", the section on special situations is extremely helpful!!!! I have loved every book he's ever written (Infants and Mothers is my other favorite) and find his advice invaluable and in the best interest of the child! He is a true child advocate and has the most calming voice to listen to...."},{"Title":"Touchpoints-Birth to Three","review":"TOUCHPOINTS is a parental guide that deals with the development of children aged 0-3 from the viewpoint of an experienced pediatrician. The advice is sound and balanced. If there are many ways to approach a subject, the benefits and drawbacks of each are explored. The best insights come when Dr. Brazeleton reveals precisely what he is looking for - in the child and in the parents - during pediatrician visits. He sees the role of the pediatrician as part of the parental team and stresses this philosophy throughout the book. Some people in these reviews have complained about the author's tone; however, I do not see any problem. To me, the author is nothing more the helpful and very experienced. I am in the process of interviewing pediatricians, as directed by the advice by Dr. Brazelton, and if we end up with one similar to him, I will be very happy.So, why only 3 stars? While I find the advice in TOUCHPOINTS very helpful, I think it could be organized much better. Each chapter deals with a time period in the child's development, but oftentimes, the subject matters are scattered throughout the chapter or even across several chapters (with no cross reference given in-line). I found myself using a highlighter marker extensively so that I could use the book better when I need a reference.Ironically, the one attribute that made TOUCHPOINTS completely worth the investment was its reference to another book,The Children's Hospital Guide to Your Child's Health and Development, which I bought. Initially, I wanted THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL GUIDE as a good developmental/medical reference, but upon reading it, the book is much more readable than I expected - so much so, that it does a much better job than TOUCHPOINTS while covering exactly the same topics and in a much better organizational format and with the same \\"pediatrician as partner\\" philosophy. By the way, Dr. Brazelton is associated with THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL GUIDE - he does the foreword and contributes to some of the content. I should stress that the organization and format of the material is exceptional. THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL GUIDE is a 5-star book that obviates the need for both/either of Dr. Brazelton's books - it and even comes in a hardcover format, which might even last until we no longer need it!My simple advice: buy THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL GUIDE TO YOUR CHILD'S HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENT instead of TOUCHPOINTS."},{"Title":"Touchpoints-Birth to Three","review":"Well, he may not really be, but unfortunately, that's how the writing comes across in several places. For example, p 52 \\"I have come to expect this tenuous, rather childlike behavior [of father and mother] when new parents come into my office. Rather than a sign of incompetence, it represents their ability to accept me in a nurturing 'grandfather' role...\\". p. 102 \\"By this time, I know parents will leap in to correct me if I'm off track, and I welcome their deeply held beliefs about who their child is becoming\\". If these sound somewhat condescending to you, you might be put off by the book. Also, the term 'Touchpoints' itself doesn't really refer to a particularly useful concept-- it's basically refers to an opportunity to bond with your baby. The repetitive use of the term sounds forced. OK, so this may sound like a negative review, so why 4 stars? Because despite these annoyances, the information inside is useful and I like how the chapters are essentially organized by periods between pediatrician visits. You get a chance to check your baby's progress against a pediatrician's standards. It is not too useful for the first 10 days when so many questions swirl around your sleep-deprived head. But it provides a longer term perspective (up to 3 years) whereas most baby books stop at 1 year. Sure, 1 year is a convenient way to end a book, but this is one of the few books that bridge the time period from infant to toddler. Also, it is really useful to hear what a pediatrician looks for during each visit. Aside from the tone, the book is well written, well referenced, and covers some very interesting topics (separate chapters on sibling rivalry; speech, language and hearing problems; television; grandparents). Even the book layout is pleasing, with mid-size pages, occasional photos, and wide margins if you are a note-taker. I wouldn't use this as a sole reference, though, as several opinions expressed are just that- opinions- but I haven't found much to disagree with in this book, except that I refuse to call emotional milestones 'touchpoints'!"},{"Title":"Touchpoints-Birth to Three","review":"I'm so impressed with the researched based information in Brazelton's work. I have also seen videos from years ago with him working with infants and can't be more happy to know that his work is becoming the norm. He was one of the first pediatricians to bring to light, that infants do SEE and HEAR and birth. Touch Points, reassure parents that they can navigate the predictable spurts in development and issues as they arise. Brazelton talks about the key points, which are natural moments where a baby advances in one area, but then regresses in another. Brazelton's work offers parents a chance to reflect, take a change in direction and grow along with the child.Love his books - and highly recommend his books to all new parents.Kimberley Clayton Blaine, MA, MFTLicensed Child TherapistFounder, www.TheGoToMom.TVAuthor: Mommy Confidence: 8 Easy Steps to Reclaiming Balance, Motivation, and Your Inner Diva"},{"Title":"Touchpoints-Birth to Three","review":"I found this book through PBS's \\"Whole Child\\" website.

I've found the author's tips work well with my two children and am especially grateful for his tips on sleep (patting the child's back to settle her down, using a lovie).

Instead of focusing on babies, it goes on about how he tricks fathers into thinking babies recognize their voices or how mothers who come to his office look bedraggled because they are spending too much time dressing their babies in impractical outfits.

If you don't work outside the home, I may actually recommend this - as I mentioned, there are some good tips and it will certainly reinforce your choice. If you've made the tough decision to go back to work, then this book will add to any guilt you may already feel. There were also some tips that are in direct opposition to other books I've read, such as waking up your baby before you go to bed to feed him or her to prolong your sleep at night. A book that I found extremely useful - Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child - warns parents that this not only does not work, but is also not healthy for the baby.

Here, SIX MILLION murders are alleged to have happened, but despite all of the Jewish drumbeating about the holocaust, no team of Jewish forensic specialists were dispatched to locate the remains of SIX MILLION CORPSES. Well over half a century later, and still no forensic specialists dispatched. Still no SIX MILLION CORPSES.Saddam Hussein was recently sentenced to death based upon the remains of 130 or so victims, remains that were purportedly discovered and exhumed some 25 years later. So, we can find 130 bodies of Saddam's victims 25 years later, but Jewish forensic specialists cannot find SIX MILLION CORPSES 60 years later?.Holocaust advocates want to produce documents as \\"receipts\\" of the SIX MILLION CORPSES. If only 1% of the bodies were discovered, we would need 60,000 coffins to bury them. That is only 1%. Instead, we're told a story, shown hair and teeth, and told about the \\"receipts\\" which \\"prove\\" the story.

I participate in online debates, and it is my best reference by far. If you want to understand the holohoax, this is the book to get.The holohoax is not sophisticated, it is a crude deliberate hoax, and this is easily demonstrated. And yet, we've been lied to for so long, there is a remarkable resistance to the truth of the matter. As a result, the revisionist position is a very hard sell. One of the failures of revisionism is there has been no analysis of this resistance.It is easy to demonstrate the hoax. There are two existing 'extermination camps', Auschwitz and Majdanek. Tours are conducted in both these camps, and hoax gas chambers are shown to the visitors. How do we know the gas chambers are hoaxes? Both have unbarred plate glass windows! No joke. Google 'gas chamber doors a comparison in photos' to see photos of the Auschwitz hoax gas chamber. A picture of the Majdanek hoax 'gas chamber' in on the USHMM web site. For more info, google 'David Cole interviews Frantizek Piper', Piper is the Director of Research at Auschwitz.(Note: the Auschwitz hoax gas chamber an unbelievably crude fraud, the Majdanek hoax gas chamber was a delousing room used to kill lice on clothes to prevent the spread of typhus.)It is important to look critically at the 'evidence' offered for the holohoax. This is the book that does it. The result will amaze you.Here is an example of an actual online debate:DW writes ------General George Patton vomited at what he saw in the death camps. General Eisenhower ordered that tens of thousands of US troop tour the just liberated camps to be witnesss because he knew the day would come that someone would start denying this grave evil.My response ------Neither Patton nor Eisenhower visited what are now claimed to be 'death camps'. Of course, the holohoax did initially maintain that camps at Dachau, Buchenwald, Belsen Bergen, and others in Germany proper were 'death camps' complete with gas chambers, etc. There was no shortage of eyewitness testimony to gassings at these camps, and there were pictures of 'gas chambers' in the camps published in US newspapers and magazines. The problem is, that was all a hoax, as now everyone, including the USHMM, admits. The USHMM, and the rest of the holohoax establishment, now maintain that there were only six 'death camps', all in Poland, four were razed before the end of the war, Auschwitz and Majdanek were captured by the Russians.What did Patton and Eisenhower see? Perhaps you saw the recent AP article on the records at Bad Arolson, which were not 'released' by the way. This is from the AP article\\"Frank, Annelise M. is Anne Frank.She was on one of the last trains to Germany before the Nazi occupation of Holland crumbled. Six months later, aged 15, she died an anonymous death, one of some 35,000 casualties of typhus that ravaged the Bergen-Belsen camp.\\"Patton and Eisenhower saw camps devastated by disease and starvation, brought on by a huge influx of prisoners from the eastern camps, and Allied bombing of supply lines. The correrspondence of the Belsen commander. Kramer, was captured and preserved, he did everything in his power to prevent the catastrophe. He was executed for his efforts.DW ------ was heard from no more."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"I stumbled onto this book in a shop and having heard about the controversy still surrounding it, I was curious of it's merit and content. I will emphatically state that I read it with a completely &quot;open mind&quot; and hope my statements regarding it reflect that. After the first few chapters, what disturbed me most about the book was it's tone. It is written at times like the words are being yelled at you, which to me makes me a little suspect in terms of accuracy. One of the functions of an intelligent historian should be an objective approach to the subject matter. When a writer loses that objectivity, he no longer functions in the role of an historian, but indeed, assumes a different role, which makes you wonder what exact role is Dr. Butz actually playing. He makes statements which he tells you are proof of &quot;this hoax,&quot; yet to me, the reader, they are not only unproven, his arguments are not even conclusive. He takes considerable time to verify to the reader that Jewish testimony is unreliable and inaccurate, yet never holds the same standard to his own sources, which he never questions. He wants you to believe the Nuremburg trials were corrupt and fixed in favor of the Jews and the creation of the Jewish Holocaust myth, but gives no explanation or even much thought to the obvious question of &quot;Why, then, did some of the those on trial get off scott free and others with light sentences along with the ones who were condemned?&quot; I also had to go to outside sources for explanations which happened to be in opposition to his position, explanations that Dr. Butz neglects to mention in his arguments, explanations that are so obvious and important, it has to be a &quot;conscious&quot; decision to omit them. One wonders again, what is his role? . In something so massive as the Holocaust, there will always be mistakes made by those trying to tell the whole story, but certain inaccuracies do not invalidate the whole picture, and certainly do not &quot;prove&quot; malicious intent. The book is very unprofessional, and left me feeling I had spent time with someone hostile, certainly not someone I would trust to tell me an honest account of something which is blatantly very personal and emotional to them as a person. I can only recommend this book to readers who are curious about the origins of this movement."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"Disclaimer: I have only been able to sample Professor Butz's work. I looked at those portions of particular interest to me. I read what he had to say about Jewish demographics, that is, the number of Jews in Europe before and after the Second World War. I also looked at what he had to say about the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, at which the Germans, according to the standard historians, decided on the Holocaust. I was also interested to see how he evaluated the Nuremberg trials of the top Nazi leaders.On population figures, Professor Butz will not accept any data from Jewish or \\"Communist\\" (i.,e. Soviet) sources, since, he says, such sources are tainted. Jews and Communist lie, according to Professor Butz, so why listen to them.On the Wannsee Conference, he quotes the Nazi sources that speak of Nazi plans to deport all of Europe's Jews and to enslave them. But since these Nazis did not spell out an intention to kill all Jews in so many words, Professor Butz finds that, therefore, this source is reliable evidence for his proposition that no such killings took place.In Professor Butz's book, moreover, whoever says that he has witnessed the Holocaust is a liar.On the Nuremberg trials, he finds that any incriminating statements by Nazis to have been extorted by cruel and sadistic Allied guards.Professor Butz's work gives evidence of great industriousness. He has many footnotes and supplies many figures and pictures. Such apparatus has been taken as a sign of deep scholarship by his friends and supporters. But his analysis of all these data is simple: whatever supports his thesis is accepted, whatever contradicts it is called a lie.But unfortunately for Professor Butz, it is quite impossible to accept his thesis without also accepting his notion of the Jews. He sees Jews of all stripes -- from the most Zionist to folks like Noam Chomsky -- as united in a vast conspiracy to dupe the non-Jewish world. Moreover, in order to accept Professor Butz's work, we must also accept that this Jewish conspiracy, this \\"Hoax\\" as he calls it, was also uncritically accepted by all the professional historians who have worked in this area. Everyone is a dupe, everyone, that is, except he himself and his handful of friends.Is that plausible ? I don't think so."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"I found Professor Butz Book solidly documented but the conclusions lacking. He certainly showed up the bias of the Nuremburg trial and the pictures from the British War Museum certainly supported his case on the Typhus epidemic. I have written articles on the subject and interviewed both victims and jailers and I believe that the real truth will be lost somewhere in between. Butz at least has the courage to express his opinion."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"May I recommend a book that is from the same publisher and Amazon has in stock and supersedes the contents of this book--I think ten times better, and the best Holocaust book out there:DEBATING THE HOLOCAUST: A New Look At Both Sides by Thomas Dalton, PhD"},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"Just because an idea is challenging, controversial or goes against dominant norms doesn't make the idea intelligent or worthwhile. I had to read this book for a class on the public sphere as apart of a holocaust section. I will say that from a rhetorical standpoint the book is interesting in the language games it plays. Unfortunately its sense of constructing valid arguments about history is quite laughable. I don't believe that all Butz fans are necessarily anti-Semitic, I simply think that there are people who flock towards a theory that states \\"even though everyone thinks x is true they are misled.\\" The more controversial it is to say that x isn't true, the more people seem to like it. Such people like 'being in the know' or having some insight that the majority is too blind to see, etc. Certainly what is more controversial than suggesting that the Holocaust didn't happen?Not too long into the book it really began to dawn on me that the only thing Butz was capable of pointing out is that any type of historical knowledge relies at least partly on a bit of faith. I'll make this more clear. Prove to me that the Civil War happened. Were you there? So what if books are written about it and there are historians that will sware it happened, can they prove it? Nobody died at Gettysburg from gunshots and cannon fire, they just caught the flu. I mean as long as we have Butz who is going to completely regard primary as well as secondary sources one could never prove anything historically. The National Socialists were notorious for their meticulous documentation, and the extermination of Jews is no exception. They documented their actions to the last detail going through pain staking steps to ensure the most efficient mass production of death ever seen by mankind.Butz answer to all of this? Elaborate language games with an internal logic that is absolutely astounding. They all died of Typhoid and starvation, there was no gas chambers. Set aside the plethora of evidence that suggests otherwhise, is this somehow a better scenario? If the Jews were concentrated into camps and then systematically starved and allowed to die is this somehow not a genocide? Seriously stop and think for one second. There is also hard facts with which he is not able to make a valid argument. Before the Nazi Party there were nearly 9 million Jews in the European nations that the Third Reich would come to occupy. After the war there was 3 million Jews. Where on Earth did these 6 million people go? The numbers that fled to Israel and other countries before the war don't even come close to one million. They all died of typhoid? That is blatantly absurd unless typhoid was diliberately unleashed upon the camps, and there again is that somehow better than gas chambers? The science to back up the notion that there were no gas chambers is incredibly laughable. If you set out to prove a specific conclusion and want to prove it badly enough, you'll find a way. And sure enough holocaust deniers use all kinds of bogus science that has again and again been refuted by countless scientific studies. The way Butz and other deniers interogate the eye witness accounts only makes them look foolish.In the end I stick to my earlier point. It is absolutely irrefutable that massive numbers of Jews, Gypsys and others were locked up into camps. The Nazis viewed the Jews as an inferior race and were very clear about their desire to rid Europe of their presence. Hitler's speeches and writings make no mistake about his personal and focussed hatred of the Jews and his belief that Germany and the world was better off without them. They were imprisoned and forced into hard labor because of this racial hatred. An estimated 70% of those who were imprisoned did not live to see the end of the war. Does it matter how they died? Does it matter if they were starved to death or if there was gas chambers? I personally do believe that there were gas chambers as do most reputable historians. But I have to ask what on Earth does it matter? Nearly six million people vanished after being imprisoned by a regime that called for their destruction. What do you need to be convinced that a genocide occurred? Cinematic documentation? Oh wait, the Nazis did document the concentration camps. Butz may have been educated, but that doesn't make his argument anything more than utter nonsense and futile nonsense at that. Genocide is genocide regardless of how it is carried out."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"\\"Il est bien malais&eacute; (puisqu'il faut enfin m'expliquer) d'ter &agrave; des insens&eacute;s des chanes qu'ils r&eacute;v&egrave;rent.\\" (It is difficult to free fools from the chains they revere.) -- VoltaireA reviewer here states that \\"the real issue here is not whether six million Jews (and others) were deliberately put to death by National Socialist [that is, Nazi] Germany...\\" But that is PRECISELY the issue, because six million Jews (and others) were deliberately murdered by the Nazi empire, and Arthur Butz - with a certainty as unwavering as Ptolemy's that the Sun revolves around the Earth - denies that it every happened.Arthur Butz is a \\"prof\\" at Northwestern (as this reviewer puts it.) What he fails to mention, however, is that he is not a historian, has no training as one, and does not even read or speak German. He has never visited the crematoria of Auschwitz or Chelmno, nor has he ever bothered to interview any of the tens of thousands of camp guards, Kapos, SS-Einsatzgr&uuml;ppen, or Holocaust survivors alive at the time he published his screed, or those still alive today.Butz possesses an advanced degree in engineering. It is hard to imagine that he would take seriously a paper dealing with the higher mathematics related to fluid dynamics from someone who never went past high-school trigonometry - especially one that asserted everything every professional engineer or physicist in every university in the world knows about fluid dynamics is not only wrong but a deliberate lie. Nonetheless, Butz blithely refutes nearly everything EVERY serious historian of modern Europe has ever written about the Third Reich and the Holocaust (including those on the Right, such as Paul Johnson and Michael Burleigh).I have read \\"The Hoax of the Twentieth Century\\" - which, despite one reviewer's breathless assertions of censorship is freely available online, or in many libraries, or even now on Kindle. It is slow going, as Butz contorts logic and simply denies or ignores any evidence that contradicts his preconceptions.Nonetheless, you should not forgo reading it simply because it is tiresome, or because it displays the stilted prose of someone who spent most of his life studying equations. Rather, you should feel free to skip it (as I have not) because Arthur Butz on many occasions has himself summarized his arguments, such as they are. Finding himself in happy agreement with his intellectual fellow-traveller and moral soulmate President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran on the subject of Holocaust denial, among other things, Arthur Butz stated:In 1976 I published a book entitled \\"The Hoax of the Twentieth Century\\", in which I argued:1. The alleged slaughter of millions of Jews by the Germans, during World War II, did not happen.2. The extermination allegation is properly termed a hoax, that is to say, a deliberately contrived falsehood. It was not at its source an honest misunderstanding or accidental falsehood.3. The hoax had a Zionist provenance and motivation. That is, while some of the original obscure stories did not come from Zionist sources, the elevation to allegations repeated by the American and other governments, and major institutions, was due to Zionist circles within those countries, who acted with Zionist motivations.More sophisticated Holocaust deniers use weasel words and arguments to minimize the Holocaust (e.g., \\"Yes, the Nazis murdered Jews, but only a few hundred thousand.\\") Butz rejects this - he believes (in the face of overwhelming evidence) that: THE NAZIS DID NOT SYSTEMATICALLY MURDER JEWS - NOT AT ALL.The Holocaust is one of the most well-documented events in history. There is irrefutable demographic evidence that there were nine million Jews living in Europe in 1939, and less than three million left alive in 1945. The Holocaust was well documented by the bureaucracy of the Nazi government itself. It was further witnessed by the Allied forces who entered Germany and its associated Axis states towards the end of World War II.This documentary evidence includes hundreds of thousands of letters, memos, blueprints, orders, bills, speeches, articles, memoirs, and confessions detailing the Holocaust; accounts from survivors, Jewish Sonderkommandos (who helped load bodies from the gas chambers into the crematoria in exchange for a chance of survival), SS guards, commandants, local townspeople, and even high-ranking Nazis who spoke openly about the mass murder of the Jews; official military and press photographs, civilian photographs, secret photographs taken by survivors, aerial photographs, German and Allied film footage, and unofficial photographs taken by the German military; the concentration camps, work camps, and extermination camps that still exist in varying degrees of originality and reconstruction.Hitler himself announced in a national broadcast made in 1939 that a war would result in \\"the destruction of the Jewish race in Europe\\" (\\"sondern die Vernichtung der j&uuml;dischen Rasse in Europa.\\")The Holocaust is more throughly documented than the American Civil War. What if I told you it was all a hoax? Slavery never existed in America - NEVER! There was no war. Grant and Lee were soldiers, but they never fought each other. There was no Confederacy. The battlefields are Potemkin villages. The photographs are falsified. The eyewitness accounts are fake as well. It was all a vast conspiracy by Americans of African descent to gain sympathy from the whites in the North. There is no one left alive from that period - so how can you say I'm wrong?I could go on, but what is the point? Those who are willfully blind will never see. I am happy to send to anyone a 312-page, single-spaced (300,000+ word) point-by-point refutation of everything Arthur Butz and David Irving, et al, have ever asserted about the Holocaust, written by the most distinguished historians - all painstakingly detailed.Would you take the time to read that? Most likely not. Keep clinging to your comfortable and pernicious illusions instead."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"What is Butz looking for? Nice well kept cemeteries, with impressive granite monuments?Is that what it would take to satisfy him?So he thinks that the 15 miles of file drawers of Nazi documentation at Bad Arolson are all made up, imaginary?The Allies took plenty of pictures of the bodies they found at the concentration camps when they liberated them.As for the bodies the Nazis \\"processed...\\"My parents are both concentration camp survivors. I visited Auschwitz with my father almost 20 years ago.In the little theater they have there, I saw films the Nazis had taken themselves. We saw films of bodies stacked among railroad ties and being set aflame in the town of Chelmno.My father, in a quiet but resolute voice, told me that answered the question for him of what happened to his 37 year old mother and 10 year old brother, who had been transported to Chelmno early in the war when the Nazis liquidated the Jewish population of his small town of Lask.My father and grandfather spent several years in the Lodz ghetto after that, performing forced labor for the Germans, before being transported to Auschwitz.My grandfather died within days of liberation. At the time my father was liberated, he weighed 78 pounds, and at 17 was the sole surviving member of his family.In 1977, he went back to Poland, and brought back a small jar of ashes and dirt, that are now buried under a monument to the martyrs of Lask in their burial association plot in Elmont, Long Island.There must be a special place in hell for those who use their time and energy to deny the Holocaust.

I have spent a great deal of time working with people who are in &quot;denial.&quot; Mr. Butz, like many people who cannot admit or face the truth, will use any rationalization to believe a certain set of facts. A main premise of the book is that witnesses which bolster the holocaust are suspect &quot;for obvious reasons.&quot; For example, all evidence from Jewish and Soviet sources should be disregarded. (Butz states that Anne Franke's diary is made up.) An issue referred to throughout is that Germany was not the only country that did bad things during WWII and others, that other countries have engaged in territorial conquest. What a startling revelation!! But Hitler only engaged in &quot;territoral acquisition.&quot; Butz's sympathy for the National Socialists is obvious. He includes a photo of some prisoners yelling at a guard after a camp was liberated; I guess those Jews didn't like being in the camp. I wonder why? Butz claims that where Jews were held in groups it was largely in transition to other places. Where? No answer in the book; I guess he means that they went to the USSR and those Jew loving communists took them in and hid them forever. The book itself almost looks like the publisher took Butz's typed draft, and glued the pages together; the font is miniscule and crooked, the letters are often poorly spaced. The references to photos and diagrams usually do not correspond to the correct page number, at least not in my copy. One last thought, many of the convicted persons I know have one thing in common, they are convinced that their trials were unfair (like Butz and Nuremberg) and once they are sent jail, though semi-literate, they commence research at the library, and, as a result, appear totally inadequate when putting their fragile factual/legal theories on paper."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"I just returned from the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., where I had the sad privilege to view thousands of pieces of what historians call \\"prime source material\\"--film footage, letters, Nazi publications, and other physical evidence.

I have noticed that all such theories have certain common features, as do the people whose mindsets are susceptible to them. This one will be no different.

I could not finish the book - I only got through about 40% of it since it was more of the same over and over, ad nauseum and my blood pressure could not take it.I must give Butz credit for one thing - he is clever. He couches his book with comments that make him out to be an 'historian' and seeker of truth rather than a raging anti-semite. This is necessary because if he came across as an anti semite he would not be taken as seriously. Whereas in this case he can be seen as \\"unbiased\\".Unbiased in NOT what Butz is. His endless dissertation is filled with more heresay than can be imagined. He constantly makes reference to holocaust evidence which he claims is either fabricated, non-existant or otherwise flawed. yet his own assertions must be taken at face value.There are literally hundreds of thousands of deputations made by survivors, allied soldiers, GERMAN soldiers, and other public personell that support each other. There are tens of thousands of photos available - just search for them on the internet - that attest to the horrors of the death camps. How Butz simply denies these is amazing. As well, it would take a conspiracy of the entire world to coordinate such a \\"hoax\\" as he calls it. How was this orchestrated by a ragtag band of Jews (all 6,000,000 survivors spread throughout the globe) who were abhorred and kicked out of most countries. Remember that anti-semitism was rampant during the 40's 50's and into the 60's in most countries.

One cannot know the source of his bigotry; one can only pity him and hope that in the interest of public safety Butz is a better teacher of electrical engineering than history, for as a historian he is pathetic, offensive, and slyly illogical.

There are mountains of proof on the holocaust. He only mentions real facts that can be twisted to his favor. The rest are not facts at all. He only uses SOME post-war census.

Pretty elaborate for an international hoax. For someone to deny the Holocaust, you must first question their motives: why would they want to fly in the face of overwhelming evidence? Do they have something against the Jews, or Israel, or are they merely Germano/Hitlerophiles? Regardless, the outcome is the same: it demeans the Jewish people and their suffering.Most, if not all, Holocaust denial books are antisemitic works, and Butz is no different.

Mainly, more than any other in the U.S. this is the classic, defining book of holocaust revisionism (or denial if you prefer).Butz, a computer science prof. at Northwestern University near Chicago, builds an overwhelming case for his thesis, and presents it in the hard-nosed, academically sophisticated, rigorous, peer-reviewed style and forensic diction that make it a serious piece of work. No intelligent person can read this and not be impressed by his thoroughness, and also, not be deeply disturbed by the wider implications. But that's another story.Rather than give you a tedious synopsis of it, I just want to post this review to point out a couple of things. (a) Butz has updatde the 25-year-old original with a new 2nd edition a few years ago, which I believe he makes available online as a pdf download. (b) Butz's book, good as it is, has been complemented by many others since, which have taken the discussion to the next level. I am not saying Butz's work is dated, but that it has been fleshed out and supported admirably by many others. I am thinking of Robt Faurisson and Germar Rudoph especially, but there are many many others. Of course the Institute for Historical Research, which was founded after Butz's first edition, has filled a small library with addition research on this subject. Butz was the ground-breaking inspiration for much that has followed, so again, this is history-making in itself.None of this takes away from Butz's accomplisment in this early book, which I still regard as the single best introduction to revisionism in English; but I would have to say that,equally, The Rudolph Report ( a free download ), written within the past decade, is also now indispensable as a complement (emphasizing the forensic, architectural and operational issues at Birkenau, which are almost completely lacking in Butz's book, as I recall)."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"Although it can get a bit technical at times, Dr. Butz's book allows the reader to understand better alternative viewpoints regarding the treatment of Jewish deportees during the Second World War. Time will always allow a more objective treatment of historical events and this book, written in 1975, is an important contribution in this respect. Anyone with an interest in what really happened to the Jews during the Nazi era and willing to consider documented fact left out of the information mainstream owes it to him or herself a thorough study of this work. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"Butz's book was first published in 1975, followed by a second edition in 1977. It seems to have been produced on an IBM compositor - a film ribbon proportional-spacing typewriter. Butz's methodology once his interest had been ignited, was to obtain documents and books, some in German and French, through the university inter-library loan system. (He is or was an electrical engineer, specialising, as I understand in pylons and electrical transmission). So far as I know, this was the first ever detailed book specifically on holocaust revisionism. As might be guessed, it's been the target of red-faced rage and indignation, but no point-by-point refutation has been written. It's far better known in the USA than Britain - look at the comments on amazon.com from about 2000 onwards, and the extreme distribution of 5-star and 1-star reviews, usually a sign of a 'controversial' book. An updated online version exists; in fact, of course, Internet now allows Butz to be read online.

I have to admit that many of the facts they present are compelling. For instance, no one can really pinpoint where the &quot;six million&quot; figure arose and the sheer logistics of murdering six million people (during a war where supplies and manpower were scarce) are hard to swallow.The attacks on Mr. Butz are disturbing. This author is entitled to express his views. The Holocaust is the ONLY event in history that one is forbidden from questioning or probing. Why??? Why is this event any different from the many other genocides that have been committed in history? (For instance, the mass murder committed by Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolultion, to name only one.) In terms of numbers, Stallin killed a staggering twenty million individuals yet we are taught that the Holocaust is unique. Well, it isn't any more disturbing then other mass murders in history. If other historical events are open to scholarly debate and questioning, why should the Holocaust be treated any differently? If the facts about the Holocaust all have merit, they will be proven true in the marketplace of ideas -- why the need to censor Mr. Butz?I applaud Arthur Butz for the courage to question the &quot;facts&quot; that have been force-fed on the world for the past fifty years.

One can excuse the poor layout and typeset, a problem faced only because the work has never found itself being released by one of the many well-funded international publishing houses. To use this to scoff at the author is somewhat puerile. As a historical researcher and student of the Nazi holocaust - everyone involved in the subject has his or her unique this idea on what this may mean - I feel that Butz' work is a good starting point, in that it both points out the pertinent facts and encourages the reader to actually go away and seek out standard mass-published works. As the book can be classified as being pre-Leuchter, it is best read in conjunction with more contemporary revisionist works and articles; nevertheless, it serves its purpose well enough for one to call it an informative and at times even shocking read - shocking in that the reader is genuinely shocked when he or she takes note of verifiable facts that have been either hidden or distorted by contemporary commentators.

The work is only a threat to those who have something to lose and thus something to hide but is an incredible bastion of information for those who have something to gain, and that something is called THE TRUTH, which Dr. Butz has presented in fool-proof fashion. I have read and re-read the impressive scholarly work and will doubtless read it again and encourage every brave thinker to do the same; and after each reading, I stand never more amazed but moreover, not surprised at the media blackout from the mainstream Jewish-controlled media (a fact that even they have admitted). The kindergarten taunt \\"Holocaust Denier\\" is only a fright to those with a kindergarten mentality; such as refuse to read the book itself: insisting, as the maxim dictates: \\"Don't confuse me with the facts, my mind's already made up.\\" The book is only for grown ups and those able to break through the brainwash barrier and undeniable denial of the modern era or better: modern error.

In depth. It accepts deficiencies in available knowledge of certain areas, and unlike those who accept the holocaust myth, it does not use them as a kind of \\"proof\\", in comparisson to the argument for instance that German records detailing the holocaust were \\"destroyed\\", where there is no proof they existed in the first place.It is, however, an old book, and much new material has come to light which strenghtens the revisionist argument. Thus, this book alone does not serve as a total counterargument to the holocaust myth, but as a technical framework it is unsurpassed. I would encourage readers to visit www.ihr.org and bolster their knowledge with the material they offer, as well as considering arguments by holocaust believers. In the search for the truth, all available knowledge must be considered, without bias or emotion.I am discouraged to see so many negative reviews of this book by readers who obviously have not taken the time to read it. If the \\"fact\\" of the holocaust can actually stand up to scrutiny, then those who take a knee-jerk reaction to revisionism should take the time at least to educate themselves on revisionist argument before accepting the holocaust myth with blind faith.

There is no hate here. No so-called anti-semitism. No pro-Nazi rhetoric. Anyone claiming so is either lying blatantly or simply hasn't read the book.Some holocaust authors claim they will not argue with revisionists like Butz! Of course! Because they simply cannot explain away or refute many of the arguments presented by the so-called 'other side'. Raul Hilberg is a classic example of a holocaust 'scholar' unable to successfully defend his case when skillfully probed by revisionists. His cross-examination at the Toronto trial of Holocaust denier Ernst Zundel was, in fact, a complete farce. He could not explain away many of the ambiguities in his book 'Destruction of the European Jews' and ended up making a very sorry spectacle of himself. Rudolf Vrba (I Cannot Forgive) was another who, when confronted on the witness stand, hemmed and hawed and finally cited, incredibly enough, 'poetic license' as the reason for many of the questionable claims recorded in his book.To the average person, I say, do your own research. Don't be afraid to consider other facts and points of view especially when they can be substantiated enough to claim some degree of credibility. This book by Arthur Butz is a big and important step in that direction.

The Nazis were a lot of disgusting things, but they weren't stupid. Much like everyone else in America, I was raised to believe in the holocaust as an article of faith.

In Canada, Germany and France, Arthur Butz is guilty of thought crimes for daring to raise disturbing questions about the \\"official\\" view of Holocaust. His main point is that, yes, perhaps as many as 6 million Jews died in concentration camps, BUT, they died as a result of typhus epidemics and NOT from intentional gassing in gas chambers - which Butz says is mere fabrication without any basis or evidence to support it. The gas - Zyklon B, was designed expressly for gassing clothing in order to control typhus epidemics. From that main point, Butz questions the integrity of the subsequent trials and seeks to know what the fabricators of the gassing story hoped to gain by their disinformation.During the two decades since I read Butz's book, I studied history on both sides of \\"the pond\\" and taught history on both sides of \\"the pond\\". Like Butz, I have not found proof of the gassing either. When I asked Professor Vazzano of Walsh University for the proof, his proof was to say \\"Believe me, it happened\\". I even queried Jehovah's Witnesses in the U.S. and U.K. for their versions of gassing stories since Hitler forced them to wear \\"purple triangles\\" and go to concentration camps too, but alas, they too have no stories or evidence either.As a history teacher, I can only say that I don't know if the 6 millions Jews and others including Jehovah's Witnesses who died in Hitler's concentration camps died from deliberate gassing in gas chambers as \\"officials\\" maintain, died from typhus epidemics and starvation as Butz's alleges, or died from a combination of those methods and perhaps others. I don't know because I wasn't there. And rather than outlaw Butz's disturbing questions about really happened, I would like to see these questions addressed and put to rest.

The argument concerns three key components of the 'presumed extermination of European Jewry'. Butz discusses mostly Auschwitz, where perhaps a million people died in gas chambers, but also the three 'Action Reinhardt' extermination camps (Treblinka, Belzec and Sobibor in Poland) and the 'Einsatzgruppen' death squads further east that together account for another three million dead. He thus takes on Gerald Reitlinger's The Final Solution (1953), early editions of Raul Hilberg's The Destruction of the European Jews (1961, 1968) and the studies of Levin, Poliakov and Dawidowitz.Butz uses a moral compass according to which lies are more likely than killing. He thinks the Allies and Zionist groups had strong motives to distort the record (to excuse their own actions and maintain morale) and traces several atrocity stories back to these sources. He makes a variety of reasonable points: e.g. belief in an unwritten German policy of using euphemistic language lends sinister significance to otherwise innocuous documents; and the Nuremberg trials admitted into evidence confessions gained by torture (as established at later trials held under English law). However, Butz also cites at length International Red Cross and other reports and statements by Himmler and Hitler that indicate exterminations took place, though not where or on what scale. His attempts to explain these away are at times implausible. He concludes that about four million supposed victims survived in Soviet-controlled Europe from where many emigrated, through displaced person camps, to the USA, Israel and other countries. The chilling 2.7 million reduction in the number of Jews in Poland he attributes to the transfer of Eastern Poland, where the Jews had congregated, to the USSR in 1945.Stylistically, the chapters are poorly structured and some have unhelpful titles (\\"Et Cetera\\" and \\"Remarks\\"). Whilst the term \\"Hoax\\" causes gratuitous offense, there is no obvious 'anti-semitism' on display: he does not caricature or generalize and his tone throughout is factual rather than emotive. The book has very narrow margins and the long, reproduced documents are in annoyingly small type. One reason to 'remember the Holocaust' is to prevent the repetition of its strangely boundless cruelty, so at odds with everyday experience. Butz helps us to look critically at the evidence for such irrational behavior and at its scale, though his 'case against' is at times a whitewash.Note: this is a review of the 1992 blue paperback edition."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"It was refreshing to read this politically incorrect book.

This review is for all you \\"historical revisionists\\".Every single time I give \\"revisionists\\" a chance, every time I read another book and approach it as I would approach any work of history that purports to be a serious study, I am faced with the disappointing truth. My criteria for judgement are always: Does the author have a good case? Is he honest? Can he think critically? Is he a sober and discriminating researcher?Let's just come out and say it: Butz is a deceitful pseudo-scholar whose words rest on a swamp of lies and cynicism. How can any respect at all be directed to this writer by the intelligent reader?I'm not even talking about his outlandish conclusions and half-truths. But I'd never waste the time involved to refute all this stuff, though I can understand the desire to do so. In fact, if I'm asked on my deathbed, \\"What would you have done differently, what do you most regret in your life?\\", way up at the top of the list will stand such regrets as, \\"I wish I'd not wasted what precious time I had by reading \\"historical revisionism.\\"But yes, I can read your mind:\\"So far you have not mentioned or criticized a single part of this groundbreaking work. You probably didn't even read it!\\"Oh yes I did, every page, though it was not pleasant, and I did tend to lose some concentration after I began to see the measure of the man, and the very low quality of the writing. What follows is the reason I had to regretfully cross off the name Butz from my list of \\"Great Scholars Who Have the Courage To Write Groundbreaking Controversial New Histories\\":Here's BUTZ'S VERSION of Rudolf Vrba's account of Himmler's July 17, 1942 inspection vist to Auschwitz, related by Butz in the \\"Rudolf Vrba\\" section of Chapter 3:\\"The prisoners were drawn up for inspection, and the orchestra was in readiness to play when Himmler arrived. As they waited, the leader of the orchestra:\\"[...] stood, baton raised, motionless, poised to weave music for the honored guest.And then it happened. The catastrophe that every actor dreads. The moment of horror that only great occasions merit. The crisis that seems to dog every moment of truth.In the tenth row outside our Block, the Block senior found Yankel Meisel without his full quota of tunic buttons.It took some seconds for the enormity of the crime to sink in. Then he felled him with a blow. [...]Out of sight, [...] they beat and kicked the life out of him. [...][...] Himmler's suite was twenty yards away. The baton moved [...] and the orchestra followed [...] with an excerpt from Aida.It was 'The Triumph March.' [...]He lined us up and rapped: 'I am the Reichsf&uuml;hrer. Let's see how you behave in front of me.'Slowly he marched down the ranks, a little killer aping a big killer, glaring at each of us in turn. If he found dirty finger nails or wooden shoes not properly blacked, he howled abuse at the offender and thumped him with his heavy bamboo cane. He even inspected us, nursery fashion, behind the ears and then went prowling through the barracks, searching for blankets which had not been folded with precision.\\"After a few lines, Butz adds:\\"The book manages to maintain this utterly incredible tone throughout, as you can verify by reading it, if you can stand it.\\"It is indeed incredible that people should behave like that. Orchestras in concentration camps? Brutal, inhuman and cruel murder over a missing button? Yet this is the real world of the camps, where people, be they imported SS or local talent, go animal because they can. You guys will never get it, will never understand the potential for humanity to sink under such conditions, nor understand the fantastic other-worldly confluences of life in the camps, such as a selection from \\"Aida\\" being performed at Auschwitz by a resident symphony orchestra, by the side of bloody murder.But you want to see here a real refutation of something, anything in this book that could possibly cause it to be looked upon with disfavor. You know, \\"The book carries with it its own condemnation\\" and such.It happens that the second part of Butz's quoted section of Vrba, beginning at \\"He lined us up and rapped, \`I am the Reichsf&uuml;hrer...' \\" was rather disingenuously presented by the impeccable scholar Butz. This scene occurred **before** Himmler's visit. Vrba specifically writes that the Block Senior made the inmates prepare and rehearse during the week before the big visit, by playing out that scene and others, however far removed they turned out to be from the events as they actually occurred later. They were \\"role playing\\" to ready themselves for the important upcoming event. Whatever you may think of the preparatory play-acting does not matter. It is what Vrba wrote that matters!Vrba then goes on to give a striking and perceptive description of the actual visit, where Himmler was a quiet observer, putting his intimidated German hosts at ease without stirring up gratuitous tension or calling undue attention to himself. The play-acting preparations show how little the inmates knew about Himmler, who they all imagined (with good reason) as an abusive monster at fingernail-inspection level. Read Vrba's actual account (the truthful one) on pages 2 - 7 of \\"I Escaped from Auschwitz\\" (Barricade Books, Fort Lee, 2002). (pagination may be different in other editions)No doubt Vrba meant to convey some gallows humor in his account. But the issue here - and you asked for it! - is Butz's disgraceful character, intentions and methods as clearly revealed in his book. Can anyone doubt that Butz aims to deceive here? He willfully forces a narrative from its true setting and transplants it to another, for the express purpose of making Vrba seem unreliable.Butz doesn't care what he has done, and he knows you won't care either. He actually invites the reader to read Vrba from the source, because he trusts that you will never bother to seek out the book. More importantly, he knows that even if his ruse is discovered, he can count on his worshipful fans not to care. Why else would he feel safe in performing such a low-class trick?OK - your turn. Someone defend him, please. Tell us that he is not guilty of fraud here. No useless statements like \\"it was a slip of the pen\\", as the rehearsal section in Vrba occurs 2 pages **before** he recounts Himmler's actual visit. Butz tacks it onto the end, **after** the material from the actual visit! He knew exactly what he was doing.Here's another pathetic lie that Butz knew he would get away with, solely because he knows that YOU, his target audience, are utterly uncritical.BUTZ writes as follows, near the beginning of his Vrba section. I chose the Vrba section to explore because Vrba's book is near me on the shelf, for easy checking.This is BUTZ now:\\"... in the book (page 128) Vrba writes that the girls working in the \\"Canada\\" area were in very good health, but in the WRB report (part I, page 31) these women were \\"beaten and brutalized and their mortality was much higher than among the men.\\"Unfortunately, Butz knows very well that Vrba was describing two completely different situations, which, exactly as in the Himmler section, he attempts to fuse together as one. In his Auschwitz book Vrba writes that most of the girls working in \\"Canada\\" appeared healthy. But in the WRB report, Vrba describes what happened to a certain group of Slovakian Jewish girls working in Canada. At first they lived on the other side of a wall near him in Auschwitz, where \\"Canada\\" was located. But one day these girls were sent to live in Birkenau. Vrba noted the change in their appearance when they reported back for work to Canada from their blocks in Birkenau, as treatment was harsh and cruel there, and they were \\"beaten and brutalized and their mortality was much higher than among the men.\\"Read it for yourself in Vrba (I Escaped from Auschwitz, 2002, p. 360-1). Don't despair - it took me all of 5 minutes to reach up and take Vrba's book off the shelf and find the reference. Yes, that is by far the most pathetic element in the sad \\"historical revision\\" story: It is so easy to find the holes, the distortions and lies. But nobody cares to. Why should they? They are already believers.Is anyone going to dispute my findings here with straight answers? Of course the fact of Butz's editing does not really call for debate. There it is staring us in the face. How about it, Mr. \\"SmokeNMirrors\\"? You enjoy accusing reviewers of never having read the book, and of not addressing specific issues. I have offered 2 specific examples taken directly from the book. Certainly enough for a focused discussion. Oh, let me guess your response: \\"But what about the Holocaust? You still have not proved its historical veracity!\\"My intent is not to prove the historicity of the Holocaust. I am reviewing a book. My intent is to prove that the book's author, Arthur Butz, is a lying phoney. And this I have done.Perhaps you feel that these are the ONLY 2 examples of Butz's mendacity. Let me put it like this: You have ordered a dish in a restaurant. You find that the cook has urinated on the rice. \\"Go on\\", your companion tells you, \\"try another dish.\\" So you order the beef stew, upon which you find that the cook has deposited a mound of his feces. Your companion advises, \\"Well try another. Maybe there is something good in this restaurant.\\" One does not need to be a genius to realize that it is time to close down this place!The issue is this: Your great hero, Mr. Butz, the Courageous Historian, the man who exposes the Great Lie, behaves like a mere cheater. This is absolutely classic - a liar who hates other liars, and sees them everywhere. Butz is a common hypocrite - and a boring one. Yet you all (his fans) kiss the ground he walks on. Mental imbalance is the only explanation.I'm through with all of you - Butz and the rest. Sorry for the anger, but there is so much to be angry about. Maybe you feel that Butz's two comically inept lapses offer little reason to tear down his life's work. Yet Butz placed these two crude examples of deception within pages of each other in his book! Now how would you feel about researching and refuting all those other pages, dredging up every source he mentions, after discovering his pathetic cutting and pasting with a book that is available everywhere? Right, me neither... because - I've had it!"},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"Arthur Butz made a great contribution to holocaust history in writing this book, but the modern reader would do better to start with Germar Rudolf's \\"Lectures on the Holocaust\\" or Thomas Dalton's \\"Debating the Holocaust.\\" In comparison with these books, Butz' work is somewhat of a rocky read. People predisposed to dislike Butz' conclusions will likely struggle to follow his train of thought, as he does not always hold the reader's hand (witness the negative reviews here: not one of these critical reviewers was able to engage with Butz' central arguments). There are many truly fundamental arguments in the present book, which anyone seriously interested in the holocaust should find the time to read. However, holocaust revisionism had advanced tremendously in the past 35 years, and more recent books are simply better places to start.I would suggest using this book for supplementary reading of a general character, after one has read Rudolf's and Dalton's books."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"Excellent book, very well researched and written and powerfully argued.

This person told me that the Nazis had never committed genocide against the Jews and that those who died in the concentration camps had died from typhus.

I meant to prove, at least to myself, that \\"The Hoax of the Twentieth Century\\" was wrong. I intended to read other books, books that supported the story of the mass murder of the Jews.I expected the book to be a vicious racist diatribe. It was nothing of the sort. It was well reasoned, and the author backed up what he said with good sources. Indeed, I found his sources much easier to check out than the sources of the more mainstream history books on the subject.If you are looking for a book on this subject that will merely confirm your preconceptions, then you don't want this one. If, on the other hand, you are someone who is willing to consider unconventional points of view, you might find this book enlightening, as well as disturbing, and certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"The Hoax Of The Twentieth Century was one of the earliest revisionist works and probably the hardest to refute ever since it was first published; indeed mainstream authors (cough) have always been wary of engaging Butz in any kind of controversy. The book is a sweeping examination of some of the finer details, in which we know the devil himself resides, of the \\"Jewish holocaust\\", covering so many different topics that it can rightly be considered a sort of miniature \\"holocaust\\" encyclopaedia; from Jewish population statistics to \\"war-crimes\\" trials to the industrial and economic role of prison camps to the reliability of the eyewitnesses to the history of the magic \\"6 million\\" number to the evolution of the propaganda stories to the aerial photography, and so on.My only criticism is a very general one, the fact that it is so all- (or nearly all-)encompassing the treatment of many of the individual subjects is, whilst still impossible to refute and at the time of publication groundbreaking, sometimes relatively superficial. These have of course all been expanded upon in other works in the Holocaust Handbook series. The truth is that this should be the first book in the series; for anyone who generally reads series of books in order the knowledge gained after reading 6 heavyweight volumes preceding this one slightly dilutes its impact. Therefore the criticism probably should more rightly be aimed at the publishers of the series. Still highly recommended for anyone new to the subject - indeed, read this first! - and for any serious students who have not read it, it is certainly worth reading for completeness and to see the evolution of the revisionist case.It should also be pointed out that anyone negatively reviewing such a technical work must of course give valid technical reasons why any part of the thesis is invalid. Without exception so far, negative reviewers have given the sum total of zero valid technical reasons for their negative reviews, going instead with emotion, preconception and ignorance of technical realities. It should also be stated that, again without exception, anyone in the future who negatively reviews this work quite categorically has not read it. I say this with total confidence - indeed, I challenge any naysayer to convincingly refute a single word Butz wrote - and for a very good reason: it is impossible to refute the truth."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"&quot;The Hoax of the Twentieth Century&quot; is an important book that should be read by every teacher mandated by the state laws to teach about this legend. It effectively makes the case that the industrialized extermination of Jews by gassing never happened.When the book was first published in 1976, the canonical story was that gassings even occurred in concentration camps, such as Dachau and Buchenwald in Germany. Nowadays, of course, no historian believes this to be true, not even those at Vad Yashem in Israel. Butz is partly responsible for this revision of the accepted story as well as for discrediting the tales of soap, lampshades and the &quot;6 million.&quot;The scope and thoroughness with which Butz has researched this important historical question is impressive enough that its sale has actually been banned in several countries. It has convincing arguments that are much maligned by people who have never read it, and by the censors who just wish it would go away. It has tables, maps, graphs, photographs, references and full quotations from hard to obtain documents. It uses the hard logic of an engineer to arrive at the truth, not the emotional hysteria of the propagandists who are more interested in the loot of the reparations, support for Israel, and all the pleasures that come with hornswoggling the gullible."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":"\\"THE FATE OF LEGENDS\\" BY SIR JOHN BAGOT GULP (!)COMMANDER, ARAB LEGION OF TRUTHThe fate of legends generally goes through several stages. First, there is the age of credulity, in which \\"everyone knows\\" the legend really happened. Thousands of Jews testify to the existence of \\"gas chambers\\" and millions of purported deaths. A kangaroo court and thousands of emaciated bodies appear to be conclusive proof of the legend. The world sobs and weeps while a Zionist state is born. Next comes the age of skepticism. After a period of about thirty years of absolute faith in the legend skepticism begins. Why are there so many survivors of an extermination still around? Why do they collect ever increasing reparations as they rise from the grave? Next comes the age of investigation as banned German records pour out of the former Soviet archives. \\"Gas chambers\\" are shown to be delousing operations. Millions of victims become mere thousands, only a small minority of them Jews. Finally comes the age of repression. Holocaust Deniers are imprisoned for telling the truth. They are fired from their jobs and turned into unemployable social outcasts. Their findings are excluded from all respectable journals of opinion and discourse. Ultimately comes the age of enlightenment. The Jews are forced to beg for forgiveness after denying it to others. Their tyranny is broken and the world rejoices.Such is the \\"fate of legends\\" in the modern world.This nifty little parody adequately describes the fate of Professor Arthur Butz's famous work - except that the age of enlightenment has not yet arrived. We are currently in the age of repression as the Jews employ every conceivable technique to cover up the hoax that confirms the Protocols. The stakes are high; the elders of Zion are terribly nervous. The terrible fate of complete exposure is not yet upon them but they snarl, hiss and play the part of the vampire awaiting the dawning of the sun.

I surfed the web for transcripts of the Wansee conference proceedings and found nothing resembling what Butz published.The book includes an interesting collection of documents which I could not get off the web and could be valuable as a source reader if I were convinced the translations were intact and accurate.Many of his arguments have been demolished by the passage of time, for instance his argument about the lack of intelligence reports is refuted by Breitman's &quot;Official secrets&quot; a book written using inteligence reports declassified in the 1990s.Despite this it was valuable reading for me as it set me off on a trail where I found a lot of dark corners in WW II, such as the zionist collaborator with the nazis who later held high office in the Israeli government and the way big business managed to provide Germany with supplies, after America entered the war, while denying them to the US forces: all this information is in my &quot;waiting to read the sources&quot; pile.In short, while I think Butz is wrong reading the book and checking the evidence was something I would not have done otherwise.I would fault his references, which often omitted things I was interested in, such as the first world war anti German propaganda tales, which in turn were recycled from earlier wars and resurfaced in the Balkans, for example in the tale of the bowl of Serbian Eyes one partisan was alleged to keep.Like Mein Kampf and Hitler's Secret book you should read it, but be sceptical. It's illegal to own Butz or Mein Kampf in many countries, and that is something I disagree with."},{"Title":"The hoax of the twentieth century","review":". . .

I am very satisfied with the purchase."},{"Title":"Open-Ended Stories","review":"Excellent stories. Students grades 6 - 12 love them. The Authors should be encouraged to produce a revised edition. I use the 1970 edition, as a reward. Students look forward to them."},{"Title":"WILDERNESS: A Tale of the Civil War","review":"This book is triggering some sort of artistic attack. I read this because I wanted to understand the work of another writer I admire who cited this book as an influence.As an aside: Robert Penn Warren's poetry works for me. That says quite a lot since I only have about three poets I can say I enjoy at all. It is maybe easier to focus on the words and images when I am not trying to keep track of a story--something I had a hard time doing in Wilderness.What interests me about the book are the poetic tricks my friend talked about. I LOVE the idea of laying down a code that only people who are really paying attention will tune into, or even better to maybe paint a picture they themselves aren't even aware they are looking at.The author uses color in a concrete way, repeating words like white over and over, or green, or going on and on mixing the way he repeats the word stone with other descriptions of words like gray, slate, and other things that call to mind a certain solidity and coolness. (I am starting to sound like an English professor wannabe on meth.) But what bugs me about myself here is that I am giving the author my patient attention and thoughtful consideration because I know he is someone to pay attention to--this author won three Pulitzer Prizes for God's sake!One thing I can rave about: the characters in the story are not black and white, they are all in the middle of moral and ethical difficulties. They are real. This renews my faith in the human mind's ability to see the various shades of gray in our experiences and characters (ourselves). So I am thrilled to say I didn't miss everything!One example from Wilderness: A character who studied the bible all his life, wanted to be left in peace and found he had to kill the \\"'scripters\\" who came to collect him to avoid going off to war and killing any more people. After this he had to live in the wild to avoid being found. One night he wakes his wife up laughing (the giggling and laughter throughout the book make me think half of the cast is insane) and says:\\"...the Lawd God said thou shalt not kill and then put a fellow in a tight whar he had to kill to keep from killen.\\"What would the writer's digest book on dialogue say about that one? Here is probably an example of knowing the rules and then bashing them to dust.Back to the character's dilemma: when you read what this guy turns into, it does make you think the entire world must have been, and still is, totally off it's rocker and there is no such thing as sanity, morality, or right and wrong. I compare this to the way things work today and feel not a little silly for believing anything different.Earlier in the book one character explains the necessity of conscription.\\"...when the heroes are dead, you have to fill the ranks some way. Even with ordinary mortals. Who much prefer to stay at home and make money and sleep with their wives.\\"None of that sounds familiar right... All war books seem to end up being relevant at least in this way.Anyone looking for time period details would find lots of good ones in here: the sutlers, the way people talk, the funky facial hair, the games people played outside their tents, the awful things people did to each other, and what people on the ground really thought about the whole business. I really appreciate when people don't fall into pat moral categories and just want to get on with their lives. This resonates and feels honest. We are not all heroes in the face of injustice, racism, apathy, greed, bullying, lust and all the rest of it. Some people overcome and some just try to get by."},{"Title":"The Lawnchair Astronomer","review":"This chatty book is a great introduction to what you can see from your backyard at night. The author doesn't go into much detail as he discusses each object (the planets and a few of the more prominent deep-sky galaxies and nebulas.) There are a few sidebars that give interesting historical trivia. A great book to interest someone in astronomy or an arm-chair astronomer, but not a good book to use while actually looking at the stars. The b&amp;w photos is the book are a waste of ink given that they are so dark. And, the star chart included is really nothing more than a constellation chart. Few stars are included and no deep sky objects. A nice chart for the wall, but not a good reference."},{"Title":"The Lawnchair Astronomer","review":"I bought this book a long time ago, read it in a few days and I've started noticing things in the sky more. Highly recommended for a book to read in the spring/summer time (warm enough to actually stay out at night)"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I enjoy Cussler's Dirk Pitt stories - they are great lighthearted adventures which also throw in a little maritime history or science. Trojan Odyssey is a fine example of a Dirk Pitt novel, with three great adventures wrapped into one story: rescuing a water hotel, searching for proof that Odysseus' adventures took place in the Atlantic instead of the Mediterranean, and stopping a plot to cause cataclysmic climate change as a means to gain wealth and power. If you like Pitt stories I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. If you're looking for hyper-realistic thrillers, Cussler is not your author.A P-3 Orion aircraft makes a cameo appearance as \\"Galloping Gertie\\", the 'hurricane hunter' belonging to the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration.I enjoyed how Dirk's children get to work with him to solve the main mystery, while Al yet again serves as faithful sidekick. This book is a bit longer than some of Pitt's stories, with the first 150 pages being an interesting yet almost throw-away introduction...almost like two books were blended together. The wrap-up of the book certainly makes it appear that the Dirk Pitt stories have come to a close, with lots of little threads tied up nicely."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I especially love how Cussler mixes history with science and adventure. It made this book really awesome. Plus that was cool how Cussler did a little cameo appearance at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I just finished a read through of the entire Dirk Pitt series, and overall I'd say that as the series went on, it did not improve.Now, I don't think that anyone expects great literature, but the author seemed to get caught up in the trap or escalating danger rather than variations of situations to approach.And as the series progressed, more errors crept in. Perhaps Cussler's reputation made his editors think that they no longer had to edit his manuscripts, I don't know. In this book, obviously the hurricane path issues are obvious. Another item, for those who have read the whole series, is that Lauren Smith's father who's death was cronicled in Vixen 03 was resurrected to come to the wedding.Oh, and although it might be cute, the ever increasing roles that Cussler wrote himself into got to feel just silly.Overall, I can't say that I'd recommend this unless someone had read the rest of the books and just wanted to get the series over and done with. Read the first couple novels in the series instead."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"If Clive Cussler wrote this piece of garbage, he's either lost his talent, or he's submitting copy to make money. This is the worst Dirk Pitt novel in the series...and where the hell were the editors. The copy just doesn't make sense in places, or is laden with inconsistencies and inaccuracies. E.g., Cussler (or whomever) describes a meal of lobster thermidor; two paragraphs later, it turns into lobster sauteed in butter. Another: Pitt jumps in the water during a period when he's in the calm eye of a hurricane. Next paragraph, the hurricane's second half has come and gone and Pitt starts to do his routine...but what the hell happened when the hurricane hit...no mention...what did Pitt do, slide up and down the mountainous waves? Third...it's a Cadillac ESCALADE, not Esplanade!This is the kind of rip-off that's becoming more and more prevalent in publishing. Do yourself a favor and skip this book; if you must read it, wait until you can find an old paperback for 25 cents a few years from now!Oh, and by the way, please retire Mr. Cussler!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"While well-plotted, Trojan Odyssey is so unevenly written that I found myself distracted every few pages by another clumily constructed sentence. I could tolerate the bland two-dimensional characters, but when I read a best-selling author who's seemingly so indifferent to the quality of his work as to fail to proofread it, I begrudge him his literary success.I won't be reading Clive Cussler again."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Wow, where can I start? This book was truly dreadful in pretty much every imaginable manner. Not only was the plot completely absurd and filled with glaring inconsistencies, as already mentioned, but was totally transperant. In this type of book a little artistic license can be granted for the sake of a gripping storyline, but this book offers nothing in the way of suspense. The characters are ridiculous cardboard cutouts which do nothing to fix the book's predictability. I've never read any other of Cussler's novels (and now never will), so I'm not sure if his writing is always like this, but here he seems to have little command of the English language, his prose is drowning in mangled phrases, overblown cliches and pointless technical jargon.A travesty from start to finish - don't waste your time on this book!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I read some good early reviews on Amazon and bought the book on a whim. It's lousy, like his last several have been. Besides the rehashed plot, two-dimensional characters, and poor dialog, the book suffers from horrible editing. I'm sure Cussler can afford a proof reader and editor, but you couldn't prove it by this book. There are time/space conflicts, contradictions, subject/verb agreement problems, etc. I love Cussler's early stuff (Raise the Titanic, Sahara, etc.) but save your money and skip this one. If you want to read adventure pick up Lonesone Dove or early Cussler."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Blah blah blah, I laugh at this idiot who tries to rewrite history in his own words, a total moron, cant believe this garbage got published."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Someone gave me this book, plus Valhalla Rising. I'm not sure why I continued reading after the first few pages. Maybe morbid fascination.

Dennis Halsey."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"See storyline above.Cussler again delivers a high level adventure that should please all his fans. This time he throws in a little history about Odysseus' great voyage as well as a lesson in Celtic Culture and the Druids.I thought this was a well rounded adventure and a great escape. One of Cusslers best. It includes all the regular characters, as well as introducing Dirk Pitt's new found son and daughter, Dirk and Summer, who have an adventure of their own. You'll get no disappointment reading this newest adventure.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"OK, a bunch of disconnected &quot;historical&quot; factoids which are never really tied together coupled with a mystery scheme to get rich. Throw in the usual cast of characters and predictable events and you end up with a mess.The good news (for fans of Loren), is that her Dad who was killed off 3 years before Vixen 03 (a very good book, BTW) has had a miraculous recovery from his death. I guess Vixen 03 was a &quot;dream&quot; (aka Bobby Ewing) - like the dream that we all have that Cussler could still put together a good read. Clive - TV programs use people called &quot;continuity checkers&quot; - you might want to investigate that! I also found the obligatory CC appearance at the end to be even more contrived than usual."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Clive Cussler's Trojan Odyssey, while not his top shelf material is a step up from some of the latest drivel that he has put his name to. Cussler resurrects his irrepressible hero NUMA special projects director Dirk Pitt. Pitt in the Valhalla Rising adventure, had been shockingly introduced to his previously unbeknown children, fraternal twins Dirk and Summer. Raised by their mom, the late Summer Moran they both pursued careers in marine sciences and were now both working for NUMA.The Pitt twins were researching a dirge to marine life in the Caribbean called the brown crud which was destroying the delicate ecological coral reef systems and surrounding sea life. While conducting underwater investigation they came across an archeologic relic which subsequently was discovered to be of Celtic origin and 3000 years old. Such a discovery in the middle of the Caribbean was inexplicable. Their research was cut short by the formation of a massive hurricane of super colossal magnitude which was threatening the Dominican Republic and an immense state of the art, luxurious, floating hotel, the Ocean Wanderer moored two miles off the coast.Miraculously (and unbelievably) Dirk Pitt and his sidekick Al Giordino helicopter through the &quot;perfect&quot; storm to save the day towing the hotel to safety and rescue Dirk and Summer who became trapped inside an undersea habitat.The Ocean Wanderer hotel is owned by a mysterious Mr. Specter an obese billionaire whose face is hidden by huge sunglasses, a turban and facial coverings. Spector is the owner of Odyssey, a giant research and construction corporation whose upper management is composed entirely of statuesque red haired women versed in Celtic lore and Druidism. Pitt and Giordino probe an Odyssey facility based in Nicaragua which is determined to be the source of the brown crud. While reconnoitering they discover that the crud is a by-product of a heinous, diabolical scheme that will tip the balance of world power.Cussler in Trojan Odyssey puts forth an intriguing explanation for the origins, locations and mechanics of the Trojan War and the subsequent voyages of Odysseus which were clever and fascinating. If this was Cussler's literary swan song, he departs on a high note which ties up many of his character's loose ends."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Couldn't wait for this one to come out. Well written as all of Cussler's books. He seems to have toned down the action a bit, but still managed to keep me riveted. Unfortunately Cussler is chosing to retire Dirk Pitt and Al Giordano.Still I'm looking forward to the next one by Cussler, I believe it'll be out in July, and it is called Lost City, most likely with Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have read all of Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels and I have enjoyed every single one. As for TROJAN ODYSSEY, the best recommendation I can make is do NOT read it before VALHALLA RISING. The introduction of key characters in TROJAN ODYSSEY can be found on the last couple of pages of VALHALLA RISING. The introduction of these two new characters is a bit of a shock. Thus, I cannot reveal who they are, but I can say that meeting them in VALHALLA RISING makes TROJAN ODYSSEY a great anticipation.Without exception, Dirk Pitt has always been the source of the initial hypothesis for the cause of the earth shaking calamity about to erupt. In this case, a computer beats Pitt to the punch. As for me, I thought this was a sad commentary on plot development. Following the thought processes of the hero is an extremely important component of my reading pleasure. Thus in this novel, in the battle between man and machine, machine wins. Although the hypotheses comes from the computer, Pitt is the one who develops the precise plan to save the earth, the European economy, and, of course, identify the true wrong doers.In Cussler's past novels I have always found myself getting lost in the reading. I traveled in my mind. The TROJAN ODYSSEY did not share this characteristic with his other novels. This is not to say that the story line is bad, the novel lacks that metaphysical quality and intensive writing style that makes me travel with my mind.On the last couple of pages, Dirk is facing a gerontological crossroad. He has to make a critical decision, but doesn't. Clearly, Cussler will have Pitt make a decision at the beginning of an upcoming novel. I feel sure I know the final decision (as most readers would); however, the implications for the decision are going to lead to a whole new series of twisted intrigue."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I always hate how stilted Cussler's dialogue is, but every story is great fun and full of adventure, albeit unbelievable adventure! And where did he come up with those names for his characters in this book??? Mason Jar??? Really. But the suspense and adventure are as good as any other of his books. I can always count on them to be entertaining stories!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Clive's most recent books have been very much influenced by archealogist Graham Hancock. In 1997, a true life sunken city was found off the coast of Okinawa in 70 feet of water. What is so amazing about this city is that not only does it have pyramids, but also a Greek style ampitheater with an area called \\"the stage\\" that has to be seen to be truly awed. It's Grahams summarization, based on this city ans several others recently discovered off of India, Malta, and Florida, that there is a missing chapter of human history. He goes on that 11,600 years ago, we were in an ice age. Then suddenly, quite suddenly, the ice age ended. The oceans rose 360 feet and a large amount of the human race was wiped out. Then, as in the present day, 75% of the human population lived within 50 miles of a shoreline (think New York, L.A., Houston, Chicago et. al.).We not only see Graham's influence in Atlantis Found, but either Graham plagiarizes Cussler, or vice versa, because certain phrases are shared.Moving on to Trojan Odyssey, Dirk's children make an astounding find in a Caribbean reef. This eventually leads to Dirk and Al geeting involved, and predictably coming to the recue. There is some long coming twists at the end of the book, but Cussler seems influenced by Clancy in these changes. Well worth the price. Read it and love it as I do."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I totally enjoyed it. I still find Dirk Pitt to be the quintessential hero - the books have more action than james bond. Thought the hurricane was exciting. Cussler's books are always great escapism - some maybe better than others, but you are always assured of a fun read &amp; this selection was no exception."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"While I have always enjoyed Cussler's work for what it is, a light read where the good guys always win and have some fun blowing stuff up along the way, this latest novel is just too formula driven from the same mold as all the others. There are even scenes in this book which are cookie cutters from others, specifically the yacht chase from Sahara. I enjoyed reading Dirk and Al in action one more time, I just wish the story had been a touch more original."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Granted there are logical errors--yes, Loren's father being alive was an error, just like no mention of the Titanic occuring in Vahalla Rising. But these are not the reason why anyone reads a Dirk Pitt novel!! Like an old fashioned roller coaster, people read Pitt because he is fun, exciting, and a good escape from a world that would be a little less interesting if he wasn't around. Perhaps Cussler did have some problems while writing this opus--notice the dedication--and in an early interview Cussler has said he was slowing down and having trouble writing. Yet even with all this, Trojan Odyssey is a fast, fun, amazing work. Perhaps, in the future, young Dirk will replace his father as the Special Project director and we'll have a new generation of Pitt adventures!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"If Dirk Pitt is OLD to you . . .Then this book shows it. OK, the basic storyline is fun and rumbles along with the typical sociopathic private corporation with its private security force and its plans to make a fortune while incidentally creating a global disaster. The ancient shipwreck story is straight out of Homer (of the Odyssey, not Simpson, but with Cussler you never know) by way of Cambridge, England.So where do the signs of age creep in? First, the finale really doesn't involve much of a shoot-'em-up and Pitt (and even some of the bad guys) seem actually to avoid killing people - unless absolutely necessary.Then Loren's father shows up at an intimate event and neither Dirk nor Loren nor Cussler (who also shows up) remembers to say \\"Welcome to Washington Mr Smith. How come you managed to come back from the dead after being found in a submerged plane wreck several novels ago?\\"OK I still had fun reading it, but zero points for editing and nowhere near as good as Inca Gold.If Dirk Pitt is NEW to you . . .These books are fun to read but don't expect a lot of depth. We are talking airport books with lots of action but very linear plot development and close to zero character development.Cussler is pretty good on technical stuff like boats, guns and diving equipment. At least, I think he is, but I'm not sure. His books abound with lots of bizarre technical errors on other subjects. In one book he talks of \\"square acres\\". In this book, he gets into the chemistry of a revolutionary new fuel cell based at one point on ammonia and oxygen and at another on nitrogen and oxygen. Let's just say he's being inconsistent and not even discuss feasibility (it is supposed to be fiction after all). At least the hypothetical science is no more misinformed than in his other books.But let me say this, I enjoy reading Cussler's books - just don't look for a lot of depth. Cussler claims that he wanted Dirk Pitt to be a kind of underwater James Bond and he comes close to that goal. When he strays from his area of expertise (boats, guns and diving), Cussler tries to impress us with Pitt's sophistication in all matters - just as Ian Fleming would with 007. But come on! Chardonnay with steak! And it might be nice to see Pitt order something foreign, like a biriani or a moussaka or paella for a change. You won't see it because Cussler also has a barely disguised xenophobia that runs through all his plots - OK Bond killed his share of Russians in the SMERSH days, but only in the line of duty and Bond would have been shaken, not stirred, by Dirk's ordering a frou-frou white wine with a blood-red steak.As I said earlier on for the OLD readers, try Inca Gold. Maybe you'll get hooked. Just take it for what it is - fun - and don't get too serious about it."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have been reading Clive Cussler novels for 25 years. He has not written a bad novel yet. His stories are pure escapist, action adventure yarns. Do not judge his books by the two that have been made into movies. Sahara doesn't follow the novel at all. I think some of the other reviewers on this site are too [...] a novel that is soley intended to be mind candy. This is like a comic book with no pictures. A relaxing read perfect for the beach or a long flight. Keep'em coming Clive!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"the other reviews pretty much covered it: bad/no editing, annoying new pitt kid characters, scenes that could have been dramatic and page-turning but instead drab, big plot mistakes.the formula doesnt bother me, because many of the pitt novels follow the formula; many of the ealier ones work well within it . . . refer to shock wave or even atlantis found.all i ask from a cussler novel is to be amazed and informed in an exciting way, but i had to put this book down after a couple hundred pages. the opening had a lot of potential, but then it went nowhere, very slowly.i thought at first it was me--i havnt read a cussler novel in five years, but instead have been focusing on \\"fine literature\\" and reputable writers for my creative writing degree. i loved these books, but after so much dense prose i decided to reward myself with some fun reading instead. have i become jaded from so much classic liturature? nah, this is just plain horrible.if you're looking for a fun read, try the harry potter books or the da vinci code, just like everyone else."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"The Dirk Pitt series that has sprung from the keyboard of Clive Cussler over the past 20 years has badly needed a transfusion of excitement. That excitement is found in \\"Trojan Odyssey\\". Harkening back to a time when Cussler wrote more involved and complicated plots, \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" has a lot going for it. The staple characters, Pitt, Al Giordino, Admiral Sandecker, Rudi Gunn, and others are present as well as Dirk Pitt's newly discovered children, Dirk Jr. and Summer. While the two Pitt children are little more than sidebars in the plot, they are, nonetheless, being groomed by Cussler to replace Dirk Sr. and Al very shortly.The book's plot deals with the plan of a nefarious character (known as Specter) to create a global disaster involving a new ice age. Specter and his band of Amazon (Druid) female followers have begun building a tunnel through Nicaragua that will link the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and create a temperature swing in the water temperature that will have a drastic effect on the climate of any land mass north of the 30th parallel.Dirk and Al do their best to foil the plan and and involved in a number of interesting situations along the way. Cussler actually revives the Pitt franchise somewhat with \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" and leaves his readers wanting more. Based on the ending, however, this reviewer is not sure that will happen with the Dirk Pitt series, but the ending at least left the door open to more adventures with Dirk and Al.If you're a Dirk Pitt fan, you will want to add this novel to your collection. It will not disappoint!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I think everyone has beaten to death the story of this book so I don't see a need to give a synopsis.I just enjoyed this book as a good beach read! If you are a true Dirk Pitt fan this is a fun one to read.Without giving away a lot of spoilers, this should really be the last Dirk Pitt book written. Dr. Cussler did a great job of cleanning up any loose ends. He's done a great job of giving all the true fans an ending that really is worthy of ending the series.However, it appears that this won't be the last book he writes for Pitt fans but it does appear a little bit that the next book will be written with his son. Could be nice to have a fresh view on things. Could also be interesting to see where he takes everything now that new things are in place.But, before I end this thing, does anyone else have a problem with the relationship between Dirk Pitt Jr. and his sister?! Thankfully, it was explained that they had \\"girlfriends/boyfriends\\" but without that, the relationship was a little too odd. Just my two cents!Bottom line, read this book as a Dirk Pitt fan. It's really important I think and it's also pretty fun."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Every few years, Dirk Pitt saves the world from an ecological disaster. This daunting task is always achieved, but only after harrowing adventures, dastardly villans, and heroics that are beyond mere mortals, such as I.This book is no exception. It IS a page-turner, a roller-coaster ride, and a lot of fun. It is NOT great literature or scholarly research. If that is what you want to read right now, then, as some other reviewers have suggested, go elsewhere for the moment. When you are ready for fun, read Trojan Odyssey.What I always enjoy about Cussler's work is the &quot;over the top&quot; physical deeds of heroism of Dirk and Al. Although they are getting a bit older, they still provide the thrills.While this may not be his best (I'm still partial to Sahara) it is very much worth the read for fans. Perhaps those who are new to Cussler's work should go back to a book that predates Flood Tide....get to know the players, and enjoy them. Just a thought. But for me, I wanted a &quot;Dirk Pit fix&quot; to enjoy, and I did."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have read Clive Cussler novels for over 20 years and count some of his novels as the best I've ever read, in particular Sahara, Night Probe and Atlantis Found. I picked up Trojan Odyssey pretty much the day it came out and, like most of his books, devoured it quickly. And I have to admit that when I was done, I didn't have that &quot;Wow!&quot; reaction like I have had with many of his books, but I did enjoy it.I thought the typical catastrophic event that pervades Clive's novels was novel indeed. An evil corporation attempts to freeze out Europe using underground tunnels to attampt to change water temperatures in the oceans. He hasn't done that one before. Dirk Pitt and his partner Al Giordino again go through much agony to save the planet once again.Of course, what has changed here is the addition to the storytelling of Dirk Pitt's newly discovered twins, Summer and Dirk, who made their initial appearance at the end of Clive's previous novel, Valhalla Rising. I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of the twins, primarily because they are exactly like their namesakes (their mother, Summer Moran, was a character in the very first Pitt novel, Pacific Vortex). I wish Clive had made them a different from Dirk Sr. and Summer Sr. But I was glad that they only have a secondary role here. I hope it stays that way in the future.All that said, if you've never read a Cussler novel, I think you'll enjoy it. If you've read the entire Cussler catalog, I can see why you might be disappointed a little. But understand that Clive wrote this with a heavy heart as he lost his wife of 40+ years, Barbara, to cancer early in 2003. He still plugged away for his fans, so I'm going to cut him some slack. I'll bet the next Pitt novel will be a great one!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Trojan Odyssey written by Clive Cussler is a fictious novel that is easy to read and is pure adventure entertainment. Dirk Pitt, Cusslers alter ego, battles a deadly foe as in his other books, but things are a bit different in this book, Pitt has help.After finishing \\"Valhalla Rising\\" we are introducted to two new characters... these being Dirk Pitt's fraternal twin children with Summer Moran... Summer and Dirk. This introduction of Pitt's grown children makes for some interesting reading and scenes in the book.Cussler fleshes out his characters in this book and we get a pretty good impression as to who's who and what's what. Cussler's books are entertaining and they all follow closely to a pattern and this book is no exception. Here Dirk Pitt doesn't make an appearence till page 102 so we get a lot of background and some interesting underwater scenes with Summer and Dirk,Jr.Of course, there is a meglomaniac involved with a world disaster, the mysterious Mr. Specter is the current edition. This book has bits and pieces of Celtic lore and Druidnesses making for an interesting read.This isn't one of Cussler best book, but it isn't one of his worst either. I gave this book a solid 4 stars for it's readability... it's bubble gum sugar treat for the brain. It is an entertaining read with dazzling suspense and really good action. This is a book that shows Dirk Pitt getting older, ready to wrap things up with facing off with the bad guys, and it has some twists and turns in it to make it interestingly intriguing."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"One very important point to remember when reading Clive Cussler books, they are meant to be purely entertaining. Any rescue or feat of survival that appears possible in the real world is merely accidental, the escapes from certain death are to be expected and accepted.Dirk's back, but there has been a major change to his life. He has discovered that he is the father of a pair of fraternal twins who are now 23 years old and he has had to make a complete readjustment of his life's priorities. His children, named Summer and Dirk, are every bit as intrepid as their father and have both been given jobs working with him at the National Underwater and Marine Agency (NUMA). The whole Pitt family are all involved in the start of adventure, with Dirk and Summer trying to work out the origin of a massive slick of brown crud that is killing the sea-life in the Caribbean. Like so many other Dirk Pitt adventures it appears that a mysterious multi-billionaire megalomaniac is behind the environmental disaster in the making, with even grander and earth shattering plans in store. Again, like other Dirk Pitt stories, the evil mastermind is willing to use deadly force to keep his nefarious activities a secret. It's up to Dirk and his sidekick Al Giordino to save the day - and the world.Clive Cussler sticks to his tried and true formula, starting with a brief history lesson, this time harking back to the Trojan Wars around 1190 B.C. and then fast forwarding to 2006 and the research being undertaken in the Caribbean where, lo and behold they come across an ancient artefact. As usual, a nice job is made of marrying the ancient story to the present day crisis. The second part of the formula involves Dirk Pitt saving the world, yet remaining stoically modest about his role in proceedings. We all know it's going to happen; it's just a matter of how Dirk's going to get us there.Unfortunately, this Dirk Pitt thriller isn't the fast-paced thrill ride of earlier books. You get the distinct impression that Dirk Pitt is getting tired and is preparing to call it a day. The usual snap is missing and the heights of excitement just aren't reached, probably reflective of Dirk's malaise. Sure, the corny dialogue, improbable escapes and unbelievable rescues are there, but the edge feels as though it's missing. Could it be that the young Pitts will soon be taking over from their old man?If you've never read a Dirk Pitt story before I would advise against starting with this one. Dirk Pitt has come a long way and been through many adventures and does quite a bit of reminiscing about the past. Better books to start with (and these are the first ones I read) might be Dragon, Sahara or Inca Gold, but don't forget the warning at the top of the review because this can't be stressed often enough, these books aren't to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Sigh. For something like twenty years these have been my guilty pleasures. I've eagerly bought each new Dirk Pitt adventure the week, or even the day, it was released. This will probably be the last.The copyright on this book is held by something called &quot;Sandecker, RLLLP&quot;, which seems to mean that it wasn't written by Clive himself. The writing in the first 2/3 of the book is simply terrible. The plot is sketchy and formulaic: historic nautical event, modern disaster averted by our heroes while finding some artifact, trip to Perlmutter's, research by Yaeger, etc., etc.It usually works for me, but this time it felt like the author was going through the motions. The dialogue is even more stiff than usual -- and that's saying something for a Cussler book! Even the character names are ... weak -- Specter, a pair named Dodge &amp; Ford, a island native named Moreau (as least he's not a doctor).One of the hallmarks of the older Cussler books was his accuracy and the chance to learn a little something. Here, the book loses ALL credibility when in the first 25-50 pages, you have a meteorologist simply make up a name for a hurricane. I can't imagine Clive, who's spent his share of time on the sea, either not knowing or not thinking his readers would know about the pre-ordained list of hurricane names from the NOAA or whomever. A small factual quibble perhaps, but to me it was quite telling.That said, I still got sucked in and was up until 2:30 last night finishing the darn thing. If it weren't for one semi-cliff hanger, I might have thought this was to be the last Pitt book. I guess it's not.When does the next one come out? Hopefully, Clive will write it himself. By then, I'll probably have forgotten how bad most of this book was and be ready to jump back on the band wagon. Sigh."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Who wrote this trash? It seems like Mr. Cussler may have written the outline, and left the details to folk who have no clue.The plot is obvious, the technical details absurd. Even the geographic details lack any realism. Go north fron Nicaragua and find Key West? Not on any map I've ever seen.Maybe it's time for Mr. Cussler to retire along with Dirk. Either that or start writing the whole story again."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Was this really Clive Cussler who wrote this book? If it was ,what happened to the old cussler? He use to write books for entertainment and not money. It is sad to see that after writng so many other books Cusslers writing skills have declined to that of a high school student. Trojan Odyssey is not the same as the classic Cussler books like Sahara,Inca Gold or Deep Six. the story line seems to have been re hashed from past books, but don't let that fool you into thinking that this is one of them. The story line is stupid, like the fact that there is four gigantic tunnels running under ground, that have been built with out any one on the surface discovering this. These tunnels are hundreds of miles long, and when reading the book you find it hard to believe. The fact that I am Nineteen and found it hard to believe, I would hate to think what a more mature reader would think. A great pity to end on such a low. This cussler book is only for the die hard fans.If you are not one of these people, save the money for something worthwhile."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I just recently read this book and found it to be not as thoroughly researched and full of errors, more than usual. While the plot is OK and enjoyable enough, I still think Inca Gold or even Atlantis Found as better books.A number of errors that I can remember in particular include:(1) The ship that Jason sailed on was the 'Argo' not the 'Argonaut'; the Argonauts were the Greek heroes that sailed with Jason!(2) Fuel Cell technology that uses Nitrogen and then produces water as its output waste??? I mean at least do a little research on fuel cell. The reason why Hydrogen produces water in the first place is because the hydrogen ion produced bonds with oxygen to produce water while generating electricity. How can you produce H2O WITHOUT the H???(3) How could Summer be the \\"Daughter-In-Law\\" of Loren Smith Pitt?? Shouldn't she be the Step-daughter??(4) Pumps in the tunnel... why would you need pumps in the tunnel when the water pressure at that depth is enough to induce water flow? He probably meant a turbine which can produce electricity when connected to a generator.Some additional comments: Why does he kept referring to China as \\"Red China\\"? Nobody refers to China as that any longer - even in 2003 when this book was published.He never did place a connection between what Odyssey was doing and Hurricane Lizzie! I suspect he meant to include that in the book, i.e. that the freakish super hurricane was brought about by climactic changes that occurred because of the experimentation or whatever by Odyssey.And what is the deal with that \\"low cost\\" fuel cell thingymagingy that can produced with 8 parts?? 8 parts?? Are you hallucinating? Even the most rudimentary wind-up toy requires more than 8 parts, let alone an ultra-sophisticated piece of technology. Why didn't he just leave well enough alone.Clive puts too much useless details in this book that made it even less plausible than it already is. I would have been willing to gladly suspend disbelief given the genre of the book, but this calls for beyond even that! It's ok to inject Sci-fi elements into a book of this kind, but please at least do some research and put some semblance of plausibility scientific or otherwise into your stories. Clearly Clive is very well versed in automobiles, marine science, sailing, piloting choppers - but for those that he is not, I wish he'd stop cutting corners just to get a book out in print. Mr. Cussler please do your research or fire your editor!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've enjoyed Cussler for several years. I admire his work in marine archeology. But he's no longer on my must buy list after this one. The one saving grace for the book is it exposes the reader to the hypothesis about the location of Troy and the evolution of the Illiad and Odyssey. Beyond that, the characterizations are the thinnest parody of the worst of the Bond Movies. The addition of Dirk Pitt's newly found children to the cast of characters is a little unbelievable, and certainly unwanted. The tempo is uneven. The dilemmas are so over drawn as to give melodrama a good name. The basic premise is the least plausible one to show up in one of his books. I read it through hoping it would improve, and it just got worse and worse. At the very best this book is better than being trapped in an airport with absolutely nothing else to read...but only just. Clive Cussler is a talented writer, but he must have rushed to finish this book."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Did Cussler really write this book? Weakest plot of any of his work. Unlike his others, this book starts very slow...and then fails to pick up speed. And mistakes? There were many...especially with directions like east and west (hurricanes travel from east to west and not west to east as Cussler said)or distances like hundreds of miles and thousands of miles (the Pananma Canal was 100's of miles away and Cape Horn was 1,000's not the other way around as the book indicates). If Cussler actually wrote this book, who edited it? I have thoroughly enjoyed all the fiction Cussler has written with his name on the author's line. Until I read this one. It's a shame that Dirk and Al had to end their careers (or so the story implies) on such a low note. And how exciting are the books with Dirk Jr. and Summer as the main characters going to be? Being brother and sister, Cussler can't even turn the series into romance novels."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Let's clear the air right now. No one ever claimed these books were great works of fiction. They are supposed to fun escapism. Sadly the series has gone downhill to the point where I am now nitpicking everything instead of just going along for the ride.I agree with other comments that suggest this book needed much more editing. Maybe that would have done it. It needed to be read by a totally disinterested third party completely unfamiliar with the subject. Then some of the glaring inconsistencies would have been resolved.Examples: How does one fly a helicopter into the eye of a hurricane? At one point it is mentioned the hurricane extends upwards in excess of 50,000 feet. Ain't no chopper I ever heard of goes that high. Yet it appears, drops off the passengers and equipment and sails off without a care in the world.Or another- Summer photographs what appears to be a lady's comb while in the underground cavern. A big deal is made that all artifacts must be returned to where they were found. OK, no problem. Later on, during a meeting, she wonders what the computer analysis of the comb revealed. Uh, wait a sec here. I don't remember the materials actually being turned in for analysis. And sure enough, later on the next page the photos are shown for the first time.I think some of the wording could be improved as well. We get the point- Summer is one smokin' hot babe. However, some of the word choices in places could lead me to believe Summer & Dirk Jr. are going to end up rolling in the hay together.And I promise I will not go into the issue of Mr. Cussler's proclamation years ago where he stated all his books would use the metric system and this book does not. After all, this review should just be limited to the subject at hand.In my opinion, this book needed one more re-write and it would have ranked right up there with the other great Pitt stories. Instead, the next time I'm in an airport bookstore, I'll skip over the Cussler offerings altogether. Too bad."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Clive Cussler novels have always been page-turners. I once had to buya hardcover copy of \\"Inca Gold\\" after reading the first few pages in abookstore; I was so drawn into the story there was no way I could waitfor the paperback. Throughout the years, I've thoroughly enjoyedreading every Dirk Pitt book through \\"Valhalla Rising.\\"I stopped reading Cussler after buying one of his \\"with Paul Kemprecos\\"titles. Having lost interest in that tome after reading about fourpages, the author's books dropped off my radar.Recently, I found \\"Trojan Odyssey,\\" and bought it immediately when Isaw there was no co-author. The perfect vacation read, me thinks.I never noticed the prose before when reading a Dirk Pitt tale; thestories just flowed, and the writing never got in the way.Unfortunately the writing in \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" kept hitting me in theface like a splintery board. It was hard to see past it to followthe oh-so-thin plot. The first half of the book was the worst; itread like a Hardy Boys book, one penned by a particularly talentlessghostwriter. Clearly no one who could even spell \\"editor\\" looked atthat part of the text before publication. It didn't help that Itwigged to several major elements of the plot in about 20 nanoseconds.The writing improved noticably in the second half of the book, nearlyreaching the level of a mid-tier Hardy Boys. Surmounting the stilteddialog was still a struggle, but at least some of the subplots wereenjoyable.Years ago, readers of the last Travis McGee novel were surprised (aswas he) by the appearance of his adult child at the end of the book.I remember thinking this could be the death knell for a series about afree-spirited adventurer. Unfortunately, due to the untimely passingof John D. MacDonald, we never got to find out. It was certainlydeja vu when Dirk Pitt's adult twins turned up at the end of \\"ValhallaRising.\\" Reading \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" we get a sense of what might havebeen in store for the McGee franchise.As a man of a certain age facing the realities of getting older, Iwant to escape into a character who has heroic adventures, harrowingscrapes and dalliances with beautiful women. I'm not so interestedin reading about a character of a certain age facing the realities ofgetting older. In theory Pitt's progeny could pick up the slack, butonly if they weren't so lame.I'm willing to cough up ten!!! bucks for a well-crafted adventure storyof the quality of the previous Dirk Pitt novels. One actually writtenby the person whose name appears on the cover, and edited by someonewith at least a passing familiarity with English. One that doesn'tforce me to grit my teeth and plow through its surprisingly large typeby sheer force of will. One that doesn't leave me feeling cheated, asthis one did.Now that the diatribe is over, I want to return to the earlier DirkPitt novels for a minute. I think the series peaked with \\"Sahara,\\"but all the books through \\"Atlantis Found\\" are a ripping great readif you like adventure stories. \\"Valhalla Rising\\" is also recommended,but the \\"Pitt feels angst about getting old and starts behaving likea responsible adult\\" theme is a little depressing."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Let me start by saying that this is the only Dirk Pitt/Clive Cussler novel I've read so far. I have no opinion on any other DP books. This, however, was dreadful.This book's only redeeming point is the seemingly interesting theory about the Trojan Oddyssey having taken place in the Atlantic Ocean instead of the Mediterranean. Unfortunately, this theory has preciously little to do with the rest of the book, and seems to be there mainly as a selling point for a mostly unrelated (and very poor) story.The actual story is best compared to a bad James Bond movie (one from the seventies would do nicely), complete with super-villains, world-threatening schemes and secret bases. The problem here is that all of this is completely silly from start to finish (what on earth was up with the hologram pirates?). Everything is far-fetched, implausible, or most likely both. It also has none of the style and very little of the humor which often redeems James Bond.To make matters even worse, this movie must contain the worst characters in living history. From Dirk Pitt to the super-villain, they're all extremely dull and flat. Yet, no opportunity is wasted by the author to rub in how wonderful, beautiful and talented all these characters (supposedly) are. Together with lots of unnecessarily lengthy descriptions of just about everything, this book is truly full of filler.The characters are also completely super-human, apparently, since there doesn't seem to be anything that Pitt cum suis can't handle, including flying a helicopter into the hurricane of the century (just after the hurricane nearly took out a much more sturdy plane) and much more. This takes away any form of suspension there could have been.If this book didn't take itself so seriously, it might have worked. As it is, though, \\"Trojan Odyssey\\" is a totally daft, horribly written excuse for a book that does almost nothing with a potentially very entertaining theory."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've been a Cussler fan since the mid-'80s and have read everything and anything his name his on. But I've got to say that this is by far my least favorite. The writing is pedestrian, the story predictable, and the characters just do not live up to their terrific heritage. The introduction of Dirk's kids is awkward, and at first more than a little confusing, since his son is also \\"Dirk Pitt.\\" I think what surprised me most was the repetition and appalling lack of editing the book recieved. Clive repeats facts, scenarios, and background information over and over again in different chapters, as if it was the first time being presented. It's almost like there were long gaps during his writing period where he had forgotten what he had already written. I guess that's understandable, but what's not understandable is how all this got past his editors! I would highly recommend most of Clive's books, but not this one."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"The prologue was bad, the next 20 pages were worse, I gave up after that."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"The plot may be doubtfully realistic, but it's not what bothers me about this book - Actually the plot idea is fairly exciting. The way the people talk to each other, really bothers me. It's either scriptspeak, or overtly complicated. It's just not realistic. Even in heated action the characters will use complicated play-on-words, analogies and sayings which seems completely ridiculous to me. The way brother and sister talk to each other also seems way overscripted and complicated. People just don't talk like that.Moreover there's a lack of degrees of contrast - From the happy happy rosy family dinners to the evil emotionless enemy (who will still be shocked, though, at seeing an american flag, while the good guys will stare in reverence.....sigh).But the base plot is good, and I kept on going because of that."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have read nearly 200 books, primarily novels in the past 3 years, including several Clive Cussler novels...this book is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read, period.Do yourself a favor and literally run from this book. If you see a spare copy laying around somewhere...set it on fire.First of all, the story line is ridiculous. Cussler is trying to put together evil villians, women who think they're ancient goddesses, Greek mythology, etc. and make some kind of plot/storyline out of it. It's horrible!Secondly, the dialogue is even worse (if that's possible). It was SO bad I started highlighting the stupid phrases, things nobody would ever say in real life. I stopped reading the book when my highlighter went dry from all of the marks.And lastly, I thought if Cussler spent another full page describing one of Pitt's stupid cars, or leapt from the story line into another 8 sentence description of some wine that's being drunk, I was gonna have to kill myself.Have I mentioned how horribly bad this book is??? Seriously, Clive Cussler, if you read these, I want my money back, all $8.50 of it.

When he told me he thought it was Clive's best Dirk Pitt book yet, I was intrigued. I began reading and was soon so entranced with it, I couldn't put it down. Every spare moment I had, I picked this up to continue reading.I have to say that Clive is truly back in form, his writing is superfluous, his research impeccable. He breathes life into every one of his characters, no matter how short a 'life' they have. Although fiction, Clive has a knack for making the implausible possible.The story begins with a hurricane of unheard magnitude that devastates the shores off Nicaragua and almost kills hundreds of people in a luxury floating hotel, not to mention Pitt's twin children, Summer and Dirk, who are conducting research in an underwater enclosure in the hurricane's path. And this is just the beginning. There are evil red-headed women to contend with, a link to the story Homer made famous in The Odyssey, the opposite of global warming (brrr) and a little bit of romance thrown in (but not too much for you diehard Dirk Pitt fans).I have a soft spot for Night Probe, but Trojan Odyssey is easily the next best Dirk Pitt adventure yet. Thank you, Clive, for making up for the abysmal Golden Buddha.

They, like their father, love the ocean and work for NUMA where they investigate toxic contamination that is destroying the fragile sea life in the Caribbean ecosystem. While taking samples underwater, they discover a man made palace that sunk to the bottom of the sea millennia ago. While NUMA scientists analyze the find, the twins head to an island off of Guadeloupe to see if a sailing expedition lies beneath the waters and if so is it from the same era that was found in the Caribbean.Their father is saving a floating hotel from a force five hurricane before going to Nicaragua where the toxic contamination seems to be originating from. He finds a company owned by a mysterious four hundred pound man is working with the Chinese to construct underground tunnels that will connect one ocean to another. When he learns what the tunnels will be used for, he and the U.S. government try to stop them without creating an international incident.Clive Cussler always writes an exciting action thriller that appeals to readers of both genders. Pitt is a modern day James Bond who hooks the readers into hoping that his heroic acts won't get him killed. The hero realizes with a family to care for he can't take so many chances and is prepared to change his lifestyle. In the last part of the book, the protagonist feels he will cross paths with his enemy once more implying hopefully that there will be more Dirk Pitt novels in the future.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Before I received this book as a gift, I remembered reading in the news that Clive Cussler was retiring from writing, and so with great dread I knew that the Dirk Pitt-NUMA novels were coming to an end. So I was pleasantly surprised when Cussler released this book, as I was not expecting to see anymore Dirk Pitt novels. However, as I read this book, I could sense Cussler winding things down for Dirk and his pal Al Giordino. This is not to say that there is any less action in this book than there was in his other Dirk Pitt adventures. I have read EVERY book of fiction that Clive Cussler has written (both NUMA files series - Dirk Pitt and Kurt Austin - and the new Oregon files series), and &quot;Trojan Odyssey&quot; is not one of his best, but I was still entertained.As one other reviewer mentioned, be sure to read &quot;Valhalla Rising&quot; before you read &quot;Trojan Odyssey&quot; because of the new characters that were introduced in the former.If you're as big a Clive Cussler fan as I am, you'll enjoy this book, but you'll recognize that Cussler's heart didn't seem to be in it quite to the extent that it was in his earlier novels.This was a good book, but not outstanding."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've enjoyed Cussler for several years.

Is this the novel where Mr. Cussler's problems with simple science began? Or am I gonna have to go back and re-read some of his earlier works?My mental warning sirens went off as I read the description of Summer Pitt diving in tropical waters in a full dry suit as protection against suspected toxic substances in the water. Leaving aside for the moment the question of whether an off-the-rack dry suit was ever intended to be an effective shield against an irritating or perhaps lethal contaminant, was it not ludicrous to begin the paragraph by mentioning the wisps of auburn hair that were peeking out from under her dry suit's hood? Wouldn't that compromise the suit's seal?Further on, Summer and her twin brother Dirk Jr. were left at their undersea habitat by the NUMA research ship. A hurricane was bearing down and there wasn't enough time to carry out the long decompression process that would allow them to surface without suffering the \`bends.' When the NUMA vessel returned after almost being sunk in the hurricane (and not visiting any port in the meantime), it miraculously had a hyperbaric chamber on board, which then allowed the two castaways to be quickly treated after their rescue from the now-tattered habitat. Wouldn't it have been more logical to employ the chamber before the hurricane struck, thereby removing the two siblings from immediate danger? Or at least concoct a story as to why the chamber couldn't be used sooner.Oh, and what type of helicopter has an operational ceiling sufficient to fly over a typical hurricane (which easily tops out above 30,000 feet) so as to bring Dirk Sr. and Al down through the eye to engineer the rescue of the giant floating hotel?

The plot is standard Cussler fare, opening with the mythical voyage of Odysseus following the Trojan war before moving to a present-day disaster of cataclysmic proportions. Naturally, Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino uncover sinister details behind this disaster and face off against yet another mystery.While Trojan Odyssey may not be the best in the series, it is certainly a rollicking good tale not only for new readers but for Cussler fans, eager to find out what could possibly be Pitt's last adventure."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This book is full of errors and contridictions. As mentioned by another reviewer, the hurricane entitled Lizzie originates off the Cape Verde Islands near Africa (paperback edition, pg 25 para 2), travels EAST (pg 104 para 1) WEST (pg 116 para 4) again EAST (pg132 para 4), SOUTHEAST (pg 144 para 6), all the while traveling in a straight line, as if on a railroad track (again pg 104, para 1). I always thought the Caribbean was west of Africa.Also, not necessarily an error but a bit misleading, the hruricane moves about 50 miles into Nicaragua and dies. This is from the east coast (pg 144, para 6), but later when discussing the damage there, the statement is made that next to Haiti, the WEST coast of the country is the poorest stepchild of the Western Hemisphere (pg 182 para 1)Another bit of confusion is the statement regarding service provided by Commodore Vanderbilt moving people across Nicaragua, CUTTING OFF HUNDREDS OF MILES BY NOT SAILING AROUND CAPE HORN BUT ALSO SAVING ANOTHER THOUSAND MILES BYPASSING THE ISTHMUS AT PANAMA. ?????????????A contridiction occurs when the book states that they will be pumping the South Equatorial Current into the Pacific (pg 369 para 2) but into the Atlantic (pg 421 para 4)There are other misconceptions in the book, such as the characters yelling at one another because they are standing near a noisy ventilation fan while endeavoring to be stealthy. Loud noises do not necessarily mask other sounds near them, loud noises make it hard to hear when the listener is close to them.

I can deal with the ridiculous plot line, the impossibly perfect good guys, and the nothing-but-evil bad girls, but I kept getting bogged down in adjectives and distracted by mistakes. Although not to my taste, Trojan Odyssey is not so much badly written as it is VERY BADLY EDITED. Nothing, it seems, is too minor to be described in minute, painstaking detail. (Obviously Mr. Cussler loves good food and classic cars.) Occasionally this leads to humor when the long string of adjectives end up inadvertently pointing to the wrong word. This is no doubt due to careless editing, which is also displayed by not catching the repetition of something already stated in the previous sentence (something along the lines of: Having never been here before, she . . . . . . She had never been here before.). Another example would be when Dirk sent Renee below to make Molotov cocktails, at which point she \\"disappeared below.\\" Six paragraphs later on the same page, Dirk, still on deck, tells Renee to lay low and take cover behind the things they've piled on the stern. Then two pages later Renee reappears on deck with the Molotov cocktails. Even with better editing this wouldn't be one of my favorite books, but I wouldn't have felt like I was trudging though sludge trying to get through it. It took me longer than usual to read this book because I couldn't stop putting it down!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I am not a follower of Cussler's books...a friend gave me this as a gift. Cussler's plot suffers from poor writing and even poorer editing. Statements like \\"...win, or occasionally lose, which wasn't that often.\\" make no sense. How does something like this make it past an editor's desk? Unnecessary words hinder textual flow. If you say \\"occasionally\\" you don't need \\"which wasn't that often\\". The book is full of this type of writing.If you are a fan...go ahead. If you are used to reading polished authors, you will be annoyed."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"this is my first cussler novel, and seeing as this particular book is the last of a series maybe i needed to get some background on the characters before reading it. now that i have read it the chance of this happening is zero. Simply put this book has nothing to recommend. the plot is dull,the lack of excitement is astonishing for such a well known author, the two main characters Pitt and Giordino whilst on their deeds of derring do never come close to being in any danger at all. what surprised me the most was the numbing dialogue, characters often explaining the banal with regularity, and if you use dialogue to explain all of the plot it better be done well,otherwise,like this novel,its gonna be sooo bad."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've only read the first half of Trojan Odyssey but I'm not sure that I can finish it. The writing is that bad. The dialog is stiff and unnatural. The plot seems to be going nowhere. There is lots of \\"filler\\" that doesn't add to the story -- it just makes it longer and more difficult to read.Several pages in the first half of the book are devoted to an airplane designed to fly into hurricanes to gather weather information. The plane is literally torn to pieces, but a NUMA helicopter is able to enter the eye of the storm to drop Dirk and Al onto a floating hotel without sustaining any damage? Once our heroes arrive at the hotel, they have only two or three hours before the second wall of the worst hurricane ever recorded hits full force. It never happens. They hook up the cables and the hotel is safely pulled out of danger at a speed of one to two knots!I read an interview in the local paper with Mr. Cussler and based on it I believe that his son is taking over the series. Was this book perhaps written by him instead of Clive? It definitely doesn't appear to be written by the same person who wrote Sahara and Inca Gold."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Although Clive Cussler can still spin a good yarn, this was basically a disappointing book. Clive Cussler's work has gone way downhill, and the character development is shockingly thin. The introduction of Summer Jr. and Dirk Jr. at the end of the last book could have presented an opportunity for Mr. Cussler to pump some life in to a series that is getting very tired - instead, he squandered that by leaving them as one-dimensional clones of their parents: who cares? Also, it was totally obvious that someone (Mr. Cussler's editor?) forced him to insert a paragraph that led the reader away from thinking something bizarre was going on between Dirk's children. This book needed another good edit (lots of obvious typographical mistakes and inconsistencies) and needed to trade character quantity for depth.Finally, the &quot;shocking&quot; change in Dirk's personal life at the end is a really obvious attempt to pump some life in to this series (just like introducing Dirk's children). Because I was hugely disappointed by this book, I am not optimistic about Mr. Cussler's next effort.Also, I was a bit disturbed by the three (?) snide political references to President Clinton and liberals in the book. What's that about? They were wildly inappropriate.If you're a fan of Mr. Cussler, go ahead and give it a try (but try to pick it up from the library or wait for paperback). If you've never read Mr. Cussler, do yourself a huge favor and choose a different book to start."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Dirk Pitt, special projects director of NUMA, is constantly running around the world, discovering spectacular shipwrecks, solving unusual riddles of the sea, and saving the unsuspecting people of the world from total devastation. He is the James Bond of North America, and like his British counterpart, the books about him are very lightweight, but fun to read. There's always an interesting reversal of world history or literature, this time being the &quot;real&quot; location of Troy, and the &quot;true&quot; route of Odysseus home. It's quite intriguing, and I actually found it fascinating, but it was a mere sideshow to the deadly menace of a group of latter-day female Celtic druids. The action is non-stop, and as long as you don't spend a lot of time thinking about the absurdities of the plot, you'll enjoy the book. Also, like Alfred Hitchcock in his movies, Mr. Cussler insists upon inserting himself in his books. I find it fun to wait for his appearance."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Trojan Odyssey begins with a barebones recitation of the Iliad and the Odyssey, with minor variations on those familiar stories. Then, Dirk's twin adult children, marine engineer Dirk and marine biologist Summer (who both work for NUMA), find themselves in the pathway of a once-in-a-millennium hurricane after uncovering unexpected artifacts while searching for the cause of what is killing marine life. The same storm threatens a new semi-submersible luxury hotel, which is abandoned to its fate by its secretive billionaire owner. The book begins to get interesting when Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino appear from nowhere to attempt a rescue of the hotel. Later in the book Pitt and Giordino uncover a massive subterranean excavation project for an unknown purpose. Eventually, they discover a connection between all of these elements that has important implications for the world and Dirk's own children.Mr. Cussler often gives us fascinating mysteries to think about that cause us to see the world differently. In Trojan Odyssey, he opens up new dimensions of how climate is influenced by the ocean and what ancient writings might mean. When the story finally takes fire in pursuing those mysteries around page 320, Trojan Odyssey becomes a typical Dirk Pitt adventure thriller. Until then, I found Trojan Odyssey to be the least satisfying Dirk Pitt book I have read by a wide margin.Part of the problem seems to relate to adding Dirk and Summer as important new characters. However, Mr. Cussler makes poor use of them in the story. They just pursue activities that Dirk and Al would normally do . . . and do much better. So Dirk and Al just have two more people to get out of trouble. But any characters would have done for that purpose.The book's ending suggests better things could be ahead, so I suggest giving Mr. Cussler one more chance after this book before abandoning what has been a fun action series for many years.If you haven't read any other Dirk Pitt books, go back and read any of the earlier ones. They are all better than this one."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've been reading Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels since grade school - always fascinated by the fantastic scenarios and engaged by engrossing action.Sadly, Pitt is getting a bit long in the tooth. Pages spent on the decor and menus of local restaurants, descriptions of female characters' cosmetic applications straight out of Vogue, and even brief details provided re: sending facsimiles and other trivial action all seem hopelessly out of another time (not 2006 as suggested), and out of place (not occupying the mind of our alert hero, who may or may not share ALL of his author's preoccupations).I purchased this book on sight. Cussler + Trojan War should = instant delight and a very fast read. However, with rather obvious plot developments leading the way, accompanied by seemingly irrelevant and distracting scenes and/or descriptions of fleeting settings necessitated by said scenes, this has not turned out to be the speedy, pleasurable read I usually associate with Cussler. Furthermore, the introduction of Pitt's kids is going... where?Of course, anyone who's read the other Pitt adventures MUST read this one, if only to enjoy the quality of Cussler's premise - as good as any that have come before. The discovery of Troy is certainly right up there with Atlantis, et. al. Any true fan will forgive Cussler this time - hopefully he'll reinvigorate the franchise next time around.And who knows, perhaps Cussler will yet pull off a feat that few other action writers have dared attempt: Realistically aging his hero to the point of retirement, while retaining the audience. I, for one, will keep rooting for Pitt - and Cussler - either way."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Why is this guy so popular? I've struggled through a few of his novels and I've been pretty stunned by the quality of writing - Mr. Cussler can't seem to be able to keep a plot line straight half the time - he contradicts himself from chapter to chapter, he brings back dead characters without even bothering to explain their reappearance, and his character development is non-existent. This story is particularly bad and the characters are one-dimensional and more stereotypical than ever. We have Dirk Pitt's drop-dead gorgeous daughter Summer 'giggling helplessly' over and over again while the muscular, dashing Dirk Jr. (who has the personality of mud) keeps a cool head and solves impossible problems, a bunch of evil female druids who are coincidentally man-haters, and the dull and grizzly main action figures themselves, Dirk Sr. and sidekick Al (predictably boring in his commitment -over and over again- to bachelorhood). Don't get me wrong - I am all about entertaining, fiction-for-fun books, beach reading that you don't have to think about to enjoy, but this is so bad that it's downright frustrating. My conclusion is that Clive Cussler has gotten as bored with his characters as we are, but he's not motivated enough to create some new blood - why should he when the same old tired cast can reappear in retreads yet again and still sell?"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Cussler continues to be the master story teller. This book had a far ranging plot that keeps you engaged all the way to the end."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I enjoyed this book, but Cussler seems to be losing his flair for action packed adventures. His latest work is less intense then the previous novels I have read and enjoyed. He hasn't gone totally down hill, but he has mellowed out. I like how he included the kids into the storyline, which he did better than Clancy towards the end. I found Trojan Odyssey difficult to get into, but enjoyed it anyway. I hope Clive hasn't lost his touch."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"3 and 1/2 stars for this novel actually, since no halves, thus feeling generous, I go for 4 stars.

They are backed by the mainland Chinese. The background for all of this is the theory that the Trojan war was not about Greece or Turkey, but about the British Isles and tin mines (tin is needed to move from the copper to the bronze age). Odysseus traveled not to the Mediterranean but the Carribean. Sort of interesting and almost believable. A decent yarn, which might be Dirk's last (he is getting a little old for all that activity)and two major things change Dirk's life. Perhaps some of the future action will go to his son and daughter.

The villain was one-dimensional and pretty forgetful and Dirk's kids were just boring characters all the way around. The dialog throughout the book was week and I often read some of the lamest to my wife just to elicit a laugh from her. The nefarious deeds of the villains as well as the antics of Al and Dirk are getting even more unbelievable and poorly devised.I got the feeling that Mr. Cussler had grown somewhat tired of the whole Dirk Pitt/Kurt Austin formula. It seemed that he just banged this one out at the instanced of the publisher or his agent or for some other motivation unrelated to the actual desire to tell a compelling Dirk Pitt story.These novels are starting to make James Bond look believable.

The alternative history detailed in the first few pages of the book had me hooked. There were also some well thought-out scenes where Cussler was able to demonstrate his considerable knowledge of marine wildlife and archeology. These items alone weren't enough to carry the book however.If you are looking for intelligent edge-of-your-seat storytelling I wouldn't recommend this book for you. Then again I, like most of us I think, enjoy a good B-movie once in a while."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I read this book while on vacation fully aware that I would need to let my imagination run wild to be able to believe another one of Dirk Pitt's adventures but I had no idea that my imagination would need to stretch that far in order to even begin to believe this tale.Clive Cussler gives another performance of Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino, the dynamic duo of NUMA who go racing around the globe in search of the last evidence of Odysseus' Odyssey from the Trojan War while trying to stop the evil of a secret society of women from spreading throughout the world. Bottom line: typical Dirk Pitt theatrics.The end of the novel leaves the reader believing this is the end of the adventure career for Dirk and Al and one almost hopes it is. After nearly a 30 years career of being shot at, gunned down, and countless near-drownings, wouldn't you be ready to for a little R&R;?

However Cussler should stay to his characters and their story. Lorens father supposed to be dead, died as he tried to savage gear of a lost airplane (Vixen 03), how can she be walked down the aisle at her marriage with Dirk by him? Believing that Cussler has intentional introduced this mistake, like he did in several others of his novel (mixing up Dirk mother names) it could be guessed that he wants us to comment on his books.Nevertheless it is page turner!

Adding to the storyline is the inclusion of Dirk and Summer, Pitt's twin children who appeared out of the blue at the end of Valhalla Rising. This is simply a very good novel filled with all of the action, suspense, and frequent plot twists that have become Cussler's trademark. In addition, after all of the action has been concluded, there is still a chapter or two that provide some material that Cussler fans should find interesting.

Enjoyed the fictitious slant on historical events. Would like to have seen a little more technology slant. Overall entertaining. Would recommend to non Cussler fans."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"THE LOWDOWN: A solid adventure thriller from master adventure writer Clive Cussler, with cocky hero Dirk Pitt becoming a little older and a little wiser with gray hair around the temples, a few more wrinkles, two fully grown children, and by the end of the story, a wife.THE PLOT: Dirk Pitt is on board a NUMA resarch ship when an unnaturally large hurricane suddenly pops up an threatens a new, high-tech \\"floating hotel,\\" as well as Pitt's children in a bathysphere. After pulling off two dramatic rescues, Pitt begins to track down the source of a \\"brown tide\\" that has been polluting the waters off Nicaragua, and is led to a ruthless tycoon who has a following of female druid priestesses. The mechanism causing the brown tide is changing the ocean's currents, causing hurricanes and slowly cooling the Earth down into a new ice age, all to make the world dependent on the Odyssey Corporation's new power cell.THE PROS: While not the best of the Pitt stories, I found myself thoroughly enjoying this book. The villain's plot is James Bond-style large scale, but the idea of changing the ocean's currents is more interesting than the typical spy movie caper. There are plenty of suspenseful scenes, including rescue in the middle of a hurricane, a head-on collision with a \\"ghost ship,\\" a ship-to-ship battle between a NUMA ship and an Odyssey catamaran, an attempted druid sacrifice, and a shark attack.THE CONS: The historical mystery was definitely a drawback to the story; the idea of the Trojan war being fought in the British Isles, all over the price of tin, is a bit of a stretch. The two Pitt children, Summer and Dirk, while not bad characters, are not particularly interesting, and spend a creepy amount of time together. If the junior Pitts are going to be included, they should have some specialties (like Yaeger with computers and Perlmutter with history) instead of making them generic NUMA researchers."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Clive Cussler has another terrific Dirk Pitt story in this novel. Cussler novels can always be counted on to give us several tried and true story elements in this series of adventure novels. You can be sure the usual historical information is included; this time with a twist! Cussler moves the Trojan War from Mediterranean Turkey to England, and Odysseus' voyage to the Carribean. There are the fistfights, shootouts, traps, and other action features we have come to expect. This book also is improved by the addition of Dirk Pitt's grown children, Dirk Junior and Summer. This allows Cussler to take the story in two directions at once for a richer feel. The whole NUMA (National Underwater Marine Agency) staff are involved as well, providing technology support and several rescues. It's a rollicking good story. A fun read! I highly recommend it to any reader who enjoys a good adventure story in the tradition of the great pulp fiction writers like Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Kenneth Robeson. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that Trojan Odyssey is not as richly complex as a Tom Clancy or Robert Ludlum thriller."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Dirk Pitt, the until the previous novel Valhalla Rising unknown son of Dirk Pitt, is diving together with his sister Summer Pitt to find the source of a brownish contamination in the ocean's waters, when they stumble upon a strange historical artefact. At the same moment the father is trying to rescue a gigantic maritime hotel from total devastation due to a enormous hurricane. Little do they know that this is only the beginning of revealing a plot so devious that the whole world will suffer from its consequences?To say that the Trojan Odyssey has an unbelievable plot is like stating that water is wet. If this book was a parody on some of the most crazy James Bond stories, then it would indeed be an excellent book. But, unfortunately it is not. Although the story arc about Homer's Odyssey is very entertaining and quite informative, the main storyline can only be catalogued as completely absurd. If only ten percent would be true, it would mean that the whole world has gone mad. It can always be that this preposterous plotting is to the liking of the fans, but only a hint of realism would be nice to keep the interest of the average reader.Unless you really want to know how silly things can get, skip this book and pick up one of Clive Cussler's earlier works."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This book was very action packed and had me reading until 2.00am...I could not put it down until I was finished.

However when a writer reaches this level they should be held to a higher standard- unfortunately the opposite seems to be true and I think sometimes their editors are intimitated by their fame and amount of $ they bring in.This is still a fairly entertaining novel and exhibits flashes of why Cussler is such a great storyteller with its multiple plot lines, growth and chage of his characters, and seemingly inexhastible knowledge of marine lore.The villians in this novel are perhaps the most one-dimensional characters that Cussler has created since his totally evil Cuban communists in Cyclops. Dirk and Dirk Jr. deserve better than this-they need villians as resourceful and engaging as they are. As stated in the other reviews the editing in this book was a tad loose in both the inconsistencies in the plotting and in the sloppiness of the writing.On the plus side it is wonderful to see Cussler's characters grow and some possible monumental changes occuring in their lives-(Dirk Pitt the DIRECTOR of NUMA? and MARRIED?) These developments are what is keeping this series fresh and entertaining. I just feel Clive needs to spend a little more time and attention on the flagship of his empire."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"It's been awhile since I've read a Clive Cussler book, and now I remember why I quit reading them. I found this a bore of a book. The best part of the book is the first part where Cussler describes a Category 5 hurricane and the effects that such a thing can have. I did not like the characters in this book. For example, Dirk's new-found children are stiff and wooden, and don't seem real at all. Even the bad guys (or women in this book), seem character parodies rather than to be real villains. The premise behind the book is a good one - an alternate explanation to Homer's epic poem \\"The Odyssey\\". That part did make me think a bit, and I wasn't aware that there was a school of thought out there about Odysseus' adventures occurring in the Atlantic Ocean rather than the Mediterranean Sea. But other than that, I wouldn't recommend this book. If you must read it, borrow it from the library or from a friend."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Normally Clive is pretty accurate, but in this one, he had the hurricane traveling on an eastbound track towards(?) the US mainland.

This is apparently more then I can say for Clive Cussler who makes the idea the centerpiece of his book!!!There was however an interesting take on why the Trojan war actually took place (If it ever took place to begin with)Overall-I might have been prepared to overlook the shorcommings of the book and chalk it up to simple summer reader fun. This was of course before I got to the end where Cussler wrote himself into the plot. That was just stupid."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Being a Dirk Pitt fan, I have read and loved most of Clive Crussler's books. He have a way for making the most outrageous plots more believable. That is in my humble opinion, make his Dirk Pitt books so popular and enjoyable to read. However, in this book, it seem like Crussler is either running out of fresh ideas or recycling old ones. I think I read Trojan Odyssey before but under different titles. The concept of the Celtic Homer and all that is geared toward pure fantasy. Clive Crussler is not Dan Brown in this case. There is little to be said about this book, it seem old and tired. I can't buy the plot that Crussler wrote and considering that I have brought every single other ones he wrote, that itself should be a good indictor of quality of this book.The book also suffered thanks to the introduction of his kids which definitely break up the momentum of the pacing of the book as distracted papa Dirk who seem to spent half of his life saving his two younguns. It seem like Crussler is trying to set up the two young Pitts as the main vehicle, retiring Papa Dirk who got married and nominated to head NUMA. Maybe for that, I gave the book three stars when it really deserves no higher then two, that this novel is a transition book. But I thought it would have been whole lot better."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"The novel is very much a repeat of previous plots --an old event or war, a ship that somehow made it to America, a treasure to be found, an evil mastermind, Clive Cussler meeting Dirk Pitt-- and so would merit the same reviews as all the previous novels.However, I'd like to suggest that the author stick to English: whenever he has anybody speaking Spanish, there are glaring syntax and vocabulary faults, that any competent Editor would have pointed out. One of the best (worst) examples: a guard calls out to Pitt \\"LA PARADA!\\", hopefully meaning \\"HALT!\\", but actually being \\"THE BUS STOP!\\"... not much of a warning, isn't it?"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"First of all, the editing for this book was terrible. Trojan Odyssey is full of errors that a seventh-grader editing the back pages of the junior high yearbook would catch. It takes away from the story.As others have mentioned, there is a basic Cussler formula, and TO sticks to it. Formulaic and predictable, especially for longtime Cussler fans, there were happily a few minor surprises. As always, the attention to detail in regards to ships and diving was superb. The same cannot be said for the writing in regards to much of the action, and it would be nice to see other characters evolve besides Pitt (to be fair, it seems that may be the case with the next offering).A good time-killing, waiting at the airport sort of book, but not Cussler's best effort (I've always liked Night Probe and Iceberg the most)."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This is my first Clive Cussler/Dirk Pitt book and I enjoyed it so much that I can't wait to pick up the others. This book was not original or intellectual but it most definitely was entertaining. If you're looking for something easy and fun to read, this is a good book to pick up."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Although I sadly realised that Clive lost his wife Barbara, hence the tribute, I realise that the Dirk Pitt series may be coming to an end as Dirk seems to have accepted the takeover as head of NUMA and Al is fed up of getting shot. It may be that Dirk Jr and Summer may take over as the lead characters with Dirk Sr as head of the organisation but I feel that this book left a lot lacking regarding the plot against other books in the series. It didnt grip me as the rest of the series did, especially Sahara, which is being made into a movie and about time and is my favourite! I have to say that it wasnt that good apart from the hotel rescue at the beginning but after that, a little lame. Sorry fans but I read my first Clive book aged 7 which was raise the titanic in 1977 and Ive got his full collection, disappointed with this one."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I am a big fan of Cussler's books and generally enjoy them tremendously. The enjoyment is not based on their intellectual challenge. Far from it. Cussler's books are not challenging, but just pure fun. Bubble gum for the brain. The plots are spectacular, at times unbelievable, and the characters are super human. But it does not matter. Almost.Trojan Odyssey is a little bit too unchallanging and too predictable. It seems at times that Trojan Odyssey is just an amalgamation of Cussler's prior books. It is still a fine diversion from the real world, just not as much as the others."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"At the end of 'Valhalla Rising' we found out quite by surprise that Dirk Pitt, hero and world-class adventurer has not just one, but TWO children (fraternal twins Dirk Jr. &amp; Summer). This came as quite a shocker, especially for those of us who have known Dirk to be quite the ladies man -- but also a confirmed bachelor. His relationship with Congresswoman Loren Smith has come CLOSE to wedding bells once before, but I personally figured that if it didn't happen THEN, it was probably NOT going to happen at ALL. However, I've learned long ago to NEVER say NEVER.As usual, 'Trojan Odyssey' begins with an interesting re-telling of Homer's Odyssey, a version that is apparently gaining in popularity. How does it tie-in with events from today? As is always the case, finding out is half the fun. Summer &amp; Dirk Jr. are busy attempting to examine a tide of brown crud that has infested waters in the Carribbean when they stumble upon something extraordinary (well Summmer does, at first). Suddenly things take a nasty turn as the Mother of ALL Hurricanes begins to form and head directly towards Summer &amp; Dirk Jr. and also towards the most unique floating Hotel ever designed. Can they all safely escape before the Hurricane arrives? Maybe, maybe not. Along the way Dirk Sr. and Al make an appearance and suddenly as a direct result, their plans for the next few weeks are set in motion. Are massive tunnels being excavated underneath Central America, and if so, for what purpose? Once Dirk &amp; Al figure it out, an all-out race is on to avert an incredible disaster of amazing proportions.Along the way, Dirk Sr. and Al discover one of lifes more unfair absolute rules: we cannot remain young forever. Getting shot at and risking your life can only remain fun for so long. Dirk realizes that with the sudden appearance of two grown children his death defying exploits are no longer a challenge, and more of a major hindrance to his ultimate goals. Dirk does a LOT of soul searching, and along the way it wasn't hard to figure out where it would eventually end up. Is 'Trojan Odyssey' the last outing for Dirk Sr. as a souped up version of James Bond? Maybe. I can't answer that for certain, but with a son named Dirk Jr. it can safely be assumed that Dirk Pitt adventures WILL continue.Along the way I found a few genuine surprises (Admiral Sandecker's New appointment for one) and a few genuine sad moments for us die-hard Dirk Sr. fans. Unlike James Bond who will forever remain youthful, Clive has treated us fans to one simple reality: we ALL grow older, and so did Dirk. He no longer can do all the stunts he used to without serious repercussions. Healing from wounds no longer are as quick as they used to be, and the thought of leaving his two children without a Father begins to seriously force Dirk to re-think his life. I finished 'Trojan Odyssey' with mixed emotions. Did I enjoy it? Absolutely. Did it make me excited about what was on the horizon for Dirk &amp; Co.? Again, yes. But it also saddened me at the same time. You will just have to read it for yourself to figure out what all of this means, and why.Clive continues to be the BEST action/adventure author writing today, and no matter WHAT it is, if his name is on it, you can be rest assured that I WILL be reading it. Long Live Clive &amp; Dirk Pitt, both senior &amp; junior."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Like all of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novel's this one has our heroe's battling some dastardly plot to destroy or take over the world. This one is somewhat different from the others in that the adult son &amp; daughter that Pitt learned he had in the last page or two of Valhalla Rising are now working at NUMA.The book starts with what has become Cussler's formula of some great event occuring at some point in the past and then moving forward to the present day,in this case Aug-Nov 2006. A super hurricane is about to wipe out some fantastic floating hotel when Dirk Sr. and Al Giordino arrive to save the day,kind of a wasted story element as it is only lightly linked to the rest of the book (D.Sr. &amp; Al don't even appear until chapter 8 by the way).The rest of the novel switches back and forth between Pitt's children and the older generation, sometimes together but more often not. You'll find the usual mix of a great old car or two, narrow escapes and explosions tempered by Pitt (you'll almost need a score card to keep track of which Dirk you're reading about, Sr. is usually referred to as Pitt, Jr. as Dirk) and Al referring to the years getting to them.The stories have been going on for almost 25 years now and it seemed to me that at times Cussler was ignoring past story plot lines although many times he'd put something in about a lot of the past adventures. A couple of times there was a problem with the timeline - Valhalla was set in 2003 but Trojan Odyssey, set only 2 years later, is set in 2006. Another time warp occurs when a man is sacrificed by the evil Druid group, the way subsequent events regarding the man's holdings are related far to much time goes by to fit into the general storyline.In the end all ends well with Pitt marrying longtime love Congresswoman Loren Smith, and it looks like he and Al will have job promotions at Numa. Cussler himself makes his usual appearance in the story but this time only in the last page or so.Mr. Cussler may be planning to retire, I kind of wonder from the tone of this book. I wonder if someone else will write some Dirk Jr. &amp; Summer Pitt novels, perhaps Paul Kemprecos whose Kurt Austin &amp; Joe Zavala characters are very briefly in this book."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I am always excited when I see a new Dirk Pitt novel (not one of those poor &quot;Kurt Austin&quot; collaborations).However, almost right off the bat I sensed that this was not going to be one of Cusslers better Dirk Pitt adventures.The action was slow to develop and had none of Cusslers great &quot;feel like you are there&quot; narrations. The action sequences were flat, average and predictable.Cussler just could not pull me into the action on this book.Cussler spent way too much time on technical details in this book and the plot was transparent and obvious.At times, Dirk Pitt seemed to be remarkably &quot;slow to catch on&quot; to events in the story. The good humor &quot;give and take&quot; with AL seemed &quot;forced&quot; and uninspired.At times, this book seemed to be like the lame &quot;Kurt Austin&quot; books and if I did not know better, I'd say that Cusslers co-writer in those books had a hand in this one as well.This book was an &quot;Ok&quot; Dirk Pitt novel, but not one of the better ones."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"It's difficult to know how to describe this book. Exciting, gripping, realistic, well-written, intriguing, thought-provoking? This book is none of these things. The plot would be considered overly silly for an Austin Powers movie, and I seriously expected that at any moment, the arch-baddie (Spector) was going to appear on a video screen in the White House to demand 'One Million dollars'.The dialog would be considered poor for a 1950's Boys Own comic book and the characterization is so thin that my partially blind pet cat could see through it. The only reason I continued through to the end was the fact that I was on a dare from my wife to finish it. I could not recommend this book to anyone, even if they were in solitary confinement in a Turkish prison and the alternative was insanity."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've been an avid follower of the Dirk Pitt Novels since the mid 80's when my folks forced me read Treasure as a teen, for which I am still grateful. When reading his early books start to finish I couldn't put them down. T-O took me over a week to read.I did enjoy the premise of the book but felt overloaded with technical schematics on every bit of equipment utilized throughout the story. A little background is good but this is an adventure novel not a &quot;how to&quot; manual on a TBM Boring Machine. Pitt's constant inner monologue on how he was getting to old for the lifestyle he leads left me a little down.The supporting characters were not fleshed out and the twins were boring. After the introduction of the twins in Valhalla Rising, which I found to be the best DP book in a while, I was left excited at the potential of the Jr. Pitt's. However, if they are going to take over the series they need some more personality and verve. Cussler has spoiled us with Dirk, Al, Rudi, Loren, Sandecker etc. The twins are pale shadows in comparison.The story did not have the edge of your seat suspense prevelant in so many of his other books. Also, figuring out the bad guys was much too easy. I did enjoy the book just not on the level of say Raise the Titanic, Treasure, Inca Gold and his other earlier works.There were also some really obvious mistakes in this book that leave me wondering if his editor needs an eye exam, as well as distortions in the timeline and incorrect past character reference.To sum up there are a good number of the DP books in my library that get re-read every couple years. This won't be one of them."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"What a very disappointing wrap up to Dirk's career. I have never seen the NUMA crew be so incredibly dumbfounded by the clues that are so apparently staring them in the face. How many times can you say &quot;Not Odyssey, again&quot; after the reader has figured it out 50 pages ago. The whole Spectre debacle at the end was obvious from the first introduction of the amazonian women early in the book. The editing on this book was done with an obvious attempt to get the book to market instead of a concerted effort to make the book readable. The time warps are ridiculous. I have recently read the Buddha book and found it somewhat enjoyable. Then Cussler introduces the same supersecret propulsion system (or one very similar) into one of NUMA's vessels. Then a little later we have the fishing smack that has all the earmarks of a smaller Oregon with its fancy decor supposed to fool even the hardiest of fishermen. Then we have the special jetski deigned by NUMA to penetrate covertly into enemy territory. Why would NUMA make this machine. No reason except to have a new toy for Dirk and AL. The kids are ridiculous and serve no purpose in the story line. I hope we do not see them as the new Pitt Al duo.What a shame to release this book. This was an obvious attempt to make some quick cash and it worked because all of us Pitt fans will read it even after reading these reviews. Shame on you Clive Cussler. GO back and read your own work some time and bring back the glory days of old. And to think I even named my cat Dirk Pitt.Shame on you."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Trojan Odyssey continues the line of Dirk Pitt adventure stories. This one is not that different from the others and many of the plot devices have been used before (the evil cult that Dirk is trying to expose, the death-defying heroics of Dirk and Al, the impossible situations they find themselves in, the causes and reasons for the situation, etc.). Unfortunately, this storyline is rather perfunctory and seems like mostly rehashed material. Unlike some of his previous ones that had me holding my breath in anticipation (Sahara for instance) or staying up way too late to continue turning pages, I could see what was coming almost from the first page.Another problem was that some of the plot devices were put out there and not really followed up. The story starts with a wonderous concept that gets into severe trouble. The main evil being does not do anything to help, and leaves thousands of people behind at risk. One would think that somewhere along the line, there would be a discussion of why that occurred. Why was the thing constructed, and why was it abandoned as it was. But none of that occurs. The only obvious puropse it serves is to provide a convenient entry point for Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino.There are also several mistakes in the book that make me think that Clive Cussler is poking fun at this audience. For instance, there is a hurricane that developed off the African coast and moves towards the U.S. The book repeatedly talks of its eastwards movements. Excuse me? Last I looked at a map, that would have it moving WEST!!! This \\"mistake\\" is repeated several times so it cannot be a real mistake, and I cannot believe that no proofreaders caught it either!Towards the end of the book, several things happen that make me believe that Clive Cussler intended this to be the last book in the series. Now, I know that is not true as a sequel has appeared, but the ending was not a typical Dirk Pitt ending ... there was no dropping of a villain down the elevator chute in the World Trade Center, etc.So, I am overall slightly disappointed."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This book was a lot of fun to read. I've been a Cussler fan since I bought Inca Gold at a yard sale for 25 cents. Once again he provides a great story. There are a few editing glitches which will hopefully be taken care of in the paperback edition, but all in all highly recommended.The Trojan plotline was very intriguing, so much so that I've been trying to track down Where Troy Once Stood.... the inspiration behind the novel. Pitt fans won't be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"After reading some of the less flattering reviews I decided to read Trojan Odyssey for myself, not believing one of my favorite guilty pleasures could have missed so badly. Sad to say, though many of the &quot;Cussler&quot; gimmicks are still included, they seem weak, over done and flat in the overall plot this time. Dirk's kids are just not interesting and after spending so much time with them before the plot takes any real &quot;action&quot; I wanted to send them to their room for quiet time. Dirk (Sr.) is getting long in the tooth and would be better served if replaced permenantly with Kurt Austin ( a doppleganger to be sure, but hey, no insufferable offspring yet.). Maybe Clive is stretching himself too thin these days, maybe his flare for exciting thrillers is running dry. Whatever it is, I hope this is only a blip, and if he needs three or four years between books to get back in top form, I'm willing to wait before crossing him off my must read list - after all, so many books, so little time!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"O.K., so Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels are formulaic. We can even describe the formula: Begin with an ancient event, real or imaginary, such as the sacking of Troy. Fast forward to a few years from now (in this case, 2006). Invent a cataclysm that threatens to destroy human life in large numbers (in this case, a hurricane that threatens a floating resort). Bring in Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino to rescue equally large numbers of people. In the course of the cataclysm, make sure someone discovers clues to the ancient event. Throw in a menacing organization that is somehow connected to all of this. Have Pitt and his NUMA crew defeat the baddies, while also shining the light of truth on that ancient event. Voila! Another book.It's all here. What makes Trojan Odyssey interesting is the other stuff. Pitt's heretofore unknown twin children, introduced at the end of Valhalla Rising, are now working for NUMA (surprise!). Pitt, Admiral Sandecker, and Al all make decisions that determine the future direction of the series (We knew that Dirk and Al were going to hand things off to young Dirk and Summer--it was just a question of how. The bigger surprise lies in Sandecker's decision). While those decisions are predictable, they are still satisfying. They also meet the first criterion for series novels--they set the stage for the next book.Trojan Odyssey isn't the best book Cussler ever wrote, but it isn't the worst, either (that dubious honor goes to Dragon, an incredibly racist diatribe against Japanese economic power). It's a bridge book between Valhalla Rising and whatever's next as young Dirk and Summer take the places of their father and Al in Cussler's adventures. Is that enough to make us come back next year? Only if Dirk and Summer are fleshed out (telling us a LOT more about their upbringing would be a start) and Pitt and Sandecker are believable in their new roles.As has been true with most of Cussler's Pitt books, Trojan Odyssey suffers from poor editing. Verb tense disagreements, dangling participles, and introductory clauses that don't agree with sentence subjects abound. These errors are so elementary that one wonders if a high school junior English student shouldn't do the next editing job. On the other hand, folks like me have turned NUMA into a money machine for Cussler and his publishers, so why should they bother?"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This poem is hard to follow because of the language and the vocabulary, and reading it can be somewhat of a chore. Sentences may have to be read over a few times before they are fully absorbed. Many of the words are difficult, and a few of the character's names, as well as the names of places, are similar to one another, which makes it confusing. The story is fast paced and does not stay focused on one event for too long. It does, however, explain the events in great detail, with plenty of sensory imagery, making it easy to form a mental picture of the action.The general plot is rather repetitive. Odysseus overcomes a challenge on an island, and while leaving via boat, a storm takes him to yet another island, where the process is repeated. This makes the story predictable and less interesting. It is even a bit disappointing, because while one usually expects a hero to be happy, helpful, and maybe funny, Odysseus possesses none of these traits. He is stubborn, selfish, overly confident, and serious. Also, before the tales of Odysseus' travels even begin, the reader finds out that he was gone for ten years, and is now safely retelling his story to others. This and the fact that early in the story, a man tells Odysseus of a prophecy detailing exactly what will happen to him, spoils the ending, so there is little to look forward to.This work would be more enjoyable for people with an extensive knowledge of Greek mythology, or for people who like poetry. It is doubtful that many people college age and younger would take an interest in this story, and it is certainly not something to read for fun."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"People have followed over 20 years of Dirk Pitt's life through 17 books. In his younger days he did a lot of crazy stuff with ease. In the more recent books there have been hints of aging. Sure it happens to everybody, but not characters from a book... Trojan Odyssey really brings the issue to light. They're all getting older. Dirk Pitt doesn't do nearly as many death-defying stunts in this book as in earlier ones. He's not immortal, he's getting old and decides to settle down. I absolutely love the big ending. I actually got tearry-eyed. Especially the last paragraph.My main advice is don't finish the book at 3:00am with nobody to babble to but a cat sleeping next to you on the couch. He won't care and you be left saying 'wow, i can't beleive it.'BTW Pay attention to Sandecker's hint on p.305 second to last paragraph."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This book was not my favorite Dirk Pitt Novel but I think it ends well. The action is a little less intense than his other books but Cussler still has chases and clashes with the &quot;evil doer&quot; I would recommend anyone that has read the other books to read this one but new readers should read earlier Cussler novels because because there is history some history revealed in this book."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"As a long time Cussler fan I am disappointed to read so many unfavorable reviews. So I thought I would put my two cents in concerning Trojan Odyssey. I thought it was a vast improvement over Valhalla Rising. VR had some good parts, Ono Kanai was a good villian and the plane chase through New York city was amazing, too bad it wasn't in a better book. The plan at the end to blow up the World Trade Center with an LNG tanker was eery considering it came out before Sept 11. I will admit though, that Cussler has a cheesy streak in him that turns up once in a while; that combined with a tendancy to sink into maudlin melodrama, (which doesn't happen regularly in the other books), and my skepticism due to the Captain Nemo story idea started me off on the wrong foot. Though, having been slightly disappointed with Atlantis Found, I was further tainted by skepticism. I am sorry I started that way, because he tied up the story well, and I actually bought the Nemo idea, thanks to Julian Perlmutter. Also I will concede that Cussler's books are formulaic, and not always seemingly original at first scanning the book cover. But, what author doesn't resort to formula, the Grisham books atleast the first three are all very similiar. Boy the mob sure gets around. That aside, I was pleasantly suprised to be pulled in so easily to TO. Cussler's story was interesting, and kept me wondering. Technical details gotten wrong that might have been a glaring error to others didn't bother me. The edge Pitt had in his earlier books, which he had seemed to have lost in the last two incarnations returned. The end scene in congress, as however implausable it might be was just as audacious as anything I have read before in the series. Suffice it to say, the old Dirk was back, as ironically, a page is turning, and we see that the old adventures we have enjoyed all these years, are most likely coming to an end. If this is to be the last Dirk Pitt novel, Mr. Cussler has chosen a high point to end on. So there you go, my two cents. Oh one last thing: Good work Clive! Thanks for bringing back the Dirk we remember."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Cussler has finally developed another interesting novel. While he continues to use a template to his writing that is consistent with every Dirk Pitt novel, the subplots were well developed and interesting.The Celtic history and questioning Homer's Odessey were very entertaining.Anyone who is a fan of Dirk Pitt is ready for his near death-defying feats. Cussler uses Dirk's introspective very well. I do believe that Dirk Jr. &amp; Summer characters need to be much more developed.If Cussler is ending the Dirk Pitt saga, I hope that he greatly improves his other series. The Golden Buddha was far from entertaining."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I am in need of a psychoanalyst. I continue to read these things hoping against hope that SOMETHING will change but no - we still have the same cardboard characters (Dirk & Dirk Jr are equally wooden - daughter is just for show), the action is over-the-top as usual and and the \\"plots\\" still take outlandish license with history as Cussler attempts to make sense of nonsense.Ready? It's a gawd-awful mixup of Greeks & Celts & England & Persia along with a modern-day cult based on Greek (or Celtic?) mysteries. Someone's trying to direct the ocean currents to Nicaragua to freeze the world and sell a special type of battery that...need I go on? You are probably asking what the freezing oceans have to do with Helen of Troy and of course, you are absolutely right - not a cotton-pickin' thing.This is SO much worse than Lincoln in the middle of the Sahara. (If you don't get it then you are lucky.) Or Atlantis or the claim of the US from Iceland or fill in any of the hysterical events. I am convinced he wrote these with Mystery Science Theater in mind. If not, they should be adapted for that particular medium."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"If you are looking to feed your mind, this is the curly-cheese fries of literature. The author takes an interesting theory on the location of Troy and turns it into a bad James Bond movie.If you've read any of Cussler's previous novels, you'll have no problem predicting each of the unlikely coincidences which lead to a showdown between Pitt and Specter. For the uninitiated, let me give you a taste of what you're missing:Dirk Pitt's twin children, who look, act and have the same first names as their parents, get caught in the worst hurricane, ever. Nearby, a giant, floating hotel is on the brink of being crushed against a rocky shoreline. The owner of the hotel is &quot;Specter&quot;, the leader of a druid cult out to create a global disaster so that they can corner the market on a new energy source. Pitt's kids discover a celtic relic on the wrong side of the ocean, which threatens to rewrite ancient history. A history which happens to be related to the druid cult.The story zips along like a 500 page comic book, thanks to the author's lack of character development. Instead, most people are described by their eye-color and a description of their outfits. The bad guys (or gals?) wear color-coded jumpsuits and paint all of their vehicles lavender (if only Bin Laden was this crafty). The good guys ride around in turquoise planes and ships.The story is very uneven. One minute Dirk sees a woman with wet hair and deduces that there must be a bomb on his boat, the next minute he can't decide if a bikini-clad bombshell pulled off a sinking Odyssey gunboat might be dangerous. As with other recent Pitt novels, the author can't make up his mind which previous Pitt adventures to negate and which to keep in the Pitt timeline."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I guess Cussler had a renaissance of sorts here. In some ways this was the best Pitt novel in a long while. Clive has some of the old spark back. Plus I suppose Dirk had a dose of gold kryptonite taking away his superpowers of recent novels.I did like it and I agree with another reviewer that this is likely to be the last Dirk Pitt novel. Not the last of the NUMA crew for sure but then again, we'll likely have Dirk Junior to knock around for the nest decade or so.Like the last half dozen Pitt stores, Cussler revives his tried and true - if somewhat tedious - formula. Dirk and Al the heroes against another billionaire meglomaniac bent on:SELECT \\"evil_plot\\" FROM PITT_PLOTS where (SELECT plot_type, evil_villan, FROM PLOTS where (plot_id = (SELECT (rnd(plot_id))You get the idea. My thought is Cussler has a computer write his books from a database of mad scientists and evil plots. This one is better, but still the same old repetitive story, now the evil guy is Specter ( SPECTRE?) maybe KAOS and THRUSH are next.I guess I liked it overall. It moved fast enough but still so predictable I probably could have written it myself all I need do is fill in the name of the bad guy and historical background facts.It is worth reading I think for long term Pitt fans wanting all of Dirks loose ends tied up. I won't give away any more than that, probably don't have to anyway. Everyone already knows what it's all about - the same as the last 6 Pitt novels.Unfortunately tt's no \\"Raise the Titanic\\" but fortunately it's no \\"Oregon\\" either. So read and enjoy and then go re-read \\"Titanic' or Vixen 03 and have great memories of Dirk and Al."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I read reviews and marvel at people running down the exciting and happy writing offered with the Dirk Pitt Novels. Some complain it is the same old thing. Others state many of the things are unbelievable, and etc. and etc on and on. Why do they read it knowing it is fiction. Clive Cussler has well proven his ability to produce readable interesting stories. It is quick, interesting, and many times instructional. Behind all fiction is some fact and his real life in the seas surely substanciates that. Instead of total criticism to a wordsmith take a long look and see if you have the ability to better his writing. If so I strongly suggest you get on the word processor immediately and bang out something better. As I feel I will look forward to each book written and will enjoy his topics in the sense of happy action stories. Long live Dirk Pitt and all concerned."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"What, Dirk Pitt is getting old and is hanging up his shoes? Since when did he turn into Dick Marcinko? Of course readers could see this coming since \\"Valhalla Rising\\" introduced his son and daughter in a somewhat contrived fashion toward the end of the story.Storywise it features a fair amount of action and is worthy of being in the series. However it does seem to lose a fair amount of steam after the rescue of the floating hotel: the second part of story almost reminded me of something from \\"Cannibal Women in the Avocado Jungle of Death\\". Where was Adrienne Barbeau as Epona?I almost thought we'd escape a Clive Cussler cameo in this novel but he pulled one out very late. Nothing pivotal to the plot as they usually are...just a bit of fluff.So it's a good CC novel but nothing spectacular. That said, it's good to see the series end while it still has some modicum of respectability left."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have not had this much funny reading in a long time.

This book was fantastic! I've read every Clive Cussler book to date, and this one did not disappoint. Once I started reading this, I couldn't stop. Believe me, it's that good!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Cussler's veteran hero Dirk Pitt has stood him (and us) in good stead over the years. Cussler has even had the good manners not to pretend that time stands still for Pitt the way it has for James Bond through more than four authors over half a century (\\"Casino Royale\\" was released in 1953). Now it has me wondering whether or not Pitt is about to retire. He's become very serious about his longtime love Representative Loren Smith. There's a strong hint that Pitt is about to be promoted. His long-lost twin son and daughter have come back into his life and are following in his footsteps with NUMA (it's them who discover a potential biological disaster in the Caribbean that may be man-made and deliberate). For years Cussler has been introducing a slightly-younger hero into the NUMA ranks with the help of co-author Paul Kemprecos. But is Cussler going to do a Tom Clancy and also bring Dirk Pitt Junior in as a hero in his own right? It seems possible as two generations of Pitts go after a mega-rich villain very much in the Goldfinger mold. There's one bit of irony here as life imitates art. This book came out in hardcover last November, at the end of the Atlantic hurricane season. Central to the first half of the story is a huge storm so big and nasty that NOAA scientists skip several letters of the alphabet to name it after axe murderer Lizzie Borden. Several months later, between the release of the two editions, we in Florida get clobbered in the real world by a record-setting four humongous blows."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This goes right in there with all the other Clive Cussler books. Clive takes you on an amazing ride and has you sitting on the edge of your seat.With the exciting adventures, the great cars, and the charismatic main characters Cussler makes a wonderful book and makes you really think about what really happened at Troy."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Being a huge Clive Cussler fan I usually grab a copy of any new novel he releases. Trojan Odyssey was no exception, however the quality of the writing makes me suspect that Mr. Cussler is on hiatus. This book could not have been written by my favorite author, it's not even average. After seeing Robert Ludlum release a new book (apparently from his grave) I'm beginning to believe that there ought to be a disclosure if the work is not that of the author listed on the cover."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I realize this is fiction, and I realize an author can take liberty with his works, but I have to admit: I am used to authors who try to remember what has happened in their own previous creations. Cussler obviously doesn't care anymore. For one, how can Loren's father be present when Dirk found his DEAD BODY at the bottom of a lake in Vixen 03?! And HOW can Cussler write that Loren strayed and returned when Dirk slept with how many women?! Pot meet Kettle! And finally, I never understood how the twins exist at all since Dirk and Summer never had sex! I'm going to attempt to forget that this book was ever written!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Having read the joint effort, 'White Death' and this latest Dirk offering back-to-back, the former pales into insignificance against the latter. After the shocking finale to the previous Atlantis Found, whereby Dirk discovered he had adult twins, Dirk and Summer, born to his previously thought deceased wife of twenty-plus years ago, Cussler moves into Trojan Odysessy with a new lease of life. He also chooses to link the timeframes of White Death and this novel together with a brief meeting between Dirk and Kurt at NUMA, as the latter heads to the Canadian \`fishery' that is so prominent in White Death. Unfortunately, White Death makes no mention of the storm of the century even though Kurt and Joe have heard about Dirk and the Ocean Wanderer. Still....Historical purists might wince at the paraphrasing of the Illiad and the Odyssey by our author, his condensing of ten years of epic into a ten week battle between the Dardanians and the Achaeans and a new slant on the Trojan Horse, but it has its reasons in the story to follow....The first part (and full third) of the novel opens at high speed with the storm of the century (Hurricane Lizzy) defying all previously known hurricane traits hurling herself across the Atlantic with 250mph+ winds devastating all human sea activity. Caught up are Dirk and Summer who are used as the storm's plaything in their marine outpost, Pisces. Having previously discovered a rare bronze urn in the shipwrecked Vandalia (thus linking us into our prologue) they narrowly escape death and are rescued by the ever familiar Dirk and Al, who have previously saved over a thousand lives on a floating hotel called Ocean Wanderer (owned by the mysterious Specter) together with the NUMA ship Sea Sprite and her hardly captain, Barnum from the effect of the hurricane.Part Two commences with the bronze artefact and Dirk's and Summer's instruction to investigate it more fully whilst Pitt and Giordino head towards Nicaragua to investigate the brown crud that is originating in the area, threatening the sealife. Whilst down there they come under scrutiny from the Odyssey corporation who promptly try to blow them up then chase them off with a hologrammatic projection of the pirate Leigh and some well placed missiles. Several battles later they end up in one of four great tunnels designed to allow the Pacific ocean into the Atlantic - allowing Max to prophesy an arctic winter for Europe for eight months a year - designed to enable the Odyssey corporation to cash in on their new source of free nitrogen-based energy.It ends up down to Pitt and Giordino to storm the Odyssey bastion, capture the evil Flidais and set off a volcanic eruption to literally squash the scheme. Meanwhile, Dirk and Summer end up on a celtic sacrificial altar as the other half of Odyssey, Epona, continues her personal insanity. Along the way Cussler gets to propose his alternative location for the battle of Troy and hence where Odysseus' voyage actually went. Inevitably, the Navidad Bank where the artefacts were located ended up being Circe's island and the treasure haul that Epona and Flidais had previously located had funded their empire.This volume is clearly a turning point in the Pitt series. By the end Al is moving on to technical director of NUMA, Sandecker's running for Vice President and Dirk is to become head of NUMA, thus paving the way for \`Pitt:The Next Generation' novels which may be no bad thing. This latest volume is enjoyable in a true Cussler style and is portrayed as Dirk's swansong on the front line but so long as he retains an appearance in the future adventures then fans will continue to read them. A vastly exciting volume, Cussler has produced one of his better Dirk Pitt novels and, at least for now, has nothing to fear from Kurt Austin...."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"You have to develop a taste for Clive Cussler. He is simply outrageous with overblown plots, superhero characters and enough miracles of timing and coincidence that force credulity to its limits.That said, Cussler writes some of the most entertaining, exciting novels to be found. They read quickly and definitely have the ability to keep you awake long into the night.This time, unassuming, always modest, strategically well connected and fortunately wealthy Dirk Pitt has been reunited with his two unknown children after 20 years.All work for NUMA, a mysterious US government agency that concerns itself with a wide host of marine issues.A monster hurricane introduces us to Specter, a mysterious global tycoon who has anchored a hotel off an island lying directly in the path of this killer storm. Dirk and friends rescue the hotel while the meanie Specter escapes.Without a day off, Dirk and his ever present companion Al Giordino go off to explore mysterious construction in Central America - and needless to say discover a nefarious plot to dominate the world. I'll save the details for your reading --- it's way more fun to read the book and see it all unfold.Dirk's children (trouble prone as you might expect in the children of unassuming superheros) in the meantime discover remnants of the fabled Trojan era civilization in the Carribbean Sea. That is a story onto itslef and a fascinating one at that.Cussler requires you to set aside your sense of credulity. And you know what? It's worth it. He is a magnificient writer and carries you away with his story, no matter how unbelievable it becomes.Jerry"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Having read Golden Buddha recently (which I was very disappointed with), I wasn't sure I wanted to read Trojan Odyssey, so I let my father-in-law read it first. When he told me he thought it was Clive's best Dirk Pitt book yet, I was intrigued.I began reading and was soon so entranced with it, I couldn't put it down. Every spare moment I had, I picked this up to continue reading. I have to say that Clive is truly back in form, his writing is superfluous, his research impeccable. He breathes life into every one of his characters, no matter how short a &quot;life&quot; they have. Although fiction, Clive has a knack for making the implausible possible.The story begins with a hurricane of unheard magnitude that devastates the shores off Nicaragua and almost kills hundreds of people in a luxury floating hotel, not to mention Pitt's twin children, Summer and Dirk, who are conducting research in an underwater enclosure in the hurricane's path. And this is just the beginning. There are evil red-headed women to contend with, a link to the story Homer made famous in The Odyssey, the opposite of global warming (brrr) and a little bit of romance thrown in (but not too much for you diehard Dirk Pitt fans).I have a soft spot for Night Probe, but Trojan Odyssey is easily the next best Dirk Pitt adventure yet. Thank you, Clive, for making up for the abysmal Golden Buddha. Dirk Pitt fans unite and buy this book!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I've enjoyed Cussler's books in the past. (although his recent penchant for including himself in a cameo appearance in his novels is a little bizaar!) I did not care for this latest effort. In fact after reading about 1/4 of the book I just closed it up and said &quot;Nope, I'm not going to waste my time with this drivel. Seems like he wrote it just to meet a deadline. Nothing new or exciting really. So, I'm thinking Cussler is off my list of authors to seek out for awhile."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"A Christmas present that comes early has arrived once again with the new Dirk Pitt novel by Clive Cussler entitled Trojan Odyssey. Once again Cussler has combined known history,action, adventure, romance, a evil villian and drama together. Cussler combines the plots of a terrible hurricane, a mysterious discovery by Summer Pitt, a evil man named Spector, a substance affecting the ocean, and mysterious tunnels. You will not be disapointed by Trojan Odyssey, it the typical Cussler and will be hard to put down. This novel also has great heart in it and leaves you wondering what happens next for Dirk Pitt, Al and company. Read this book it is well worth it for any Dirk Pitt fan."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"If you've never read Cussler, all his books are done via formula. Essentially they're all the same, but you'll never complain about the retread. They're all the same, yet all very entertaining.This book is Cussler's last (though not the last of the series). It suffers for that reason, as Cussler strives to tie loose ends.The reigns are being passed from Dirk Sr to Dirk Jr (a convenient appearance, but not wholly unbelievable). At the same time the reigns are being passed from Clive to his son.The story is entertaining, and likely was likely read by the writers of The Day After Tomorrow. It was novel before the movie, might be tired after, but this came first.There are some creepy moments between Dirk Jr and his sister, as she's set up to be a sexy character despite spending much of her time alone with her brother in the middle of the ocean - am I the only one that sees this? Couldn't the editor have stepped in on these?I won't complain much, though. Cussler has given us many, many (many) entertaining reads, and even though he ends on a dip it is a necessary one, and still a solid effort.If you're a Cussler fan buy it. If you're not yet a Cussler fan buy this, along with some older ones and read those first.Adventure fans will not go wrong."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I grew up on Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels; my mother was a fan, and I enjoyed them as well. I am well aware of the car fetish, St. Julien's foodieness, the cheesy camaraderie, the constant barrage of stunning women, a character named Clive Cussler cameoing in every book, etc. It's an adventure series; I get it. It had been years since I read one, though, until I grabbed this one, which my husband had picked up from the library. Now, all I can think about is whether they were this immature all along and I just didn't see it because I was an immature reader. I'm horrified that a large part of my early years might have been spent idolizing books that rival Twilight for pure audacious failure.To begin with, there are punctuation errors scattered throughout the book. I also found missing commas, periods, quotes, etc. I checked the front of the book and realized I had a first printing copy, so hopefully someone caught those and fixed them later. I mean, three of them by page 30? Come on.Then there are the adverbs. They're everywhere, a plague upon the story's existence. The most egregious sentence had four of its ten words end in -ly, but trust me, if you notice adverb overuse, just walk away now. They're more prevalent than moss in a Pacific Northwest forest.The book's overall feel is rough and unpolished, but in some places, the rough draft aroma is overpowering. The places it jarred me out of the story the quickest involved contradictory details. One happened early on with a boat which first had propellers, then magically had always possessed those caterpillar drive engines instead. Later, a blonde character, being introduced, had her hair loose in one sentence, then tied back in another in the same paragraph. Another major problem was awkwardness in sentence structure. It was crazy how many times I had to reread a sentence because it folded back on itself or got things out of chronological order. It was frequently painful, wondering how this book got out the publishing house door. Was it...smuggled?Exposition: Mr. Cussler, you're killing me here. Don't talk to me, tell your characters' story! I am, in fact, interested in saving the planet, and in its amazing quirks and details of composition, but do you really think the beginning of every other chapter in your adventure novel is the place to stop? Everything? And tell me about them? In present tense? No. It's not.Another big irritant was the sloppy language. I've seen better writing projects by teenagers. Sentences continually included extraneous phrases or (re)stated the obvious. In so, so many places, this story felt like it was written by someone who had to explain the details to himself so he wouldn't forget, as if he'd never written in this genre before, let alone this series.We haven't even gotten to story elements yet, so let's do that. First: Specter. If it wasn't obvious what was going on with that character from the absolute first time he showed up, then your brain was off. Yet none of the MCs can figure it out. Specter and the lavender-hued Odyssey were absolutely everywhere in this book, hogging the attention, while the historical reasoning for, you know, the whole plot as well as the book title was confined to a tiny section toward the back of the book.Everything is ridiculously easy for our heroes. Sandecker plans everyone's entire missions in minutes, it seems, informing them that all they need to do is show up and do the job. This happens a ridiculous number of times in this book, so that the characters can keep to a fast-paced schedule. Searching for things takes minutes instead of weeks, and everyone's smart enough to deduce all that they need to know, yet dumb enough to be oblivious to the plot details they're not supposed to figure out yet. (What, no one in the entire world of espionage, observation or research noticed the color-coded bad guy vehicles parading around the Caribbean for the last several years? You're all fired.)Was this a case of a terrible ghost writer dragged over from the YA section? A madly rushed edit job done by a chimpanzee with ADD? An author who felt his previous successes earned him the right to \\"break the rules\\" (No. No matter how often your books have succeeded, the minute you write a sloppy-ass story, you should get nailed for it.)? I've no idea, and it could easily be something else. But I am horribly disappointed with the quality of this story, even within its own series. Endless examples of what not to do in fiction writing. I'm forever going to use this book as an unfortunate example of how some truly terrible books can still get traditionally published. Oh look, Twilight! You have company!"},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"This novel was a deep, jagged pothole in the road of Dirk Pitt's adventures, BUT PLEASE don't judge the rest of Clive's work by this stinker. Read 'Flood Tide,' 'Atlantis Found,' 'Valhalla Rising,' 'Black Wind' 'Treasure of Khan,'or any of the previous works to discover your love of the series and James Bond-like escapist fantasy. My absolute favorite is 'Atlantis Found,' which can't be beat for pure audacious story-telling and incredible set-pieces. This novel was an oddly boring snooze that was badly written and edited even worse, if it was indeed edited at all. Perhaps this is why Mr. Cussler now hires \\"writing partners\\" for all his works. Immediately after this, the books are much improved."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I borrowed this book from our workplace library thinking that a nice thick book would help me endure the train ride home each evening.While I could endure the train ride, I could barely endure the book.This book can be compared to the awful romatic novels that pubescent high school girls might read but in this case for pubescent boys or men who get off on fantasy (not the good sci-fi stuff). Dirk Pitt is an aging McGuyver who could work his way out of anything no matter what the hindrance. Dirk Pitt is a lame Man of La Mancha with his sidekick Giordino, who is obviously a Sancho Panza ripoff.As soon as I read about Spector, who has never been seen, hides his face..I knew that Spector was someone else - in disguise. It was obvious to me, and I'm not a particularly good crime solver. Maybe Cussler meant to do that?The women in the book are perfect in appearance, whether evil or not. Each meal that is eaten is a gourmand's dream. Each sip of wine would bring Bacchus back from the grave. Wretched crap.This must be Cussler's mastabatory fantasy. I hate to be crude, but if the shoe fits....I guess Cussler appears in each of his books at the end, but it was so stupid and so self promoting, I wanted to gag.I finished it, but only to prove I have the intestinal fortitude for anything."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I picked up this book, remembering a few pleasurable volumes of the past. What I forgot is that I was in HIGH SCHOOL at the time! I found this book to be so fantastic, absurd, and boring that I could not finish it. Even a good book of the fantasy genre has a plausable fact upon which to build the story. This has none. I do not know how an adult reader could enjoy this type of work. On the other hand, I would recommend it to high school freshman and sophomore boys who might not have an interest in reading. It might be attractive to them. To others - - stay away. And with that, I will be silent as I would be embarrassed to admit I tried to read this book to any of my friends."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I have not read a Clive Cussler book since high school when I read Raise the Titantic. My parents were clearing out their library in preparation for moving and my wife and I took two Clive Cussler books (Trojan Odyssey and Valhalla Rising). I read Trojan Odyssey while my wife read Valhalla Rising. While we both finished the respective books, we both walked away with a dislike of Dirk Pitt as well as Cussler's writing style.I'm accustomed to fiction that has some basis in technical and historical accuracy. That includes authors like Tom Clancy and Jack Whyte. Clive Cussler is not one to let improbability or scientific inaccuracy stand in the way of his story. Combine that with a writing style that feels dumbed down, over exaggerated, one dimensional, and offers few positive comments regarding women with the exception of how they look in their bikini or sun dress, and you have a book where the entertainment value is greatly diminished. Then, there's Dirk Pitt; a \\"protagonist\\" that provides little appeal to the reader unless you like shallow characters that can miraculously save the day chapter after chapter with little effort under odds that every other character finds \\"impossible\\" or \\"inconceivable.\\"With all of my disdain for Dirk Pitt, historical and technical accuracy, and Cussler's writing style, there is certainly some entertainment value to the book. It's a quick read and has some nice descriptive elements, especially regarding the ocean, a favorite topic of mine. If you are looking for a relatively mindless book to read and credibility is not an issue, then you may enjoy this book.I may reread Raise the Titantic again just to see how much Cussler's writing and Dirk Pitt have changed in the more than twenty years between their being written."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I like a good thriller with a nod to history and other cultures. This wasn't one of those books. It was a bunch of nonsense, poorly written and with a weak plot, weak character development and nonsensical scenarios. The first and last of Cussler for me."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"My exposure to this author prior to reading this book was very limited, having seen only the movie \\"Sahara\\" (which I enjoyed immensely). My expectation that this book would be as enjoyable as the aforementioned Dirk Pitt movie was simply not borne out. Don't get me wrong, this is not a total flop, but neither will it impress very many readers.On the plus side, I thought the general storyline was quite creative and engaging. The various elements drawn into the nefarious plot of Specter, such as the foray into Homer, Celtic history, and modern issues of Chinese ascendancy and Western energy dependence, were skillfully crafted, in my opinion. Also, I enjoyed the flavor provided by Cussler's technical knowledge of all things nautical. It was reminiscent of a Tom Clancy novel in that sense.Where the story falls flat is pretty much everywhere else. I thought the characters were too shallow and too slick -- which is really sad considering how many novels this author has written about them. One would expect much better character development at this late stage in the series. Also, the dialogue seemed a bit stilted and unrealistic. Finally, there was very little suspense, which is a key element in stories of this nature. Pitt and Giordino made everything look too easy. Their seemingly flawless handling of every tight situation made James Bond look like a bumbling moron by comparison. As a result the ending was more than a little predictable and therefore disappointing.To summarize, I think Cussler is a talented writer who simply didn't deliver in this novel. I will likely read more in the Dirk Pitt series, but if the next one or two novels don't excite me any better than this one did, that will be the end of it for me."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"Why is the author slowly letting the superstars Dirk and Al fade away????

Sticking to his tried-and-true formula of a historical event, enviromental disaster (calling for the rescue of numerous people in peril) and bad guy trying to take over the world, it all comes together for a good read.Pitt spends alot of time agonising over getting older, and the normally amusing banter between Pitt and sidekick Al seems very strained, which leaves me as a long time follower a bit down!Maybe the surprise introduction of Pitt's twin offspring in the previous book will breathe some life into the Pitt legacy, as they play a signifigant part in Trojan Odyessy.Keeping my fingers crossed."},{"Title":"Trojan Odyssey: A Dirk Pitt Novel","review":"I always get excited when opening Cussler novels.

I have two precalculus students at present who go to different schools: one was issued this textbook while the other hasGlencoe Advanced Mathematical Concepts: Precalculus with Applications [GLENCOE ADVD MATHEMATICAL CONC].

It is very hard for me(as a student) to want to do the homework for a book that is dull and boring. This book covers all of the needed chapters and concepts that are needed for Calculus. It first begins reviewing what the student should have learned in previous Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry classes. It then takes these problems to the next level. While most books show you complicated math expressions and equations to explain a rule, this book both explains it in an easy to understand way, and it shows it in simple and complex expressions and equations. It also walks you through some great examples for every section of every chapter. This book also has calculator views for all of the examples; this includes graphs and multi entry calculations. The Chapters are separated nicely and are in an appropriate order. On the inside cover and first and last page, are formulas, basic graphs, and many more basic mathematical concepts that students will learn (or have learned). This book also does a small chapter introducing some calculus concepts, which helps in the transition from Precalculus to Calculus.

My district adpapted this book, but budget cuts prevented the district from adapting this book, by a stroke of bad luck I was,in retrospect sadly, able to buy this book. As a teacher I have to work very hard at building my own examples to make sure the students understand the problems assigned at the end of the sections of this book. If I were a student trying to use this book as a reference it would be next to worthless. The book is written as if all students were taking this class to prepare them for the Advanced Placement Calculus most students will not be doing this and need problems explain clearly and without assumptions that they should already know the concept. The problems of the book are not that difficult but the examples in the section preceding them are next to useless.

Take it line by line (few examples have more than 5-6 simple steps), and you'll have no trouble at all.O'Reilly is truly an amazing book publisher. It's very uncommon to pick up one of their books and find even one error or lack of coverage. This book is NO EXCEPTION. O'Reilly makes a durable book with a clever binding called a RepKover.

Basically, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, fifty or so delegates agreed to keep in-depth journals that would detail the day-to-day events at New York's Madison Square Garden. Reeves then used these journals to write this informative, at times very humorous and even poignant, book about the plots and sub-plots that accompanied the 1976 nomination of Jimmy Carter.The book details everything from the Carter Campaign's bizarrely paranoid attempt to bug the Convention Hall to the strongarm tactics used by Chairman Robert Struass to control the convention to 18 year-old delegate Clare Smith's valient attempts to track down Hunter S. Thompson. As well, we read about future Ohio Governor Richard Celeste's endless attempts to promote his own future viability as a presidential candidate and George Wallace's agony at fading into the background. Perhaps the most amusing sections for me were the ones dealing with joyful convention crashed Joe Kaselask and is attempts to sneak his way onto national television.At times while reading this book, I had to remind myself that the events detailed within took place a quarter of a century ago. Many of the most fascinating characters (like Hubert Humphrey, Pat Brown, Mo Udall, and Wallace)are no long with us, while other leading characters (Celeste, Fritz Efaw) have sunk into relative obscurity. I find myself wondering what happened to some of the non-politicians in the book. Has Clare Smith ever attended another Democratic Convention? Did Joe Kaselask go onto crash the 1980 Convention?Another added pleasure came from occasionally running across minor characters who would later go on to achieve a prominence apart from their actions at the '76 Convention. A good example of this would be wheelchair-bound, anti-war activist Ron Kovic, later to become better known as Tom Cruise but here presented as somewhat of a blowhard. Even a pre-anchorman Tom Brokaw shows up, long enough to get into a brawl while yelling at his antagonist, &quot;I won't forget you, creep!&quot;Appropriately enough, the only character who seems to have been exactly the same in '76 as he is now would have to be then-Governor, now-Mayor Jerry Brown. Brown, with his enigmatic presence and refusal to take anything at the convetion too seriously, actually emerges as one of the few pure characters in the book. In fact, Brown turns out to be more Carter-like than Jimmy Carter himself.In the end, imagine Robert Altman directing a political convention and that's what you have with Richard Reeves' wonderful book. Its non-fiction that reads like a brilliantly satirical novel. Last time I looked, there were 27 used copies of this book available so take a chance and order one. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Thinking of the Sensible: Merleau-Ponty's A-Philosophy.","review":"The Thinking of the Sensible is not like most secondary source books: rather than just summarizing Merleau-Ponty's thought, it is a deep engagement with Merleau-Ponty's key later concepts that brings out dimensions of his work that would otherwise remain hidden. Carbone draws attention to revealing terms, finds original formulations for ideas that carry Merleau-Ponty's thought further and deeper, and hones in on key junctures of Merleau-Ponty's thought that have not been adequately appreciated. The importance of Merleau-Ponty to contemporary thought suddenly becomes clearer with Carbone's treatment. The preface articulates what the \\"mutation between humanity and Being\\" that Merleau-Ponty saw emerging in his age entails in terms of his new ontology and its taking into account developments in quantum mechanics, biology, theories of nature, as well as the work of poets, painters, and other artists. Carbone shows how the idea of the \\"chiasm\\" tellingly describes the relations between the sensible and the intelligible, the conscious and the unconscious, and the surface and depth of perception and time. His treatment of the idea of \\"a-philosophy\\" brings out the interdisciplinary nature of Merleau-Ponty's thought. Carbone's treatment of the work of Proust sketches out the parallels with Merleau-Ponty's evolving notions of time and memory. The chapter on \\"The Time of Half Sleep\\" is the best treatment of the revolutionary nature of thinking through time with Merleau-Ponty to arrive at new senses of the \\"relationship of self to self\\" and of the chiasm between space and time. Carbone is also one of the only thinkers who takes seriously how the use of language in philosophizing is altered by Merleau-Ponty and Carbone both explains this in Merleau-Ponty's thought and exemplifies in his own use of language in the book such that metaphor and silence get their due place. However, it may be that Carbone's drawing forth from Merleau-Ponty a critique of \\"the concept\\" as it has been used within philosophy and Carbone's articulation of his idea of \\"voyance\\" to unlock the human relations with nature, the passivity of activity, and the relationship of the sensible and the ideal that is the greatest contribution of this book. A wonderful side benefit to the book is that it is short and concise, no interminable ramblings and defensive taking on of other philosophers--just right into the depths cogently."},{"Title":"The fairies (Enoch Pratt Free Library Poetry Broadsides)","review":"I have enjoyed this calendar, the artwork is delightful, reminiscent of Arthur Rackham, Dulac, and the like...

The author's modeling departs from Waltz's neorealism, but the structural perspective is soon amended, with the inclusion of one variable that is strictly on the unit level (the state's interest). This modification approximates his scheme to classical realism, with great gains to ad hoc analysis, like the one he does. Important to say that the historical research is very good too, remarkable in a study done by a political scientist. This book should be considered a good and commendable example of case study in the International Relations area."},{"Title":"Deadly Imbalances: Tripolarity and Hitler's Strategy of World Conquest","review":"very thought provoking and well written"},{"Title":"Globalization and Inequality: Neoliberalism's Downward Spiral","review":"Globalization and Inequality is a brilliant, well-written, and comprehensive overview of neoliberalism's ubiquity and influence. Using theoretical concepts borrowed from international relations theory and political science, Rapley presents a clear and concise thesis which argues that the growing inequality manifest both within and between countries is a direct result of the hegemonic neoliberalist \`regime'. Taking a broader view than geography, sociology, or economics, Rapley convincingly demonstrates the revolutionary nature of contemporary global relations, and suggests that alternative regimes of accumulation and, particularly, distribution are needed before the inequalities of globalization can be resolved. A \`must read' for anyone interested in current trends in globalization and development."},{"Title":"Globalization and Inequality: Neoliberalism's Downward Spiral","review":"I gave the book 5 stars, because it's well researched and very well organized and written.There are a lot of very insightful points that Rapley makes and then there are some I'm not sure I totally feel are fleshed out.First, I like how he defines all of the terms that most authors gloss over as assumed definitions. As he starts with \\"regime\\" as a prevailing way of doing things, rather than as a specific system of government, he is able to make a more nuanced observational point, i.e. that the regimes change even if the governmental system does not undergo a revolution and reinstallation.I like that he describes all leadership as requiring mass descent of which democracy is the only one that admits to it. This is actually insightful and is not necessary what the prevailing idea of government is. This would also suggest that politics is the study of how to obtain that consent (either through some sort of active affirmation like an election or through forceful compulsion).I also think he is spot on with respect to describing the Neoliberalist movement (i.e. capitalism) as being both constructive and destructive at once. The examples that he gives are compelling both in the US and - more catastrophically - abroad. The march of \\"neoliberal\\" progress is a destabilizing factor that few countries admit to, but have set up policy to control. In this regard, I like the quote...\\"Socialization is a transaction, However it is a transaction in which the seller enjoys a degree of power over the buyer.\\" Socialization is the tool by which Neoliberalism innocuously takes over existing norms in a nation.Where I am less satisfied is that the back half of the book presents an argument that Neoliberalism is the causal for fundementalism. While his argument is well articulated - i.e. one of income disparity, etc, I'm not totally convinced that he's made a strong argument. Neoliberalism is not the only fundamentally large discourse that is taking place. The sheer raw amount of change that has occurred resulting from neoliberalism has left many alienated an confused.Rapley touches on the divide between skilled and unskilled labor, but I would like to have seen him look to this more strongly. Indeed, Neoliberalism has promoted an increase in education in many parts of the world, despite increasing the divide between rich and poor. This increase in education has resulted in fewer fundementalist constitutents from which organizations can actually draw; and to much of an extent has changed the types of lack of civil rights these groups are able to actually communicate.It seemed like this is where he was going at first with his commentary that people would rather be the richest among the poor than the poorest among the rich, even though the poorest among the rich has more material wealth than the richest among the poor.... plus his ideas that in the US, the income disperaty is great, but because everyone feels they can achieve greater income, there is not social dissent.I'd like to see him more fully (although he does a lot of the work of it already in this book) vet out the \\"tools\\" in which neoliberalism does not result in large scale dissent in many countries where it is the most advanced. This might be more interesting to seeing where society is advancing to. In other words, it seems neoliberalism having \\"played out\\" for many nations is transforming into something new that will have it's own pluses and minuses"},{"Title":"\\"Call me mister.\\"","review":"Written in the final years of bifurcating sexes and social decorum, \\"Call Me Mister\\" is an in-depth look at becoming a man- shortly before it was forgotten how.It's practical lessons on the importance of self-betterment, personal dignity, being well-read and articulate, and the respect and treatment due to women have sadly dated much more than any clothing style.Being in it's target audience (16-25), I can say that \\"Call Me Mister\\" contains lessons scarcely found today and serves as a testiment of our social regression since."},{"Title":"\\"Call me mister.\\"","review":"somewhat dated, a slice of time when Mens grooming was important -1966***large format hardcover advice to men on: grooming/wardrobe/manners/personality/speaking/job success/fitness..overall pleasing layout+design.

This book was placed on a table adjacent to the \\"Nature/Birds\\" section and the \\"Children\\"sections and there was a sketch of a dead bird on its cover.

Upon closer inspection, and much to my dismay, I noticed that the complete title is \\"Canceled Flight: 101Tried and True Pigeon Killin' Methods\\".When I began to read through the book, I was sickened, shocked and enfuriated by its contents, which detail creative and horrible ways to commit heinous acts of sadism/cruelty against birds; in particular, pigeons. There is absolutely nothing humorous about this instructional book for killing and torturing.

But Rod lives on the planet Old North Australia, or as the inhabitants commonly call it, Norstrilia. People need to be tough on this harsh, dry planet. In order to make the people tough the government had long ago banned all luxuries, so now everyone lives simple, hard-working lives that vaguely resemble those lived in that long-gone, original, rural region of Northern Australia. Rod's property, like all those in Norstrilia, raises sheep, or what passes as sheep. They are mutated animals, now huge in size. The sheep are not breed for wool, but for stroon. This is a substance produced by a virus that infects the sheep. When consumed stroon has the effect of extending the life span of humans indefinitely. The virus that produces stroon, however, can only survive in the unique atmosphere of Norstrilia. Stroon means that people can live as long as they want, but in Norstrilia, before an individual becomes an adult, they must pass a test which proves that they are mentally and physically fit. If they fail the test the youths are sent to the 'giggle room', a place where they are drugged and experience a happy and quick death. Rod has a major handicap and so it seems that he might not see seventeen. How can Rod pass the test and what adventures await him after that?This book explores the issue of social rules. Most societies demand that people behave in certain ways, for example that couples pair of in monogamous relationships. These 'rules' usually exist for the benefit of the members of the society. Monogamous relationships, foe example, provide a stable environment for the raising of children. The question arises, however, are the 'rules' always right in all circumstances, and indeed are there other ways of doing things that might be equally effective? Life on Norstrilia is greatly restricted and the reader finds himself asking: \\"Should things really be like that?\\"Also the question of eugenics is explored in some detail. Should we end life on the basis of handicap? In doing so we prevent suffering and, by purifying the gene pool, prevent reoccurrence of the problem. But how much do the handicapped suffer? Indeed, what if the individual concerned also possessed characteristics of giftedness? What if, in unforeseen circumstances, the 'handicap' was itself an advantage? In this world of abortion and in-uterus genetic testing these questions are less academic than they seem.The plot of the book moves along in an interesting way. Often a new chapter takes the story in new and unexpected directions. Smith manages to convincingly draw the Norstrilians as 'red-neck' characters, though they come out more like 'backwoods' Americans than 'outback' Australians. Considering the connection with 'real' Australians is, in the story, in the very remote past this does not really matter.If you feel that this novel ends up-in-the-air and rather suddenly that is because the story continues in a sequel, called The Underpeople, which takes up exactly where this novel leaves off. Smith later combined these two novels, added extra text and published the resulting book under the titleNorstrilia(1975)."},{"Title":"The Planet Buyer","review":"Rod McBan is sixteen and in many ways just like any other wide-eyed youth of that age.

So both the reader of Victorian literature and also the classicist may be somewhat surprised to find here a passionate defense of the 1st-century BC orator and statesman Cicero. This is all the more surprising because Trollope wrote at a time when Cicero was under attack, especially from German classicists. In these two volumes, however, Trollope discusses Cicero's speeches, compares Cicero's life to that of contemporary Romans, and decides that Cicero was a great man and a patriot whose reputation should be defended. Although Trollope may be a little over-lenient regarding the orator's famous pride and bombast, his glowing assessment is (ironically) closer to some modern views than that of his contemporaries who lambasted Cicero from their positions as professional classicists. I heartily recommend the set to Trollope enthusiasts and to Cicero partisans, but the average reader of Victorian literature may find the classical dicussions uninteresting, while the average classicist may not be satisfied with Trollope's non-scholarly approach."},{"Title":"Guide to aesthetics: (Breviario di estetica) (Library of liberal arts)","review":"This is a 1913 work by arguably Italy's most famous modern philosopher. Croce's writing and thought is pitted against positivism, and this 'guide' very much speaks that antagonism, much in the way of Nietzsche (in content; not in style). Reading it I did occasionally think toward Nietzsche, though I am unaware to what degree if any Croce himself was influenced by the German. (Curiously, I very frequently thought of Wordsworth's brief presentation on poetry and art in _Lyrical Ballads_; some language, especially in the first chapter, seemed rather distinct echoes: though that may be happenstance of the translation.)The work is very much flows out of and through Modernist thought, though the presentation is very much Croce's own approach to the questions of \\"What is Art?\\" (the first chapter), art history, art criticism, and the relationship of art to man and society. It is definitely a philosophic presentation, a formal argument, and at times requires attention. But I did not find it a terribly difficult read -- though, if this you are new to aesthetics you may find it a little challenging. I would be surprised if too challenging, though. (It is, after all, a guide: intended for a more public consumption, if cutting short arguments and evidences to that end.)I will recommend this little work to anyone interested in the question of beauty -- especially those that also reject the limited world of positivism. Art here is defined as intuitive and sensual, and not through genre, history, morality, or philosophical concept. (Indeed, Croce does a handy job rejecting such as the definition of art.) The first chapter alone, which centers on intuition and ideality, is on its own worth the effort and attention -- and price of admission. (And, you need not read farther to have gained much in thought on the subject of beauty.)I give it 5 stars on Amazon's scale. On other scales I might limit it to 4 because of its limited aim: it is but a 'guide.' But, then, even in its brevity, it remarkably full; so perhaps 5 stars is indeed accurate. In the end, I can not see how anyone -- be they an artist or a philosophical thinker -- would not benefit greatly from pondering the ideas in this little text."},{"Title":"Guide to aesthetics: (Breviario di estetica) (Library of liberal arts)","review":"Difficult and challenging, Croce's work provides a unique approach to the study of art, art criticism, and aesthetics. This is not an easy read, but the insights into the nature and place of art in society and in the human soul make it wort hthe effort. This is best read with R.G. Collingwood's work on Art."},{"Title":"Within the atom;: A popular view of electrons and quanta,","review":"very good, good price and good idea to reprint old books. very recommended place.nothing else to add, that is all"},{"Title":"Instant Immersion Arabic (Arabic Edition)","review":"I have other language courses, in many languages.

In the section about racing technique they explain the fundamentals of cornering. Well, there's nothing more fundamental than the Late Apex. They explain what it is, then they show an illustrative diagram that has the late apex and early apex reversed! (They show the late apex but label it an early apex, and they show the early apex but call it a late apex.)2. They claim to give \\"the best racing lines for all tracks\\" -- which was my main reason for buying the book -- but they don't. Rather, they make lots of generalities about about various turns, like \\"Stay out of the dirt when possible,\\" and \\"Don't let them pass you.\\" I expected to at least see illustrations of critical turns with suggested racing lines drawn through them.My expectations were high after my first experience with their work, which was their Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle-Earth guide. It was helpful. The GT4 guide, however, is rather repetitive and full of filler, as if trying to fill out a 300-page book with insufficient material. And redundant. And repeats itself. With lots of filler. Lots of redundant filler. Repeatedly.However, if one is looking for lots of automotive and racing trivia and jargon, this book has lots of it -- it's just that the book is billed as \\"The Complete Owners Manual\\" but the majority of the book is just. . . stuff. And trivia. And more stuff. And filler. Repeatedly."},{"Title":"Gran Turismo 4 (Prima Official Game Guide)","review":"If what you want is a handy reference for some cars, an index of all cars that can be unlocked, and something very light to thumb through at your leisure, buy this book.If what you want is what is advertised on the book -- \\"The best racing lines for all tracks\\" \\"Expert racing lessons to help you dust your competition\\" -- you'll be sorely disappointed.The closest they come to including \\"racing lines\\" is brief mentions of a fraction of the turns on each track. Particularly bad is the Nurburgring Nordschleife coverage. Here's an example of how they describe one vast section of the course: \\"The third section of the course is also highly technical, with many difficult chicanes and hairpins connected to one another.\\" That's all they say for what is approximately 3 to 4 miles of track.The \\"expert lessons\\" appear to be completely missing.

Why? Because Gran Turismo is a racing game. What can a guide teach you that you can't possibly learn by playing the game.

Because I wasted my money on it, that's why, and I'm going to bash into the ground and attempt to scare others from wasting their money as well.Pros and Cons:+ Pages 292-295, which contains a list of the cars you win racing certain events.- It \\"describes\\" driving techniques. How many have ever passed a driving test by only reading the driving manual and never actually getting behind the wheel?- It analyzes car manufacturers, which can be fun, but it's also something that's been found in car magazines throughout the world.- It gives you maps of the race course and the key turning points, once again \\"describing\\" how to take the turns.- The guide has a kind of \\"extras\\" section, that actually bores us with the past Gran Turismo titles and how they affected the industry. We know how it has affected the industry, because their have been FOUR titles.- Then, it tries to squeeze money from you by advertising, in a section all its own by the way, other GT items (hats, DVDs, a steering wheel). This wouldn't have bothered me had they placed it at the back of the book but it's closer to the middle.- Finally, it has all the websites of all the car manufacturers, another way of shamelessly advertising things most of us can't afford.Some of you may think that my \\"cons\\" are actually pros, but when you think about it, a strategy guide (which they cleverly titled \\"Game Guide\\") is supposed to aid you in the game.

Any questions an educator might have regarding any part of a law are well explained. The book's author Jim Walsh has done a magnificient job of delineating just what can and cannot be done in the classroom, what can be done by administrators and by teachers, and what effects actions of others have on students and their education. Teachers, after reading the book, can interact intelligently with administrators when dealing with situations which affect education. For so long, teachers have been told what the state law says.

There's plenty of action, characters to cheer for, and some nice twists and turns throughout. Our heroine is Cordelia Naismith, a scientist from the stiflingly modern Beta Colony, who gets caught up in a complex web of strategy and betrayal during a war with a comparably primitive planet and repeatedly finds herself thrown together with Commander Vorkosigan.I find little to say about these two novels. For sure, Bujold coordinates her plot well, with clever surprises arriving on a regular basis and all of it building up to a comprehensive and rather grim picture of the societies involved. Character development is relatively strong, as we get good portraits of emotional intensity from both the main characters throughout the book. I think that most of the dialogue exchanges are handled well, with occasional dashes of humor. The villains, on the other hand, are so underdeveloped that they might as well have twirling black mustaches. Fine entertainment overall, much recommended, but not perfect."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"It is GOOD. Love, Hate, Relationships. All of it is in there. And come to think of it.

The plot was excellent, holding your interest."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Although I love this book (or rather, compilation), I think that people who are expecting a hard SF novel are in for a big shock.These two books follow the story of one woman falling in love over intergalactic distances, but there's a remarkably low proportion of technical detail about how anything works or what the big machines look like.Also, anyone without a heathy respect for and appreciation of quasi-medieval cultures had better stay away, unless they're willing to have an open mind about certain aspects of those types of cultures, since the plot moves from a very technological culture to a relatively feudal one.I've always been a fan of the Vorsokiverse, but I think that perhaps _Cordelia_ isn't a very good place to introduce someone to the universe."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This is just one of many fantastic books the series. Yes it does read like a soap opera but that is what makes these books so much fun.

It's definitely light reading, but provided good entertainment while it lasted."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I sure am going against the grain here. For the life of me I cannot see why or how this is receiving so many good reviews. What started out strong quickly evolved into something that went nowhere fast and left a story that I couldn't really care about.The beginning, or first 100 pages or so, really caught my interest. I was fascinated by Cordelia and Vorkosigan and the world she was creating. The scene with the floating jellyfish really captured my interest because she was \\"discovering\\" a new and alien planet and it felt as though we were also discovering it. Cordelia was tough minded, sure footed and full of confidence. Vorkosigan was likewise, very tough and soldier like, not to mention the persona she created of him as the Butcher of Komarr. Fascinating, then it seemed like she hit a brick wall as soon as Cordelia went back to her home world.From there the plot was forced. I hate it when characters or put into forced situations that are there not for realism but in order to further the plot (both psychiatrists come to mind, especially the second one). This of course set up an unrealistic flight to Escobar, and than to Barrayar to get married and blah blah blah. All the excitement that was built up in the first 100 pages disappeared completely, leaving you with a domestic story of little consequence and of little interest.I can usually see where or how a book would win or become nominated for a Hugo or Nebula, even if I didn't necessarily like the book. In Barrayar's case the book is so uninspiring it feels like an afterthought and I am at a loss for why it would even be considered for the Hugo or Nebula. If she would have continued the way she wrote the first 100 or so pages this would have been a dead bang winner, as it is it barely gets a nod because of the first 100 pages. Not a recommend.1.5 stars."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Cordelia's Honor (1996) is the first SF omnibus edition in the Vorkosigan series. It containsShards of HonorandBarrayar. It also includes an Author's Afterword and a timeline of stories in the series to date.Shards of Honor (1986) is the first novel in this series. It starts on an unsettled planet in a newly explored star system.Cordelia is hiking up a mountain with Dubauer. The planet is much more like Terra than is Beta. They can breathe the air without special equipment.Dubauer is examining the ground cover and trees while Cordelia is scanning the landscape. She notices smoke arising from near the camp. Then their shuttle takes off.They both try calling the camp, but are not answered. They return to the camp to find it ablaze. Cordelia finds the body of Rosemont in the grass. He has been shot with a nerve disrupter.Cordelia and Dubauer search for a comm unit among the wreckage and call their ship. Stuben answers, but Ullery describes the encounter with a Barrayaran patrol. Cordelia orders them to take the Rene Magritte back to Beta and report the situation to Survey.Then they are found by the Barrayarans. Cordelia loses consciousness. When she awakes, Vorkosigan is standing over her.Aral had been stunned by someone in his own party. Apparently Cordelia had also been shot with a stunner. But Dubauer had been shot with a nerve disrupter.Cordelia and Dubauer are Vorkosigan's prisoners. Dubauer is still alive, but unable to speak and having convulsions. Aral offers to cut his throat to put him out of his misery. Cordelia refuses, but gives Vorkosigan her parole.Barrayar (1991) is the eighth novel in this series. Cordelia is pregnant with a son. She and Aral name him Piotr Miles for his grandfathers. Then an assassin shoots a canister of Soltoxin poison into their bedroom.Aral recognizes the distinctive scent of the poison and tells Cordelia to hold her breath. They escape the bedroom and the Soltoxin antidote is fetched from the Imperial Residence for them. Then the physician learns that Cordelia is pregnant.The Soltoxin is being flushed from their system, but the antidote is very harmful to the fetus. His bones start dissolving. Piotr wants to abort the fetus, but Cordelia looks for another answer.Vaagan knows of a possible solution, but it is dangerous to the mother. Cordelia suggests that the treatment would be safer if the fetus was within an uterine replicator. Vaagen agrees and Miles is relocated into the device.Piotr thinks of Miles as a mutant and wants to dispose of him. After frequent and impassioned explanations that the damage is not genetic, the Count is of the same opinion still. Aral revokes his clearance to Vaagen's lab.Then a civil war starts on Barrayar. The Vorkosigan household abandons the mansion at Vorkosigan Surleau and disperses into the hills and woods. Cordelia meets some of the Count's old guerrilla unit who had fought against the Cetagandans.These stories contain the backstory of Miles Vorkosigan. They end with his birth. The next omnibus in this sequence isYoung Miles.Highly recommended for Bujold fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of interstellar warfare, political intrigue, and true romance. Read and enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This was the first book in the Vorkosigan series that I read (I know that it's a compendium) and it got me hooked. The plotting is fun, the characterizations are excellent. You should read it."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Previously published as two separate novels, so not new.Have just re-read them, and am very pleased to report they are as terrific as I remember them."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This is the beginning of the vorkosigan books, and it is great. I think it is the best book of the group."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I don't usually read this kind of book--space opera, military SF, etc. . . But I was drawn in by the widespread praise of Bujold and the fabulous heroine. This, it seems to me, is SF that has something for everyone. Do you prefer SF with strong female characters (like I do): Check. Military battles? Check. Political Intrigue? Check? Stories of outerspace? Check? Depictions of alternative worlds? Check? \\"Hard sci-fi\\" in the form of speculations of genetics? Check? A little romance? Check.I was amazed by how much I loved these books. While some people only consider them prologues to the main event--the books featuring Miles--for me, these books can stand on their own. But pick up The Warrior's Apprentice and meet Miles as soon as you're done here!"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I brought this book (or books, if you prefer) with me on vacation. Thanks to Ms. Bujold, I spent far too much of that vacation locked away in the camper reading.I would give both \\"Shards of Honor\\" and \\"Barrayar\\" five stars. The characters are engaging, interesting people, and the plot has plenty of excitement to keep you turning the pages. With that said, I think \\"Barrayar\\" is the stronger of the two books.The plot of \\"Shards of Honor\\" is more straightforward, and at times, started to feel a little too easy. Given the bloody backdrop to Cordelia Naismith's meeting with Aral Vorkosigan, I had trouble accepting the romantic seeds of their relationship. Likewise, as the war between the Betans and Barrayarians develops, forcing Cordelia to choose where her love and loyalties lie, there were occasional moments where things happened a bit too quickly and easily for my sake. Characters sometimes seemed to be a bit too noble or dastardly, depending on whose side they were on.With that said, I still enjoyed it immensely. Cordelia and Aral are great characters, and the star-crossed lovers story works marvelously well, as does the messiness of Barrayar's politics. I can only hope my own first novel is half as good.The second half of the book, first published as \\"Barrayar,\\" explores the consequences and implications of the first book. There are no easy \\"Happily Ever After\\" endings here. Cordelia and Aral get to deal with uprisings and political intrigue, not to mention the painfully vivid near-loss of their unborn son Miles.I think \\"Barrayar\\" is even better than the first book. The writing is cleaner on a sentence level, the plot is more complex, and the emotions are stronger across the board. Secondary characters are developed, and many of the subplots are strong enough to be books all by themselves.I haven't read the rest of the Miles Vorkosigan series yet, but after reading this book, I'm planning to pick up the next books very soon."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"The best military sci-fi series ever starts with the two books that make this omnibus:\\"Shards of honor\\": Survey Captain Cordelia Naismith leads her team on newly discovered planet Sergyar, only to find the Barrayaran army well advanced on the job of taking over.This Cordelia has no power to stop, as her Survey team is no match for the Barrayar war party... but one of the enemies, Army Captain Aral Vorkosigan, turns out to have a great need of her help against his own chiefs-in-command and his real mission has very different objectives from those put out for all to see. Slowly seduced by the man's hidden need to keep on to his sanity and last bits of honor, Cordelia faces the choice her Betan upbringing never led her to consider: abandon everything and join him on Barrayar... or leave him to his slow, ingrate and honorless self-destruction.\\"Barrayar\\": Aral Vorkosigan is the acting Regent for the child-emperor Gregor Vorbarra. The danger he faces everyday follows him home, where Cordelia has to deal with a vindctive and strong-headed ex-General father-in-law, Piotr Vorkosigan, with young Lt. Koudelka's suicidal depression, with the unsecure bodyguard Drou, with maniacal killer Sgt. Bothari and his rape-begotten daughter - and to top it all, Aral's conscience problems lead a very ineffective would-be assassin to attack the household - thus leaving yet unborn Miles Vorkosigan with the stunted body he'll try all his life to surpass.Ah, and not to forget - politics on Barrayar is everything, and young widow Princess Kareen, Gregor's mother, will be the prize everyone lusts for in the pretendership that will force Cordelia to show her mettle again.This is a superb work, patiently put together and highly enjoyable. I loved Aral's personality and found Cordelia more than his half mind and heart.This book I'm keeping close forever!!!"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I loved this book from the first time I read it to the tenth time I re-read it over the years. Cordelia comes alive in Bujold's hands. While the events might be too much to make believeable in most authors hands, here you cheer for Cordelia. From the matter of fact treatment of sexual knowledge to the practical use of future technology, Cordelia's refreshing views on the world of Barrayar shine as a light for our times as well. There is plenty of action, and the book moves rapidly along, so you wish immediatly to go get more Bujold when the plot is concluded. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Cordelia is leading a scientific expedition to another planet when their group is treacherously attacked. By necessity she hooks up with Vorkosigan, a member of the attacking group, also stranded. From different ends of the galaxy and with diametrically opposed world views, two good people find they have more in common with each other than with their ignorant or evil brothers. Of course, too much separates them for anything to ever come of their mutual admiration and sympathy - neither would be acceptable in the other's world.The rest of the story is what they gain - and its costs to them.What a thrill to find Bujold! Her view of the human condition speaks to me."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This is more than just a space-opera novel, while it is part of that genre. Here we hae the opportunity to see how a world that was cut off from the rest of the universe for over a hundred years.

I'm jealous for anyone who just picked this up, because this is a fabulous novel and it starts off an incredible series!"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"CORDELIA'S HONOR is a compilation of two of Bujold's novels: SHARDS OF HONOR and BARRAYAR. The main character in both is Cordelia Naismith. These are wonderful books, although I thought BARRAYAR is the better written of the two.I suspect, however, that the person who wrote the above &quot;synopsis&quot; did not read this book at all. Cordelia is not forced into marriage, he is not her arch-enemy, and her husband is made Regent for the young Emperor, who is 5 years old.If you have not read Lois McMaster Bujold, and you enjoy well-written, thoughtful novels with good characterizations and well-thought-out plots the READ this book. I envy you the opportunity to read her books for the first time."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"I read this book before I even knew of Bujold or the Miles Universe. Despite the cheesy old cover, I pressed on and discovered a treasure of an epic space saga. Cordelia's Honor is actually two books: Shards of Honor and Barrayar. This is a novel for the space opera fan and those who appreciate skillful writing. Bujold's talent leans more on the character driven side rather than the scientific side (a la Star Wars). You will be introduced to galaxy spanning human colonies, namely: Beta and Barrayar. These two worlds collide via the Betan captain - Cordelia - a liberated, headstrong female captain of an expeditionary science ship and Aral - the so called Butcher and warlord from the monarchical Barrayar. Forced to surive together in a remote world, they discover each other's humanity after bridging the gap between their worlds that seemed so violently different because of xenophobia and ignorance. Bujold's intelligent characterization evoke pity and terror in a remarkable tightly woven tale - and its her first published book!In Barrayar, Aral marries Cordelia despite his world's disapproval and she learns to deal with the patriarchal society despite her liberated upbringing on Beta Colony. This is where it most reminds of me of Star Wars: monarchies, corrupt leaders, and political intrigue. The action sequences are smart and suspenseful. In both books there's a whole slew of supporting characters and none of them are two dimensional. At the end is a spinoff to the Miles Universe and you will learn how he was born with his deformity and will get a whole 8 (?) more novels that are just as good as this one."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Series fiction has requirements very different from the single novel, or even multiple books forming one long story such as Tolkien's Ring Trilogy. The multi-book single storyline can be - probably is - so self-referential you have to read every book in the series, in order, to understand what's happening in later books. But the author of a true open-ended series like Lois McMaster Bujold's Miles Vorkosigan novels knows readers may start with any book in the series, and read them in utterly random order. Thus, while each book must build on, and ideally add to and enrich what's come before, it must also be self-contained and not require having read any other book in the series to enjoy. Bujold has always been aware of this, thus for new readers interested in her tales of Miles Vorkosigan, it's not really necessary to begin with Cordelia's Honor. On the other hand, if you are a brand-new reader to this series, why NOT start at the beginning?The two novels contained in Cordelia's Honor (Shards of Honor and Barrayar) form the beginning of the Miles Vorkosigan series. (Bujold's novel Falling Free takes place within the same fictional universe but, being set approximately 200 years before Miles' birth, features none of the series' familiar characters. Eventually you'll want to read Falling Free, but it doesn't matter when; you can insert it into your Bujold reading experience anytime.) These two books have an interesting history. Shards of Honor is Bujold's first novel (not merely the first novel she ever sold, but the first she ever wrote, thus disproving the axiom, \\"All first novels are unsaleable trash\\"). She begins writing it in December 1982. In mid-'83, having worked through the Shards material and about a third into what would eventually become Barrayar, Bujold realizes her manuscript is becoming too long to submit as one book (the \\"wisdom\\" at the time being a thin manuscript is more likely to be picked off the slush pile than a thick one). Bujold finds a logical breaking point for her tale (Cordelia's arrival on Barrayar), puts it in final draft form, and mothballs the partially finished \\"rest of the story.\\"Bujold submits Shards and begins working on another book, The Warrior's Apprentice. She's about halfway through that when Shards comes back rejected with an editorial suggestion she tighten it up. She finishes Warrior's, then cuts about 80 pages out of Shards, giving her two good unpublished novels. In 1985, around the time she finishes her third novel, Ethan of Athos, Warrior's makes it over the transom at Baen, and suddenly she goes from unpublished wannabe to successful novelist with three books (Shards, Warrior's, Ethan) SOLD. Shards is published in 1986.Fastforward to 1989. Bujold has written four more books, Falling Free, Brothers In Arms, Borders of Infinity (a short story collection), and The Vor Game. Then the program-book editor of Philcon, a long-established SF convention in Philadelphia, asks Bujold to do a short story or outtake to donate to their program book. Remembering the unfinished novel fragment of years before, she troops up into her attic, retrieves the pages, reads them and decides to complete it as a novel. After all, it's already a third finished, right? And in 1992, Barrayar won the Hugo Award for Best SF Novel of the Year.These two books, written seven years apart, tell one continuous story arc. By being published together as Cordelia's Honor the story is finally presented (to quote Bujold) \\"very much as I originally envisaged its shape, if not its details.\\"Shards of Honor stars Captain Cordelia Naismith, commander of a survey team for the Betan Expeditionary Force, and Captain Aral Vorkosigan, victim of a mutiny on his Barrayaran warship. Both stranded on an unexplored alien planet, officers on opposite sides of the Betan-Barrayaran War, they reach an agreement of honor: they will trust and rely on each other for survival as they travel across a planet seemingly intent on throwing all its resources into killing them before they can reach Aral's ship. And then there's the little problem of overcoming the mutineers.... In the process of their adventures, Cordelia and Aral fall in love.Both novels are told from Cordelia's viewpoint. Barrayar deals with her first experiences on that planet, leading up to the birth of her and Aral's son Miles (though there is an epilogue showing Miles at age five). Thereafter in this series Miles, with very few exceptions, takes center stage. Never again will Cordelia be the main character. But for these two books she emerges as one of the most well-realized, loving and vulnerable but still tough-as-nails female SF protagonists ever.The next book in the series you'll want to read is The Warrior's Apprentice, which picks up Miles' life at age 17."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"&quot;Cordelia's Honor&quot; contains two earlier published books, &quot;Shards of Honor,&quot; and &quot;Barrayar,&quot; which are the second and third stories in Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan Saga. Together, they tell the story of Cordelia Naismith, a survey officer from civilized, polite Beta. In &quot;Shards of Honor,&quot; her crew was killed, and she was taken prisoner by Aral Vorkosigan, &quot;The Butcher of Komarr.&quot; When she was released, and then recaptured in a later conflict, Vorkosigan rescued her and proposed to her, and she married him.The second half of &quot;Cordelia's Honor,&quot; &quot;Barrayar&quot; (which won the Hugo Award), is the story of the incredible effect Cordelia had on Vorkosigan's warrior planet, Barrayar, and how she stopped the civil war that threatened to slag down the planet. The heir she bore Vorkosigan was twisted and deformed from an assassination attempt during pregnancy. This son, Miles, Lord Vorkosigan, is the hero of the following nine books (so far) of the Vorkosigan Saga. I am very fond of David Drake's and S. M. Stirling's SF realistic war stories. Lois McMaster Bujold's &quot;Barrayar&quot; and the Vorkosigan Saga stories are Drake's and Stirling's equal. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"A fan of the Seafort Saga, I saw the Vorkosigan saga recommended instead of Feintuch's books in several of the reviews for the Seafort saga. I figured I love scifi, especially military scifi, so I should give this series a shot.It is absolutely fantastic. I started off with Cordelia's Honor because I wanted to get the background before I plunge into the Miles' part of the saga. This book is a combination of Shards of Honor and Barrayar (Barrayar won the Hugo award), and it tells the story of how Cordelia met Aral, got married, and wound up having Miles. Sounds like a romance? It isn't. It's full of twists and turns that'll keep you on the edge of your seat. Although I don't think Shards of Honor wasn't as exciting as Barrayar, it still is a wonderful book.Cordelia, of the planet Beta, becomes Aral \\"Butcher of Komarr\\" Vorkosigan's prisoner while she's doing a Survey mission. Vorkosigan has this \\"thing\\" about prisoners and refuses to do harm to them. Well, being his prisoner spins off into her first adventure where she gets a taste of Barrayaran society (where Vorkosigan is from). Beta and Barrayar are sort of like the technologically advanced hippies vs. Conservative Spartan societies. Barrayar prides itself on its military capacities, but it's politics are a mess. The technology is primitive since Barrayar only came out of isolation less than a century before Cordelia arrives. The current emperor trying to straighten everything out, the class structure is incredibly rigid, and civil wars seem to be the norm. On Beta, they're sexually liberated, there is no poor, and they have the best technology of the galaxy.The two of them wind up in a few more adventures together, and then they are happily married on Barrayar - where Cordelia is an outsider and Vorkosigan is a war-hero. When the emperor names Vorkosigan the regent to the emperor's heir - 4 year old Gregor - Cordelia finds herself swept up in politics, conspiracies, and treason. The book is a non-stop thrill ride.Bujold has a fantastic writing style, mixing adventure, theology, philosophy, romance, politics (but not over your head type politics), and suspense. The characters are all believable , and you can't help connecting with at least a couple of them. All the characters are multi-dimensional and with a great variety. For example, there's Cordelia, the theologian who does not understand war, killing, and senseless masochist honor. There's Aral, a 'progressive' Barrayaran who tries to reconcile his ancestral-culture with everything that's being brought in, not ever quite knowing what the ring thing to do is. Bothari, a \\"monster\\" in appearances and insane in mind, who reflects whatever is expected of him... the list just goes on and on.Wonderful tale, but the only drawback was I started it the week before exam finals. Bad choice on my part: I couldn't put the book down. I'd tell myself \\"one more chapter,\\" but that was just impossible and 100 pages later I'd still be trying to pry myself away from the book. And now I'm in agony that I don't own Young Miles"},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"Lois McMaster Bujold has long been my favorite Science Fiction author. She earned that status with her wit, believable characters, and beautiful prose. Cordelia's Honor, a combination of her two books _Shards of Honor_ and _Barrayar_, is one of her best. It has it all: romance, drama, action, adventure. Yet it is not mere melodrama.The story is about Captain Cordelia Naismith of the Betan Expeditionary Force and her love, Admiral Aral Vorkosigan, known throughout the galaxy as the infamous &quot;Butcher of Komarr.&quot; They fall deeply in love despite being on opposite sides of a war, and yet they are both still determined to do their duty.Bujold has written many styles of book, from space opera to mystery to romantic comedy. Cordelia's Honor is high drama, a love story set against the backdrop of both interstellar and civil war. The main characters are not your standard heroic twenty-somethings; they are mature people, who nonetheless learn to grow together. Neither is perfect, but both try to be the best they can be, both apart and together. But there is still plenty of action, everything from space battles to assasinations to inflitration of the enemy capital."},{"Title":"Cordelia's Honor","review":"This is the book that got me hooked on Lois McMaster Bujold.
