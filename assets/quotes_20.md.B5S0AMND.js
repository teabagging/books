So the two kids set traps to scare the other boys. I like it because I like Owen Foote books."},{"Title":"Owen Foote, Frontiersman","review":"This book, Owen Foote, Frontiersman, was an enjoyable book because of the different events that Owen faced. These events allowed me to connect with some of the things that he encountered. Most young readers would be able to connect to having a friend like Joseph and the what Owen and Joseph encounters as frontiersman. The organization of the book was easy to follow and the sentences were easy to read and understand. There are a few pictures in black and white throughout the book, but these are not necessary but are handy for readers to connect with the event taking place. Young readers, boy or girls, that were interested in the outdoors would take a great liking to this book."},{"Title":"Owen Foote, Frontiersman","review":"This book was FANTASTIC! I have three children aged 4-10. They all read it and loved it, including me. My nine year old son liked it the most.

Robert Crisp describes the action of the daily battle (swanning about the blue) as well as the activity in the evening when men of battle attempt to get some rest while the mechanics and fitters prepare the armour for another day's battle. Major Crisp tells it like it was- the humor and the sadness. He daringly retells his own combat decisions and the results (which are not always flattering to himself). I've read this book several times over the years. I always find it refreshing and exciting. I regret that I only have a paperback issue. Highly recommended for anyone interested in Ameican M3 light tanks, British warfare tactics in the desert and leadership in combat."},{"Title":"Brazen Chariots","review":"I admit to having known Bob Crisp. Somehow his book does not give justice to the man. He writes in a modest manner which suggests that he only 'did his bit' as the British would say. This is far from the truth, as this book became virtually a set text for the Israeli army. For anyone wanting to know more about the confusion of desert tank warfare, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Brazen Chariots","review":"As a Tank Commander in the British Army (RAC) I found this book to be extremely helpful when I first read it in the early sixties prior to my deployment in the Middle East. Desert tank warfare has changed very little, if at all, since Bob Crisp wrote his book - as witnessed by the Gulf War less than a decade ago. Indecision and incompetence is present in all military organizations, at every level, but it always appeared to me that the higher the level the more indecisive and incompetent were the perpetrators. It is an excellent book and I highly recommend it to any who would choose as his career to ride in a &quot;Brazen Chariot&quot;."},{"Title":"Brazen Chariots","review":"I first read Major Crisp's book many years ago. Then I served as a tank platoon leader in Desert Storm. His book was the single biggest influence on my understanding of what I would face and how things passed. It is exceptional, honest, funny, and illuminating. If you are interested in military history at all, this is one of the best books you could ever read about men and tanks in combat."},{"Title":"Brazen Chariots","review":"This book is old and hard to find, but boy I was glad I did! My personal collection of WW2 books grows every year. Sometimes I hit upon a real gem. This book is one of them. Its a short narrative of tank warfare during Operation Crusader. The author writes well, and there are many amusing stories thrown in. I found this book hard to put down, and in the end was almost moved to tears. I learned more about the conditions these guys went through in North Africa then any other book I have read concerning the African campaigns. Its a damned fine story. Read it. On another note I found out that the author, Bob Crisp, passed away in 1994. Too bad, I would have loved to thank him personally for such a great read."},{"Title":"Brazen Chariots","review":"This is one of the finest first hand accounts of the British armor battles fought in North Africa Desert during November and December 1941. It is a very well written account were the author allows you feel the emotion, tension, and fear experienced by the gallant soldiers 3rd Royal Tank Regiment. They operate the under gunned US M3 Light Tank (affectionately nick named \\"Honey\\" by the British), while fast and mobile being powered by an radial engine designed for aircraft could out run the larger German Mark III medium tanks but were out gunned by the 50mm and short barreled 75mm cannons while armed these these tanks.You travel with Captain Crisp as he swans across the North African sands as the advance guard for his battalion fid and the charging the enemy in a head long all out cavalry style charge similar that of the Light Brigade of old.The story covers Captain Robert Crisp's gallant efforts to lead his troop of \\"Honeys\\" against German logistic columns guarded by armored cars and combating other armor columns for the capture of a key airfield. You can feel the vastness of the open desert and image the heat, wind blown sand, and the smells of battle. And in the end you feel the sorrow and grief as the hero is sustains a grave head injury by explosion which mortally wound his best friend whom he just rescued from his combat damaged \\"Honey\\".It is a book that you can read once and come back and read it again in a few weeks or even years with the enjoyment. I still remember passages which always create mental images of what it was like in the vast openness of the great North African Desert. Captain Crisp shows the human side of war and well as the futility of death and destruction caused by war. Captain Crisp servived his injuries sustained in the desert and went on to fight in Northeast Europe after the Normandy landings."},{"Title":"Brazen Chariots","review":"I enjoyed this thoroughly. The book is a rare viewpoint from a tank commander in the Desert in WWII. Really shows the confusion so much a part of any war, but particularly this campaign."},{"Title":"Brazen Chariots","review":"I enjoyed this book as a former combat arms officer, history buff, and WWII wargamer. The book provides an engaging account of a British WWII veteran's experience in North Africa that spans the excitement, boredom, unpredictability, and horror of armored warfare. He speaks credibly and frankly by including descriptions of his successes as well as his failures."},{"Title":"Brazen Chariots","review":"Captain Crisp recalls his experiences fighting Rommel's forces in the desert with vivid detail. His account brings to light the everyday fighting man's lack of direction from top staff and the confusion of desert warfare. An excellent acount of a pivotal point in the history of WWII."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"I don't think I can describe what this book did for me twenty years ago. At an age when I didn't have any clue who I was in this world, let alone what drove me to be passionate, I was given this book in the library by a wonderful teacher and was immediately hooked. Not only did I realize my love to read (and be involved in what I was reading), this amazing love for books, but I realized my love of words. I had never known, to that point, that just mere words put together in sentences could bring about the same emotion as everyday life. I remember crying when Colin was abandoned! I remember running in to my mother and telling her all about it - sobbing! I knew then, at twelve, that I wanted to be a writer. I, too, wanted to really invoke in someone the love of books. Today I am an up and coming childrens book author, something I've worked hard for over the last twenty years and I attribute my realized and fulfilled dream to this book."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"AS a middle schooler, oddly enough, I was in love with Gilman's Polifax series. I loved all those stories about a senior citizen spy. I readTightrope WalkerandCaravanand loved those too. Caravan was my favorite book for a while, right up there withThe Outsiders. I was going through a phase where I liked books that made me cry.I had no idea that Ms. Gilman had written books for teens, and it didn't occur to me to find out if The Maze in the Heart of the Castle really existed until I reread The Tightrope Walker as an adult.The book was quite expensive, since it was out of print--more than I would generally spend. It took me several months to convince myself to buy it, and during that time I built it up big time in my head.It wasn't quite as good as I expected. For me, it wasn't life changing the way it was for Amelia, but I'm glad I bought it. It's a good story, an allegory really. It reminds me a bit ofThe Phantom Tollbooth.If you like fantasy, you might want to check out my book, [...]"},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"This is a very good book by Gilman. It ties in to \\"The Tightrope Walker\\" which was actually written first. This one should, however, be read first. I highly recommend both books for people who like to suspend disbelief when reading. Entertaining reading."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"This book should be required reading in the schools. The events that take place and the characters Colin meets are all symbolic of the trials and challenges we all face. One of the most powerful scenes in the book is when Colin has been captured and placed in an animal cage. People buy tickets to see him, taunting him and throwing food at him and, of course, he is miserable. Then one day he sees a bird soaring overhead and for a moment he IS the bird and feels free. He learns to overcome his circumstances through the power of his mind and thoughts. A happier scene shows him learning how to make rainbows. Like Colin, sometimes the \\"rainbows\\" we try to create are a little crooked in our first efforts, but if we keep trying we can bring about great color and joy into our lives."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"This is an intelligent, exciting, message-full adventure in the style of the Chronicles of Narnia, A Wrinkle in Time etc. and the like. The lessons are a bit heavily stated, from an adult perspective, but not syrupy. I got this book because I'm a great fan of Gillman's Tightrope Walker (in which this book is mentioned), Incident at Badamya, and Caravan--great adult thought-provokers."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"I purchased this book after I readTightrope Walkerin which it was a characters favorite book and played a prominent role.While it isn't a classic, it is a story of darkness into light, and a story of hope.From the first lesson, where you discover how you can be so trapped by your own troubles that you can't find your way out, to the ending, where confidence and hope are prevalent, it is a good journey for anyone who has struggled with depression.Just wish it could be reprinted so it would be available in a decent price."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"I liked this book a lot,but I think it &quot;repeated&quot; itself too much. What I mean is, Colin (The star in the story)finds a people in destress,is captured,and escapes,after possibly helping the people. Only the circumstances vary. However, it was wonderfully written and overall, intruiging. It is the perfect book for people with a hunger for action-fantasy books."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"When I first read the book, I thought it was &quot;a cool adventure story&quot; but not much more. Recently I took it out again, read through it, and discovered that it's possible to read this on an entirely new level, and that there is a lot that's only insinuated or hinted at. It's an easy read, of course, being a young adult book, but I think that someone of any age would get something out of it. I must have read it at least twenty times by now (no exaggeration) and it gets more interesting each time. Great book :)"},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"One of the other reviewers said that she gets something more out of this book each time she reads it. Like her, I've read this book over twenty times (at least), as I've been reading it every few months since I was about ten years old. When you first encounter The Maze, you read an adventure story, full of original action and intriguing characters, all of it taking place in a time and space somewhat similar too but significantly different from &quot;conventional&quot; Western fantasy. The book begs to be read over and over again, as the characters and situations that the hero, Colin, encounters reveal themselves to be something more than what they first appeared to be. In other words, the book is an allegory, where Colin's adventures and his quest actually represent a much deeper spiritual journey. The people that Colin meets, though somewhat fantastical to say the least, represent different kinds of people we all meet in the world around us, and the places he visits represent different feelings and states of being that we all possess. As Colin learns to recognize the different &quot;types&quot; around him and comes to understand how he fits in the among them and how he alone can complete the journey, the readers also learn to see themselves in Gilman's book. I invite anyone who is thinking about reading this book to get it (somehow) and to immerse themselves in the story and take the journey. Then to read it again. And again."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"Like other reviewers, I also read this book for the first time at the age of about ten or eleven, and since then have read it six or seven times. I'm not sure if it's the adventure story aspect of the book or the allegory that keeps me coming back to re-read it year after year. Now 26, I still find something new in the book every time I read it (significance of the color of the fruit?). I doubt that any book that I've read has stayed with me and given me as much insight as this simple children's book.Very, very highly recommended for all ages, especially pre-teens and teens. If the prices being asked here are too high, check public libraries in your area."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"I read this book after I had read The Tightrope Walker by Dorothy Gilman, as it was referenced in that book. Even though it is listed as a book for young adults it is quite fabulous. A book with a moral and it makes you think. I loved it!"},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"When I first read this at age sixteen it instantly became one of my favorite books of all time. Being young and dumb I didn't realize the incredible depth of the book and even thought the plot was poorly structured, yet I felt there were hidden meanings in it and it facinated me more than any other book I owned. As I age I find greater and deeper meaning in it any read it at least twice a year. I hope it goes back into print someday so other people can enjoy it :)"},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"I first read this book when I was ten years old. It was my introduction to the fastasy genre, as up until then, I'd read primarily The Babysitters Club and Sweet Valley High.At the time, I thought Colin was whiny and annoying, but I fell in love with the world he was in. When I read it again a year later as a pre-teen, I related to his heartbreak. Again a year after that, I saw how important it was to keep trying, even when everyone else has given up and try to discourage you so that you can join in their misery.Colin starts out as a self-centered whiny boy, learns to keep going when others say it's impossible, help those in need, when to fight back and when to run, how to love another, mend a broken heart, and keep sight of a goal. Each group of people that Colin runs into faces a different challenge emotionally... and he grows up as a result.I loved this book as a child, teen, adult, and now as a parent who recently introduced it to my own nine year old. He loved it for the same reasons I did and insisted that we buy a copy for his school library.\\"Everybody should read this one Mom, not just the kids who are already readers.\\""},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"After reading this, I had my son read it, and my friend's daughter read it. I think all teenagers should read this book."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"It's all here, all the stages of grief. The anger, the denial, the deal making, the acceptance -- all play out in an allegory built around a young man's adventure of self discovery. I read this book to my children, I have given this book as a gift when someone faces a horrible loss, and my children have since begun reading it to their children. I wholeheartedly endorse the book and pairing it with The Tightrope Walker just enhances the fun of cross discovery. I have not checked the publication dates for the books but I am sure The Tightrope Walker was written before this book and that's why, as one reviewer pointed out, there are scenes detailed in one book that don't show up in the other. I've read everything Ms. Gilman has ever written and this, hands down, is my favorite."},{"Title":"The Maze in the Heart of the Castle","review":"This book is a wonderful way to start in the world of reading.

Also what about the supposed sequel, In the Land of the Golden Warriors? Is it really coming? I hope so, because I think Colin's adventures in The Maze were just the beginning!"},{"Title":"Texas Bound: Book III: 22 Texas Stories (Southwest Life and Letters)","review":"I've always known Southern writing to have its own flavor, its own texture, its own flow. Like the speech that labels a southern with the dropped 'g' so does Southern writing take on a tone that is distinctive and different. Despite my background in literature, however, until now I've neglected Texan writing, with its infinite differences that strike at the common elements of the human spirit. Indeed, I've now learned that Southern writing, Texas style, is a genre all its own. With the fluid grace of a hot summer day and iced tea, TEXAS BOUND: BOOK III reveals the people and the land make Texas writing its own sub-genre.From cowboys to common experience, these authors capture disdain for social fripperies and Wal-Mart sex appeal. Ordinary experiences take on freshness with distinctive language that becomes trademark for Texas style, as does the capturing of flow of conversation, and the flavors of pepper and pickled okra. Ordinary struggles become extraordinary when facing pregnancy or death. Indeed, as William J. Cobb says as he captures the movement of time and tragedy, &quot;things get boring without trouble.&quot; And trouble comes extra large in Texas.TEXAS BOUND moves with the perfection and grace of masterful storytelling. The words on the page hold the rhythm and cadence of speech, lending each story a sense of immediacy and importance. The simplest elements of life take on richer meaning through the act of observance and recounting. While the stories move from passionate to poignant, from humorous to tragic, each will capture the heart and imagination. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Texas Bound: Book III: 22 Texas Stories (Southwest Life and Letters)","review":"Kay Cattarulla edits Texas Bound Book 3, which provides a further meaningful set of stories about people who come to terms with love, race, myths and time in towns across Texas.

But then again, given her creativity and her exceedingly inventive mind, anything is possible with Sandra Heath. For a while in the mid-90s, she ventured a bit away from the traditional Regency and into the paranormal and the sensual, and sometimes a combination of the two.HALLOWEEN MAGIC may well be the best of her books of this type. Drawing on a wide variety of folk-lore and other research, this entertaining look at a mad, bad witch would have been difficult, if not impossible, for a non-British native.Meg Ashton, accused of being a witch, was burned at the stake in 1618. Two hundred years later, she comes back to the area she had earlier inhabited, and sets out to wreak revenge on the descendants of those who were instrumental in her demise. Successful in her vendetta against the Villiers family, Meg next turns her attention towards Nicholas, ninth Lord Montacute.Goodness will always win out against evil, and the goodness here is personified by Verity Windsor, orphaned niece of the village magistrate. Inadvertently, Verity manages to intrude on nearly every spell being cast by the witch against the hapless Nicholas. Consequently, the innocent Verity finds herself irresistibly drawn to Nicholas, just as he is to her.HALLOWEEN MAGIC is a truly perfect--and VERY sensual Halloween treat. Whether by trick or by treat, be sure not to miss this one."},{"Title":"Halloween Magic (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Sandra Heath so impressed me with her novel Lavender Blue, A Regency Gothic strong on pagan lore, that I rushed out and bought her backlist. And again, I am impressed. Halloween Magic is another strong tale of dark magick and things that go bump in the night. Once again, the lore surrounding May Day and Halloween are presented in a non-hysterical fashion, steep in lore and myths surrounding these pagan festivals.On Halloween, there was a terrible thunderstorm that plagued the small hamlet of Wychavon. The remote Shropshire valley had to forgo their usual All Hallows Eve celebration, as the country folk, hid in their homes as they shook from the thunder. In strike of lightning, The Elderly Admiral Villiers is shocked to look out his front window and see a beautiful woman suddenly appear from nowhere. She was gorgeous and very naked. He had the servants bring her into his home, and word quickly spreads through the village that she's a victim of amnesia and cannot recall who she is or where she came from. He calls her Judith after his mother, and gossip runs rampant, as a short time later, the village learns he is to marry the woman 1/3 his age. The shock is fed fuel, when scarcely two months later, the man is found drowned under very mysterious circumstances. Since he had no heir, Judith inherits his estate. Only Judith, knew precisely who she is - or rather was. She was Meg Ashton, a powerful witch, burnt at the stake two hundred years ago. The clap of thunder freed her spirit where it had been slumbering in an ancient stone called The Lady. Now she is set on punishing the descendents of those responsible for her being burnt. First on that list was Admiral Villiers. Next is Nicholas Montacute, the lord of Wychavon.On Beltaine - May Day Eve - she goes to cast a spell to bring Nicholas back from London, so she can plot his death. Only she dropped the seal she had stolen from his house. She had charged it with bringing Nicholas back and making him fall for her charms. Only when she dropped it, the seal ends up in Verity Windsor hands. Verity has slipped out to wash her face in the dew on Beltaine, and found the seal. By her possessing the seal, Judith's spell works - but instead of Judith being the object of Nicholas' affection - he returns and is suddenly obsessed with Verity.Verity has long worship Nicholas from afar, but felt it was a hopeless love. But suddenly, the handsome Nicholas declare himself taken with her. Only, true love shall not run smooth in this case, as Judith is furious that Verity keeps thwarting her black magick.It's a charming Regency Romance, with a strong feel for the period and the lore. Give the writer extra points for knowing a turnip is a pumpkin, and a pumpkin is a neep. Also, for the flawless Mutli-Point of View writing that shines, painting her story with the full rich textures of letting you know all the characters."},{"Title":"Halloween Magic (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"From the back cover:Verity Windsor was startled beyond belief when the dazzlingly handsome, wealthy, and charming Lord Nicholas Montacute declared himself her smitten slave.

It never slips into academia, but is consistently written with the common man in mind. The author's excitement about theology comes through loud and clear, and takes you with him. And the explanations give you that \\"Aha!\\" moment of clarification that is so often lacking to Catholics. I would strongly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about the Catholic faith."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"Theology for Beginners is a book that should be in every catholic home. For those seeking a deeper understanding of their faith -- this book does not disappoint.This is a study book and must be slowly read. I am so blessed that I found this book and I am throughly enjoying the deeper understanding of my catholic faith."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"This is a book recommended by Dr Scott Hahn a convert to catholicism and someone I consider as a modern day St Paul. This a good primer for the formation of a catholic mind. Theology for Beginners provides an excellent and well written framework for understanding the catholic faith. It is said that the measure of understanding of any subject is how well it is expressed. Frank Sheed knows is subject.It really is a must read for those of us who are seeking a deeper understanding of who we are."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"This book is great for anyone looking for information on Catholic theology. It is easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"I knew St. Thomas Aquinas had a sense of humor when he wrote in the prologue to his Summa Theologica that its purpose was to \\"tend to the instruction of beginners.\\"Frank Sheed's Theology for Beginners is a much more accessible introduction to theology. Sheed is lucid, witty, deep, easily readable, and comprehensive, and it's difficult to envision a better brief, popular introduction to theology."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"Sheed answers every question that you ever had about God in laymens terms.

This book has greatly helped me to understand my own self and my relationship to God and His Church."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"This book is a MUST READ for every Catholic and for anyone curious about the Catholic Faith. Many times while reading Theology for Beginners I had to just stop and reflect on the beauty of what it was saying. The book has inspired me to share my faith more whole-heartedly with all my questioning Catholic friends and my Protestant friends as well. I can now answer questions that used to drive me crazy! READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"\\"Theology for Beginners\\" by F.J. Sheed accomplishes the task of condensing much complex theological thought and thus provides apractical overview of a multitude of religious subjects. F. J.Sheed's writing style makes for easy reading and comprehension.I recommend this volume for anyone interested in gaining a mentalfoothold on the myriad aspects of Catholic religious belief."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"This book is one of the best introductions to theology I have read. Most of us read the bible and never really understand fundamental concepts (e.g., the difference between soul and spirit, nature and person). I have had dialogue with many evangelicals and main-stream christians about certain concepts for which they have problems. However, these concepts can be explained once they have read this book. This is one of the few books that explains the Trinity in a way that utterly makes sense. Sheed writes clearly, and unlike many books on theology, he does not spend time with literarry forms and other intellectual and formal spects of theology. Instead Sheed concentrates on logical explainations of the central beliefs of christians. This is an excellent book for ALL christian to read. Sheed makes it clear that this is not a substitute for faithful reading of the bible, but insists it can enhance you understanding of scripture. His faith shines through on each page. Other excellent books are: 1. Theology and Sanity by Frank Sheed, an expanded version of this book. 2. Handbook of Christain Apologetics by Peter Kreeft."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"A great recap for lots of areas. Worth buying for the trinity discussion alone. Very useful and clear. You will find yourself referring to the material in the book to explain things to your friends. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"I'm sorry to say it, but I suspect an awful lot of people have zero interest in reading Catholic theology, and I don't mean because they think it will be written over their heads. However, anyone who does have such an interest should not only seriously consider buying this book, but also any other book by Frank Sheed as well. This man understood his subject to perfection, and to say he had a knack for explaining it clearly to any audience does not do justice to an author who learned and honed his apologetics skills from years of successfully meeting all comers from atop a soap box in London's Hyde Park. This short book, like his other short work, Map of Life, sticks to the point and is a sheer delight to read. His longer works are the same, but obviously demand a more sustained commitment. Pick any Frank Sheed book on Amazon, click on his name, then follow the link to Amazon's Frank Sheed page to look over his many books. I had an excellent Catholic education from kindergarten through university, from Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur to Jesuits, no less. I even had as a spritual advisor a quintessential Jesuit who was a priest and a geologist of such accomplishment that he spent the Geophysical Year(1957-58)at Antarctica. I tell you this: I have truly never seen Catholic theology explained with a clarity comparable to that of Frank Sheed. Read and reread him with great profit and great pleasure."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"This is an excellent overview of the Catholic faith. It gives the reader general knowledge of almost all aspects of Catholicism. Of course, being only 190 pages, it only talks about each subject very briefly, so should only be regarded as an introduction to the subject. I should probably also note that it's not an introduction to the general field of theology, as the title would suggest; it's only about Catholicism.This book answered many questions I had about why the Church believes what it does, or why we do certain things at mass. It often did this by presenting Bible verses as evidence, which really helped to back up the claims that Sheed made because otherwise some of them would seem quite absurd.I read this book with a friend and after each chapter we discussed what we had read. I highly recommend reading this book this way because many of the subjects are based on faith and scripture, rather than science and reasoning (as is often the case in apologetics books), so there is much that can be discussed and debated.The target audience for this book is firm believers of the Catholic faith. Anyone who is still unsure of what religion they are, or even what type of Christianity they believe in, should NOT read this book. This is because the book presents some concepts that would seem completely absurd to a non-Catholic (or even to some Catholics), and it presents many concepts that need to be taken \\"by faith\\", something that doesn't really work with a non-religious reader. Also, it presumes some prior knowledge of Catholicism, such as from an upbringing in the Church or by reading a few apologetics books.I would highly recommend this book to all Catholics. It will give you a new perspective on your faith and give it more meaning. It will also help you defend your beliefs."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"This should be required reading for anyone who wants to grow in their faith. If you want to understand yourself and your meaning and purpose in life then read this book. Frank Sheed explains theology in an easy and understanding way."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"I started reading this book several years ago so when I was looking for one to use in my home study group I decided on this one. It has no study guide so for each session someone would write out a set of questions for disscusion after we all read the assigned chapter(s). In my opinion, this is a \\"need to read book\\" that every Roman Catholic should read individually and use to teach children the faith. This book is deep but the author seeks to give much needed information that is not gained from homilies or CCD classes. This book will help a person grow immensely in the knowledge of God, the Trinity, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and so many other topics.I bought the last book to put in our lending library at our Church. It is a must along with the Catechism of the Catholic Church."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"Without a doubt, this has been the most thought provoking book on religion I have ever read. It has given me a much deeper understanding of the mysteries surrounding my faith.

He lays out all the basic theological beliefs that Catholics hold dear in a simple, easy to understand way."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"I wish every catholic would read this book. I think that not only would they understand their faith better, they would be able to explain it better AND be more motivated to live it. Simple, simple, simple little short read with HUGE substance.

It had answers to everything you would have a question about!"},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"Frank Sheed's book is the best introductory book I have found as a secondary reference for Catholic teaching. Although it is a relatively short book (which is appealing for people who cannot devote adequate time for a full treatise), it provides excellent depth and is fairly comprehensive. His writing style is straightforward (a significant advantage) but makes the reader ponder almost every sentence because of how much meaning he provides in a sentence, not unlike the experience I had when reading the Roman historian Tacitus."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"I loved this book from start to finish!!!!

Sheed. I felt my spirit tingling with joy as I read this book, and found it as much a page-turner as ANY book, fiction or otherwise, I have ever read.Mr. Sheed is one of those rare men who has an immense knowledge, yet can explain it in a way that makes it not only a pleasure to read but understandable as well. He brings to light the three most important concepts in life and theology: spirit, infinite and eternal. When reading Mr. Sheeds explanations of these concepts your view of life will likely be irrevocably changed.If you want to know God, if you think you already know God, if you want to love God, if you already profess to love God, PLEASE read this book. Whatever God-laden yeast you bring to this book it will rise 100 fold into a baker's loaf!Even if you doubt God exists, or think His existence can't be arrived at logically or by reason, read this book because you have a surprise waiting for you.Forgive my exhuberance but I LOVE THIS BOOK - you will to. :)P.S.

Even if you only plan to read one or two books on your faith, I think this should definitely be one of them."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"Theology for Beginners is the link between the Scriptures and the Cathechism of the Catholic Church. F J Sheed takes his time and explains theology in the layman's language. He constantly references Scripture (he asks the reader to stop and go to the scripture before continuing). He warns the reader of a difficult concept ahead of time so that the reader is prepared and not overwhelmed. Sheed says it best, &quot;The theology which the theologians knows does not nourish the laity until they, too, learn it&quot;. Sheed is brilliant."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"If you are sincere in wanting to learn the truth about the teachings of the Catholic Church, this book is one of the best in giving you the truth in a very easy to understand manner.

I highly recommend it to anyone who is willing to go deeper in understanding the teachings of the Catholic Church, and this is only the beginning."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"Frank Sheed has a knack for explaining difficult subjects; his use of analogies helps tremendously. Even for a new Catholic convert like me, Frank Sheed's writings: &quot;Theology and Sanity&quot;, &quot;To Know Christ Jesus&quot; along with &quot;Theology for Beginners&quot; have been great sources of enlightenment and brought me closer to knowing God and loving my new Catholic Faith."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"I am a Diaconate candidate and theology student.

I found this book enlightening, and very satisfyingly logical in the arguments and examples provided in the text. Frank Sheeds writing style turns what could be an intimidating topic, into an easily readable test with an attractive style. I have recommended this book to many people who have also found its contents very satisfying. This is one of those books that sits in the section on my bookshelf for only the most treasure books. It is a really good introduction to understanding what Theology is and also for laying a foundation for future exploration or study of this subject. Read it. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"Frank Sheed presents very readable explanations of Catholic theology.

From a new yet common ground we have basic stuff to think about and REALLY apply to ones faith with conviction."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"I was hoping for a book that would describe Christianity from a very objective view and this was not the case. Theology is for people looking to enter the Christian faith or people who have read the bible and would like to take their faith a few steps further. I rated 4 stars because it was nicely written and easy to understand. If your too lazy to read the bible this book will only be halfway useful."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"This book is OK as an introduction to the Cathechism of Catholcism, but not as an introduction to theology. I would be interested in an Introduction to Theology from a Catholic perspective, mind you, but this is not that either. I want to say the author treats you as being stupid, but that wouldn't bother me either - I like Cathocism for Dummies. This thing that bothered me most, was after reading pages and pages of lead up for each subject, and being referred back to reread of other sections, right when you think he's amout to say something, he says something like, great theologians have spent a lot of time thinking about this, and suffice it to say, the conclusions is ... . I can read the Cathechism for that, and skip the preamble.If what you really want is a summary introduction to the Cathechism with a mild Theological slant, then go ahead and get the book - you'll love it."},{"Title":"Theology for beginners","review":"Difficult to read.

Like Knuth, Storer thoughtfully supplies an extensive list of questions at the end of each chapter that will greatly deepen your appreciation of the field if you tackle them. Ok, he doesn't give answers, but think of that as greater incentive on your part to solve them. There are almost 400 questions in the book.The teaching style is similar to Knuth, in that it has all the rigour needed by an algorithm designer like yourself, without drowning you in epsilon-delta ultra rigour like a pure maths text.Note that the only code fragments are in pseudocode. This should not be a problem for you. I am assuming you are experienced enough that what you need is understanding of an algorithm, and that manually converting it to code is straightforward and a purely secondary issue.The take home message is that this is excellent for anyone doing serious programming."},{"Title":"An Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (Progress in Theoretical Computer Science)","review":"I selected this book as the textbook for my course of data structure, and this book has given me a lot of troubles. Firstly, the pseudo code give by the book is sometimes wrong and the descriptions about the data structures are inconsistent. For example, if you have this book, turn to the page containing the merge sort pseudo code and give it a try. As another example, go to the tree section and have a detailed look at descriptions of the delete-min operations of a binary search tree, you will find the defects by yourself. Secondly, the language the author used are not reader-friendly, especially not beginner friendly. To some extent, it scared away my students.

I should have selected another book on data structure."},{"Title":"The Heart of Christmas (Harlequin Superromance No. 817)","review":"This is a story about a romance between Nick and Abby and a lot more.

The book is so much better than the movie. The characters were so interesting and you can't help but feel for htem. Even the most heartless character will have your sympathy.Ms. LaPlante did not leave anything lacking in this mafia story. The focus on the women of the family was very refreshing. She did not leave you hanging at the end, as some authors love to do.If you do nothing else, I advise you to read this book.

Also it focused on women and thier struggles to live happily amongst the mob. I have always liked the workings o fthe mafoa ans i thought this book realle captured the meaning o f the mob while including the gangsters family problems. But the best thing was the calibur of the family problems and the immense amount of dramatic irony. Roberto Luciano's near obbsessive adoration of his beautiful eldest son led him and his family to his downfall. Paul Corolla's jealosy and stupidity caused so much heartache for the Lucianos. And Luka, the tragic figure, the hauntingly beautiful illegetimate son of sophia &amp; Michael went thru so much. IT was powerful and the closing words were touching.&quot;the thorns of the rose are hidden by the bloom&quot; this is a book that will forever stay with u."},{"Title":"Bella Mafia","review":"Having read this book 13 times now I am still totally captivated by it. You will not find a better read than Bella Mafia - no matter what your tastes are. The story follows the Luciano Mob Family in Sicily and contains a rare mixture of Mafia life and it's effects and the power of the women, seemingly helpless after the murder of every male member of their precious family. Lynda La Plante has a way of writing which grips you and all her books are fantastic. I would also recommend her books Entwined, The Legacy and the Talisman.

Set in the psychedelic era, the authors are not scientists, in fact, the book begins with an impassioned defense of the merits of smoking pot. It's a quick breezy read that is long on reflection, short on detail, draws no solid conclusions, yet has some interesting pictures of the Bimini Wall as the divers investigate it. Yes, the authors were also followers of Edgar Cayce, and these days it's fashionable to dismiss the wall as simple &quot;beach rock&quot;, but the pictures do make you wonder. The wall is so long and many of the blocks the same size that it does look as if they were cut to form either a road or harbor. Not the best book on Atlantis, but an interesting read that may or may not become more important historically later. It's also a nice flashback to the 60's."},{"Title":"The 8 Seasons of Parenthood: How the Stages of Parenting Constantly Reshape Our Adult Identities","review":"We received this book after our first child was born.

It's like they took the words out of my mouth. As each new stage of parenting was approaching I would pick this book up to become better prepared. I found parenting was very emotionally challenging at times and this book validated how I felt. It just helped me cope a little bit better with all I was worried about.It's easy to just pick up and read the section you need to and wait until the next stage approaches to read the next chapter. I still have a couple of chapters ahead, although I took a sneak peak. I love the concept I read recently that once you're a parent you live your life over and over. In a way, you re-live your own childhood, then your children have children and you re-live it again...You never finish being a parent."},{"Title":"The 8 Seasons of Parenthood: How the Stages of Parenting Constantly Reshape Our Adult Identities","review":"I really loved this book. Rather than being a book that only focusses on small things such as \\"back-talking\\" or teaching children responsibility (great reading as well!) it teaches parents to see parenthood as a life long journey. The authors encourage the reader to enjoy parenthood as a ride through which there are dips, curves, and plateau's. Overall it puts parents in touch with those anxious feelings which are hard to get into words. Most of them come from the parents own insecurities or regreats from their childhoods. I thought the book was fabulous and I intend to always refer to it no matter what season I'm in. Overall, the biggest message I recieved was to always enjot the season you were in while appreciating your child no matter what stage they are going through as our true duty as a parent is to help our children become self-sufficient adults."},{"Title":"The 8 Seasons of Parenthood: How the Stages of Parenting Constantly Reshape Our Adult Identities","review":"this is really a wonderful book - giving readers outlines of the different stages of parenthood.

The particular chapter from which that quote was taken dealt with thought forms and their illusory power.

While this book is not on par with Eye of the Needle, or Pillars of the Earth it is a very enjoyable read. It has all the elements a good Follett book has which is a romance, some thrilling moments and characters you can't help but to feel for, root for and keep reading to see what happens. I definitely recommend this if you like any of Ken Follett's other books and if you like World War II espionage novels."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"This novel is fast paced and intriguing.

This was in a different theater than the other book but the plot was riveting and the characters were interesting and believable. The novel had a couple of strange, almost misplaced chapters towards the end but the overall novel was really good."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Ken Follett's \\"The Key To Rebecca\\" is a thriller told in parallel thread following the duplicitous, clandestine, and nefarious activities German-Arab spy Wolff, and his gallant Dorset-English pursuer Vandeman in early 1940's Egypt, as Erwin \\"The Desert Fox\\" Rommell's campaign to take Cairo unfolds.Follett's historical setting serves as an excellent background, and the on-the-ground details of like in war-time Egypt provide welcome exotic atmosphere. While Follett's style is too lean to neither taste the dust nor feel the heat and sweat, it is enough to provide suspension of disbelief.The principal characters are fairly well drawn for a lean thriller. Wolff is of course a borderline personality disorder/sociopath, which of course does not really fully explain the lengths he goes to to help Arab and German causes. His unique background of being a full-blooded-German whose widowed mother marries a wealthy settled Alexandrian Bedouin-Arab provides his ability to blend in both three worlds: Arab-Egyptian Cairo, European occupied and populated Egypt, and the nomadic Bedouins. He is sexually if not amorously involved with Cairo's most famous belly dancer, and shares her degenerate kinks and lusts and gluttony for expensive pleasures.British Intelligence army officer Vandeman is widowed, with a precocious eight year-old boy, which sets him up for plausible romantic entanglement with curvaceous and courageous Egyptian Jew concubine Elene, who has her own interior problems reconciling herself with her circumstances, estrangement from her pious Orthodox family, and her interest in this cold Englishman who wishes her to use her wiles to penetrate Wolff's world and capture his apparatus and code for communicating to Rommell.There are a few stock comic characters for occasional relief, the perfidious boss, the buffoonish petty officer, clever and disgusting Arab crooks, and the chase scenes are a little over orchestrated, as if they were pre-directed for the cinema, but otherwise the tale unfolds in the page-turner pace of thrillers everywhere. While this novel says nothing deeper than \\"Nazis bad, English good\\" this is a solid B+ of a thriller on technical merit and being an exemplar of the genre."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"The book was captivating from the begining. While parts of the story bend history (it is fiction), the events are believeable and the reader can relate to the characters. If you liked Pillars of the Earth and expect this book to be similiar, you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"This is excellent work by Follett. Besides the sensuality, deceit and action the setting in Egypt is very interesting.

You will not be sorry if you purchase it."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Having been consumed with the masterful writing in Follett's Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, I've started revisiting all his novels. Although written over 25 years ago about a war that took place over 65 years ago, Follett's insightful characterisations hold up remarkably well. The master storyteller pulls you in and weaves a web of intrigue that will keep you involved until the final pages. Great read."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Every Ken Follett novel I have read so far has been outstanding. The Key to Rebecca is no exception. This book centers around a spy in the 1940's in Cairo named Alex Wolff. Through most of the book, all of the characters are very likeable. But keep reading, and the story takes a drastic turn. The book is fast paced. It is full of mystery, suspense, and romance. The book keeps you guessing until the end. Personally, I think this book is even better than The Eye of the Needle."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Germany has managed to sneak a spy into Cairo during the desparate struggle between the British and Rommel's Afrika Corps. Alex Wolff, the spy, is ruthless and determined to help the Germans capture Egypt. Using contacts from his depraved life in Cairo, he sets out to steal secrets from an unwitting British officer, providing Rommel with all the tools he needs to defeat the British.Standing in his way is Major Vandam, a British Intelligence Officer, widower and father, and Elena, a beautiful young Jew he recruits to try and capture the spy. The trap is set, but their plans are complicated by the conflicting alegiences of the Egyption officials, and Elena finds herself trapped by Wolff and his depraved partner, and must somehow both survive and help Vandam stop the spy and provide the key to stopping Rommel.Set against the chaos of wartime Cairo, the suspense builds as Wolff and Vandam dance around each other, each trying to gain an advantage. The story moves at a brisk pace, and full of interesting twists. However, there is a fair bit of moderately graphic, mature content, so this book might not be appropriate for less mature readers (parental guidance is strongly suggested)."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"I enjoy reading Ken Follett and this is another good, fast read.

Keeps up the interest all the way through to conclusion."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Although I can not agree that this book is better that the already legendary \\"Eye of the needle\\", I must admit that in his second book Ken Follett managed to do as well as in his first. This story takes place in Egypt during WWII and has for hero Alex Wolff, a German spy infiltrated in Cairo in 1942 by a daring raid through Sahara (this is partly inspired by real events - there was such an operation). Fluent in Arabic as well as in English, helped by local Arab sympatizers, Wolff proves to be a particularly dangerous man - information he transmits to Rommel headquarters helps Germans winning a couple of desert battles. Finally, British counter intelligence realises that there must be an undetected spy network somewhere in Cairo or Alexandria and the laborious investigation begins... This book is quite realistic and keeps good suspense until very end. I enjoyed reading it and recommend it warmly. It was also well adapted to cinema, in 1985, with David Soul playing Alex Wolff."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"I have never read anything by Ken Follett and I did enjoy this book.

Mr Follett has that stunning ability to show you the landscape and create the very feel of the air together with the aromas present - so engaging on all these levels. The only problem with this marvellous book is that it came to an end!!"},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"\\"The Key to Rebecca\\" is one of Ken Follett's best novels. Set in World War II in British-occupied Egypt, it is the story of a masterful German spy who is pitted against a skilled British counter-intelligence agent. The stakes could not be higher -- the Nazi agent is on the verge of producing intelligence for the benefit of General Erwin Rommel that will make it possible for the Germans to overrun the British armies in North Africa and capture Egypt. Interwoven into this fascinating story is a tale of rivalry and conflict within the British Army, romance, and much else. This story moves at a fast-pace, features excellent characterizations, and in fact features some of Follett's best writing. I rate this one as one of Follett's best novels, and I have read them all.This novel is not to be missed. Recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"For the first 250 pages, I thought that Follet had matched his earlier spy masterpiece, \\"Eye of the Needle.\\" The tale was well crafted, the atmosphere of wartime Cairo was well described and the strained relations between the Arabs and the occupying British were explored in reasonable depth.Unfortunately, the final hundred pages were a let down. It was almost as if Follet asked a junior writer to come in and mop up. The pace became hurried, and the dialogue became stilted. Even John Grisham closes his novels better than this.Despite the sloppy close, however, this was still a very enjoyable novel."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"There are not many fiction books that discribe this particular set of battle in the second World War, so besides the fun of reading a Follett book, you also learn something about the war in Africa. Follett has done a good job in picturing the struggle between a british army captain and a ruthless Nazi-spy, called &quot;the Sphinx&quot; in the streets of Cairo and through the desertic egyptian country. Also, the sensuality is a constant and present part of the plot, involving a beautiful young jewish girl working to defeat her tough past and to guarantee a safe future for her and her people. Second best of Follett, only behind &quot;Pillars of the earth&quot;."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Don't get me wrong, Key to Rebecca is a very good Follet novel. However, I read it on the Kindle digital format and found the conversion from print to digital to be very poor. Some words were blended together, such as an \\"r\\" and \\"n\\" forming an \\"m\\" and other words were repeated. While I could generally figure out meaning through context clues, it was distracting at best. If Amazon is going to market the Kindle as being superior to print, or at least as good, it needs to work out some of the kinks on the digital conversions.Back to \\"Key to Rebecca\\"- very good suspense book. Other Follet recommendations would be \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", \\"Word Without End\\" and \\"Eye of the Needle\\"."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Having read and LOVED \\"Eye of the Needle\\", I was all too ready to embrace another one of Follet's acclaimed spy thrillers. Unfortunately, \\"Key to Rebecca\\" reads like a cheap romance novel. True, the espionage details are very-well crafted, and the chase scenes are nail-biting. But at the heart of the novel is a love story so soppy that it drivels through your fingers; not to mention that it's a yawning rip-off of Hitchcock's \\"Notorious\\". When unforgivable dialogue like that is tossed around it ruins the whole experience. Not to mention that the two most awaited sensual scenes are delivered in a hokey dialogue sequence and an anti-climax. (Re)read \\"Eye of the Needle\\" to see how it's really done."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"I first read The Key to Rebecca more than a quarter of a century ago, read it, thought about it after reading German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel exploits inDisciples of Fortune, got it; and behold, it captivated me like the first time. That is what truly great novels do. There is always something new to find in them each time you pick the book up and read it again. Centered on the fascinating character of the German spy codenamed \\"Sphinx\\", who Rommel slips into Cairo, so that he could send back classified information needed for his final push to conquer what was left of North Africa (Egypt)not under Nazi control, Follet through this fascinating and well-developed character and other remarkable characters who got drawn into his world, tells the story of the last phase of Nazi Germany's North African campaign in a manner that sets him apart from other writers.This complex plot in the hands of Follet the master storyteller, comes out as a smooth flowing, fast-paced, colorfully-set and character-rich story. The descriptions are masterly done, and narrative and dialogue are used effectively to make this story one of the best classic spy stories out there."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"This was a great spy novel, although not on par with The Eye of the Needle. I have a couple of major criticisms for this novel. 1) The hot-n-heavy sex scenes. I know that this is a major way in which Follett departs from peers like Tom Clancy and Jack Higgins, and therefore is a reason for Follett's specific (yet expansive) readership. Not that I find the description of sex offensive; I think the stories would be better off if those things were left to the imagination.2) The 'cat &amp; mouse' game at the end of the book between Wolff and Vandam. I won't give away any of the major plot developments, but there was several times in the last 50 pages or so when I found myself saying &quot;Just pull your gun and arrest 'im already!&quot;As you can see, however, I thought the book was good enough to merit 4 stars. It's an entertaining tale."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"I've reviewed Ken Follett once before, and gave him 1 star for a book I thought was truly horrendous. I hesitated to post that one until now, because I frankly don't like giving 1-stars. After my initial disappointment with Follett, his name eventually came up in conversation with my friends. Many of them said I should give Follett another chance, and read one of his thrillers. I was skeptical but decided to give him another go with Key to Rebecca. I am so glad I did!Interestingly, as hard as I was on Follett in my review of Pillars, I'm appalled at how unfair some reviewers are to him here. Some go have criticized the sex in the story! It's a spy thriller, people --- spy thrillers have sex in them. If anything, people have more sex in war zones, because Mother Nature makes us respond to the constant threat of death by strengthening our desire to reproduce. Throw in poverty, rationing, high unemployment for civilians, and the army of a rich country occupying the cities of a poor one: there'll be sex going on pretty much all the time.This story starts with a man in the Egyptian desert, struggling to survive a trip back to civilization. We don't know who he is: he might turn out to be the hero, the villain, or just some fellow who dies leaving a vital clue for hero and villain to discover. But I saw urgency right away, not only in his fight to live, but with foreshadowing that this man felt he has something incredibly important to do once he reaches his goal.The next phase of the story is a game of cat and mouse on the Egyptian streets. It reminded me of Casablanca, only grittier. It's not a slow, steady build of tension, at least in the beginning: it's a roller-coaster ride where pace changes from fast to slow and back again, all on a dime.The story unfolds at a stage in World War II where England has occupied Egypt. Some Egyptians think they might be better off free, or even occupied by the Germans --- and it's interesting to note that they look at World War II through a completely different lens than we Westerners are used to. Not surprisingly, they don't care so much about what's going on in Europe --- they want what's best for them, and many feel they're getting shafted.This is the first time I recognized that Follett was going to avoid the mistakes he made in Pillars. He doesn't preach! He may have personal opinions about the morality of how the major players in World War II interacted in North Africa, but he doesn't shove them down our throats. Erwin Rommel briefly appears in the story, not as a person to be admired or hated, but as a man trying to do a job.The heroine in the story proves to be more complex, and interesting, than she first appears. For the last several years, she's used her beauty to get what she wants, and is disillusioned by it. When she starts interacting with the hero and villain, she believes at first this might offer her a chance to change the way she makes her way in the world. But the \\"villain\\" seems to want her only for sex, but the \\"hero\\" seems to want her only to use her sexuality against the villain: in this light, just how heroic is the \\"hero\\", anyway? The line between the hero and the villain starts to blur here, in the exact way I've always loved in spy thrillers, as both men expose her to steadily increasing danger. (I found her attraction to both men, particularly the hero, quite unlikely --- but given her ennui, and how danger can be an aphrodisiac, I think Follett stil lmade it work.)One on level, the conflict in Key to Rebecca goes beyond these two men, and even beyond the British Empire and Nazi Germany --- it's also between two principles of morality in wartime: a) that governments owe loyalty to those who risk their lives in wartime on their behalf, and b) that governments are not subject to morality, only expediency.I would have been satisfied with victory for the \\"hero\\" or the \\"villain\\". I was more worried about what kind of outcome awaited the heroine (and other people on the conflict's periphery). I wasn't exactly thrilled with the ending, but this was the kind of book where I didn't think that mattered --- it wasn't about the destination, it was about the ride. The writing was tight, and the writer never lost control of the all-important pace."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Having consumed Giants Fall and Dangerous Fortune I went back to some older Follet books expecting good reads, I had a copy of a book called The Third Twin and now have finished the Key to Rebecca. Great idea, colourful and interesting setting he brings Cairo to life with the gravity of saving Egypt from the wily Rommel. It had potential to be something very good however the lead character and everything about his fumbling ventures to catch the great spy of Cairo were frustrating enough to make you scream aloud. I cant believe that an Intelligence operative in 1942 could be so incompetent even as part of the decaying British Army. Vandame a self made officer is the most clumsy, stupid character I have read in \\"serious\\" fiction, is he meant to reflect the pompous class affected Britain we think of from the Gallipoli campaign of the First World War?This central character and his plot flaws spoiled the book for me, I found myself unable to \\"buy into\\" the concept and therefore he failed me as an author as I was a willing reader ready to commit. I enjoyed his peripheral characters greatly and the super spy could have been something really special, I think he wanted to make this guy the hero of the story and then found himself having to put the British spin onto it for understandable pragmatic reasons. The ending lacked detail and was concocted poorly as if to wind it up, it could have used some more \\"interesting\\" details about how the Rebecca Key ended up being used exactly rather than a sun set shot and a passionate kiss. I like the fact the Follet writes genuine sex into his stores it is a big part of most peoples lives and it certainly is a factor in decisions made at all levels of society and government, it shapes history. I am sorry Rebecca disappointed me I really enjoyed the first half until the Keystone Cop went into action, hey maybe it is representative of British WW2 army intelligence and thats why the war went on for so long if so then I must apologise."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"My title was less about offending purists and more about catching the eye with a little joke: plus it's technically all true. The fact is The Key To Rebecca is one heckuva thrilling jaunt. Set in occupied Egypt during the early part of World War Two and telling the fictionalized background story of how Rommel's best spy infiltrated Cairo and got his hands on invaluable military information the British were trying desperately to conceal, Ken Follett's second published novel has something for everyone: including, may I add, fans of strategically shaved belly dancers. By using as his code book something as innocuous as Rebecca, Daphne du Maurier best-selling novel of Cornwall, a maverick German spy sends theoretically unbreakable messages back to his comrades on the front lines, giving the Afrika Korps a seemingly inexplicable advantage over its beleaguered foes. Opposing this ruthless spy is a British officer tormented by his own personal demons, someone far less interesting than the spy he hunts, but more sympathetically comprehensible in his fallibility. Unlike most novels of this genre The Key To Rebecca, while energetic and quick moving, offers few cliffhangers or plot twists and instead relies on being driven by some of the most memorably sketched characters in fiction who stalk one another in a time and place that holds the balance of the world itself."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"If you have read Follett's \\"Eye of the Needle,\\" you might call this story \\"Son of Eye of the Needle.\\" Both stories have a German spy in English territory (in this case, British Egypt) and a dogged pursuer who finally gets the spy. But that does not make this book any less thrilling. First, the story parallels actual events in Egypt during Field Marshall Rommel's North African campaign in World War Two. Second, Follet does a magnificent job of making his characters real, with fears, dreams, disappointments, and personal baggage. Add to this the fact that the German spy, Alex Wolff, has information that will insure that Rommel will defeat the British Army and conquer Egypt, and you have a breathless thriller of the sort that Ken Follett does so well. The story has thrills, tender romance, kinky sex (not connected to the tender romance), and a slam-bang climax. If you like thrillers, it is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"A classic WWII espionage story told in true Follett fashion. He creates a vivid image of the war raging across the desert towards Cairo and the daily struggle for survival and ultimate victory. But then he takes the story a step further and takes you into the minds of the main characters, from the good guys and what makes them good despite their personal issues to the pure evil of the bad guy. And, when you think you have it all figured out he turns everything upside down and you won't want the story to end."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"It was a waste of time.

However, the plot and the story is not unique and has been written to death by other authors. Other books by Mr Follet are much better."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Not what I expected from Ken Follett. Too little \\"action\\", very little personality and his usual character development. I expect to be drawn in to the story, and had to struggle to keep reading. Probably won't finish the book."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"The Key to Rebecca is Follett's third novel after he hit it big with the Eye of the Needle, and I enjoyed it a lot even though it lost steam towards the end. Follett is one of my favorite authors because of the way he can bring historical periods to life with entertaining and vibrant characters. Often, the same type of character exists in each book but because Follett is so good, his style works.The Key to Rebecca is set in WWII in Egypt, where Rommell is about to conquer the country for the Germans because of the help of Alex Wolff, a German spy. Wolfe's nemesis is William Vandam, a British officer charged with detecting and stopping all covert spies. Follett introduces the decident Sonja, a famous Egyptian belly dancer who has a history with Wolff and ends up helping him. On Vandam's side is Elena, a beautiful you girl who wants to immigrate to Israel and needs help. She agrees to help Vandam catch Wolff in hopes of Vandam making it easier for her to travel to Israel.Follett takes the ultimate question of who will win the war in Egypt and boils it down to the story of these four people. Therefore, as he writes about their lives and passions, we know there is much more at stake. Follett sets up a conflict that boils down to sexual in nature, which makes the ending sort of a let down. The ending is a standard chase scene that vears away from the conflict established in the middle part of the book. Without giving it all away, Sonja is a sexual being who can be controlled if her sexual preferences are catered to. Wolff is Sonja's lover but will betray her at anytime to get his way. Elena has gone from man to man and now Vandam wants her to seduce Wolff and she is angered at Vandam's attitude toward her because she has fallen for him.This conflict between the characters is the strength of the novel and unfortunately it gets resolved with about 50 pages to go. Still, I've read 3/4 of Follett's novels, and this one too is a must read."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"In this story an English Intelligence Officer tracks down a german spy in Cairo during WWII.The story is well-written and engaging with a lot of good description regarding military procedures and intelligence practices. The characters are well developed for this type of novel and the story moves fast.The only thing I didn't like (warning - ** spoilers **) was that at the end the confrontation between the Brittish officer and the spy was somewhat anticlimatic.But all in all it was a good spy story and a quick read!"},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"We certainly can't fault Ken Follett for variety in writing -- his books span many timelines and topics. But in \\"Key\\", he returns to a seeming favorite combination found in several of his nearly twenty novels -- sex, war, and spies!! Set in early WWII in Egypt, the basic story line is about a German spy, Alex Wolf, who is half European and half Arabian, and therefore blends in easily in numerous settings in Cairo during the British occupation. His goal is to send Field Marshall Rommel, whose army is advancing on Egypt from the west, superior and accurate intelligence via radio transmission using a secret key from Du Maurier's novel \\"Rebecca\\" (hence the title!). He enlists the aid of a sexy belly dancer, whose sexual appetite is nothing short of voracious anyway, to entice an unwitting Brit, and steals secrets from his attach&eacute; case while the officer is \\"otherwise engaged\\". (Alex helps himself to her favors as well...) Meanwhile, British security officer Major Van Damme, is soon hot on Wolf's trail, having cleverly picked up on his activity by piecing together some events that look a little too coincidental, followed by the passing of counterfeit pound sterling notes. Van Damme eventually also enlists a female to woo Wolf, but soon regrets the danger into which he embroils her as he falls in love with her himself. Frantic desert chases and crosses and double crosses galore characterize this suspenseful yarn from start to finish.At first, we mentally stumbled over the foreign people and place names, but soon were at home with the lead characters. The villain was so clever we almost started rooting for him somewhere along the line, but were not disappointed with the ultimate outcome. While some content is definitely not for the prudish, we are sure Follett's faithful, as well as readers new to this author, will enjoy this adventurous tingling tale!"},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"A thrilling ride.

I've read a few other Ken Follett books (Pillars of the Earth, Fall of Giants, and On Wings of Eagles), and this one is most like an early version of Fall of Giants. I say this because it has fewer characters, is shorter, and has a reduced scope. It centers around World War 2 in Africa (Egypt) and has excellent espionage/action sequences. Very entertaining.

He introduces us to the characters and has a wonderful way of rounding them out by giving us an idea of why they think and feel how they think and feel.This novel is set in British occupied Egypt during the early days of world war II. We have the Nazi spy and the British officer who battle it out in a head game with a supporting cast who's allegiances to both are carved in history.It's great cloak and dagger stuff that puts the very outcome of the war in the hands of the two men Van Damme (Brit) and Wolff (Nazi). Van Damme always seems one step behind Wolff who, code named \\"Sphinx\\", is reporting directly to Rommel. The Afirka corps under Rommel is acting on Wolff's information as they move towards Egypt and ultimately liberation from the British.Standing between Rommel and victory is Major Van Damme the British intelligence officer who, despite little support from his superiors, is going after Wolff with spirit.

To say that I was disappointed with it would be an understatement. Its supposed to be a spy-hunt set during WW2, but the neither the tension nor the enormity of the situation is actually established. And in some places, the book is so childish that is sounds more like a Hardy Boys mystery.Examples: The spy is an extremely intelligent person who plans all his moves. Once he's made his move, the officer on his trail (Vandam) is Einstein reborn because he guesses the intent behind each of the spy's moves within the blink of an eye. Not just once or twice, but throughout the length of the book.Add to it the sleazy, over-the-top love stories (if one may call them that) which leave you disgusted. In some instances, Follett's obsession with sex comes out stronger than the plot itself.The book seems to go on, and at a point, you want it to end. And when the end does come, its absolutely pathetic. By that time, you neither feel malice towards the spy nor sympathy towards the the officer. What you do feel is a sense of relief that the book is over.I agree with the reader who called this book a bunch of crap. It is. And its hard to believe its been written by the same guy who wrote 'Eye of the Needle' and 'Pillars of the Earth'.

This novel has all the essential ingredients for an \\"unputdownable\\" read.The novel opens in 1942. World War II is raging, and German Field Marshall Erwin Rommel is having success after success with his Afrika Corps. The Nazis are planning to invade Cairo. The British are hunkering down, and doing everything possible to thwart the invasion. Rommel desperately needs access to British intelligence from their Headquarters in Cairo, in order to ensure his plan's outcome. So Rommel sends a master spy into British occupied Egypt. The spy, known only as the \\"Sphinx,\\" covertly enters the country, and with a few mishaps, makes his way to Cairo. He has with him a radio, a code to transmit the information secretly, based on Daphne Du Maurier's book \\"Rebecca,\\" and a piece of paper with the key to the code. Having spent much of his childhood in Cairo, the German-born spy, knows the city, language and many of its inhabitants well.The Sphinx's task is not as easily accomplished as he once imagined. A British officer, Major Van Damme, with whom he shared past adversarial encounters, is soon on to him - and after him. Enter a beautiful Egyptian Jewess, Elene, who Van Damme wants to use as bait to capture the Nazi spy. Sparks fly between Van Damme and Elene from their first meeting, making it difficult for him to send her into danger. The cast also includes a famous, erotic, and somewhat depraved, belly dancer.The main plot, although complex, is very realistic and reads smoothly. The various subplots are fascinating, and are often related to historical fact, such as the Egyptian Free Officers Movement's plot to subvert the British. This group of officers, headed by Gamal Abdul Nassar, and Anwar el-Sadat, plan to secretly side with the Germans, in order to rid Egypt of Britain's presence. They strategize to exchange their support - (thus Egypt's support), and throw in their cards with the Nazis, for postwar freedom for their country.Ken Follett is a master at creating lifelike characters. All of the book's characters have their own past history, baggage and inner conflicts - and their own dreams and plans for the future. There is not a one-dimensional figure in the novel, even with the minor characters.The novel moves at an incredible pace, ending in an unbelievable, and mortally dangerous chase through the desert. Hold on to your seats for this one. I highly recommend \\"The Key To Rebecca,\\" and would have given it 4 1/2 stars, but that option is not open to me. I do like Follets \\"Pillars Of The Earth\\" and \\"Eye Of The Needle,\\" more - which decided me on 4 stars. Still, this is a thoroughly enjoyable and well written book."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"I've read almost all of Ken Follett's books and would rate this as his second best, behind Pillars of the Earth, and right up there with Eye of the Needle. It has the usual stock elements found in any thriller: an admirable hero, a despicable villain, a vulnerable but brave young girl, but infuses them with real humanity and builds to a crackling and suspenseful climax. As in other Follett books, he makes the conflict many-layered: The hero (Major Van Damme) wants to apprehend the villain (Alex Wolf) not only because it can have an effect on the progress of the second World War in Egypt, but because they have a past together, and because the girl he is falling in love with has been used as &quot;bait&quot; for Wolf. Shades of Alfred Hitchcock's Notorious.What I like about Follett's best work is that it really delivers the suspense and resolves the story in an incredibly satisfying way. Like many spy novels, there are contrived situations, but he &quot;gets you to turn over the next page&quot; (Ian Fleming's goal as author of the James Bond books) so eagerly that you just want to see how it ends. His female characters are far from cardboard as well: both of them are fully realized. And, best of all, he makes everyone vulnerable; he knows that we can identify with characters that have strengths and weaknesses, instead of the usual cast of robots exchanging gunfire from speeding cars."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Ken Follett is a very good tale-spinner and The Key to Rebecca has a promising premise.The setting is 1942 Egypt--Cairo is threatened by Rommel's advancing army. German-born and Arab-raised, Alex Wolff is the perfect Nazi spy--calculating and ruthless. Almost perfect--Wolff has an eye for pretty girls. Wolff's partner is Sonja el-Aram, a sensuous belly-dancer with a depraved mind--perfect for Wolff. Major William Vandam, a straight-laced British Intelligence officer who has seen better days, is hot on Wolff's trail. To set the trap, he recruits Elene Fontana, a beautiful Jewish runaway with nothing to lose. Together Vandam and Elene must stop Wolff at any cost!The action is heart-pounding (typical Follett), the locations are beautifully described, and the key relationships are well-developed. My only two complaints are the brevity with which everything is resolved at the end and the overly graphic descriptions of some twisted sexual encounters. Please, leave some of that to the imagination next time!"},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"OK, so I bought it for the title. :)I've been reading for over twenty-five years, and only discovered Ken Follett within the past three months!His historical fiction is sharply detailed, but isn't overbearing or over my head. The characters in &quot;The Key to Rebecca&quot; are real enough that you love them, hate them, root for them, hope they get captured. They're clever -- perhaps more clever than the characters in &quot;real&quot; life upon whom they're based.Buy it for the fabulous storytelling. Enjoy the history lesson that's interesting even to someone who didn't enjoy history in school. Wish that a sequel had been written."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"The book is really good....The book's event are all in Egypt and i must tell u that as an i Egyptian I was astonished at how the author had a very good background of egypt... all it's streets and how the egyptians felt about the war..... never read such a good book which is well studied, not even by egypian authors.....WELL DONE FOLLETT!!!!"},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Ken Follett's The Key to Rebecca is a classic WWII thriller pitting the Nazi super-spy Alexander Wolff against a renegade forlorn Englishman Vandamm. It is set in the early days of the war in colonial Egypt. Follett is doing us a service here as Americans are generally unaware of the North African phase of the war, since our major involvement really came later. Few rememember that the French in North Africa, after the fall of France, fought American and especially British forces, but let's leave that story for another day.In 1942, Egypt was a British colony, with strong nationalist forces chafing under the control of the Turkish king, installed by the British. Egyptian nationalists, led by Sadat and Nasser, saw little difference between British and German colonial rule, and typically aided the Germans in this theatre. Sadat is a minor character in Follett's book.Into this quagmire appear Alexander Wolff, born of German mother and Egyptian father, trained by the Germans in the latest espionage techniques; and Major Vandamm, a minor British military intellligence official burdened with personal grief and moronic superiors. Wolff successfully establishes a direct link into British intelligence by his clever manipulation of a belly dancer and another British officer. With this information, Rommel is beginning to rout the British.Fortunately for us Anglos, Vandamm devises a honey trap to snare the Nazi. His instrument is a young Jewish girl who is terrified at the prospect of Nazis in Cairo.All in all, a well crafted thriller. Follett uses the historical context and byzantine relationships of the colonial era to great advantage. It is not a great work, as some parts are a bit formulaic and easy to predict, but read it for the history and the adventure."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"This is the 5th Ken Follett Book I've read in a row. Pillars of the Earth was the first and my favorite. This, while not as great as Pillars, is still a very entertaining read.One thing I enjoy about his books is how he can use real events in history and real places in the world and weave them into his stories. The history doesn't overpower the underlying story though. At times you can think that you're reading an actual account of someone who was there, going through what the characters go through.With very deep and true to life characters and a villain you love to hate, you can't go wrong.

Alex is clever--he devises a great way to glean and share that information.Enter Vandam, the British Major who against recommendations of the powers above him, pursues Wolffe with the help of a beautiful Jewish concubine who is currently between paramours named Elena.With the backdrop of WWII, Follett wraps a impeccable story filled with rich characters while not skimping on historical detail.

This novel, somehow, seems more contrived, with many subplots that lengthen the book but don't necessarily increase the tension. I did, however, really enjoy the setting: Egypt and the North African desert. And I enjoyed the fact that the British-educated Nazi spy used Daphne Du Marier's novel, written at about the time the events take place, as the key to his code. Although I'm not into codes and decoding, I thought that the key to the code was somewhat easy, and that a real-life decoder would have figured it out pretty quickly. Consider how long it took British Intelligence to break the Nazi U-Boat code in Europe (covered very well in the novel \\"Enigma,\\" which shows how very difficult the code was to break). \\"The Key to Rebecca\\" was an okay read, but not as good as \\"The Eye of the Needle\\" and not as good as the book that followed, \\"The Man from St. Petersburg.\\""},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"i entirely agree with the reviewer who wrote ok until the last 80 pages. the plot is implausible and the ending is a joke-an embarassment to the author."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"World War II.

The struggle between these two groups swings back and forth but overall Wolf has the upper hand from all points of view including his willingness to employ any ruthless means to transmit intelligence to Rommel that will tip the balance of the war in favor of the Germans. He obtains intelligence that has that potential and what happens then should be determined by the reader for the oppotunity to follow a suspenseful plot with frequent surprises.Selected-The Strange Story of Captain Jennings"},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"I picked this book up quite by accident and having enjoyed Ken Follett before, felt confident, I would enjoy this one too and I did!

The Key to Rebecca was a quick, oldie-but-goodie. I might be slightly less enthused because I read this book in bits & pieces over a few weeks on my Kindle, where it's harder to gauge what you've read and what's left to read. I think it's a book you should dive into & read quickly. The Key to Rebecca is a spy novel, set in World War II. The novel ping-pongs mainly between the determined Major Vandam, a British officer, & Alex Wolff, the cunning, handsome & suave spy on the German side. Both Wolff & Vandam have gorgeous lady loves who assist them, not only in the bedroom (whoa!), but in their professions as well. Follet is a captivating author, detailing the lives of both the protagonist Vandam, & the antagonist Wolff, & the war unfolding around them. I will say the book dragged a little-it was divided into three parts & at the beginning of part three, I was taken aback in a good way, thinking, here comes the action we've been waiting for, but there was still a third of the book to go! But still very entertaining & worth a quick read."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Skillful, exciting thriller with interesting, engaging characters. Pacing, Follet's strong suit, was superb as always.Flaws included [spoilers](1) The characterization of Sandy Smith seemed unkind to the point of maliciousness;(2) There was no real resolution to the Bogge subplot;(3) It was not that plausible that Alex would need to carry around the key. The instructions provided for the first encryption suggest the rule was simple enough that the key could easily be memorized;(4) Like in nearly all Follett's books, the plot winds up with a faintly implausible, complex climax. Here, I did not find Alex's kidnapping of Billy to be credible under the circumstances, although I suppose it is possible."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"This is a first rate spy and action novel with a bit of interesting history thrown in.

The problem with a lot of spy novels (and police novels as well) is that the bad guys are smarter in the beginning and the good guys are smarter at the end (or the bad buys shoot better at the beginning and the good guys shoot better at the end). Makes the outcome less fulfilling, and that is the case here. Didn't find myself identifying with our hero, and our bad guy starts out smart and ruthless, but does not maintain those qualities throughout.Thought the sex scenes contrived, the method they used to extract information from the British officer somewhat silly (let's hide in the closet, sneak out, blah, blah, and of course he will not suspect anythings up, and will take the top secret documents with him).All in all, I enjoyed reading it, but there are better books on Follett's shelf (Eye), and better books in the genre by others as well."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Starts a bit slow what with the exposition of the central characters: Alex, the ruthless German spy sent to Cairo, Vandam (yes, really), a 40-something major in the British Staff Intelligence, Elene, a beautiful Jewish woman who's had a string of bad luck with men, Sonja, a renowned dancer in Cairo with a strange sexual fetish (but, more importantly, an Anglophobe), and several others.But the pace steps up when Vandam gets intrigued with the case of murder by a European named Alex Wolff who seemingly vanished into thin air. Soon enough, things take a turn for the worse when he realizes that Wolff is a spy for the Nazi. Then it becomes a cat-and-mouse game. Vandam becomes tenacious on Wolff's scent and the spy recognizes a worthy adversary.The beauty of thrillers such as this is the coming together of events and people in so \`innocent' or at least inconspicuous moments that would later have shattering effects. What's more, Follett was able to sustain it all throughout. And his portrayal of the characters leaves no room for any perfect personas: all of them are flawed and constantly stumble into mistakes.Thru providence and the sheer gullibility in the part of a British officer, Wolff was able to get highly confidential information, resulting in resounding defeats for the British. As the trail of Wolff almost always leads to the discovery of the English novel \\"Rebecca\\", Vandam begins to put two and two together as to how Wolff operates. And as the looming force of the German army advances ever closer to Cairo, Vandam has to work quickly to catch this spy in his own game, even if it meant using Elene as bait, the woman Vandam is rapidly becoming attracted to.This is a real take-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat race for time. By the third quarter, I was regularly quietly blurting \`dammit!' whenever a new twist comes around to thwart Vandam's plan. I was glued to the pages.A real treat. The ending *ending* was a little too soppy for my taste, but it's negligible. Wolff is not as compelling (nor as scary) as 'Die Nadel', but the story is still gripping."},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"This is a great book. Follett took a real life story of espionage and fleshed it out into an exciting novel of action and suspense in World War II. I agree that some of the characters were probably a bit of a caricature, and a few scenes were quite contrived, but this did not take away from my enjoyment of this book. I do think as a story that Eye of the Needle was superior, but this one is still one of my Follett favorites. Wonderful descriptions of wartime Egypt and colonial British empire.My three star rating is for the Kindle format. It was laughable at times - like the incident mentioned of turning an \\"m\\" into an \\"r\\" and \\"n\\" - turning a character's name into a bit of a joke. Paragraphs seemed off at times and there were hyphenated words in the middle of the sentence. I agree with the previous reviewer that AMazon has to improve the transition from written to electronic word better, though these mistakes do not appear to deter many people from purchasing a KIndle. I still really like the Kindle, but I think that a little more effort could be put into executing a better product.Update: got the supposedly \\"re-formatted \\" version. There are still mistakes on mine. Did anyone else find this to be the case?"},{"Title":"Key to Rebecca","review":"Too much I didn't understand in this novel.

I give it an A+. It is a very long read that covers a broad range of information involving economics, but well worth the time spent. There are a lot of references to issues that were occurring during Smith's time that may not seem to be pertinent to the reader, but can still be applied to modern times. I most enjoyed the last sections of the book on taxes and public debts. His 4 maxims of taxes are that they should be- equal, certain, convenient, and beneficial. He viewed inflation as \\"extremely pernicious\\". The book contains ideas that Americans should possibly revisit in the near future."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"This book is filled with great information you will find useful as well as having to find new things you never knew about. I will recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"pretty much the base for most modern thought on capitalism, while still being surprisingly relevant though it was written over 200 years ago."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"I was not impressed to find that this is an abridgement, especially considering that I found it by reading the reviews and could not discern it from the book cover at all. For this reason I have marked it down to three stars. Smith is necessary reading for anyone interested in the history of Western thought, the Enlightenment or economics, but it must be said that it is dry, if admirably clear, reading and difficult to chew and swallow. For that reason, it is disappointing to get so far in and then find that one is not getting the complete work.There can be few books that have had such lasting influence on the cultural milieu. Unlike Marx, Smith's ideas seem to have stood up to the tide of history without being washed away, although I write at a time when the finance system appears to have just collapsed, so who knows how a little more history will judge it. At any rate, the correctness of Smith's ideas is perhaps of less import for the student of Western thought than its place in the emergence of a rationalist, secular culture. For Smith was part of the conscious project of the Enlightenment to introduce naturalistic models of our world in place of the magical thinking, in the form of divine providence, which preceded it. Smith was building a model of economy which did not rely on an external, disembodied agency but which emerged deterministically and reached equilibrium through the rule-based interactions of its component parts. His \\"invisible hand\\" replaced another.At the same time, he was making a case for personal autonomy and the right of economic self-determination. As such, Smith combines the two most salient threads of the Enlightenment project - liberation from authority and liberation from magic. More than perhaps any other Enlightenment figure, Smith has shaped the way we think as a political culture today. As such, one must read this book to understand the legacy of the Enlightenment. It is hard going, as he was a very thorough worker and this is economics, the most dismal of sciences, but indispensable.There is one misconception that this reading corrected for me which I ought to share, and that concerns Smith's alleged scepticism about \\"corporations\\". For Smith, and presumably for his contemporaries, this did not, as I thought, indicate opposition to public companies and multinationals in the way we would currently understand it. Rather, he referred to, and condemned, the system of closed trades and apprenticeships by which the market for certain trades was until recently widely protected from competition. I demur from taking sides in this, but it is important to mention the misunderstanding which arises out of the word \\"corporation\\", incautiously read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Buy the Liberty Fund Glasgow edition instead of this. This, the Modern Library edition, contains an introduction and footnotes that essentially amount to Adam Smith as interpreted by 20th century socialists -- placing Smith and Karl Marx at the same level in the pantheon of social thinkers. (One can imagine that the Modern Library may continue the trend and subsequently publish an edition of the Federalist Papers in which Madison is compared with Pol Pot.)If you wish to understand Smith, avoid this edition. If, however you want to gain a muddled perspective on The Wealth of Nations, go no further."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Don't be taken in by the gushing praise of the 4-star and 5-star reviews. Adam Smith did not found economics, and The Wealth of Nations is not a must-read. It is not the first or best case for economic liberalism, or even the best case of its time.While Adam Smith's work was a much-needed rebuke to mercantilism, it was in many ways a step back from what had already been written on economics by the School of Salamanca in the 16th Century,Richard Cantillonin 1730, andAnne Robert Jacques Turgotin 1766. It was even a step back from his own previous work, including theLectures on JurisprudenceandThe Theory of Moral Sentiments. Smith's analysis contains many serious errors that would lay the foundation for Marxism, notably his crude labour theory of value (as opposed to marginal utility), his exaggeration of the importance of the division of labour (putting in the shade such critical factors as capital accumulation and the growth of technological knowledge), his identification of some innate \\"propensity to truck, barter and exchange\\" as the cause of the division of labour (rather than differences in ability), and his adoption of the dubious Physiocratic concept of \\"unproductive labour.\\"An economist won't benefit from reading Adam Smith any more than a physicist would benefit from reading Aristotle. If you have recently taken an interest in the economic case for a free market, read The Wealth of Nations only with a cold and critical mind; there are parts that are right and parts that are wrong, and you shouldn't accept something questionable just because free market advocates inappropriately regard Adam Smith as their god."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"I really wonder how many people have ever read this book--especially those who deal with economic issues (say Congress or the President).

Smith has written much better in 1776 than nearly all economists do today.The marginal notes are good too. This book is a great book because it argues for some iron-hard economic rules in a way that Centre-left people, such as myself, will listen seriously to. Smith is not a neo-con by any stretch of the imagination. He speaks of employer combinations openly, whereas most economist writers won't talk about them, and he notes that combinations of employees (unions) are, in 1776, banned by the entire world. He also approves of regulations when they improve the safety of working people, something management still has a problem with.So Smith is more even handed than the right wing voices who cite his economic principles constantly, and deserves reading and citing by Centre-Left people."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Reading this reminded me of my Latin classes many years ago, trying to decipher the likes of Cicero.

So I had to resort to the usual CDs. This revealed an immediate shortcoming with Tantor's version. Although the announcements as to the current book, volume, and section on LibriVox are tiresome, you know where you are. Tantor's edition contains absolutely no index or printed table of contents for a 29 CD set. The current location is neither announced at the beginning of each CD, nor printed anywhere on the CD. So if you were reading the book and want to listen to the rest on audiobook, you have to listen to the whole thing from the beginning. :(The reader has a nice accent though. He delivers Smith's sarcasm and indignation very well. Contrary to popular belief, Adam Smith was a bit of a radical. He adamantly reiterates that of the workers, the landowners, and the merchants (read business people), the latter are the only group who should not lead a nation because their priorites will always lead it into ruin. Based upon his theory, which is still valid, the only reason the United States' economic system has not tanked is the petrodollar.As the book progresses his radicalism becomes increasingly apparent as he expresses his low opinion of the efforts to block free trade and posh schools like Oxford University, as well as his list of alternatives of what should be done with the new American colonies. He even declares that the missionary campaigns by the Catholic church during colonialism were only a pretense to get more gold--and this was in 1776!There are also miscellaneous digressions on the history of liberal education, banking, currencies, and organized western religion.

He explained that all work had to behighly organized in order to be productive. In addition, herecognized that machinery facilitated work. This notion servesas an important foundation for more modern patent practice.He praised the ingenuity of inventors and makers of newmachinery. The author spoke of increased production as acondition precedent to enhancing the power of labor. From thisprecept, he explained that the size of a market would dictatethe division of its constituent labor. For instance, a smallcommunity in the suburbs might be serviced by a local&quot;General Store&quot;; whereas, a county in a large city would beserviced by a retail chain store with hundreds of employeesand a highly sophisticated management structure.In Adam Smith'stime, metals were popular in the manufacture of commodities.Problems were encountered in weighing the metals and arrivingat a uniform system of metrics. The theory of pricing wasa function of the toil needed to purchase a good. For instance,the price of an auto was a function of the many hours of labornecessary to earn the money to buy the car. In addition, the price of an item was related to its constituent parts.For instance, the price of linen was a function of the laborof the flaxdresser, spinner, weaver, bleacher and overallemployer. The natural price varied with the price of componentparts. For instance, if the semiconductor was reduced significantly in price- then the overall price of an electronicappliance would go down. Adam Smith saw labour as a functionof national wealth. He recognized that laborers had to earnmore than a mere subsistence in order to live dignified lives.He told a story of a mother in the Highlands of Scotland whohad to raise 20 children so that 2 would survive. Presumably,18 children would die from various diseases and poverty.The interest rates at the time were low. In England, rateshovered at 5%. In France, the rates were 3-5% . The governmentcould borrow at 2% in Holland.Adam Smith defined a wage as a function of the following:o the ease or hardship to do workConsider the case of a diamond cutter. The art of cutting adiamond is a precise process which requires extensive trainingand expert worksmanship. The demand for precious stones was afunction of their inherent beauty, scarcity and workmanshipinvolved in polishing them and preparing them for commercial use.o the difficulty and expense of learning a tradeA skilled surgeon required years of medical training and along apprenticeship in anatomy and surgery.o the constancy of employmento the trust reposed in the workpeopleConsider the case of a landowner who took a year-long vacationto the Orient. He/she would leave behind a manager to run theentire business on a 24/7 basis. This high degree of trustreposed in the workperson required a commensurate compensation.o probability of success or failure of the ventureConsider the effort required to cross the Atlantic. The tripwas lengthy, dangerous and prone to failure due to the vagariesof nature, pirating on the high seas and disease. Naturally,a worker had to receive a greater compensation to take thesefactors into consideration.o the danger inherent in doing the workConsider the danger inherent in entering a diamond mine.The possibility of collapse was a constant threat. Accordingly,workers were compensated commensurate with the threat level.Adam Smith explained that fear of misfortune dampened the takingof risks. He knew (intuitively) that investors were risk averse.In addition, there was a restriction on training new labor.In Sheffield, no master cutter could train more than a singlecutter . Apprenticeships were lengthy. i.e. 7 years in lengthAdam Smith explained that food was a source of rent to thelandowners. The pricing of metals was a function of the pricein the most fertile mine in the world. Whatever increased thefertility of the land increased its value by implication.Markets in foodstuffs were restricted because refrigerationdid not exist until motors and condensers were perfected.Essentially, there were no operable refrigerators until thefamous Clausius statement was perfected in the engineeringsciences.Accordingly, the market for butcher's meat was confined to thecountry of origin. Wool and raw hide could be transported;however, meat was consumed locally as its shelf-life was limited.The value of money was a function of the value of annual produce.Accordingly, increased quantities of commodities raised thevalue of money. Low fixed rates of interest promoted businessand discouraged usury. Riches were a function of the annualproduce which created the wealth and supported the tax base.High duties were enforced to protect the local markets. Treatiesbetween countries helped local merchants to craft meaningfultrade sequences. Exports were encouraged . The expense oferecting public works was a function of the taxes raised on theland and the proportion of yield from the crops.Governments granted bounties to merchants who wanted to selloverseas in order to assist them in making a profit anddefraying costs/risks.

That tradition later found expression in Adam Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" in which is posited a \\"rational self-interest\\" operating as an \\"invisible hand\\" upon \\"free markets\\". Recent accounting crimes and corporate scandals, however, amount to enormous empirical evidence that \\"laissez faire\\" capitalism is a myth and the \\"invisible hand\\" is mere \\"wishful thinking\\".It is obvious that there is no \\"invisible hand\\" which militates against crooks, charlatans, and fast buck artists now seen to have firmly ensconced themselves as much in the board rooms as among sleazy fly-by-nighters.Markets left to their own devices trend toward oligopoly in which oligarchs effect political plutocracy through the exercise of sheer political muscle, intimidation, fraud, and outright bribery.If there is an \\"invisible hand\\", it has never moderated the rich and powerful. If a ruling cabal is to be moderated it must be done by political action.This is less a criticism of Smith himself than of modern economic conservatives and/or 'supply-siders' who find in Smith --ex post facto --a rationalization for rapacious and monopolistic behavior. Smith is no more to be faulted for this than Darwin should be faulted for the excesses of \\"Social Darwinism\\" --neither Social nor Darwin. \\"Social Darwinists\\" are most often associated with the age of the Robber Barons, providing them an ideological bias that justifies all manner of corporate crookedness and sleazy practices.To his credit, Smith himself feared the rise of monopoly power --a fear which modern conservative commentary either does not understand or omits entirely.The picture is complicated, however by Immanuel Kant who assailed the pursuit of self interest in favor of \\"good in and of itself\\" --a \\"categorical imperative\\". It is a moral standard that no one, of course, can live up to. Nevertheless, Kant became the other great influence upon American conservative thought --though I cannot give most contemporary conservatives credit for having actually read Kant or, for that matter, understanding him.Yet --Kant may be found lurking beneath the ideological surface of the extreme right-wing and the religious right which seeks to impose upon us a \\"transcendental\\" reality and morality whether we like it or not.It is unfortunate that Kant himself defined this \\"transcendent reality\\" --which he calls the noumena --as being unknowable. If follows, by definition, that one cannot make meaningful statements about it, but that has not kept righteous ideologues from deducing from this \\"unknowable\\" value judgments and imposing those values judgments on others. By definition, nothing meaningful can be said about whatever is \\"unknowable\\"!We are given a choice of two mutually exclusive alternatives: \\"selfishness\\" or \\"selfless transcendentalism\\". Neither position, however, is entirely true and neither is completely understood even by the conservative mentality that espouses them. Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" is no more valid than Laffer's \\"trickle down\\" theory and it is highly doubtful that even Kant lived up to his own moral dictum --though I credit Kant with sincerity but doubt it among his followers. I rather think that \\"mankind\\" is neither entirely selfish or entirely selfless.The truth is most likely found in the middle. The work of mathematician John Nash, celebrated of late in the motion picture \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", wrote a brilliant paper on \\"binding agreements\\" that casts grave doubts upon many \\"conservative\\" fables, shibboleths, and fairy tales --including those whose origins lie in \\"mutually exclusive\\" intellectual traditions.

Many of Smith's great metaphors are found in the first quarter of the book, and I felt bored reading the latter parts. It is not that Smith was wrong, by any means, but rather that many of his arguments are now well-accepted and can be demonstrated in much more succinct manners. I feel that Smith's multitudes of examples are not particularly important to the average man.With that said, I reiterate that this is an important work that should be understood by everyone - but this does not necessarily mean reading all of it. For anyone studying economics, of course, this work is the bread and butter of your field - and is a must read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Some books have entered so deeply into our culture that they affect the way we think whether or not we have read them. The Wealth of Nations is certainly one of these books. And like most such books - the Bible, Shakespeare, the works of Freud or Jung, the Bill of Rights - the Wealth of Nations does not say what you think it does.The fact is, those who most earnestly revere Adam Smith are not always those who have read his works most carefully. Which is why reading The Wealth of Nations is important for those who think about the role of capitalism and free markets in our nations and in our world."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"I waited until 40+ years after I studied economics in college to get around to reading Wealth of Nations. (It wasn't on the syllabus). Definitely my loss. Is it an easy read? No, but this Kindle edition has modernized spelling and lost the random capitalization. The vocabulary is be a little challenging, but that's why your Kindle has a dictionary built in - and you may also need Google, as I did, for some of the more obscure usages. A little background in 17th-18th century British history also helps. I recommend making plenty of notes in your Kindle as you go.Smith compares/contrasts the economies of hunter-gatherer, nomadic and warrior civilizations, as well as feudal and mercantilist economies, and outlines a free-trade system which he would like to see, which we call \\"capitalism\\". Unfortunately, it seems to me that the mercantile system has prevailed in the long run, at least as far as international trade is concerned. He makes considerable use of historical examples as well as contemporary (to him) events, and he seems ambivalent about the prospects for the American colonies which were then in revolt.Wordy? A little repetitive? Yes, Smith could have used a good editor. But not to be missed. And a serious bargain at this price."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"I give this book 5 stars only because Amazon won't let me give it 6.I just finished reading this book a few moments ago. All I can say is \\"genius.\\" It is of interest not only to the student of economics, but also of history and philosophy. I read this book because I was told that it is widely considered to be the foundation of modern economics. As I am starting a private study in this area, I felt this was a good place to start. If you are starting a study on economics START HERE! Adam Smith ties very abstract concepts to real-life examples that are understandable even today.I read somewhere that this book changed the world. Without knowing more about the period, I cannot say whether it did or not-but based on the magnificence and scope of this work, I believe it could be true. I can see the imprint of Adam Smith everywhere in modern economics-even in Karl Marx cites him! If you read my other reviews, you will see that I have never said this before-so understand, I do NOT say this lightly: This book has truly enriched my understanding of the world around me-and opened my eyes to things that I did not previously understand. Yes-this book changed my outlook on life!You know you are reading a work of timeless genius when you can apply directly what a man wrote in 1776 to the year 2010.If you are considering buying this book be aware of a few things:1) This book was published in 1776-and uses 1776 english. It's a little tough to follow at first, but you get used to it. If you've read America's founding fathers it really constitutes NO difficulty2) Despite the language, this book is VERY readable. His examples are understandable and the structure of the book makes it easy to follow him from point to point.3) This book is HUGE. This version (Bantam Classics) has 1208 pages.4) I wish Bantam would have given more room for notes in the margin.A few other observations about this book-* I was AMAZED by how different banking and financing were in the 1770s.* This book illustrates in SO many ways that people haven't changed AT ALL-very interesting - and amusing to see that illustrated over and over again.* Be prepared for an unrelating (and very convincing) argument for completely free trade.* Some of his digressions (especially the one on corn) were a little tough to get through.* He is SO honest in this book. In a day when pro-business talking heads will excuse any excess-Adam Smith has NO problem taking certain business practices to task. This book taught me, an Unrepentant Capitalist Pig that it is not only OK, but desirable to denounce bad business practices.* I feel a lot of the material in this book shows that a \\"gold standard\\" currency is not the magic bullet that many people today pretend it to be. (not that it's bad-but gold standard has it's own problems)* I feel the material in this book (specifically book 5) could be used to make a strong argument FOR the Fair tax (National Sales Tax)* The arguments he makes about the colonies in North America (us) are VERY surprising. I don't want to spoil it-but I had to re-read it a few times to make sure I understood what he said. - His argument makes sense, but I didn't see it coming.* Being a proud Pennsylvania resident, I was excited to see all the Pennsylvania references.* This book should be REQUIRED reading for any politician who will be assuming elected office. (Especially our current President)"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"This book seems to be the nicest edition i have seen of this classic and proably Smith's most important work.

It reproduces the Carman edition of 1904, a very thoroughly footnoted (or endnoted) version.

This is by far the most expensive Kindle edition of Adam Smith, and shouldn't have screwed up its notes -- the only reason for paying five extra dollars -- in this way.Let me add that the Amazon reviewing mechanism is, as usual, inadequate for reviewing Kindle editions; my review ends up one of over fifty reviews discussing the book in general, not the Kindle edition specifically."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"After some 6 months of buying Kindle books, I've found that the better-known publishers as often as not DON'T do a better job of formatting their titles for Kindle. The Modern Library's Kindle version of \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is a case in point. The footnotes, which appear at the end of each chapter, are all run together in one big paragraph, without any numbers to show where each footnote begins. Moreover, while the footnote references in the text are linked, the links take you only to the start of the footnotes for that chapter, rather than to the pertinent footnote itself. A lesser problem is that the paragraphs in the text do not begin with indents; thus, the only way to tell when a new paragraph starts is if you come to a line that extends only halfway across the screen.On the plus side, this edition does include the explanatory call-outs of the original (in italics at the end of each section they pertain to) and the lengthy 1906 explanatory introduction by Edwin Cannan (though for some reason not the introduction by Robert Rubin to the recent Modern Library paperback).But it's a shame that Modern Library didn't do a better job with the formatting, especially since other Kindle publishers have made TWON available at a fraction of what Modern Library charges."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Based on his previous writings on human behaviour, Adam Smith shows, systematically and consistently, how a market-based economic system promotes general welfare through the sole maximisation of individual outcomes. This book is a true masterpiece and laid the foundations for modern economic analysis. Though later criticised by many, Smith remains one of the most lucid thinkers on capitalism, despite the fact that he is permanently underestimated in the face of people like Marx. 222 years after its original publication, it maintains its powerful insights.

The multitude of examples and depth of discussion could stop a Mack truck, but the lessons are critical. It teaches you about the true nature of money; where it comes from, what it means. That, in turn, as you reflect on your own life, will illustrate much about how you prioritize your own life.Along with Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged,\\" this book will indisputably change your perception of the nature of money and a how person chooses to earn their living.The only drawback to the book is that it is brutally boring--but get a large cup of Java, sit back, and dig in.

And slavery like it or not is a part of economics. It's a way to get labor for very cheap (like food, water and shelter only). On page 744 he does however call it the unfortunate law of slavery. Slavery is abhorrent and prevents the whole from reaching their great potential for the benefit of a few (the wealthy who have slaves and the consumers who get products much cheaper because of it).On page 110-111 This really stands out \\"No Society can surely be flourishing and happy of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable\\"Adam Smith does however place too much emphasis on Corn being the commodity that everything is measured against. It's just as easy to switch to a different food source like Rice for instance. That if enough people switched to would cause the price of corn to drop or stop being planted.On page 986 He says there is no public institution for the education of women and he talks about not educating the women like the men. He says they are taught only what their parents or guardian judge it necessary or useful for them to learn and nothing else. This clealy isn't good either but I know he was just stating a fact of life at the time.I cry BRAVO!!! for Adam Smith's take on Religion. He got the true religion right! On page 998 it says \\"because in every religion except the true it is highly pernicious and it has a natural tendency to pervert the true, by infusing into it a strong mixture of superstition, folly and delusion. Each ghostly practitioner in order to render himself more precious and sacred in the eyes of his retainers will inspire them with the most violent abhorrences of all other sects. No regard will be paid to Truth, Morals or Decency.\\" The true religion extols Truth, Morals and Decency as Jesus taught us to keep the commandments. This is the whole duty of man. To speak the truth and walk uprightly. To not steal, Not Lie, Not commit adultery, etc. But today's organized religions are more interested in building bigger buildings to get more money collected for the most part than to do good works.On page 1067 Adam Smith says \\"the ground rents of uninhabited houses ought to pay no tax\\". I wholeheartedly disagree with thisstatement. This would allow the very wealthy to own so much land that the poorer people could never own their own piece of property. That's what property taxes are for to prevent this from happening. If the poor abandon all these houses that the very wealthy own then eventually the very wealthy will be unable to pay property tax and the government will take control of their property and put it back into circulation providing their workers places to live. That's why the proper way is the way the government of the the U.S. (or maybe Idaho) has implemented it. You get a tax break for your primary residence for your place to live but none from additional properties. Not to mention another country with a lot of cash could buy up all the property in your country and control too much without doing the labor needed to keep a country functioning properly.But overall it's a very good book.Sincerely,Jon Beckmon"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is truly one of the most influential books in world history. Published in 1776, it discussed many of the economic ideas of the thought system we refer to today as classical or nineteenth-century liberalism.First and foremost, it enumerated the capitalist doctrines that led to the awesome increase in living standards over the past two centuries--doctrines such as free trade, the importance of economic growth for a society, and the idea that the entire society benefits when the individual is encouraged to pursue his economic self-interest.Smith also examined the topics of paper money and commodity standards and provided examples from the past of when currencies were debased during hard times. Perhaps the most sobering part of the book from the point of view of today is the section that discussed how governments, when they have spent far too much and can no longer service their debt, must either repudiate the debt or incinerate it via severe inflation--we can only hope that the gross overspending in recent years on the part of both parties in Washington will not bring us to that point in the coming years.Some of the other topics on which Smith held forth include apprenticeships, colonies, agriculture, defense, taxes, the differences between public and private sector employment, and fascinating comparisons of wage rates between England and the then-colonies and between parts of Britain.The book is very readable despite the fact it was written in eighteenth-century English, and is definitely worth tackling if you have a serious interest in economics."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Although advertised as \\"used\\",you could have fooled me...this book is in perfect condition.

The mind of Adam Smith is incredible, and I encourage an interested reader to duke it out as you'll most certainly come out of the book more informed. I would recommend Wealth of Nations to anyone who has a mild interest in Economics. Brian Oley"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"This book has two massive and core problems, each one of them large enough to make this book incredibly, even dangerously, misleading.The first problem of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is not to be found in identifying all those familiar, and illogical anomalies that have been proven through experience false, and are well known (the \\"invisible hand\\" and others); nor the fact that Smith completely hides the history of his own country (how after the English civil war the English pursued an incredibly protectionist series of policies); but that all these complaints can be seen as stemming from one underlying problem in Smith's analysis: which was almost exclusively that of a micro-economist. This is highly contrary to how this book is interpreted, yet, if understood, explains many of Wealth of Nation's failings.The second major failing of this book is that through its clever wording and euphemisms it completely changed the language of economics. No longer would the British come out in direct language of their intentions in the House of Lords of the hostility and economic warfare that they were perpetually waging (and continue to wage to this day, albeit in a much different form) in open, brutal and naked language; they would do it through euphemistic and sophistical language. When we observe other methods of modern economic imperialism, the IMF for example, we see that the tools of the language that Smith pioneered have been perfected to a science - just Google the latest IMF policy papers or interviews to see what I'm talking about.To illustrate this fact in summation, rather than in a case-by-case, chapter-by-chapter disassembly that nobody would read nor would fit in this format, I'll turn to Friedrich List who illustrated these problems of Smith's \\"Wealth of Nations\\" brilliantly in his 1841 book \\"The National System of Political Economy\\". For the sake of brevity, I'll only include List shining a light to the later of these two problems, that is, the total obfuscation of the language of economics post-Wealth of Nations.\\"...The ministers of George I in 1721 openly declared, on the occasion of the prohibition of the importation of the manufactures of India, that it was clear that a nation could only become wealthy and powerful if she imported raw materials and exported manufactured goods. Even in the times of Lords Chatham and North, they did not hesitate to declare in open Parliament that it ought not to be permitted that even a single horse-shoe nail should be manufactured in North America. In Adam's Smith's time, a new maxim was for the first time added to those which we have above stated, namely, to conceal the true policy of England under the cosmopolitical expressions and arguments which Adam Smith had discovered, in order to induce foreign nations to imitate that policy.It is very common clever device that when anyone has attained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he has climbed up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. In this lies the secret of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical doctrine of Adam Smith, and of the cosmopolitical tendencies of his great contemporary William Pitt, and of all his successors in the British Government administrations.Any nation which by means of protective duties and restrictions on navigation has raised her manufacturing power and her navigation to such a degree of development that no other nation can sustain free competition with her, can do nothing wiser that throw away these ladders of her greatness, to preach to other nations the benefits of free trade, and to declare in penitent tones that she has hitherto wandered in the paths of error, and has now for the first time succeeded in discovering the truth.William Pitt was the first English statesmen who clearly perceived in what way the cosmopolitcal theory of Adam Smith could be properly made use of, and not in vain did he himself carry about a copy of the work on the Wealth of Nations. His speech in 1786, which was addressed neither to Parliament nor to the nation, but clearly to the ears of the statesmen of France, who were destitute of all experience and favour of the Eden Treaty, is an excellent specimen of Smith's style of reasoning. By nature he said France was adapted for agriculture and the production of wine, as England was thus adapted to manufacturing production. These nations ought to act towards one another just as two great merchants would do who carry on different branches of trade and who reciprocally enrich one another by the exchange of goods. Not a word here of the old maxim of England, that a nation can only attain to the highest degree of wealth and power in her foreign trade by the exchange of manufactured products against agricultural products and raw materials. This maxim was then, and has remained since, and English State secret; it was never again openly professed, but was all the more persistently followed.\\"-Friedrich List, 1841 Political EconomyWe can all agree that certain areas are more suitable to certain types of farming, but what does it mean that \\"England was thus adapted to manufacturing production\\"? As if, while grapes to make wine sprung from the earth in France, fully formed factories were springing from the earth in England and that each nation should therefore simply take what was provided to them. This sheer nonsense was later refined and perfected by such degenerates as J.B. Say and, of course, David Ricardo.As a book that professes to explain macro-economics \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is a catastrophic failure. And this explains a lot of why the modern schools of economics that build their edifice upon this \\"foundation\\" are so worthless at creating prosperity, progress, predicting anything of any merit, etc. This book originated, insofar as I am aware, the idea of looking at The Market and The State as a dichotomy rather than as using an observational and scientific approach, which concludes that looking at Macro-economics with anything other than the role of modern Nation-State at its primary focus is pure folly. Friedrich List defines Smith's work brilliantly when identifies \\"Wealth of Nations\\" as the \\"economics of a shop-keeper\\" - that is, a focus on the exchange of value rather than the creation of value. What a different world we would live in if List was widely read and understood; for List's work is infinitely more adept at explaining how productive forces come into being and how macro-economies function than Smith. Adam Smith's work, the State is giving the far back-seat in favor of The Market that Smith mythologized and the legendary Individual (Man, as such) that Smith makes so popular. There are many books that dispel this nonsensical view from simply observing the historical record, read \\"Debt\\" by David Graeber or Friedrich List's \\"Political Economy\\" (I recommend both, but the latter book much more so). If you accept the major tenants of this book as they have been popularized then you will be yet another anti-historical fool, but don't worry, you'll have plenty of company.However, for many things, Smith's micro-approach is very good and yields usable information and therefore shouldn't be completely disregarded. But drawing the line of what is useful and what is fantasy in this book is no easy task for those that don't read an incredible amount of economics books or who's minds haven't already been turned to mush from an \\"education\\" (indoctrination) in modern economics. It is this very reason that I, reluctantly in spite of this books merits, give it 1 star.If you are going to read this book then you should read the other side of the argument and give it fair consideration. The \\"other side\\" (that is, the objective, factually based one that is derived from historical observation) from what Smith professes can be found with the following authors: Daniel Raymond, John Barnard Byle, Willard Phillips, Friedrich List, Webster G. Tarpley, Ha-Joon Chang, Steve Keen, Michael Hudson, Herman Finer, Heikki Patomaki, John Quiggin, Les Leopold, and of course Alexander Hamilton."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"I ordered this book for my son.

Voter thinking 11/03/09 focused on jobs and the economy, and sent a clear message of dissatisfaction with economic progress to-date. Smith's recommendations have had a large role in creating that dissatisfaction. Private sector employment has dropped since 2000, home ownership and median family income are down since 1998 and the proportion living in poverty has risen. The topic's importance was re-emphasized 11/06/2009 with the release of data showing the unemployment rate continuing to climb - now 10.2% (not counting those who have given up looking, or are working only part-time). Adam Smith and Free Enterprise are not working; meanwhile, China's GDP is growing 8.5%.Reinvigorating Main Street America's employment picture, however, will not be easy. Problems have been building for years, long before the sub-prime crisis. Some believe automation is the major source of recent job losses. However, it is difficult to look at the constant parade of long trains carrying shipping containers inland, or the millions of illegals turning up all across America, and conclude that this is the case. Substantial improvement on Main Street will primarily require drastically limiting Smith's 'Free Trade.' Free Trade supporters repeatedly cite the imposition of Smoot-Hawley tariffs as substantially deepening and prolonging the Great Depression, and conclude that we must not turn protectionist. Reality, however, is that prior to Smoot-Hawley, the 1929 Trade Surplus was an insignificant 0.38% of our GDP, and could not possibly have had significant impact even if lost entirely. True, international trade plays a much bigger role than in 1930 - however, the fact that we've run large and increasing trade deficits for decades is prima-facie evidence that eg. no trade whatsoever would at least stop the bleeding.As for Adam Smith's famous Free Trade support, that occurred 200+ years ago - before across-the-board very large and low-cost competitors like China, India, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam, the Internet, jet planes, and massive cargo ships made a much large proportion of economies vulnerable to offshoring than ever before. We need to also remember that protectionism is what allowed the U.S. and its new Asian competitors to achieve their original economic strength. (Smith himself warned against taking Free Trade too far - such that a nation's security was endangered.)Free Trade defenders might assert that manufacturing and IT have borne the brunt of offshoring to date, and their future offshoring is not likely to increase. Recent trends and data, however, suggest service jobs will increasingly also become affected. American firms are already establishing R&D; facilities in China; Asian competitors not only have a cost advantage competing for engineering work, they also have the advantage of greater experience in production gained through producing our manufactures. Unfortunately, this also provides them with a natural lead-in to new areas - eg. offshored CRT-tube manufacturing experience helped Asians in new areas of plasma, LCD, photovoltaic, solar, and LED screen development and manufacturing, and this trend probably will extend into nanotubes as well. Data reported in Business Week's 11/09/2009 issue confirms the shift - over the past year, U.S. employment of scientists and engineers has fallen by 6.3%, while overall employment has fallen only 4.1%.Proposed U.S. economic remedies frequently suggest increasing the proportion of Americans receiving college degrees as a defense against offshoring. Alan Blinder, former Federal Reserve Vice-Chairman and current economics professor at Princeton, warns that the key distinction in whether a job is likely to be offshored or not will be in whether a particular service is delivered in person (haircuts, brain surgery) or not (computer programing) - not whether it is education intensive. (Elective brain surgery can also be offshored.) Thus, a college degree may no longer be a panacea. Blinder also believes it is quite likely that offshoring (unless changed) will depress the real wages of many U.S. workers who do not lose their jobs, the offshoring transition will continue for 2 - 3 decades and bring gross potential job losses in the range of 30- 40 million, and that American standards of living will decline. Proposals by still others to deal with offshoring job losses via more jobs in high-tech areas (eg. biotechnology) become ludicrous when viewed in the light of these numbers. Professor Blinder's suggestion makes much more sense - increased vocational education.Additionally, some Free Trade defenders contend that Chinese labor costs will soon become non-competitive. There are two problems with relying on this 'defense:' 1)Chinese productivity has also increased considerably. Economist Steven Roach (author of \\"The Next Asia\\") lives and works in China and reports that productivity in China's industrial sector surged nearly 20%/year from 2000-2004. Further, even after six years of double-digit increases, average hourly compensation for Chinese manufacturing workers was only 3% that of the U.S. average in 2004. (It's difficult to get reliable up-to-date information on China.) 2)By 2020 it is estimated that there will be 553 million non-agricultural workers in China - 100 million more than in all the developed world, according to Martin Jacques in \\"When China Rules the World.\\"Others contend that China cannot continue its rapid economic growth without Democracy, something it shows few signs of doing. Jacques, on the other hand, provides data showing that most Chinese believe the political climate has improved since 1989 (Tienanmen Square), and 72% of its population are satisfied with the condition of the country vs. only 39% in the U.S. (As for the widely reported large number of civil disturbances within China reported each year, Jacques contends most have nothing to do with the central government - eg. local land issues.)Finally, there is the large and growing problem of illegal immigrants taking jobs from American citizens. The U.S. already has enough problems finding work for its own citizens, and the problems are going to become much more severe via currently unfettered offshoring. It is numerically impossible for the U.S. to also provide jobs for the current number of illegal immigrants from Mexico, Central, and South America - we must sharply reduce the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.Bottom Line: Main Street America cannot withstand continually losing jobs to Free Trade, illegal workers, and automation. Wall Street, on the other hand, has benefited immensely from these job losses and shows no signs of changing direction. The recent financial crisis clearly demonstrated that financial markets are not self-correcting, and that Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' is not infallible. Immediate government redirection is required."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"I bought this book because it seems like a must read for anyone interested in business and economics.

It is a fairly aggressive book based on its size with almost 1,000 pages of fairly fine print of which half of it is dedicated to the supply and demand of corn. But it is surprisingly readable and even interesting. And it is the basic textbook of all economics.Wealth is defined as production capability or what we might call GDP.I figure with a changing economy, it never hurts to brush up on the basics. We are in a period of sharp changes in supply and demand. It is important for business leaders to try to understand what impact this will have on them and their companies.One principle that Adam espouses is the division of labour.He also talks about principals, those are the people that supply the capital that is put to use by the agents (people who apply the capital). His view is that people should not do both, they should do one or the other.

Less than a century later, Karl Marx was able to demonstrate, in his book, THE POVERTY OF PHILOSOPHY, how vacuous the ideas of good and bad, as they are usually applied in political economy, turn out to be in practice. Americans have largely accepted the notion of a consumer society totally dependent on copyright and trade laws to protect the value of the entertainment and related therapeutic products which it produces. What might be most upsetting to readers of this book, that someone like myself could use it to reflect on the events of 9/11/2001 as a challenge to such modern assumptions, as if the policing powers which maintain the world financial situation of today have more to fear from an examination of how this book treats consumption than from the usual lessons based on the growth of wealth, might make this an unacceptable view of what this book actually says.When this book was written, Adam Smith was able to combine economic ideas about the distribution and production (which he considered the highest good) of articles of commerce, in contrast to \\"the bad effects of the monopoly,\\" in a way that caused thinking people in Britain to believe that the world would be materially better off if the American colonies were free of rules which required those who produced all the tobacco from Maryland and Virginia to sell it in or through Great Britain. Adam Smith was worried that capital maintained to store this product in London was depriving England of the opportunity to produce goods that would generate more wealth. \\"At the port of London, indeed, it is commonly sold for ready money. The rule is, Weigh and pay. At the port of London, therefore, the final returns of the whole round-about trade are more distant than the returns from America by the time only that goods may lie unsold in the warehouse; where, however, they may sometimes lie long enough.\\" The American revolution was greeted by economic free traders as an event likely to cause a great increase in the wealth of nations, and the normally victorious political element maintains a strong belief in this fiscal ideology.The current situation might be closer to \\"the time only which the goods may lie unsold in the warehouse.\\" Near the end of Book IV, \\"Of Systems of Political Economy,\\" Chapter VII, \\"Of Colonies,\\" there was a frightening example of how bad things might get to be. \\"In Spain and Portugal the bad effects of the monopoly, aggravated by other causes, have perhaps nearly overbalanced the natural good effects of the colony trade.\\" Plenty of things went wrong, causing a large portion of the population to feel that they were victims of circumstances, \\" . . . but above all, that irregular and partial administration of justice, which often protects the rich and powerful debtor from the pursuit of his injured creditor, and which makes the industrious part of the nation afraid to prepare goods for consumption of those haughty and great men to whom they dare not refuse to sell upon credit, and from whom they are altogether uncertain of repayment.\\" Certainly, a great deal of money is in circulation today, and a tremendous amount is considered working capital, capable of producing many things that people might want, but the routine search for contraband includes cash in an amount exceeding $10,000, the amount which might be capable of buying a large amount of illegal substances. Police are actually so unfamiliar with cash transactions that large amounts might be held as evidence, until the police have been convinced that they have no reason to suspect the person who had the money of being involved in any sort of laundering activity. When Adam Smith was writing, his work was as shocking to those controlling the monopolies of his day as radical protests of today rile the police on the beat today, whose confiscation of vehicles, which are sometimes temporary, to see if they were used to transport illegal substances, is not considered in any way similar to hijacking airplanes in order to crash them into buildings which symbolize a violation of the right of the people to personal pleasure in a manner which averts the collapse of society as we know it. This hardly makes more sense than those who expected seizure of everybody's major assets to solve society's problems."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is written in the manner of one fact following another.

As a result each individual is incapable of sustaining his basic needs and thus must purchase these using his labour which Smith views as the source of all value. As a result demand and supply is created for such labour.He makes the natural assumption that each individual pursues their best interests.He foreshadows the concepts of marginal utility and scarcity in determining the shapes of demand curves for commodities. ( He never actually mentions curves ).Similarly, he describes the three factors determining supply prices for commodities ( rent of land, wages and capital costs ) and the various factors which influence them ( the equivalent of modern supply/demand curves for each factor ).He puts these together under ideal circumstances to show how supply and demand meet to clear markets ( equilibrium in modern language ).He then turns to macroeconomics laying the foundations for GDP and shows how capital can be distributed to \\"unproductive labour\\" ( that labour used to maintain productive labour ) such as doctors lawyer entertainers etc and \\"productive labour\\" ( that labour used in the manufacture and distribution of raw and finished products ). He explores the consequences of various distribution of each from both the micro and macroeconomic perspective.He concludes by emphasizing the importance of government in providing international and domestic security as well as providing public works and institutions especially education.Naturally this requires state revenue and he devotes almost one entire \\"book\\" to taxes.He delves briefly into political economy especially merchantilism and it's detrimental effects to society at large.A great introduction to modern economics that is often missed in didactic lectures.

In large part his wisdom still applies today. To briefly summarize Smith's thinking:1. Standards of living are determined by the productivity of workers.2. Productivity of workers is greatly enhanced by specialization (see the famous example of the pin factory in the first chapter!).3. Greater specialization is possible only if the market size grows. Thus, government laws that prohibit growth of the market hurt specialization, and thereby keep living standards from rising. This is why Smith opposed laws that restricted trade or created monopolies. Smith actively worked to keep Britain from going to war against its American colonies over trade issues. The Wealth of Nations is a political tract designed to sway the British parliament (obviously it failed in that regard).4. Productivity of workers is enhanced by raising their wages.5. Productivity of workers is enhanced by publicly funded education.6. The role of markets is exquisitely analyzed by Smith. Self-interest leads people to carry out private activities that lead to social betterment, as if by an &quot;invisible hand.&quot;7. It is a serious misinterpretation of Smith to assert that greed or selfishness is the same as self-interest. Smith labored hard to avoid any such confusion. Please see his other book which addresses this specific issue: The Theory of Moral Sentiments.8. Clearly Smith favored limited government. But Smith was NOT a strict advocate of laissez-faire. He ended his illustrious career as commissioner of customs, a job he took seriously, and which he would not have taken had he not thought this level of intervention in the economy warranted.Read the first three chapters of WN: they contain the essence of the arguments above.

(To my knowledge, neither of these editionsis abridged.) In 1904, Cannan, a professor at theLondon School of Economics, did two things that greatlyadd to the value of Smith's book.First, Cannan prepared a detailed index. For example,\\"invisible hand\\" appears in it. Just try to find theone (and only one) appearance of that phrase withoutan index. Most of the non-Cannan editions I've lookedat lack an index.Second, Cannan wrote and added brief marginalia.

They don't get in yourway once you've found the pages you want to read.(Reviewer T.

Anyone who has been to college willrecognize much that is familiar in his thoughts (inBook V) on \\"Education of Youth\\". And he also franklyaddresses the downsides of capitalism. The book beginswith the division of labor as a powerful means ofadding productivity.

This model serves as the foundation of the arguments in the entire book; and an excellent guide to analyze our modern market economies. Smith touches on various topics, ranging from market economics, history of colony establishments, state of opulence (briefly describing China in the 18th century), and of human nature and behavior in general.Much of Adam Smith's ideas have been distorted by subsequent scholars, some of whom contorted his ideas to suit their own purposes, while others might have simply misunderstood. For example, in coining the word 'the Invisible Hand', Smith recommended free market competition as the foundation for progressive opulance. However, his implicit assumption was that people seeking their own benefits also embraced compassion and sympathy in their moral values. This 'moral value' part is often missing in contemporary economic analysis. As such, to gain an understanding of his complete doctrine, you should read this economics book together with his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\", which explores definitions of moral values and virtues.Another issue worth mentioning is that lots of people thought that Capitalism was derived from Adam Smith's doctrine, and the current market economies in the USA is a descendent of this ideology. However, if we used his definitions and analysis to compare the current USA market system, you will find that parts of the US system seemed to match closer to the Merchantile System that Smith lambasted as inefficient and short-sighted.A lot has been said about Smith's keen observations and eloquent quotes, however, most failed to mention his uncanny sense of humor. For example, in discussing about labor compensation, Smith remarked that \\"The public admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities, makes always a part of their rewards; a greater or smaller in proportion as it is higher or lower in degree. It makes a considerable part of that reward in the profession of physics; a still greater perhaps in that of law; in poetry and philosophy it makes almost the whole.\\"; when taken into contexts that Smith is a Scholar in Philosophy, and hence should expect \`public admiration' as his total compensation package, this sentence is almost hilarious.This book is an insightful read, albeit one that requires much pondering. It took Adam Smith ten years to complete the first edition of Wealth of Nations, hence I would strongly recommend taking a slow pace in this exploration of his wisdom.You might ask whether there is an easier way to read this book, perhaps through some summary others wrote.My opinion is really not to do that, because the gist of this book is on the thinking process and good learning does not come easy. Spend the time to reflect on his reasonings and you will gain significantly from his wisdom. Not to forget that you should get a copy of his other book \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" to fully appreciate the Wealth of Nations."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"I didn't read this exact edition, and I did read an abridged version.

I thought going back two hundred years might be a dicey move, but Mr. Smith's voice remains perfectly lucid, compelling, and marvelously informative. I cannot praise this book highly enough."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"The Wealth of Nations is an overview of economics by the Scottish philosopher Adam Smith around the time of the American Revolution. At the time of the writing, the popular ideology of economics was mercantilism - that is, countries should export as much products and import as much gold as possible. Hence, the somewhat strange title of the book. (The fact that \\"capitalism\\" and \\"economics\\" were not common phrases at the times doesn't help either)Much of what the book says confirms what any Economics 101 course would tell you - when you try to modify a free market, there are ripple effects. Take mercantilism again, as an example. Countries at the time tried to have \\"positive balances of trade\\", through methods such as prohibiting the exportation of gold, and encouraging exportation of everything else. This supposedly makes a country richer. In reality, all it does is make gold worth *less* in that country, because there are less products to buy per unit of gold available. This also leads to smuggling, where gold is sold to other countries where it is worth more.Smith understands that some government and taxation is necessary - there are some services that the free market cannot effectively provide. Conservatives seem to over-emphasize the famous \\"invisible hand of the free market\\" endorsed by Smith, while ignoring the fact that he endorses the idea of taxing the rich at a higher rate than the poor. (Source: page 1065 of the Bantam paperback edition)What would Smith think about the 21st century? I think he would be disappointed in our politics, both Democrat and Republican. Both Bush and Obama have overseen increases in the size of the federal government. Smith would likely be a conservative, but not a Republican or a \\"Tea Party\\" protester. He probably would've voted for Ron Paul in the 2008 primaries and Bob Barr in the general elections, despite flaws in both candidates. He would be against the War on Drugs, the bailouts, and probably the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. He would be just as worried about corporate monopolies as he would government monopolies. I'm not so sure what he would think about healthcare - there are definitely problems with American healthcare, but don't think he'd want a public option or insurance mandate as a reform.Adam Smith is a very clear writer. Despite the book's length, it's not a boring read. I only skipped about 100 pages, mostly numerical data and obsolete information. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"The Wealth of Nations (An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations) by Adam Smith.

Their topics are present in the political agenda of our governments right today, and after all other reviewers have written, better than I would do so, i should add four key points:- With no proper political institutions there is no possibility of creating wealth (it reminds me sad examples from today...Argentina?). Smith thinks it is very important having economic liberties, besides independent magistrates, and a national state committed to enforce the contracts privates sign up to make transactions when some party doesn't want to comply them.- Under the right framework of political institutions is posible to have private interests and public interest converging on the same \\"bargain zone\\". Under Smith's point of view is the mercantilism, as a policy of state, policy that picks up the winners since the desk of politicians instead of from the shops of every-day industry and parsimony of workers and entrepreuners what creates the conflict (even though he makes some exceptions, like the Navigation Act, but he regards the need of this monopoly of english navy by national security reasons only).- After the short-run adjustments, the income distribution matters, that are so important for politicians, should be resolved by the market and the entrepreuners whom, by searching opportunities to make more profits, will make converging the prices of land, labour and goods.- The accumulation of capital is the process that lowers interest rates, expands the supply of loans and suports higher degrees of division of labour in the economy. This process should let people have cheaper goods along the time and improve the wages of workers. The tax system should not stop this process, by \\"punishing\\" profits and the letting the remaining sources of rent free (wages, and rent of land).Under Smith's point of view scarcity and poverty are historical and social problems, and their solutions are in history and in social interaction too.There are not worlds beyond every-day reality, as socialists made us to believe some time ago...just trade and division of labour and accumulation of capital, and so on. Let history and people surprise us. They will make the wealth, not the governments. The Smith system is open to history and change, and learnship, and only requires good foundations to secure an historical outcome of wealth.The world of today has institutions that were not in XVIIIth century: global financial institutions and spread trade agreements, that create barriers at some places and open gates at anothers. And now we have new constraints (the environment,..) and new key players (global corporations, ..). But this new scene only makes smaller the room of economic policy choices for latin american governments. At the core of the room which is remaining for them, the Smith's suggestions still have urgent and actual importance.Sad thing to recognize that in XXIst century latin america, we need to read a great book from XVIIIst century to find out solutions."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Adam Smith's WONs should be required reading / course work in high school.Long winded, yes, but also relevant.

We could only see every newspaper and magazines are talking on how to stimulate the consumption to boost the GDP; or government officials announce to increase government expenditure to stimulate the economy. It seems that the only question to economic growth depends on how much we spend. But if it is true, do it imply that we could be wealthy by just spend and spend and without further work?It is only after reading the first sentence of the book I remember the only truth that seems also to be forgotten by many people: it is only our labour that determine the wealth of nations, and also yourself. The book use a lot of illustrations to show how the division of labour could increase the production and it is on our self-interest to make exchange that give rise to division of labour, the theme that has mentioned by other reviewers and books.You should have read a lot of quotations from the book but you could not understand fully the central theme of the book by just few sentences.

From the very first chapter, Smith makes clear the genius of markets, the benefits of the division of labor, and how government intrusion upon &quot;perfect liberty&quot; creates economic inefficiencies. As the Industrial Revolution was in its infancy, Smith keenly perceived the theoretical framework for its future development: property rights, markets, free trade, and government non-intervention. These institutions allowed for unprecedented economic growth (there was more economic growth in the 19th century than in the preceeding 4000 years) and thus the sustainability of modern life.

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Adam Smith, a professor of moral philosophy in 18th century Scotland, was, perhaps, the World's first &quot;economist.&quot; One must remember that during Smith's era, there simply was no such thing as the formal study of economics, and it is this fact that makes &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; so interesting as it represents the first attempt, as far as I know, by an individual to explain the intricacies of money, capitalism, profit, etc., in a scientific manner. Truly, &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot; is to economics what Newton's Principia is to physics. It is not perfect, but considering the time in which it was written it was an amazing accomplishment.The reader will find discussions on a great many topics, but what is especially fascinating is the insight into 1700's Britain that is provided. Remember, this book was published in 1776. Smith even discusses the &quot;recent troubles with the colonies&quot;--America.It is emminently readable, though it becomes less so in certain sections--the digression on silver, for example. However, if one takes it slowly, then one can easily digest this feast of intellectual achievement in a relatively short time. Afterwards, the works of Ricardo, Marx, Keynes--to name a few--should be tackled.Again, highly recommended."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"If you have any interest at all in Economics, you'll want to go to the source. This is the source. Adam Smith lays the groundwork for the study of Economics in this very readable treatise.Though he is discussing 18th century Britain, the topics he discusses have direct analogs in the modern American economy. Taxes, trade, money, monopoly, tarrifs, and international trade balance are all tackled with aplomb.He really lays into Mercantilism and blasts the protectionism it engenders. Never anything less than a champion of the common man, Smith decrys monopolies and other taxes on those most unable to afford them. Though he seems to be a total free marketeer, he takes great pains to examine the types of taxes which would be useful and prudent for a government to levy.Once or twice may be fine, but Smith uses this construction for almost every sentence in the book. It is just a stylistic gripe, but the length and complexity of each sentence make digesting the information quite a bit more difficult than it otherwise could have been. I would not be at all disappointed to see this book translated to a more modern style.Again, if you're interested in Economics at all, this book is the place to start. There is so much good information here to be absorbed and pondered. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Nobody seriously involved in economics can do without this exhaustive work, originally published in five volumes as An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. This classic is a pragmatic and accessible milestone in the history of economics. Its author, Adam Smith, is woven into every economics textbook. However, Smith's theories, which today often are recounted mostly in fragments, frequently incorrectly, reveal their entire social and economic innovative power only in context. Smith burst onto the scene at a time when absolutist national states monopolized the world's precious metal reserves and tried to increase their own wealth through stringent export policies. These states were motivated by an entirely new concept about national wealth: that it stemmed from the work of the country's people, not from gold. Based on that idea, economic markets should balance themselves as if guided by an \\"invisible hand,\\" impelled by each individual's self-interest. The state has to provide only an orderly framework and specific public goods and services. Even though Smith's image of idealized economic and social harmony may have developed a few cracks over the course of time, his ideas have inspired many well-known economists during the past 250 years, including David Ricardo, Vilfredo Pareto, Friedrich August von Hayek and Milton Friedman. We highly recommend this seminal work."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Note that the complete edition of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is usually published in two volumes. The only exception I'm aware of is the University of Chicago Press' edition, which specifically states that it is \\"two volumes in one;\\" note that this means double-numbering, as the page numbers restart for the second \\"volume\\". The reason that it usually comes in two volumes is that it is a very, very long work, totaling over 1000 pages, and abridgement is apparently so common that it isn't stated directly by publishers. So, if the edition you're considering buying has less than 1000 pages, it is either only one of the two volumes, or it is abridged. It doesn't help that Amazon often provides the \\"inside pages\\" of a different edition from the one you're viewing, so if you want to check the table of contents to see just what's in a particular edition, you may be misled. If what you want is the complete work look for something that indicates that it is \\"unabridged\\"."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"After hearing about socialism from too many people who do not know and admit to not knowing what the word means, it makes sense to return to the sources and read. Start with Adam Smith. To be clear, Adam Smith is writing about capitalism, but how many of us know what that word means? Adam Smith is a good place to start learning before you start opining.This is not a simple read. The style is not as dense as was typical in 1776 but it can be just as elliptical.Interesting, although tangential is that the book mentions the American Revolution but only as an incidental backdrop to the more import issue of how and why money is created and moves. How well Mr Smith understood the then nascent industrial revolution is a hypotheses for a more learned reviewer than myself.Over all there is a great deal of repetition, and repetition with slight variation , punctuated by a scattering of tables, none of which printed as readable in my e version. This being said, Mr. Smith writes with a power granted to those who first encode a new world view. His is the more powerful because most of this work consists of a logical argument laid out in simple words.While many of us were exposed to the basics, capital, land labor, lowest cost, investment seeking the highest return, taxes bad (although not always) and so forth, I was struck by some of the lessor taught observations.Written in a time when there was no functioning concept of labor union, Mr. Smith warns that labor will loose against owners. The law (then) tended prevent labor from organizing and owners frequently socialized together, had common interests and therefor could be expected to overpower the labor virtually at will.Perhaps the single most telling comment, and the one most significant to today is his comment that when business interests attempt to make or influence public policy it is best to assume that they are lying or seeking action at the expense of public interest. Mr. Smith gives no third possibility.This is a great classic in western thought. I am tempted to say it should be mandatory. E editions certainly make it affordable. But For all you Wall Street occupiers and big wigs, Greek protesters, and Tea Party literalists, Obama haters, and anyone with a loud opinion on economics, this is a good place to start educating yourself. It might be nice to hear the shouting from some one who has done some homework."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"For anyone coming to Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations the first surprise is how readable it is. Famous classic of economic theory though it may be, this is no dry academic tome to be read only by people with a scholarly interest in economic history. There are no detailed tables of statistics of the sort one might expect to find in a modern book on the subject, and no mathematical analysis, indeed not very much quantitative information at all. Instead there is a long series of examples to explain such ideas as why it is more efficient to divide work among several specialists rather than have a complete task fulfilled by one person, or why slave labour is ultimately more expensive than paying free workers, even workers in cities like Boston or New York, where wages were far higher in Smith's time than those in his native Scotland.To illustrate the principle of the division of labour Smith discusses the manufacture of nails. Even a blacksmith -- skilled in working with a hammer but with no special training in nail making -- could not make more than a few hundred nails in a day, and those of poor quality. A specialist nail maker could make more than two thousand, but much greater improvements, both in quality and quantity, come from recognizing that even a task as apparently simple as manufacturing a nail can be broken up into smaller tasks: maintaining the fire at the right temperature, hammering the nail into the right shape, using a different tool to form the head, and so on.A popular edition of Wealth of Nations is inevitably abridged, as one can hardly expect to buy a complete scholarly edition for a price not much more than that of a novel. Complete editions are available as well, but they are much more expensive. With sensible editing, however, an abridged version can include as much of Smith's writing as the ordinary reader is likely to want, together with notes to explain points that will be obscure to the modern reader. In the Oxford World's Classics edition Kathryn Sutherland has made an excellent job of this, with notes that fill around a fifth of the length of the book."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"This is one of the truly great books produced by the Western world. Although much has been written on economics since, it considerably broadened my perspective to read it in the original.I can't help feeling that those who pan Wealth of Nations as an apology for exploitation simply haven't read it. That&#65533;s simply not what the book is about. For if you really do care about the underpriveleged masses -- and it's imminently clear that he really does -- then you better consciously organize your state in such a manner that money will flow naturally where it's most needed.I'd been told before I read it by several people that AS was, for example, apologizing for the East India Trading Company? Does his apology for EIT include the lengthy chapter which discuss in full detail how and why the East India Trading Company was responsible for an wide array of abuses in the Far East, and why no similar company would be legal if a society were fully moral and knew its own best interest?Nor is it a blind apology for laissez faire economics, though it does recommend non-intervention by the government insofar as that is possible. Still he fully recognizes the need for social services, rightly understood and rightly executed.In fact, I can't see how anyone who reads it could view it as an apology at all -- it's simply a statement of fact. Adam Smith is not the one carrying an ideology around on his shoulder. You may not like it that the world works this way -- that's another matter. But that IS the way it works... you are made to see that for yourself. It is not imposed on you as dogma.And after reading AS, I'm left feeling very happy that that's the way the world works.I think the most fundamental idea I am left with after reading all those pages, is that wealth is a verb, not a noun. Land and labor (i.e. food and farming) are the bottom line of economics. Treat your farmers well. Unjust practices in trading will ultimately backfire.The dynamo which runs the machine that creates wealth lies within each individual - it is the individual&#65533;s will to better his or her condition.

Mercantilism was a policy favoring exports and discouraging imports, while trying to maximize the silver and gold coins brought into the nation. Smith points out that this policy was self-defeating, that trade barriers invite retaliatory trade barriers. Mercantilism actually discouraged greater economic growth. Smith further argues that free trade, with a focus upon producing commodities and commanding more productive labor, is actually the more prosperous alternative. Besides many other things he says, he was in favor of an inheritance tax for the wealthy, opposed to taxes on wages, for generally minimizing all taxes as much as feasible, and repeats the idea that the wealthy have some greater responsibility to give back to their country in proportion to their wealth. In fact, it is in their self-interest to do so, to assure a prosperous and secure nation that protects their own wealth. The \\"invisible hand\\", which people are so fond of quoting - appears only once in this book (and thrice in all Smith's writings). It does suggest that it is through pursuing their own free, self-interest, that men render a greater prosperity to society.Analytical Review: Smith's argument, that free trade renders a more prosperous economy, is probably a good one. Capitalism has been a vehicle for generating greater wealth, but not always generating greater equality. It must be pointed out of course, that there rarely if ever has been a completely free market. I believe Marx's Communist radical alternative has not and will not supplant capitalism. What Marx understood, however, was a greater sense of social justice. Marx's writing is loaded with justified sentiment for the oppression of the working poor, and his labor theory of value in \\"Capital\\" goes a long way to augment and correct (but not entirely substitute) Smith's omissions. Smith had absorbed the very hierarchical, class-based values of his time. In several passages on slavery, for example, Smith's strongest condemnation is to call it an \\"unfortunate\\" institution. What Smith understood better was that humans are self-interested and will prosper more generally through a free market. But Smith also opposed the power of monopolies, and believed some provision should be made for the poor, and that plays into Marx's thought. Marx had greater insight into the abusive dominance of monopoly capitalism, and its often cold-shouldered indifference to the inequities it produced. In a nutshell, Smith gave us the wisdom that the free market is better, but Marx has given us the corrective that a fair and just use of capital is a better (and yes - you might add even democratic of Christian) ideal. A free-market economy, with some corrective for social justice and common welfare, is my view of a compromise between them. My advice - we have much to learn from both Smith and Marx, if only critics would often read them before speaking too brashly."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Out of necessity, whenever an original work is \\"abridged,\\" the abridger must make a value judgment regarding what in the original work is worthwhile (and will be preserved), and what is not of relevance, and will thus be discarded and placed beyond your view.

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself.

First, it is truly \\"complete and unabridged.\\" So, you get the real deal, all thousand pages of it. Second, it includes Edwin Cannan's summaries in the margin that assist in reading this thick tome. Cannan also provides an enlarged index that serves as a quick reference. And third, the Introduction by Robert Reich and the Commentary at the end by R.H. Campbell and A.S. Skinner are very helpful in better understanding this work. You may get more out of those two sections than Smith's thousand pages of writing.This book was written before the field of economics theory existed. As a result, Smith's writings do not include such common words as: economics, recession, expansion, contraction, inflation, GDP, common stocks, and securities. Thus, his writings has no resemblance to modern economics commentary. Given that, it is challenging interpreting what he is saying in modern context.Smith could not be an economist since the latter profession did not exist he had to be something else: a moral philosopher. In the 18th century if you studied hard sciences you were a natural philosopher. And, if you studied anything else you were a moral philosopher. Such a broad base binomial taxonomy of all intellectual scientific fields had great advantages. This is because moral philosophy included all the fields that today are pretty separate such as: logic, rhetoric, psychology, sociology. On a more granular level moral philosophy as advanced by Smith included microeconomics, macroeconomics, international economics, behavioral finance, international economics, etc... Nowadays, all those fields are fairly demarcated.In view of the above, Smith's intellectual legacy is in part timeless. This is because he was concerned about the speculations that went inside individuals' minds just as he was concerned about the productivity of labor, small businesses, and the economy at large. His cogitations covered the entire fields of behavioral finance, macro and macroeconomics.Smith's thinking was far more complex and nuanced than the ones of his libertarian followers such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Alan Greenspan. They all missed more than half of Smith's message. That included Smith support for labor unions (at a time when labor abuse was rampant), government regulations including very tight regulation of banking. Smith also was opposed to the might of large corporation as he was suspicious of their collaborating to depress wages and their colluding on prices before laws banned such practices. Thus, Smith was far more the precursor of Keynes than Milton Friedman. Yet, this is not what the economic profession conveys to the outside world.Smith's posterity and prescience are second to none. Unfortunately, his writing in a contemporary setting is unreadable. For my part, I got a lot more about Smith's thoughts from reading digested modern interpretations from others than from reading Smith's own writing. In this regard, I recommend three books. James BuchanThe Authentic Adam Smith: His Life and Ideas (Enterprise)is excellent and solely focused on Adam Smith and his writings. Arthur HermanHow the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in Itcovers the entire Scottish Enlightenment. And, John CassidyHow Markets Fail: The Logic of Economic Calamitiescriticizes the entire field of economics.

This is the predominant reason for reading this book. Secondarily, to trace the development of economic thought. Adam Smith was one of the greatest pioneers in the science of economics. There are areas where we now know he was in error. Science content of modern economics is more profound than most observers are willing to admit. If you just want to learn about economics you would be well served to first read more current economists. In modern times, Milton Friedman has played a similar role. Again there is that radical urgency to place Friedman in the conservative pile before they decide the correctness of his thought. The legacy of critically reviewing the errors of democratic governments as well as repressive governments will hopefully be kept alive and well. Much is left to be done-- even in the USA. A very exciting question remains what happens when the repressive leaders of China realize that good economic policy and political freedom are so deeply intertwined that there repression is truly doomed. Will the end be destructive or positive. It is surely coming.Similarly in the USA and other developed nations, as more people learn economics on the path to greater involvement in business, investing and entrepreneurship one would expect increasing rebellion against the reckless of policies by politicians and the uninformed contentions of the media. There are many helpful books some I have recently reviewed that can broaden ones understanding of governmental failings in economic policy.While everybody would benefit from more knowledge about economics, the basic shortcomings of the media and politicians is of critical concern. It is no surprise that reviewers of economics related books have to rush to place any book either in the conservative pile or the liberal pile.

It is for people who have an interest in classical political economy and its relation to the marginalist tradition. What I have attempted to do is take a critical approach toward contemporary mainstream economics based on what is written in the Wealth of Nations. I hope you enjoy it, and I look forward to constructive criticism and debate.Adam Smith has had by far the greatest general impact on the formation of economic theory of all economic thinkers since - it was he who cast the mold within which the future of economic thought would take place. What I believe has been neglected in most accounts of Smith's contributions to economic theory, however, is that in his attempt at establishing a unified theory of political economy he was instead responsible for developing the framework from which two conflicting theoretical approaches towards economic analysis would later be derived - one with focus on market relations and the other with focus on the relations of production. This marks the beginnings of what has been, in my opinion, a major inconsistency in the development of economic thought - the incompatibility of the former tradition of economic analysis, when taken in isolation from the latter, with the main pivot of Smith's theoretical justification for capitalist development in the \`Wealth of Nations'. The separation of these two areas, it will be argued, has been the result of the further development of certain aspects of Smiths core theoretical insights to the exclusion of deeper inquiry into an understanding of his attempted explanation of their origin and nature. Its product has been a superficial understanding of economic phenomena under capitalist relations responsible for the endless stream of conclusions that manage to both be incompatible with one another and claim immutability. Its practical impact has been to legitimize a system of ideas, culminating in the \`discovery' of universal economic laws detached from and functioning independent of social relations, that has fettered the further cultural and political progression of humanity through the intellectual impoverishment of human life.----------The \`Wealth of Nations', though it was overwhelmingly concerned with practical application and the specific policies of its time, has not cast such a long shadow on the progression of economic thought simply by merit of its attacks on the effects of Mercantilist economic policy. There were political economists before and after Smith who had carried out similar attacks, as is shown by the fact that Smith derived his argument against Mercantilist protectionist policy from Hume. Instead, the major impact of the \`Wealth of Nations' on economic thought has been its attempted establishment of a theoretical framework in which individual self interest was the driving force of an economic system that was propelled by its own momentum and functioned according to its own laws. In Schumpeter's words, it put forth the major assertion that \\"the free interaction of individuals produces not chaos but an orderly pattern that is logically determined\\". This orderly pattern was, for Smith, the tendential movement of the market prices of commodities toward their natural values. The major theoretical task of the \`Wealth of Nations' was an unveiling of the mechanisms that function to ensure this continuous movement of all nominal values toward their natural values within the framework of the free interaction of individuals. In this sense, Smith's argument against the Mercantilist system of political economy was, for all intensive purposes, an application ofhis general theory of natural value; there existed a \`natural' level to which any artificial adjustment in the quantity of money would adjust. The thrust of Smith's critiques on the effects of the Mercantilist doctrine are to be interpreted in the context of this distinction between natural and artificial value, within which its effects are extended beyond simple redundancy.Smith began his theory of value and price determination with a distinction between what he called the natural value of commodities and their market price, or their nominal and real price. The market price of a commodity is the price at any given moment of time in which commodities are exchanging for one another. Market prices fluctuate as a reaction to myriad natural and manmade phenomena and are in turn regulated by the interplay of supply and demand. If a drought adversely affects the yield of corn for a given period it would be the cause of a reduction in the supply of corn in relation to the level of effectual demand and a subsequent increase in market price; if it for some reason becomes fashionable to wear pink overcoats, assuming of course that individuals in a given society desire to be fashionable, then the effectual demand for pink overcoats will increase in relation to available supply and consequently so will the market price of pink overcoats. Value, on the other hand, is the point around which these movements, or vibrations, of price gravitate. Smith believed that individual commodities will rarely, if ever, exchange at their value due to constant changes and/or disruptions in the conditions of any given market. The hypothetical; point at which value and price meet may be understood as the more familiar concept of equilibrium; the point that competition would yield in the long run through the interplay of supply and demand on the market.The importance of these two concepts for Smith's theoretical framework was the effect that competition had on individual producers to cause the prices of commodities to always be in tendential movement toward their value. Essentially competition, which was restricted under the auspices of the \`Commercial System', was the force acting on individual producers which would ensure, in the long run, that commodities would be bought and sold at precisely the amount required to produce them - their value. There are two main justifications for the desirable nature of this process. On the one hand Smith believed that when prices were at their value the entire economic system was in turn at the highest point of efficiency and equality it could possibly be. On the other hand, Smith believed that this movement would ultimately benefit the mass of people with lower prices, which would continue to decrease in proportion to the advances in the conditions of production of commodities. Competition would in turn pressure individual producers to apply these cost lowering technical advances to the production process because of the need to reduce the value of their commodities in order to command a larger share of their respective markets, hence allowing for a higher rate of profit and the ability to continually reinvest their capital to repeat the same process indefinitely. Thus, it was on this tendency of competition to move the prices of commodities toward their values, and in time to reduce their values, that Smith's entire justification for the elimination of Mercantilist protection and privilege in favor of a system based on the free interaction of individuals ultimately rested. Not only was the Mercantilist doctrine of money manipulation redundant, but the means by which it attempted to achieve this ultimate redundancy prevented the functioning of extremely powerful mechanisms that Smith believed ensured the long run reduction in values of commodities - the betterment of the masses of people through the further development of the productive forces of society. As Schumpeter described: \\"It is the cheap cloth, the cheap cotton and rayon fabric, boots, motorcars and so on that are the typical achievements of capitalist production, and not as a rule improvements that would mean much to the rich man. Queen Elizabeth owned silk stockings. The capitalist achievement does not typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in bringing them within the reach of the factory girls in return for steadily decreasing amounts of effort\\"Contemporary mainstream economics, a position held by the neoclassical tradition, though seemingly rejecting value as an \`economic' concept, has in fact incorporated selective parts of what has been its derivative into their theory of prices in market economies. This has been accomplished by simply supplanting the tension between value and price with what is their emergent concept of equilibrium, within which the whole of their analysis of price formation takes place. Within their framework, though for all intense and purposes similar, the nature of equilibrium, being for Smith a hypothetical position of the meeting of value and price, thus takes on an entirely different meaning. They essentially adopted a view of equilibrium as being determined by the equalization of the supply of commodities with their respective demand, the signals to which occur in exchange relations on the market. There is no contrast on which Smith placed prime importance between the 'natural' value determined in production to which all \`artificial' prices determined in exchange are constantly tending, but simply \`equilibrium' prices as given by the aggregation of subjective judgments of individuals - thus making the interaction of market mechanisms with man, which Smith attributed solely to the measuring rod of \`market' price, the explanation of value a. In this regard, 'value' is transformed into a function of the influence of demand upon costs of s well production - more specifically on the last fragment of want not satisfied - and ultimately purported to be a subjective calculation of individuals. Prices are now the reflection of the interaction between these marginal rates of substitution of individual consumers and marginal costs of production of producers - Marginal substitution as the demand schedule of individuals which, operating under the \`law' of diminishing marginal utility, decreases for every increase in the price of a commodity and increases for every decrease in the price of a commodity; Marginal cost as the supply schedule of producers which, under conditions of diminishing returns, decreases as more units are produced.The effect of this change, curiously enough, was largely on the classical theories of distribution. By shifting the focus of an inquiry into the forces acting on price away from the realm of production to the realm of exchange, essentially making the regulating force of price the subjective valuations of commodities and their impact on the costs of producing those commodities, it rendered meaningless what was of prime importance for Ricardo, and Marx thereafter - distribution between economic classes and its deterministic effects on the outcome of exchange. Theories of distribution had formerly attempted to explain the division of value between different social classes in a given society. Smith himself identified the \`three great classes' of society to \\"which the price of every commodity ultimately resolved\\" as being landowners, laborers, and manufactures - it was Ricardo, and more extensively Marx afterward, that showed the conditions in which this division of value between them took place was located in the realm of production before exchange took place. Gracious as they were in escaping them, these questions of class and the division of value between them became for economists not so much irrelevant in a greater sense, but \`outside' of what economic analysis set out to answer as they were now \`outside' of the theoretical determination of price. There was no longer a separation between exchange value and use value, but the derivation of exchange value from use value (utility). Distribution therefore became determined not from conditions of production but from exchange relations.This subtle maneuver of redefining equilibrium, or we should say using it for different purposes, served to retain positive aspects of Smith's analysis to the exclusion of what the logical extension of his system by further inquiry unveiled: It ultimately served the exact same purpose of having competition operate to tend prices to a point of efficiency and equality, where things are sold at precisely what they are worth (now subjectively determined by some feat of aggregating what occurs on the individual level of optimizing preferences), thus allowing for the maintenance of the virtuous development that Smith associated with the free interaction of individuals and the discarding of the negative features that became associated with Marx's later \`socially necessary labor time'. Not only were the later logical extensions of Ricardo and Marx that spoiled the virtuous cycle done away with in a single stroke, but extremely important aspects of Smith - from the identification and examination of the interaction between social classes to the objective nature of value existing in production - were all safely brushed aside.The vicious circle, however, eventually caught up with utopia: the attempted formalization of this interplay between market mechanisms and man as both the measuring rod of and the explanation for value brought an inconsistency: initial distribution continued to claim overarching priority in the formation of price. The expression of utility that was the interaction of man with the market could not possibly be based on subjective measurements of value, but on the actual purchasing power which translated into market pull. Thus, the independent postulation of some pre-existing income level or distribution was necessary for the internal consistency of any formal demonstration of price determination based on marginal utility. Essentially, This is the root of what will later be shown to be the major contradiction in the superficial extension of Adam Smith; it essentially revolves around the assumption most fundamental to all conceptual frameworks, that question supposedly \`outside' of the economists' domain - value.--------As Smith believes that the market price of commodities, regulated by their value, is established by the forces of supply and demand, he in turn identifies the natural price of commodities, the actual substance of value, as being equal to the labor necessary to produce them. He holds the latter to be the case because he believes that a commodity is essentially worth the amount of labor it is able to command on the market - if the producer of X enters into exchange relations with the producer of Y, and the production of X requires 10 hours or labor whereas the production of Y requires 5 hours of labor, then, in the hypothetical instance of commodities exchanging at their value, the producer of X will exchange one unit of X for two units of Y. Already within the beginning of his inquiry is the major problem, and what in the end removes all unity from his whole conceptual framework, to be found. It arises from the fact that Smith ultimately merges his explanation of the substance of value into what he before held as distinct, market relations - for what Smith is now basing his explanation of value upon is here the extent to which labor can be commanded in exchange, and not the \\"so much less labour than before\\" that makes up the substance of exchange value, or the labor embodied within commodities in the process of production.Let us examine this issue further. Smith, in holding the labor commanded by commodities as the explanation of their value, is essentially making what amounts to the same claim that it is the labor necessary to produce commodities that is the determinant of their value ONLY under conditions in which the whole produce of labor belongs to the laborer. Under these conditions Smith sees no contradiction because there is none; it is only after the fact that this separation comes to play a destructive role. We can easily see why Smith thought this to be the case - when a producer of a product exchanges this product, in which only his labor was used to produce, with an individual who has done the same, the labor which each of these commodities command on the market is equivalent to the labor embodied within them. There is X amount of labor embodied in the commodity, and the laborer, appropriating the whole product, thus exchanges it and receives X amount of materialized labor in return for it. Confusion sets in on Smith when he attempts to extend the labor commanded theory of value to instances in which labor is not the sole 'factor' ofproduction, but land and capital as well. He runs head on into what is seemingly a major problem - if labor does not appropriate the whole of its produce, but a portion is divided between either rent to a landlord or profit to a capitalist (manufacturer, in his words), then labor commanded is no longer equal to the price of the commodity it produces. The price of commodities on the market will in general be higher than the exchange value of labor. As Smith is well aware that he must have an explanation of value consistent with \\"the three great classes of society\\" for the functionality of his entire schemata, if only because the appropriation of the full product of labor by the laborer was \\"at end...long before the most considerable improvements were made in the productive powers of labour\\", he is now seemingly forced to discard the applicability of the labor necessary to produce commodities as an explanation of value to a society in which labor is not the sole \`factor of production' of commodities.Instead of further unraveling this contradiction, the task of which was left to Ricardo, and, more extensively Marx, Smith adopts what is now called a \`cost of production' theory of value - essentially, as Smith sees the necessity of the incorporation of \\"the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land\\" into his conceptual apparatus, he simply makes the \\"natural value\\" to which all \\"market prices are constantly gravitating\\" equivalent to the \`returns' to land, labor, and capital based on the observation that it is into these \\"three parts\\" which \\"the price of every commodity finally resolves itself\\". Of course, \`value' is in this sense superfluous - simply identifying that rentiers, capitalists, and laborers all receive a portion of the value of commodities does not serve as an explanation of where the value of these commodities derives; but, then again, this is our problem, is it not? We can now see the starting point of superficial extensions - of profit simply being another form of wages for inspection and direction, risk or abstinence, which becomes plucked out of its proper context as being linked to the value of the stock employed. From whence does this value come - the sky? Thus, we are yet again gifted with another gem in the \`production possibility frontier' of neoclassical economics - in which there can be no mistaking the superficiality of \`switching between capital and labor'. Neither can the perspective required for the exposition of such insight be mistaken.It is in the evasion of one contradiction which Smith naturally becomes entangled in another, his recognition of this being doubtful. The contradiction materializes when Smith moves on to his analysis of the \`Wages of Labour', where he correctly maintains that returns to land and capital are derivative from labor and labor alone. Smith thus becomes his own greatest enemy, for he has now, quite explicitly, singlehandedly refuted both his own labor commanded theory of value and his cost of production theory of value. The only unifying force, and luckily for Smith what remains implicit throughout his whole analysis of the division of labor, is a labor embodied theory of value - that \`returns' to land and capital are not returns at all, but appropriation from the labor which they employ. Thus we have come to one major critique levied against Smith by Ricardo - the division of value between classes in no way refutes the principle that value is derived from labor.There are two rreasons why I believe that Smith did not realize his self contradictions: first, this contradiction was spelled out quite plainly, whereas the former was not. It thus makes little sense for Smith to have not made any attempt to remedy it as he did the former from which it came; second, and more importantly, the so called cost of production theory of value was, for all intents and purposes, consistent with his notion of tendential movements of price toward \`value', much in the same way as neoclassical equilibrium theory is functional solely by merit of the identification of a given supply. What it was not consistent with, which will be shown later, was his theory of the division of labor and the increases in productivity that it allowed as a function of decreasing value. It is from the combination of what Smith, in arguing with himself, found to be dead ends with his concept of the division of labor, on which the development of the former aspect of his inquiry relied, that is at the core my claims.---The Division of Labor---In sweeping away the Mercantilist doctrine, Smith put forth a new answer to the question of how to increase the wealth of nations; that it was be found in the realm of production, more specifically in finding a mechanism the influence of which caused improvements in the conditions of production. These improvements were the development of the productive forces which, by reducing the amount of labor required to produce them, caused a reduction in the value of commodities. Smith identified this mechanism as the division of labor.The division of labor, however, did not serve only to reduce the value of material output - it both fostered the growth and application of specialized knowledge to further innovate the production process. Innovations which were responsible for the introduction of new products and the increased efficiency of the production of existing products were the result of the division of labor. This is because a specialized producer would be more far more likely to posses, or have a much greater possibility of obtaining, the requisite knowledge to improve a product and themethod by which that product was produced than a person who was forced to spread his or her time across the production of many different products. The mechanism of the division of labor, in turn, was identified by Smith as being a function of the volume of exchange between individuals. He believed that when people regularly engaged in exchange relations they would become inclined to specialize in production - i.e. spontaneously form a division of labor. This is because with every increase in specialization there is in turn an increase in the volume of exchange due to a subsequent decrease in the self sufficiency of individuals. If an individual who formerly produced the whole of his or her necessary product specializes in the production of one of these products, he or she must then engage in exchange relations to obtain the rest. The growth in the volume of exchange then served to expand the division of labor, which itself served to expand the volume of exchange as it allowed for the individual the ability \\"to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labor\\" and therefore \\"encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation\\".Thus, as exchange gave rise to the division of labor, and the volume of exchange was in turn directly influenced through the division of labor, the result was an increasing hold of the division of labor on society. The division of labor, then, functioned as a positive feedback mechanism. There was, however, a natural limit to the internal expansion of the division of labor. Smith identified this limit as the extent of the market, or the area in which exchange relations were able to occur. The essential notion behind this concept was that the extent of specialization between producers depended on the mass of producers available to specialize. Smith describes this phenomena with an identification of the further integration of the division of labor in areas that contain a large mass of people, such as \` great towns', as opposed to a small population, such as the countryside.IIAs Smith held that exchange was the driving force behind the expanse of the division of labor, and that this exchange was limited only by the extent of the market, he identified the elimination of spatial and temporal barriers - modern day \`transaction costs' - as the means by which exchange was able to be carried out in a widened area, and hence the means throughwhich the division of labor was able to more deeply integrate itself. This is because these eliminations served to open up further avenues of exchange between individuals and, flirting with their propensities to \\"truck, barter, and exchange\\", led to further expanse of the division of labor. Thus, Smith identified the emergence of commercial civilizations, or, as he says, the first \\"civilized\\" nations, in regions that had fewer barriers to exchange than others. As far as how this reduction of temporal and spatial barriers was accomplished, Smith was rather ambiguous. However, it seems fairly evident that he viewed the division of labor itself as the force that would accomplish this task in the long run. This is because Smith identified the division of labor as not only the instigator of increased material productivity but as the force through which innovation was fostered.But had a division of labor not already existed? And if so, why did the division of labor neither perpetuate itself as Smith had envisioned nor serve to harness the application of the creative potential of individuals to widen the market? Smith's answer to this was that the division of labor that existed, because it was not a system of free enterprise but a manifestation of Mercantilist doctrine, created an atmosphere of monopoly and special privilege that restricted or distorted the forces that signaled the spontaneous ordering of production. In a system of free enterprise, competition between individual producers would both incentivize the actual applications of innovations that the granting of special privileges and subsidies deinsentivized and would eliminate monopoly control because any sector with an above average profit rate would attract production that was formerly involved in a sector with a lower rate of profit, and therefore also ensuring the important movement of price toward value. The regulating force of competition was the main ingredient necessary to bring to life the positive feedback mechanism of the division of labor. Protection was preventing the functioning of the division of labor which, per contra to the conscience construction of Mercantilist policy, functioned by merit of a mechanism which was independent of the conscience design of man.It is in this context of Mercantilist protection policies that Smith's remarks on the interests of manufactures being at odds with that of society as a whole should be interpreted 12. For Smith, the secret of the wealth of nations was to be found in the positive feedback mechanism embedded in the link between the division of labor and the extent of the market: an increase in the division of labor lowers costs, raises real income, and extends the market, thus leading back to an increase in the division of labor and an increase in the extent of the market. Smith held that exchange between individual producers regulated by competition would cause the materialization and expansion of this virtuous cycle. It is in this sense that exchange is considered the driver of growth: it enlarges the pool in which the division of labor exists. The entirety of modern exchange based growth theory is thus derived from Adam Smith. Any argument put forth that identifies \`barriers' or \`limitations' on the ability to exchange being the immediate cause of poverty is thus derived from Adam Smith. Not only that, but Smith also implies that technological innovation is a factor endogenous to production based on a spontaneous division of labor. As technological progress is the long run mechanism through which temporal and spatial barriers are eliminated, not only does short run poverty due to the inability to exchange in this way derive from Smith, but the long run increase in the standard of living of the masses as well. The whole of contemporary mainstream economics has been an attempted formalization of the requirements needed for Smith's division of labor to function. This is the power that lies within the first twenty pages of the \`Wealth of Nations'.IIIBut it is precisely in this moment of glory where the disconnect occurs. For the role attributed to the division of labor is inexorably tied to the notion that labor is the \\"real measure of exchangeable value of all commodities\\". Redefining value as being determined in exchange contradicts the whole foundation of the Smith's division of labor: if the functioning of the division of labor is to reduce the value of commodities through paradigm shifts in how they are produced in the long run, in their conditions of production, then it is within the production process alone that an explanation of value must rest. Smith himself, in putting forth the labor commanded theory of value, maintained consistency with his theory of the division of labor to the extent that individual producers appropriated their own product. As this was incapable of being extended to capitalist production, Smith then switched to a cost of production theory of value in order to escape the trap he had laid for himself. However, as we have shown, this theory of value was not a theory of value at all and thus was incapable of explaining anything other than showing a hypothetical point at which value and price would be equal - it was therefore incompatible with the dynamic nature of the division of labor. It is from the latter which contemporary equilibrium analysis has its origins, and, quite naturally, why equilibrium analysis in neoclassical economics had also been doomed to a static existence: dynamics could only be incorporated as an element disturbing equilibrium, whereas within the whole of the operation of the division of labor equilibrium is only a fleeting moment of a vibration which is in ceaseless fluctuation. Smith, despite his fumbling, maintained conceptual unity because the whole of his division of labor was based around an environment wherein labor commanded was for all intents and purposes equivalent to labor embodied - or a world where the laborer appropriated the whole of his or her produce. His inclusion of the pin factory example, while highlighting the increase of productivity it allowed, served to hide the fact that this productivity was a function of a specific explanation of value. This dualistic nature, or perhaps the high degree of ambiguity, in which Smith conducted his analysis of the division of labor therefore turned out to be both his weakest and strongest point.This dualism carried on to his heirs, however it now took different form. In adopting the marginalist approach to value, it manifested itself in an attempt to explain the functioning of an economic system according to individual self interest as a function of profit on the basis, or perspective, of individuals who have left the production process, or left the process in which material objects are produced as a prerequisite for profit. Exchange, without production, yields no profit; no growth. I may trade you nine apples for one of your apples, a deal in which you have convinced me beyond doubt is best for both of us, and in the end we still have between us ten apples. This attempted escape, however, was not an escape at all but instead served to shift the search of error and inconsistency to the confines of marginalism, and, as we have shown that it was a purely exchange driven explanation of value, financial speculative excess naturally became the issue. For where there is no production process, or when value is explained in the ct the value of which is rooted in exchange becomes more a function of the degree to which people are holding it - hoarding it - as concerns scarcity than the aggregation of marginal propensities. The recent popularity of 'behavioral' economics corresponds to this identification."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"ALWAYS GO TO THE SOURCE!!! Anyone contemplating outsourced jobs and how our economy has sunk so low should read this book before handing a copy of it to their Congressman. You'd be amazed to discover how many of the MBA-Ph.D Economist drones quoting Adam Smith in support of so-called \\"free trade\\" policies have never read it (almost none). Although Mr. Smith supports open trade, what is being called \\"free trade\\" by modern politicians and multinational corporations who quote Adam Smith in support of their rape/pillage/burn of America bears no relation whatsoever to the policies Adam Smith wrote in support of. Adam Smith DESPISED big business and wrote his great economic tome in support of SMALL to MID-SIZED businesses ... the kind controlled by a real person and not an over-payed CEO and unaccountable board of directors. Pay special attention to Smith's comments about the herring subsidies (Monsanto, big oil), taxes (a necessary evil), and corporate monopolies (Walmart/big banks - whenever they get together the common man is worse off).Talking about this book at cocktail parties where MBA-drones congregate is great fun ... kind of like taking the Bible and completing the out-of-context biblical quotes spewed out by radical right-wing Christians (they say \\"woman obey your husband\\" and you finish the biblical passages in context and say something like \\"put your wife above all others ... and husbands don't be vexatious to your wife.\\"). Makes the person mis-quoting the great work look like a donkey and you look like Stephen Hawkings.Caveat ... although this book is understandable because Smith ties abstract economic pricipals to ordinary commodities such as herring and corn, it is best read in small, digestible chunks due to the archaic 18th-century English.

Reading the observations of someone who was a contemporary of America's founding fathers, but not one of them, gave me a new perspective on the 1700s. Passing references to the vast, but stagnant wealth of China, as well as to colonial enterprises from South America to Asia, add historical flavor to what could have been a dry summary of economic theory, but is instead a rich and colorful exposition of the world as it was.Having just spent some time in Manila earlier this year visiting historical sites and museums, I was intrigued to read about Spain's \\"Acapulco ships\\" that carried silver and other commodities from Mexico across the vast Pacific to the Philippines. Indeed, over and over I found myself putting my finger between the pages so I could daydream for a few minutes, imagining Spanish galleons loaded with treasure, or European merchants bartering and haggling. I suppose a vivid imagination helps to make any book more interesting, but this book in particular lends itself to such flights of fancy.The English of the mid- to late 1700s is not exactly the same as ours today, but it's close enough that few people will have any difficulty with the book. There are a lot of references to weights and measures of gold, silver, corn and other commodities, and their relative value to one another. Frankly, after the first few such references, I simply began skipping over them. Readers who enjoy playing with numbers in their heads may prefer to read those items carefully and playfully -- but I suspect most folks will skip across them as quickly as possible just as I did. It's not the specific values and figures that make this book so important (or enjoyable), but it's ideas about how capital flows, accumulates, is put to productive use and so on.Read this book and gain a new appreciation for the wisdom of the past, and you may also find yourself noting how ideas apply so directly to issues in today's headlines.

We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love and never talk to them of our own necessities, but to their advantages. The real price of everything, what everything really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the trouble and toil of acquiring it. Smith contends that there are only 2 ways countries can become wealthy: (1). Their citizens being good savers and then invest these savings toward productive ends; and (2). By way of trade. National wealth grows when things and money are circulated and exchanged to the most remote corners of the globe.

When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day. Just don't start reading economic books from this book. It would be hard to understand. It assumes that you already have economics background, i.e. have studied economics for a few years.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"I appreciate that for most readers, Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations is going to be a deadly dull read, although I think this is a pity. With a little discipline, I think that the erudite reader will take away many enriching (yes, pun intended) lessons from Smith's ground breaking treatise. For me, as a business professional and business student (I have an MBA), the Wealth of Nations was a Damascus Road experience.I think there are several myths about economics that are exploded by a first hand reading of Wealth of Nations. Many supply side economists eagerly tout Smith's \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor in advocating deregulated markets, but in my view, Smith took a balanced and integrated approach in analyzing the supply and demand sides of national economy. In the first chapter Smith notes that national wealth is the production of labor. This has dual implications in that production is the creation of supply, but the labor force consumes that supply by trading the resulting wealth. These are two sides to the same coin, &amp; therefore indivisible. Also in the first chapter, Smith notes that increasingly sophisticated economies will employ a division of labor to increase production efficiency, which is another concept that necessarily integrates supply and demand, production and consumption.Smith devotes quite a bit of time lamenting governmental intrusion into economics by way of regulation. However, he does not condemn government regulation per se, but make very specific criticisms against those state regulatory polices that tend to create monopolies. None of his comments are strictly political in nature. Smith's analysis is purely based on economics &amp; the efficient allocation of capital. He views the enemy not as the King's ministers, but rather the monopolies that were so prevalent during the 18th century mercantile system.On a related note, I think it is clear that Smith would be horrified by the military centric nature of many post-industrial economies today. He notes that a standing army is a drain on national wealth. Essentially the state is paying workers not to work, but rather to stand ready to fight. I suspect that Smith would view large state defense budgets as being most closely akin to a transfer payment made by a welfare state. For those who will scream invective at me for saying this, please remember that the largest item on any defense budget by far, is payroll.Finally, as an amateur historian, I enjoyed the brief glimpse into what life was like in the 18th century Empire from an economist's perspective. Various parts of his book review social welfare systems of his day, as well as international banking, political economy, agrarian systems, and life in general."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Its a bit difficult to make a comment on the writtings for validity of Adam Smith.

I disliked that the book did not note that it wasn't the original text, for that reason I give it a 4."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"A couple of years ago I went to a local bookstore determined to read 'Capital' as well as 'Wealth of Nations,' but since there wasn't a copy of the latter available at the time, I picked up the former, waded through all three volumes (which were very hard and took me 18 months), then went back to Smith. This is a review of the Modern Library hardcover edition, which I ordered here at Amazon.com.Let it be said right off the bat that the big thing Marx gets trashed for has roots right here in the 'W of N:' namely, the Labor Theory of Value. Both Volume One of 'Capital' and 'W of N' spend the first 100 pages or so going over it. Both refer back to it constantly in later pasages. And both must be taken off the table without it. The LTV boils down to this: all value is created by people working and producing goods and services that other people need and/or want. Furthermore, they must produce these goods and services at at least the average level of productivity and at the appropriate level of demand. Otherwise you're working either harder or more easily for your cut of the national pie than you otherwise would. The LTV is so straightforward and intuitive you'd think there wouldn't be much of an argument.The one thing Smith stresses throughout the book is the need for what he calls 'perfect liberty,' where everyone is allowed to buy and sell what they want from where ever they'd like. With this, resources would be diverted to where they needed to be as quickly as possible so people would stop wasting their time WORKING (see how the LTV operates here?) on things that should be made elsewhere.It's important to understand that neither the words 'capital' nor 'capitalist' ever occur in this work. This is very important because both words carry baggage Smith would break no bread with. In fact, the main bad guys in this work are the very people we would call 'capitalist' today. They subvert Parliament through bribery and intimidation, protect their own interests at the expense of everybody else in society, and raise unholy hell when workers try to form unions. All the while, of course, they form unions amongst themselves with the express purpose of stabbing the rest of us in the back.Sound familiar?Let me give you a modern example of how desperately we need American economists to actually pick up and read this book, as opposed to just talking about what a good boy Adam Smith was. Contrary to the propaganda we're getting out of our media, alternative sources of energy are now ready for prime time. There's nothing the internal combustion engine can do that hydrogen fuel cells can't do better. The price of solar cells has been dropping like a rock for years. And wind power is now the second cheapest source of energy after dirty coal. All we need to do is divert all that money we use to protect our oil resources into building up the economy of scale for these products (i.e. reducing the amount of WORK necessary to build each unit; this is the LTV lurking around again), and turn all these into cheap bulk commodities. We'll also need to use this money to build up the infrastructure necessary to safely deliver and store hydrogen. Then, after these (admittedly) high entry costs (i.e. expenditures of LABOR), we'll have access to unlimited, clean, and cheap sources of energy. The nonsense we have instead, which came to serious crises in 2001 in California with the impeachable collusion of the Bush administration, has nothing to do with Adam Smith's great work. I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired of socializing the risk while privatizing the profits for this industry. Our current urge to go to war with Iraq precisely reflects the urge of 18th century statesmen to protect the interest of the mercantilist (capitalist!!) masters. This was a tragedy Smith covers quite extensively.As an added bonus he's a great read. After working so hard on Marx I was very happily surprised.Karl Marx brought the LTV to a fine polish, going beyond Adam Smith and showing how it translates into the average rate of profit, interest rates, standard of living, etc. He picked up where Smith left off. Also, using the weapon of dialectical materialism (i.e. the logic of motion and change -- the true heart of Marxism), Marx was able to show how capitalism, in fact, negates private property. It would have turned us all into slaves decades ago if not for the better angels or our nature."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Look at the bottom of the Wikipedia page, there are links to the unabridged ebook for free in both kindle and the standard format (as the copyright is long expired)."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"This huge, collector's edition is HEAVY, the font is small, and there is a ridiculous amount of margin area for writing.

In a nutshell, it details the mechanisms by which personal liberty -- accompanied by personal responsibility and a just system of government -- make nations, and the individuals who live in them, wealthy. I had a Marxist professor who did not like Adam Smith because Marxist theory prefers to emphasize class warfare, while Smith is saying that everyone is capable of providing for themselves and the less the government interferes, the better off we all are. Many conservatives, meanwhile, like Adam Smith because they seem to perceive a \\"survival of the fittest\\" philosophy in his works.

This is List's core argument and not to be confused with the &quot;infant industry&quot; characterization. Smith's work is of course a classic.

Please get the complete audio, and that's why.This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to listen it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get the complete unabridged audio version of this book."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"This 18th Century book is a well-reasoned broadside against mercantilism and state-run monopolies.

Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nation\\" establishes the theoretical framework for Capitalism covering every aspect of an economic system that has created the highest standard of living known to man. Adam Smith shows how the interplay between labor, stock and land serve to generate the wealth of a nation. The keys to wealth are freedom, productive men, productive stock, and productive land. Smith says that the role of government is threefold - to protect the land from foreign invasion, enforce contracts and maintain a physical and legal infrastructure that promotes commerce and investment. Government produces nothing and therefore the expense of government reduces the wealth of a nation. Taxes are akin to a proportional reduction in the productivity of labor, stock and land and so should be kept at a minimum in order to increase the wealth of a nation. Any government role beyond the promotion and protection of investment reduces the wealth of a nation and of its people Adam Smith would oppose the many government programs that litter the landscape of the Federal Government today. Welfare, Social Security, education spending by the government, and other non-defense or infrastructure related expenditures diminish the productivity of the people and consequently their wealth. The majority of the people in the United States would have been much wealthier had it not been for these programs.Adam Smith was also a proponent of free trade. He understood that countries varied in the productivity of the land and the people and that only through free trade could the advantages inherent in different lands and peoples be harnessed to increase the wealth of nations. He opposed guilds and unions which only protected the few at the expense of the many and consequently reduced the wealth of a nation by reducing the productivity of its people.Adam Smith was truly a man for all season and for all time. It's unfortunate that our politicians and educators are more familiar and enamored by the idiot Karl Marx than they are with Adam Smith. For if they revered Adam Smith as much as they revere Marx we would all be wealthier and happier."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"I read this book because I have had the \\"invisible hand\\" concept rammed down my throat since 1974 when I started taking business classes at a local university.

The rest of the book is a wordy list of Adam Smith's observations of micro economic events in England and Scotland and occasionally \\"savage\\" areas in the US and other foreign countries. Adam Smith was a very, very smart man for his time (or were people simply smarter back then?), and he makes detailed observations throughout the book that would be considered boring minutia by todays standards. So let me boil it down for you:Adam Smith considered Free Enterprise to be by far the best method of economic interaction possible. HOWEVER, the book is almost completely about collusions or what he often calls monopolies where two or more people get together to avoid competition. He goes on in depth about the sickness that corporations, governments, and even religious institutions can inflict upon free enterprise. See why I say he was so smart? He was a true prophet.It is truly a shame that the \\"conservative\\" right-wing political thinkers of today have adopted this book as one of theirs, because it truly is not.

I found the ideas behind taxing to be simple but effective given their presentation as well as Smith's arguements for a free market economy. Reading this historical text has also helped placed into context his arguemnts against the mercantile system and the taxing of the American colonies because the depth that he goes into about said subjects is more than any history class that I have taken has allotted. For some the wording may seem dated or old or borring but for those who enjoy a more analytical style or writing, such as the style used in the translations of Roman philosophy texts, the writing style should not be a problem. The most intimidating aspect of this book is its size, an aspect which can easily be overcome if the reader finds the text engaging for the above reason. While I cannot say that it is a \\"must read\\" or a \\"required read\\" for an understanding of economics simply because of the ignorance which I still possess on the subject, I can say that it is an informative read that explains in depth, using cited examples, areas of economics that are easy to grasp if the reader enjoys the text.

To minimize repetition, the differences for this version: This massive book is complete and unabridged (all five books). There is a great added feature in the form of small summary notes in the margin that accompany each paragraph. Adam Smith was a masterful writer of prose and communicates some of the most important economic and philosophical ideas in the history of western civilization. Economic theory never read so beautifully.An interesting choice for an introduction is Robert Reich. He is one of the few intellectuals from the left, and while I disagree with him more often than not, I respect his thought process. He offers his interpretation of Smith and how the ideas found in TWoN fit neatly with his positions. Selective reasoning or not, Reich does offer a nice summary line: \\"In these times, as when Adam Smith wrote, it is important to remind ourselves of the revolutionary notion at the heart of Smith's opus-that the wealth of a nation is measured not by its accumulated riches, but by the productivity and living standards of all its people.\\" Nicely said and I agree. I just disagree with Reich and his ilk on how the \\"wealth\\" of the modern nation is achieved. Adam Smith offers the roadmap, but it is up to us to keep lawmakers in DC or [insert any central government here] from regulating and taxing us to death --relegating Smith's work to the dust bin."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is more readable than you probably think, and if you actually sit down to it you'll be repeatedly astounded by Smith's shrewdness.But parts of Smith's original can be tough going in many ways. Why don't publishers acknowledge this by coming out with something more helpful than just the raw text?Unfortunately, finding an edition that will be of great use to you is problematic. That's why I'm giving this book 1 star: not for the text itself, but rather for the paucity of well-done printings out there.Anyhow. I have three before me:1. The \\"Modern Library Classics\\" edition, the one you see on this page. This is complete and unabridged in a single volume, and has a handsome, sturdy feel to it. There is a 4-page introduction and a well-done index, but what irks about this edition is that while it has a plethora of footnotes, all the footnotes are of the \\"textual comparison\\" variety (e.g., \\"12 Car. II., C. 32\\"), rather than the kind that really help you understand antiquated terms and convoluted wordings. In other words, you'll get no help from the editors here.2. Then there is the barrenWealth of Nations (Great Minds Series). There is a 2-page introduction at the beginning and an index, but beyond that it's nothing more than the original text, complete with the original punctuation and spellings (neither of which has been made more merciful for the modern reader).3. The Penguin Classics edition, in two volumes:The Wealth of Nations: Books 1-3 (Penguin Classics)andThe Wealth of Nations, Books IV-V (Penguin Classics). This is probably the least worst edition I have seen, with a superb introduction (nearly 100 pages long), and a glossary, all done by Glasgow's Andrew Skinner. But the only footnotes in the text itself are apparently Smith's own. They appear directly on the bottom of the page in question.So good luck, whichever one you choose.In case you need to know, Smith's original consists of five long chapters, or \\"books.\\"If anybody has a more respectable edition at hand, please comment and I'll incorporate it into this review."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"To be an economist without having read \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is like being a priest without having read the Bible. As is often the case with second hand accounts, textbooks have distorted and watered down Adam Smith. Going back to the original text is both refreshing and enlightening.The \\"Wealth of Nations\\" remains the most truthful defense of the economic science. But remember that Adam Smith also wrote \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\"; for Smith, economics was a search to better people's life rather than simply a quest to optimize mathematical functions or estimate variables using econometric models.To simply associate Smith with expressions such as the \\"invisible hand,\\" does not do him justice. Take, for example, the opening chapter on the division of labor: first, Smith defends the division of labor as being efficient; then, he defends it as an essential component of the freedom to allocate one's labor to one's talents; finally, he links the division of labor to trade: without the freedom to exchange the fruits of one's labor, the division of labor is meaningless. The point is that Adam Smith defends the rationale for the market, rather than just explain its mechanics.Anyone studying economics in school would think that economics is all about efficiency; this preoccupation, inevitably, breeds economists who support the market simply because it works. But to read Adam Smith is to enter the realm of an economic science where the ultimate benchmark is not efficiency but human freedom and welfare. That is, probably, what Smith would remark if he were to sit in an economics class today, and why the \\"Wealth of Nations\\" is as revolutionary today as it was two centuries ago."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover). In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14! Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece). Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work. Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work. Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.AMMENDMENT:Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once). I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"The Wealth of Nations handles a lot of economical phenomena in a concrete but sometimes complex way. On one hand the book is filled with ideas, some convincing, some out-dated, some fundamental to the current believe in free-markets. These ideas are combined with appealing (or appalling) examples of the injustice done to people by disturbing the free-market. On the other hand however, I find that certain sections of the book require a lot of concentration. The book is an interesting, but slow and at times difficult, read.Essentially, it is a treatise on the power of individuals to maximise their own wealth and therefor a support for the natural liberty of men and an argument for free-markets. Not as a perfect system in which there will be no misery, but as a system that gives individuals the greatest (and most just) opportunity to gain happiness and which will be the quickest to respond to changes in supply and demand (and therefor decrease the misery which is created when governments ignore gaps between supply and demand).It is not a book that believes in the pure goodness of companies (but explicitly states that companies have a interest which is directly opposite to that of society as a whole. I.e. the interest of companies is to create a supply shortage so they can ask prices above costprice), but says that the best way to break the power of these companies is the allow free competition. It also reveals that political decisions that at fist glance seems compassionate, might in fact be inhumane, cruel and the cause of much suffering (because on the long run they lead to a supply shortage). The examples given here, are still relevant to view the decisions made by politicians in today's so-called free market countries.Comment on review of Micheal Brady, june 13 2005:Brady remarks that Smith was the first opponent of globalization. The (strange) evidence he gives to support this statement is that Smith supports the use of counter tariffs, if (and only if) this might lead to the removal of the initial tariff. This statement clearly shows that Smith was against protectionist measures like tariffs and only condoned them if in the short run they would lead to less protectionism and therefor more globalization! Brady also supports his statement by mentioning that Smith opposed any offshoring if the purpose of such offshoring was to supply the home market. The keyword here again being \\"if\\". Smith was against a nation stimulating offshoring because he saw no national gain. This however doesn't mean that governments should restrict labor/capital mobility, because this would go against the natural liberty of men."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Adam Smith's \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is one those great Classics that almost everyone should read. But if you intend buying a copy, be very careful which version you buy. Why, you ask?It's out in the public domain and a plethora of reprints are available, a great many from Print on Demand Publishers and there are some truely awful reprints available. Amazon associates reviews of a book with many different versions of the same book from different publishers. Unfortunately for us customers, Amazon is seeing a growing plague of low-quality Print-On-Demand Publishers who are specialise in reprinting copyright-expired books. Such as \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" Some of these publishers produce quite good quality books, some do not. What you do need to do is check the publisher carefully for all these older \\"copyright expired\\" books.An outstanding example of \\"not good quality\\" is the version of \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" published by General Books LLC. This version is scanned in using OCR technology (and using pretty poor quality OCR scanning equipment and software from the look of their books), is overall of very poor print quality, uses automated reproduction with no index, no illustrations and an excessive number of typos.Lest you doubt, here's some word for word quotes from the publisher's own web site:\\"We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check. Our OCR software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....\\"\\"After we re-typeset and designed your book, the page numbers change so the old index and table of contents no longer work. Therefore, we usually remove them. Since many of our books only sell a couple of copies, manually creating a new index and table of contents could add more than a hundred dollars to the cover price....\\"\\"Our OCR software can't distinguish between an illustration and a smudge or library stamp so it ignores everything except type. We would really like to manually scan and add the illustrations. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies....\\"\\"We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book. We would really like to manually scan each page and buy multiple copies of each original. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies.....\\"For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in a rather unfortunate purchasing decision as General Books LLC are all poor quality, tiny (almost unreadable) fonts and they don't bother to reproduce little things like Table of Contents or Indexes.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another version of the book, and they've stated that they used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first)."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Indeed this is true, [200 year old economics books are still relevant], but we miss half the value of the Wealth of Nations, if we do not also struggle through the turgid prose of the book he wrote 10 years before, The Theory of Moral Sentiments -- both of which of course are available for the Kindle for $.89 each.

Cannan treats us to a lengthy (63 page) introduction which includes a feisty justification of why this edition is put together precisely the way it is, including an authoritative history of those first five editions, with comparisons and contrasts. Once the book itself starts, Canaan's input is non-invasive; I felt that he was sitting silently and attentively in the wings, like a stage director overseeing a play.* The original wording is preserved, augmented by explanatory conventional bottom-of-the-page footnotes. Cannan's edits (mostly to correct typos and make clarifications) are most welcome, and even the typographical errors are preserved verbatim in footnotes. An example of a clarification: the author's mention of a \\"fire-engine\\" had me thinking of a horse-drawn vehicle for putting out fires. Cannan's footnote: \\"I.e., steam engine.\\"* The English usage of two centuries ago is a novelty, and much easier to follow than I had expected.* The author's original footnotes are exactly where he placed them: in little insets around the page.As for the content itself, the prevalence of Smith's ideas in modern treatises such asBasic Economicsis startling! (I recommendBasic Economicsas a first book on Economics, by the way.) I got MANY insights into the beginnings of America and what was going on in the world at the time this was published. I now understand why towns formed along sea coasts and waterways: it was much more efficient to transport goods via water than by land. Forget Economics for a second: any general historian would be remiss without reading this."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Alfred North Whitehead famously stated that all of Western philosophy was merely a footnote to Plato. It seems to me one could say the same thing about economics in regard to Adam Smith. There were certainly economists before Adam Smith (just as there were philosophers before Plato); and there are some, I am sure, who will claim that some of the economists writing before Adam Smith were actually superior to Adam Smith in some ways (just as there are philosophers who prefer the pre-Socratics to Plato).But Adam Smith, like Plato, was able in his work to define a relevant set of problems which to a large degree are the same problems that are still being dealt with, and debated, within economics today; and, like Plato, the work of Adam Smith has been the source for various strands, or schools of economic thought, each of which finds its ground in a different aspect of Adam Smith's work. Adam Smith's analysis of the division of labor (the productive forces of society), his adherence to a labor theory of value (at least in part) and his distinction between productive and unproductive labor have been sources for the tradition of economic thought following Ricardo and Marx; while Adam Smith's analysis of the benefits of laissez-faire economic policies, his analysis of exchange, and determination of price through supply and demand, have been sources for the Neo-classical, marginalist, and free-market strands of economic thought.Adam Smith sees the wealth of a nation as consisting in its annual produce (what we today would call GDP). This is the central idea behind the whole book and is Adam Smith's major innovation in regard to previous economic thought (as I understand it). Adam Smith will evaluate the harm or the benefit of various economic policies by attempting to determine the over-all effect each policy will have on the annual produce of society as a whole. If a policy increases this annual produce then it is beneficial to society as a whole. If a policy decreases this annual produce then it is harmful to society as a whole. This is still, to a large degree, the measure we use when evaluating the effects of a given economic policy, though we are perhaps beginning to see that the benefit or harm of a given policy cannot be reduced to its effect on annual produce or GDP (environmental effects, for instance, effect society as a whole and have to be measured against effects on GDP in determining the costs and benefits of any economic policy).With few exceptions Adam Smith believes that laissez-faire policies are the best policies for increasing the over-all wealth of a nation and he bases his argument on his notion of the \`invisible hand'. This is another one of Smith's important theoretical innovations; the notion that each individual, by pursuing their own interest, without any thought or conscious plan for society as a whole, does not lead to chaos but tends, as if guided by an invisible hand, towards a maximization of the yearly annual produce of a nation. It is not necessary for society to \`plan' for this outcome in a conscious way; in fact, no amount of conscious planning could improve on the outcome produced by simply allowing individuals to pursue their own interests unfettered by government. This has been one of the most influential ideas ever put forward by anyone since the beginning of human history, whether for good or ill.So there are a number of reasons why anyone who is interested in economics should study The Wealth of Nations. First, Adam Smith defines a common set of problems which to a large degree are problems that economists are still trying to solve to this day (in the same way that Plato determined a common set of problems that still occupy philosophers to this day). Second, some of Adam Smith's ideas have been extremely influential on all subsequent debate and are still used in policy debates to this day. People still use the notion of the invisible hand to argue for the benefits of free-trade for instance. It is important, therefore, to understand how the invisible hand is supposed to work and what the benefits of allowing it to work are supposed to be. And third, Adam Smith is one of the most accessible and readable economists who ever wrote. You do not have to be a trained economist (I am not) to benefit from reading this work.So I fully recommend this work to anyone interested in economics or social and political philosophy."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"\\"The Wealth of Nations\\" is a big book of economics, history, philosophy, and social criticism. It is much more than Adam Smith neckties at GOP conventions. It is much more than a reverential nod or two in modern econ textbooks. Econ students need to read it to see where their discipline came from and what it could be again.Dickey's abridgment reproduces enough of the text (about 25 percent) to convey the depth of Smith's erudition and the diversity of his interests. Unfortunately, the editorial apparatus is weak. The Comments are few in number and incredibly brief, and the short Preface fails to put the book into historical and intellectual context. Dickey does offer four appendices but these deal with specialized topics rather than the big picture.Bottom line: this edition is inexpensive but is probably not the best one for students."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"The Scottish Adam Smith is certainly the most important economists of all times and is the founder of modern economic thought, being &quot;The Wealth of the Nations&quot; his major work, where he introduces to the general public of his time - the book was first published in 1776 - new concepts and ideas as &quot;competitive advantage&quot;, &quot;divison of labour&quot;, &quot;the power of the invisible hand&quot;, and many others still powerfull today, even accounting for the changes happened in the world economy and politics. From this starting point, a crucial juncture in the world economy, that is, the beginning of the industrialisation in England, many renowed economists and social scientists construed their theories. To name a few? Karl Marx, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill and many others acknowledge the importance of Adam Smith's work to their theories. Besides this opus, he did a lot in the field of philosophy, but was to become known as the father of the Classic school of economics. One of not so many Economics excelent Classic books to read. Enjoy it."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"This book is so widely cited and interpreted contrary to the author's original thought, that every economist should read it completely to avoid being misled by such incorrect interpretations.First, let us take the \\"invisible hand\\" metaphor. When I have studied economy in the University, I was taught that almost the entire book is devoted to the \\"invisible hand\\" which means \\"self-corrective markets\\", \\"liberalism\\", \\"Laissez-faire\\" and \\"state non-intervention\\". After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith did use the term \\"invisible hand\\" only once in the entire book, in the discussion of domestic versus foreign trade.To illustrate the point, let me quote the text where term \\"invisible hand\\" is used: \\"First, every individual endeavours to employ his capital as near home as he can, and consequently as much as he can in the support of domestic industry, provided always that he can thereby obtain the ordinary, or not a great deal less than the ordinary profits of stock. Thus, upon equal, or nearly equal profits, every wholesale merchant naturally prefers the home trade to the foreign trade of consumption, and the foreign trade of consumption to the carrying trade. In the home trade, his capital is never so long out of his sight as it frequently is in the foreign trade of consumption. [...]Secondly, every individual who employs his capital in the support of domestic industry, necessarily endeavours so to direct that industry, that its produce may be of the greatest possible value. [...]As every individual, therefore, endeavours as much as he can, both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce maybe of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain; and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it.\\"After reading this book, I have found out that Adam Smith was influenced by French Physiocrats. The Physiocrats saw the true wealth of a nation as determined by the surplus of agricultural production over and above that needed to support agriculture (by feeding farm labourers and so forth). Other forms of economic activity, such as manufacturing, were viewed as taking this surplus agricultural production and transforming it into new products, by using the surplus agricultural production to feed the workers who produced the extra goods. While these manufacturers and other non agricultural workers may be useful, they were seen as 'sterile' in that their income derives ultimately not from their own work, but from the surplus production of the agricultural sector.I have found out that this book is not about \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"Laissez-faire\\". It is quite a complete study that covers almost every basic aspect of the economy, and remains an effective introduction to economics to this day.This book is so often mischaracterized and politicized that I suggest you to read it completely by yourself. This is a must read for every economist. You can get an audio version of this book to avoid lengthy read."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"Hello,I made the mistake of buying a differnt kindle version of this book.

Thank You.Joe"},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"The Wealth of Nations is one of the most important books ever written. In some respects the Wealth of Nations was a tract for the times. Smith penned a crippling critique of the mercantilist \`Policy of Europe'. Smith, along with David Hume and David Ricardo, refuted the mercantilist case for protectionism. Much of what we read in this book is still taught in modern economics classes. Modern day protectionists still have no answer to the principles of absolute and comparative advantage, and for the basic logic of Hume's specie flow mechanism.Smith was more than an ordinary economist. He was a visionary who saw some of the potential for progress through Globalization. Perhaps the most important concept of this book is the dynamics between division of labor, labor productivity, and the extent of markets. Smith conceived of Globalization as a process that would raise productivity as local markets expanded to national and then international scope. His example of division of labor in a pin factory is simple, but illustrative.The most widely known part of this book is that part of the \`invisible hand of markets'. Invisible hand reasoning still pervades modern economic theory, though there are some variations in how economists interpret this concept. Smith does differ from Modern economists on certain issues. Smith thought of competition as a process and of monopoly as a government grant of privilege. In these areas Smith was ahead of many modern economists. Smith also explained market prices in terms of labor content. Here is Smith's great error. Labor value theory set economics on the wrong course. Labor value theory served as the basis for Marxism. This, of course, indicates the great influence of The Wealth of Nations on world history. Without labor value theory the Marxist idea of exploitation falls apart. Smith therefore played a posthumous role in twentieth century history, especially from 1918 to 1991. Of course, we cannot blame Smith for the misuse of his ideas. Smith would have surely opposed Marxism, had he been alive to do so.What we have in this book is a tremendous effort at discovering the proper limits between private and public institutions. Better still, Smith thought about society and institutions in evolutionary terms. This is another reason why the Wealth of Nations is preferable to modern economics texts. Smith understood the dynamics of capitalism better than many modern economists- who focus on static math models. Smith also influenced Charles Darwin with his ideas of social evolution. There is much evidence indicating that Darwin got the idea for the evolution of species by reading The Wealth of Nations. Smith therefore had great influence on the biological sciences.Modern economists reject Smith labor value theory (ever since Menger refuted it in 1870). However, there is no denying the influence of The Wealth of Nations. All members of the educated public should read at least part of this book. The question then in which edition should you buy? The Liberty Classics edition is unabridged. The Modern Library Classics edition has margin notes that could be helpful. Given the affordability of these editions, you might consider have both on your bookshelf (I do). I would avoid the Great Mind Series altogether. The Wealth of Nations should be read because it is both a book of great historical importance and a good source for understanding modern Globalization. The labor value theory part precludes a five star rating, but anything less than four stars would be absurd."},{"Title":"An inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations,","review":"I have read WoN in three different editions and undoubtedly the best was the definitive version in the Glasgow edition of his Collected Works.

I read the free Kindle version of \\"The Wealth Of Nations\\", and while I do not recommend that version I do recommend the overall work.The issues with the Kindle version are that it is poorly formatted, and it is painful to attempt to read the numbers in the tables at the of Book I. You are much better off getting a hard copy so that you can more easily flip to the section of interest, and to read the information in a better format. As for the rest, the content is all there, once you get past the poor formatting.The work contains five books within. The first is \\"Of the Causes of Improvement in the productive Powers of Labour\\". In this book he discusses the benefits of the division of labor, the origin and benefits of using money, a section on the \\"real\\" price of commodities (i.e. how much toil it takes to produce them), a discussion of the natural and market prices of commodities (the forces of supply and demand), the effect of controlling a commodity can have on the price, the wages of labor (again a case of supply and demand with the commodity of labor), the profits of stock, a discussion of the ill effects of groups who use their influence to manipulate the government (this would include banking conglomerations, trade unions, etc.), and closes with a section on rent.The second book is \\"Of the Nature, Accumulation, and Employment of Stock\\" which deals with accumulating wealth which lasts a longer period of time. This book starts with how one divides their stock into what they need for personal use, and what they can dispose of in exchange for others available stock. He then moves into a discussion of money as a type of stock, and then how to use their excess money/stock to gain interest.The third book is \\"Of the different Progress of Opulence in different Nations\\", where he talks about the balance between the inhabitants of towns and those of the country areas and goes into how agriculture is discouraged over time, while cities and towns prosper.The fourth book is \\"Of Systems of political Economy\\" in which Smith discusses the commercial system, along with importation which contains a detailed look at the effects of restraints on importation/exportation. Smith also discusses commerce treaties, and the role of colonies. This book also has a brief section on the agricultural system, but here he is referring to a specific system where the produce of land is the sole source of the revenue of a nationThe fifth book is \\"Of the Revenue of the Sovereign or Commonwealth\\" in which Smith deals with taxation. This is an important area to read and understand, as it is the one which many ignore when using Smith to try to support other areas. There are hints here of the progressive tax, as well as a discussion of the expenses of the nation, an important acknowledgement that the poor spend the greater part of their income on the fundamentals, such as food, and so he suggests luxury taxes as not unreasonable. Smith then closes the final book with a discussion of the costs of war, both for the actual fighting, and in terms of the loss of trade."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Volume 2 of Marcel Proust's 4000+ page masterpiece, &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, is, if it's possible, an even greater book than the first volume. I read Volume 1, &quot;Swann's Way&quot;, with the kind of astonishment and joy generally reserved for Tolstoy and Maugham, constantly amazed at Proust's (via Moncrieff, Kilmartin, &amp; Enright) ability to deepen sensation and memory to almost religious proportions, and when I finished I thought, &quot;There's no way he can keep this level of beauty up for another 5 volumes.&quot; Judging from Volume 2, I was dead wrong.Proust published &quot;Swann's Way&quot; in 1913, and waited 6 years to publish Volume 2, &quot;Within a Budding Grove&quot;; I presume that in the interim he reorganized his ideas, deciding to expand his novel and explore his themes in greater detail. This volume is much more leisurely and intricately paced than the first, as Proust masterfully tells us of the end of his relationship with Gilberte, his relocation to Balbec, and the beginning of his relationship with Albertine. The slow dying of love, the vaguely confusing experience of a new dwelling as it gradually becomes a home, watching beautiful young girls (the &quot;budding grove&quot; of the title) enjoying their beauty and youth as they walk down a city street...these things and more are plumbed and ruminated upon, with Proust's typically intricate and gorgeous language.These books, if the first two are any guide, are like nothing ever attempted in the history of literature. Rather than dealing with WHAT happened, Proust settles himself in for the long haul to try and understand WHY it happened; to quote Christopher Hitchens, Proust &quot;exposes and clarifies the springs of human motivation...with a transparency unexampled except in Shakespeare or George Eliot.&quot; But I don't think Bill nor George ever dug this deep; Marcel Proust is absolutely one of a kind, and he's not easy to read in this world of flash-images and expressways. He takes his time. Though he was dying with every labored breath (he didn't live to see the entire novel published), Proust was in no hurry to finish. His thoughts, like his sentences, have multiple branches. Follow them and you'll cherish the experience like it was your own.Moving on to Volume 3....."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"For the second book of Proust's masterpiece, 'In Search of Lost Time', his attention turns away from the black and white realities of childhood to the greyer realms of adolescence, and with that, the deep, burning sensation of unrequited love. In essence, the second book is a 530-page essay on the different forms of young love, from deep obsession to airy neglect, from the savage loneliness of rejection to the dizzying heights of a love returned.The book is split into two rough sections, the first of which is called 'At Mme Swan's'. Here we are introduced to Gilberte, Proust's first great love. The feelings he harbour's for her are ridiculously exaggerated, and oh so reminiscent of most people's teenage years. Every action, every word, every glance is analysed, studied, explored for meaning and intent. If, one day, Gilberte invites him to tea, the implications and potential meanings behind the invitation are debated internally for pages. If not, then even more pages are spent examining the pit of despair that Proust' soul fall in to. On top of this unhealthily obsessive love, we have his infatuation with Mme Swan, Gilberte's mother. There is almost a sense that Proust loves Gilberte because she is his age and he 'should' love her, whereas his affection towards Odette Swan is more real because there is no obligation or pressure from anyone, but less likely because she is twenty years older than him, and married.When Proust's love for Gilberte is over - as it inevitably must, in those tender years of a boy or girl's life - the terrifying lows to which his emotions descend is as remarkable as the highs of his spirit not twenty pages previous. He obsessively analyses the ways in which he will get revenge, plotting to make her love him again, just so that he can reject her, to let her know how it feels. He tortures himself emotionally, visiting Mme Swan and purposely avoiding Gilberte.What we have in this first part is a fascinating study on the tormented, melodramatic loves of early adolescence. Proust is too young at this stage to understand that love may not be forever, and can speak only in grandiose, exaggerated terms. If not for the fact that the prose is written with such grace and intelligence, his despair would come across as teenage angst at its very blackest.In the second part of the novel, 'Place-Names: The Place', Proust and his grandmother retire to the beach to aid in the recuperation of his body and mind. Always a frail child, the rigours of new love have taken their toll on the young man. He rejects love, deciding that he shall become a writer once more, a passion that he had denied himself when his love for Gilberte had seemed so real and assured. He is introduced to a variety of characters which, we are told during the narrative, will come to play a great part in his later life: Robert de Saint-Loup, the Baron de Charlus and of course Albertine.It is in this second section that Proust falls under the shadows of young girls in flower. He meets a group of girls, a 'gang' he calls them, and befriends first one, then all of them, reasoning that out of four or five girls, at least one would be worthy of love. Keeping with the true spirit of adolescence, he falls in and out of love with them all, needing only a stray glance or a casual smile to move from one girl to the other. Only two of them, Albertine and Andree, seem to return his emotions, and even then, everything remains chaste.Interspersed throughout, we have long, insightful remarks on what love can do to the body, to the mind, and to the relationships we have with other people. Speaking as a male recently finished with his teenage years, I can say that Proust has captured the depth of feeling, the obsessiveness, the surety that everything in the universe will be perfect if only the love is returned, the electric thrill of acceptance, the deep darkness of rejection with such skill that perfection is a word that springs to mind.Other topics are touched on throughout the novel. Early on, Proust is introduced to an author he holds in high esteem, one Bergotte. He is crushed upon discovering that the man does not exactly coincide with the image he had created while reading Bergotte's books, and ruminates on the fact that a man need not display the same intelligence and wit in reality as he does on the page. We must all focus our attention on achieving either a great reality or a great fiction, for Bergotte, his attentions were focused upon the fiction, and his personality and demeanour when interacting with flesh and blood people suffer. For Proust, it is an introduction to the idea that people can have two - or more - identities, and that a certain one is presented to a certain group of people.The writing is, of course, typical Proust. Sentences are long, paragraphs are longer, and not very much happens. Dialogue is scarce, action scarcer. The reader is there to observe Proust's thoughts, not to use him as a mirror to the world he inhabits. Luckily for us, Proust's thoughts are never dull or boring. He says early on in the novel, 'For genius lies in reflective power and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected', and Proust's reflective power more than reveal the truth of this maxim."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Penguin's new translations of \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" were just the nudge I needed to read Proust's masterwork again. I was particularly impressed by the job the American writer Lydia Davis did with \\"Swann's Way\\". By contrast, I have a few complaints about James Grieves's rendering of \\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower\\". Where Scott Moncrieff translated \\"petite bande\\" (of girls) with the expected \\"little band,\\" Grieves uses \\"little gang,\\" which to an American ear sounds rather tough. He mangles one of my favorite quotations. And there's a typo on the bottom of page 95: \\"not\\" instead of \\"now\\"!Overall, though, I like the liberties Grieves takes with the text, and we were certainly overdue for a freshened-up translation of one of the most important books of the 20th century. Unlike Proust's French, Scott Moncrieff's English has come to seem dusty and overblown. (For example, he rendered the title of this volume as \\"Within a Budding Grove\\", the literal translation being too racy for his 1920s audience of post-Victorians.)The American edition (from Viking) is particularly handsome. The four volumes now available are uniform in appearance when it comes to their cloth covers (grey and black with silver lettering), and the dust-jackets, though following a general theme, are distinctive enough that you're not likely to mistake one volume for another.

His plan to ingratiate himself with Gilberte by becoming friends with her parents backfires badly when Gilberte begins to distance himself from him. He agrees then to spend a season with his grandmother in a Norman oceanside resort named Balbec. There, in the most memorable scene in the novel, he makes the acquaintance of a &quot;little band&quot; of eight girls whose poise and sang-froid disarranges his senses. He falls in love, with first, then another. As the novel ends, we see him select one of them, Albertine, for future conquest.This is my second time through the budding grove of Proust's great multi-part novel with its crescendo of (unfulfilled) sensuality. Such was the impact of the Balbec scenes that I thought that the narrator's pursuit of the band of girls took up most of the novel. In fact, it does not appear until well into the last part and takes up less than 200 pages. It is simply that Proust imprinted that scene so strongly in my mind that, over the years, I mistook a part for the whole.WITHIN A BUDDING GROVE introduces some memorable characters that will come back in future volumes: In addition to Albertine, there are Robert de Saint-Loup, the painter Elstir, the Marquise de Villeparisis, and the Baron de Charlus. In the later volumes, we will see how Marcel (for that is the narrator's name) will fare with Albertine, and how the world that he saw as a shimmering fairy castle will shatter with the working out of his destiny, that of his friends, and that of the French in the years before the Great War.One of the great chess grandmasters commented on the opening setup position -- before any moves had been made -- by saying &quot;All the mistakes are there, waiting to be made.&quot;"},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"If you're looking at reviews of this volume, then I assume you've read Swann's Way and are considering buying more Proust. Within a Budding Grove continues the brilliance of Swann's Way, applying Proust's unequaled powers of observation to such experiences as struggling to be with his childhood idol, staying at a seaside resort, glimpsing and ultimately working his way into a clique of teenage girls, developing a friendship with an aristocratic youth, and visiting the studio of a great painter. As with Swann's Way, you will have frequent &quot;aha!&quot; moments when Proust's narrator opens your eyes to the previously overlooked drama at your elbow (and within your own mind)."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"It's my experience, reading this novel, to be perpetually grateful for the miracle of Proust, grateful, too, that he waited until his maturity to write; as someone who's spent time in writing workshops, I can only imagine the dissipation of his energies into anemic prototypes had he been persuaded to publish prematurely. Lovingly written, every word endowed with love of life and maturity's distillation of life experience, it is a novel (which reads like a memoir) of a life devoted to the connoisseur's pursuit of pleasure-how can that not alienate? Proust is consciously writing for an elite of mental or temperamental sympathy. To say that reading Proust has helped me through hard times is true-yet how can I-someone who has, to paraphrase a T-shirt I saw recently, a blackbelt in keepin' it real-not resent a courtesan with three ladies to aid in her toilette-however tenderly rendered?The mature Proust's vision of love-in this novel at least-is adolescent and self-absorbed, and there is no sense of a selfless or mature love, such as that of a parent for a child, which contains a dying to self as opposed to an expansion of self. (One thinks here of the authorial contempt for the too-giving parent, Vinteuil.) I pity Marcel: to lose oneself-the burden-to lose time-sometimes-is very refreshing indeed. Mired in the adolescent and egotistical point-of-view, without benefit of even the illusory counterpoint of an adult lover's (Swann's) point-of-view, the narrative does sometimes suffer from too much Marcel. Coddled, effete, he finely calibrates the shades of disillusionment that possession as opposed to reflection offers-the \\"psychological impossibility of happiness\\"-after having his wildest fantasies (Berma! Bergotte! Balbec!) fulfilled time and again. And he universalizes his singular temperamental trait, that inability to live in the moment.Proust is only too conscious of his weaknesses, and as a result, we get his poetics: \\"I am aware that this is to blaspheme against the sacrosanct school of what these gentlemen term \`Art for Art's sake,' but at this period of history there are tasks more urgent than the manipulation of words in a harmonious manner,\\" Norpois says, and one is laughing out loud with pleasure at the dissonance between Marcel's lofty musings on Berma and the cold spiced beef jiggling in its cubes of aspic, the delicious conflict of temperaments.He gives me back to myself-it's a long time since I've felt the sole inhabitor of my consciousness and had the leisure to puzzle out my sensations. Usually my mind is full to the brim like this: \\"Mommy-mommy-mommy-here comes little bear! What does little bear say?! Mommy-mommy-mommy-mommy-moooooommy! Here's little bear! Little bear is talking!\\" So that I don't have mental space or leisure to process even the simplest sensation, how the sun feels on my shoulders, for instance. Visiting Proust's cool room of mirrors and ocean waves returns that feeling to me, and that is precious. There is something precious in his extremity-his lack of apology for a sensitive and aesthetically-driven nature that is anathema to middle-class American values. And that rhythm like ocean waves! It gets in your head, lowers your blood pressure, no doubt alters brain wave patterns, the chemicals in neuropathways.There is something so extreme (admirable!) in Proust's sensibility-the extremity of his pursuit of pleasurable sensation intellectually reorganized and savored-that one feels-paradoxically-something dehumanizing in his gaze. His musings on the protoplasmic nature of young girls frankly chills me! Yet I see it as part of the \\"green fuse,\\" the life force pagan and repugnant at times. So, what happens in Vol.3? I can't wait, yet at the same time I hope for something I may not get."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Reading Proust presents the challenge of understanding his complex method of conveying the impressions made upon him by various people, places, and things, impressions which are so deeply personal and unique that they can be very difficult for the detached reader to relate to. Proust can recall the torrid emotions of a teenage crush with the articulate language and clarity of an extremely intellectual adult with a literary voice so distinctive it practically exists in a genre of its own; and in &quot;Within a Budding Grove,&quot; the second volume of &quot;In Search of Lost Time,&quot; he subjects his narrator, now in his young teens, to the charms of two girls who will define for him a youthful ideal by which he standardizes love and beauty.Searching for ideals seems to be the young Marcel's goal in life. Whether he is enamored with the actress Berma at the theater, the writings of his literary model Bergotte, or the paintings of the artist Elstir, he immerses himself headlong into what he believes to be the supreme examples of artistic experience and absorbs the impressions so that he may reflect them in his own future writing. Oddly enough, his feminine ideal is no girl of his own age but Odette, the courtesan who was the obsession of his parents' friend Swann in the previous volume and is now Swann's wife, and whose checkered past casts a lingering shadow over her husband's social status, excluding them from the higher strata of Paris society (the Faubourg Saint-Germain) and keeping Swann suspicious about her behavior with other men.Marcel is trying to develop a relationship with the Swanns' lovely, lively red-haired daughter Gilberte, and he agonizes over the fear that he will not succeed in impressing upon her parents that he is good enough for her. It may seem strange that an adolescent Marcel should spend so much time talking about the Swanns, as though they were potential in-laws, rather than his own parents, but this is an indication of his preoccupying desire for Gilberte's company. Finally he comes to the realization that she does not feel the same way about him as he does about her, which accompanies his bitter shock at seeing her with another boy. Long after his passion for her has faded, however, he still treasures his memories of the time he has spent in Odette's salon.The second half of this volume concerns Marcel's summer sojourn with his grandmother in Balbec, a seaside resort. There he meets his grandmother's friend Madame de Villeparisis, whose father spent the nineteenth century hobnobbing with all the great French writers of the era, and befriends her grandnephew Robert de Saint-Loup, a young man a little older than himself, who is embarking on a military career. One day he notices a remarkably attractive girl walking a bicycle with a group of her friends; this turns out to be Albertine, with whom he forms a relationship that is more playful than the tense one he had with the frigid Gilberte but ends sourly with a refused kiss and a confused Marcel pondering her intentions.Marcel's hypersensitive nature grants him many advantages as a narrator, giving him the ability to overanalyze every situation that shapes his consciousness, but arguably limits his lifestyle. His parents coddle him about his health, even supposing an evening at the theater will debilitate him, and, as we see at Balbec, he accustoms himself to a new setting in an abnormally awkward manner. But perhaps his awkwardness, in love as in life, can be explained partly by the nymphic philosophy by which Odette guides her life: &quot;You can do anything with men when they're in love with you, they're such idiots!&quot; The truth hurts."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Beautiful writing, and brilliant observations and well-drawn characters. Some caveats are the often labyrinthine sentences and multi-page paragraphs. Most people read SWANN'S WAY and no further, so those who make it through the 2nd volume might praise it excessively out of a slight superiority complex. Also, \\"Marcel\\" is also a little bitchy in his tone, and his \\"happiest when I'm alone\\" philosophy is kind of sad and self-absorbed, and his visiting whore houses is jolting after you've been reading graceful sentences and events. And some of his anthropological and psychological observations are trite and nothing most readers haven't concluded for themselves, and Proust sounds like he believes he's letting you in on some insights of which you're undoubtedly ignorant. But, yes, many of his insights are brilliant and eye-opening. And the sentences that are over-loaded actually are the exception, and the rest are doubtless among the most beautiful sentences ever written. Proust must have been extremely introspective to have thought so extensively about the most minute of moments...and good for us he was, since we get to enjoy the fruits of his introspection in this book. The humor that comes across is delightful, too. Proust has one thing you can't learn in any MFA creative writing program, and that is CHARM!"},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"How can anyone summarize even a single volume of Proust's massive six volume novel? Within a Budding Grove (sometimes translated as In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower) is the second installment of In Search of Last Time. We find the narrator perhaps marginally older on vacation with his grandmother living in a luxurious hotel in Balbec off the coast. This volume, paired with the first (Swann's Way), is really the introduction to the work entire if you can believe it. In it, the narrator perhaps matures slightly; he cultivates his keen awareness of art, meets new people, and ultimately falls out of love with Gilberte and falls in love with Albertine. His relationship with his grandmother is certainly expanded, and the reader comes to learn that the narrator is not merely motivated by a trivial pursuit of pleasure and bourgeois charm. He is in fact, a truly full human being, complete with fear, love, desire, and ambition. He meets one of my favorite characters in the whole book, the impressionist painter Elstir, a character clearly based Monet, Manet, Pissaro, and others. He introduces the narrator to Albertine through his paintings, and teaches him about the joys of life and art. There are some passages in this section of the book (the latter half) which I just can't resist from quoting,\\"I could never have believed that I should now be dreaming of a sea which was no more than a whitish vapour that had lost both consistency and colour. But of such a sea Elstir, like the people who sat musing on board those vessels drowsy with the heat, had felt so intensely the enchantment that he had succeeded in transcribing, in fixing for all time upon his canvas, the imperceptible ebb of the tide, the throb of one happy moment; and at the sight of this magic portrait, one could think of nothing else than to range the wide world, seeking to recapture the vanished day in its instantaneous, slumbering beauty\\" (pg. 657).also (how French is this?),\\"For a convalescent who rests all day long in the flower-garden or an orchard, a scent of flowers or fruit does not more completely pervade the thousand trifles that compose his idle hours than did for me that colour, that fragrance in search of which my eyes kept straying towards the girls, and the sweetness of which finally became incorporated in me. So it is that grapes sweeten in the sun. And by their slow continuity these simple little games had gradually wrought in me also, as in those who do nothing else all day but lie outstretched by the sea, breathing the salt air and sunning themselves, a relaxation, a blissful smile, a vague dazzlement that had spread from brain to eyes\\" (pg. 669).I certainly cannot add any insights into the greatness and profundity of this work which has not already been said by Edmund Wilson or Vladimir Nabokov. Within a Budding Grove is a deeply felt, beautiful and fleeting segment of one of the finest novels of the last century, I urge you to read it."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Upon finishing WITHIN A BUDDING GROVE, the reader will have been introduced to virtually all the major characters in IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME. Most importantly for later volumes, we meet and get to know Albertine, Robert de Saint-Loup, the painter Elstir, the diplomat Norpois, and Madame de Villeparasis, as well as a deepened acquaintance with such characters as Gilberte Swann, Madame Swann, and the extravagantly bizarre Baron de Charlus.Proust's extraordinary genius is evident on every page of this amazing book. One could point to any of a few dozen moments to illustrate this. What is amazing to me about Proust is how he can take an amazingly everyday event, and build it to proportions as great as any battle scene in WAR AND PEACE. For instance, at the end of \\"Madame Swann at Home,\\" the narrator recounts the times he would wait at the Arc de Triomphe to take a walk with Madame Swann and her entourage. The ensuing eight or nine pages, which merely recount the group walking through Paris, become as majestic and epic as any scene in Homer or Virgil or Tolstoy. No scene would seem to contain less potential for greatness, yet Proust is able to make it something truly unique and beautiful. Or, to take another incident, have there been many incidents in literature as filled with passion and emotion and suspense as the Narrator's first attempt to kiss Albertine? In a mere two pages, Proust is about to pack a surreal amount of dramatic (and comic) action.Although famous for containing at least part of both of the narrator's great love affairs, I find this novel even more fascinating for the extraordinary detailing of the myriad of social and class distinctions to be found in the seemingly infinitely varied French society. The great theme throughout the book, even when not specifically mentioned, is snobbism, and Proust owns the subject of snobbery as Homer owns that of war. Proust reveals snobbery primarily proceeding from those slightly lower on the social ladder. Ironically, he reveals those at the top guilty not of snobbery but of insolence and disdain, while not even his servant Franoise is innocent of being a snob. The tensions in the novel become particularly acute given the changes that were taking place in French society at the time. This theme is not restricted to this novel alone. It featured in SWANN'S WAY, especially in the attitudes of the Verdurin \\"faithful\\" and will be a major theme of ensuing volumes, especially THE GUERMANTES WAY.The section of the novel recounting his getting to know Elstir contains perhaps my favorite passage in all of Proust, where Elstir, upon the narrator's learning something unflattering of Elstir's past, tells him that no one has not done things that they would not love to expunge, but that no one ought to despise this, because this is the only way one can truly become wise. \\"We do not receive wisdom, we must discover it for ourselves, after a journey through the wilderness which no one can else can make for us, which no one can spare, us, for our wisdom is the point of view from which we come at last to regard the world.\\" This is not merely the opinion of Proust's character: it could stand as the central meaning of the novel as a whole."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"the beauty of these novels is unmatched with the possible exception of thomas wolfe. come with me and dance til dawn"},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Montcrief's translation, is the quintisential Proust. The, beautiful, florid prose is reminiscent of a time and a place that no longer exists, and captures the French aristocracy in the advent of WWI -- full of old-world trappings, yet abounding with subtle reminders of the globalization that was to follow. Proust's style and vision are directed admirably towards his artistic goal of appreciating art through sublimation, and express his idea that a true understanding of art comes first through appreciation, and then expression through a medium. This volume is full of Proust's own philosiphies on art, life and the people who abound in both. His observations, pointed and amusing, keep this volume relevant. Considering the wave of expatriate and existentialist writers who propogated Paris after the Great War, this book is truly the last in a line of works that view life in a grand, sweeping and elegant manner. Within a Budding Grove brought Proust fame and acclaim in his own time, and in ours can be seen as a masterpiece reflecting a time past, yet glimsping assiduously into the future. For those \\"in search of lost time\\" this is truly a great read."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"One of the seven volumes of The Remembrance of Things Past, Within a Budding Grove is my favorite. Proust was of course infinitely more than a narcissist and a snob, but it is perhaps this volume which shows this more than the others. In terms of pure sensousness this volume contains Proust's most purely &quot;beautiful&quot; passages. Here we see the beginning and the ebbing of Marcel's attraction to Gilbertte Swanne and his new attraction to Albertine. Here the elaborate and elegantly structured sentences are easier to appreciate than in the long passages about the unpleasantness of the Guermantes or Marcel's elaborate comments on the ebbing memory in The Fugitive.Consider one passage which Theodor Adorno admired very much, where Marcel encounters Madame Swann wearing a lovely dress: &quot;And I learned that these canons according to which she dressed, it was for her own satisfaction that she obeyed them, as though yielding to a Superior Wisdom of which she herself was High Priestess: for if it should happen that, feeling too warm, she threw open or even took off altogether and gave me to carry the jacket which she had intended to keep button up, I would discover in the blouse beneath it a thousand details of execution which had had every chance of remaining unperceived, like those parts of an orchestral score to which the composer had devoted infinte labor albeit they may never reach the ears of the public: or in the sleeves of the jacket that lay folded across my arm I would see, I would drink in slowly, for my own pleasure of from affection for its wearer, some exquisite detail, a deliciously tinted strip, a lining of mauve satinette which, ordinarily concealed from every eye, was yet just as deliciously fashioned as the outer parts, like those gothic carvings on a cathedral, hidden on the inside of a balustrade eighty feet from the ground, as perfect as are the bas-reliefs over the main porch, yet never seen by any living man until, happening to pass that way upon his travels, an artist obtains leave to climb up there among them, to stoll in the open air, sweeping the whole town with a comprehensive gaze, between the soaring towers.&quot;Adorno's comments on this passage are far more profound than anything I could say. (They are availabe in the second volume of Notes to Literature) What is so striking, says Adorno, about this passage is not its enraptured precision but the way Proust preserves the unmediated experience of childhood that is so easily destroyed by our conformist society. In showing that this experience can be retrieved Proust's writing is profoundly liberating, not filled with &quot;the false maturity of resignation.&quot; Though Proust was physically weak, the iron discipline of Proust's art reveals the deepest and most heroic discipline. Proust, in the end, is a martyr to happiness."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Five stars for Proust's masterwork, but I wouldn't buy this book except for reference. Instead, look for the Viking hardcover or Penguin paperback of \\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower.\\" It's a hefty title, but it's more accurate and evocative than \\"Within a Budding Grove,\\" and I would say the same about the text.Scott-Montcrief did his work between 1913 and 1927, and he died before finishing it. Even as brought up to date by Kilmartin, it's now a bit dusty. James Grieve has given us a volume two for the 21st century. Almost any reader will be better served by \\"In the Shadow\\" than by acquiring the venerable \\"Budding Grove.\\" (Oh sure, the ideal would be to read \\"A l'ombre de jeunes filles en fleurs\\" in French, but for most of us life is too short for that!)-- Dan Ford"},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Spoilers throughoutThe title A l'ombre des jeunes filles en fleurs is translated various ways. Moncrief's Within a Budding Grove sucks. Seriously, where are the girls and the play of light? I prefer Nabokov's more natural In the Shade of the Blooming Young Girls. My doubts about whether I am reading what the author actually wrote (coupled with my preference to read for style) normally steer me away from reading translations---but I make an exception for this vast, supremely intelligent novel.On the surface this part of the Recherche covers the beautiful, rich, stylish, asthmatic, and batty Narrator's youthful loves: Gilberte and her mother in Paris; the faces and voices of Albertine and the rest of the little band in Balbec; and Charlus (although the Narrator naively did not comprehend what was going on). They all end badly, Gilberte gets tired of him, Albertine calls for help to thwart his advances and Charlus even administers a salutary douche.I think the Narrator's love for Odette is the most profound of them all; it is her fragrance that intoxicates, her housecoats that delight, her chrysanthemums that have special significance. She is observed down to the lining of her jacket. The mauve vision of Odette in her slow procession through the Bois is for me the most enchanting part of the novel. Accompanied by her male entourage who are awed by her beauty and wealth, saluted by Princes, she is more aristocratic than the aristocrats and singularly sums up the belle epoque. And Odette is important to Proust, for, despite her mediocre intelligence, she has invented \\"a physiognomy of her own\\"---that is, she has invented herself.Proust is a subtle and penetrating psychologist and has superhuman powers of analogy. He has created images that impress themselves on my mind: the sea reflected in Balbec hotel's bookcases, the green dining room, Berma with her arm extended, the hawthorne, and of course the mauve image of Odette. As if it were an Elstir painting, Proust's novel has the feel of a mirage in a tinted haze; just so, the bit about the letters with Gilberte is recalled by me now as perhaps letters that the Narrator dreamed he wrote to Gilberte, or maybe wrote them and didnt send them, or maybe sent them and imagined her reply, or maybe he did receive an actual response. I cant tell. Very nice effect.The other thing that keeps me coming back to Proust is the brilliant observations that appear on virtually every page. To give but two instances: he dumps on Norpois \\"...to repeat what everybody else was thinking was, in politics, the mark not of an inferior but of a superior mind\\"; and reflects on Bergotte's genius, \\"...the men who produce works of genius are not those that live in the most delicate atmosphere, whose conversation is the most brilliant or their culture the most extensive, but those that have had the power, ceasing suddenly to live for themselves, to transform their personality into a sort of mirror, in such a way that their life, however mediocre it may be socially and even, in a sense, intellectually, is reflected by it, genius consisting in the reflecting power and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected.\\" There is simply a lot to chew on.I wont talk of Proust's larger themes (Time, Art, Memory, Self-Deception, Life's Irony, etc.) but I do want to recommend some criticism that I found enlightening: Pippin's essay Becoming Who One Is (and Failing) and Landy's excellent Philosophy as Fiction.There are a couple things that continue to puzzle me: what is the actual relationship between Bloch and Odette? is Bergotte a homosexual? Perhaps the reader might leave me a message to help me out."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"...and that rush of memories. I read the first volume of \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" which is normally titled in English, (Swann's Way) some 25 years ago. Truly great literature should impact one's life, and certainly the first volume did. I vowed to visit the town depicted, which has hyphenated its name, Illiers-Combray, in honor of this masterpiece. I've done so, at least five times, visited Aunt Leonie's home, and literally taken the \\"Swann's Way\\" walk, the relatively short distance from her home to the lovely and normally unoccupied Pr&eacute; Catelan park, which should be an essential part of anyone's memory of this work. It can become a place of \\"pilgrimage.\\" I reviewed (Swann's Way) in early 2012; in doing so I did a straight line project based on reading one volume of the six, every 25 years, and readily realized I would not complete the entire novel unless I changed my pace. And I did, finishing this volume just under the wire in 2012, and committing to read volume three in the first part of 2013... this novel really is such an essential read.Reading Marcel Proust seems to call out for a special venue. I kept thinking of a hot-tub. Relaxed and soothing, certainly unhurried. His style of endless run-on sentences, with 10 and 20 qualifying phrases, seems to demand a leisurely read. I would have hated to think I had a deadline and a paper due on the book, as in a school assignment. Some passages I read two and three times, just for the sheer joy of his uniquely descriptive prose. And no doubt I'll pick up the book in the future, and read those passages again.The novel is set in the era commonly called \\"La Belle Epoque,\\" in France, just before the truly man-made, with the emphasis on that gender, catastrophe of World War I. In part, it is a novel of drawing room society and the endless machinations involved in establishing and maintaining a \\"pecking order.\\" What woman, for example, will refuse to even be introduced to another? That can all be a bit tiresome, but isn't that also how the contemporary corporate and political worlds work? Part of that society is the fictional writer Bergotte, who is apparently modeled on the real-life Anatole France. And there was a wonderful section on the narrator's anticipation and thrill in seeing the actress Berma in a production of Racine's \\"Phedre.\\"The core theme of this volume is the yearnings and infatuations of first loves. For me, the utterly astonishing aspect of this is that, as is well-known, Proust was a homosexual. Yet he seemed to capture heterosexual love, and in particular, the many subtleties by which a woman can knowingly entice a man, better than any other author. And he also captures the many obsessions a man can develop for a particular aspect of a woman's body, demeanor, or even attire. How, oh how did he see and understand so deeply into something he must not have intrinsically felt? In the first part of the book, his very first love is for Gilberte, whose likeness appears on the cover. Parents and supervision are very much in evidence, and it brought back a flood of memories (a la, le madeleine?) concerning those days of long ago. Obsessions and slights were never reconciled, as they so often aren't, and therefore life moves on. In his case, the second half of the book details the narrator's summer at the Grand Hotel at Balbec (modeled on the real town of Cabourg) on the Normandy Coast. It is there that he develops new loves and new longings, with a group of young coming-of-age women, who are not so subtly alluded to by the volume's title.For a novel that nominally does not have much action, there are some intensely memorable and evocative scenes. There is the 10-page or so description of Mme. Swan taking her \\"constitutional\\" near the Arc de Trioumph, in her mauve dress, with parasol and admirers. There is the grand entrance of Robert St. Loup en Bray, at the Grand Hotel. There is a memorable scene in which the diners at the Grand Hotel, behind the large plate windows, are described as being in an aquarium, observed by the working class outside. And I wondered if this inspired Pasternak to depict a similar scene inDoctor Zhivago. Yet another concerned how the narrator was enticed, and then rebuffed by Albertine.There are so many quotable sections; I will confine myself to only one, which illustrates how erotic a simple handshake can be: \\"The act of pressing Albertine's hand had a sensual sweetness which was in keeping somehow with the pink, almost mauve colouring of her skin. This pressure seemed to allow you to penetrate into the girl's being, to plumb the depths of her senses, like the ringing sound of her laughter, indecent in the way that the cooing of doves or certain animals cries can be. She was one of those women with whom shaking hands affords so much pleasure that one feels grateful to civilization for having made of the handclasp a lawful act between boys and girls when they meet...I could have conveyed by certain pressures of hand on hand; for her part, how easy it would have been, in responding by other pressures, to show me that she accepted; what complicity, what a vista of sensual delight stood open!\\" Wow, the way Proust describes a handshake with a woman, well, it might satisfy a man for an hour or so.Proust also had the insight to realize that in his first loves, he might be in love with his mind's image of a woman, rather than the reality that she is. I felt that he also overrated nubile charms, and underrated the joys obtained from the more mature and experienced. Overall, a most satisfying read, and one that deserves a special 6-star rating."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"We pick up here, in this second volume of the larger *In Search of Lost Time* with Proust's un-named protagonist at about age 15. He longs for the affections of his childhood sweetheart, the lovely Gilberte, who now accommodates his frequent visits with more overt enthusiasm... but it's all superficial and the young man's interest in her begins to wane. He maintains relations with her opulent and often odious mother, Odette, and he still reveres her father, M. Swann, but he hits upon the concept of searching elsewhere for his notion of female companionship.At this juncture, there's not a tremendous contrast between our youthful protagonist and Salinger's Holden Caulfield in the latter's own early days inThe Catcher in the Rye. But it's clear that Proust's protagonist's character is not quite so clinically flawed as that of Holden, (who appeared many years later.)The break is eventually made with Gilberte, more a process of osmosis than that of open conflict. And it's opportune for the young man that his mother, perpetually over-concerned for his frail health, launches him off to Balbec for a summer of vacationing along the southern coast, ostensibly so he can also pursue his unquenchable emphatuation with mouldering church frescoes. It's there, while residing in a resort hotel, that he encounters a band of giggling adolescent girls on the nearby beach. It takes him an agonizingly long period of time to eventually come to know them but he ultimately does, chiefly through the aid of a close friend of noble heritage [Saint Loup] and a venerable mentor, an elderly artist of notable fame [M. Bloch]. From here his relationship with two of the girls develops, but not necessarily as he anticipates.Along the social roller coaster of his life, it becomes clear that this youthfully amourous lad might have seized upon any opportunity for familiar relations with a young lady, even with a gal who was well below his elevated station. At one point at a train stop, he hones in on a peasant girl dispensing milk on the train and his naive fantasies about meeting this unremarkable gal run somewhat amok. But Proust moves him along, allowing the young man to only see her once again at a subsequent venue -- and by this time, his initial interest in her has diminished.Between numerous diaphanous episodes of the protagonist, Proust clings to certain themes which he initiated way back inSwann's Way (volume 1 of Remembrance of Things Past), improved 8/15/2010. The lamentable M. Swann's circumstance with his wife, Odette (a woman whom a lesser man of the period might have been inclined to throddle), continues to give rise to covert stress, thus:\\"I'll tell you who does need a good doctor, and that's our friend Swann,\\" said Bergotte. \\"And on my asking whether he was ill, well, don't you see, he's typical of the man who has married a whore, and has to pocket a dozen insults a day from women who refuse to meet his wife or men who have slept with her. Just look, one day when you're there, at the way he lifts his eyebrows when he comes in, to see who's in the room.\\" (Page 199.)Proust employs an infinite conucopia of clever literary devices to capture our interest. For example, he drops a compelling morsel, perhaps a brief description of a lovely girl with whom the protagonist is clearly emphatuated, and then he moves on for a time only to detail a completely unrelated episode -- he keeps the reader very hungry that way. We drool for more but we are cut off for precisely an endurable amount of suspense time.In summary, Proust's lyrical and subtly brilliant prose makes us long for the next tome in his renowned series,In Search of Lost Time, Vol. III: The Guermantes Way (v. 3). In the meantime, Volume II, *Within A Budding Grove* garners my highest recommendation."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"This is Volume 2 in Proust's In Search of Lost Time series.In this volume, the narrator gets close to and then loses his first love, travels to Balbec, makes new friends, and starts to fall in love again. That's all that happens.But again, as in Swann's Way, Proust tells the reader every detail in beautiful prose - what the ocean looked like, why she acted that way, what the narrator is thinking, etc, etc.I found the first third of the book to be a little tiresome, since I was sick of the behavior of certain characters. But once we got a change of scene in the narrators travels to Balbec, I started to really enjoy Proust again.I have to say this once again - if anyone is curious yet intimidated by Proust (as I was), just try the first hundred pages of Swann's Way. You might be surprised."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Whether you're in prison or you're a millionaire, you'll benefit from reading Proust. Look for Viking's (Penguin) newest, most complete translations for optimal enjoyment."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"In this second volume of &quot;In search of lost time&quot;, Marcel shows the evolution of his feelings towards women. The book starts off with his encounters with Gilberte, the daughter of Swann and Odette, in which the enjoy playing with other kids. Marcel finds misterious and fascinating the perspective of being admitted in Gilberte's intimate spaces: her house, the lobby, the rooms. His fascination includes Gilberte's mother, Odette; as well as he finds resistence in Swann's figure. But soon his passion for Gilberte disappears and he forces himself not to see her, in an attempt to make himself more interesting to her. But the unforseen result of his tactics is that his feelings for Gilberte fall into oblivion. Then, Marcel focuses in the meetings of the Swanns with the high society, in which Oddette is not completely well received (given her past as a &quot;cocotte&quot;); but she enters in the circles gradually.Marcel travels to the beaches of Balbec with his grandmother and that's where he meets Albertine and her circle of colorfull and charming young friends. It is also noticeable the character of Norpois, whose words to Marcel are full of double meaning and hidden intentions. Marcel meets his friends Saint-Luop, too. After a few sightings he seems a bit pretentious, but through an aunt of Saint-Loup's (who he meets through his grandmother) he gets to know this young man and they stablish a close friendship. An uncle of his is Charlus, who will turn out to be a very important character.By the end of the book the reader have met the circle of friends that Marcel has stablished as a result of his travel. He has taken the first step to his later relation with Albertine. Proust rejoices in describing things and one has to understand why is that. His references to the Dreyfuss affair serve as a way to show the behaviour of the high society and the snobism, which seems to rule the relationships between the different circles. Everything serves a purpose with Proust, even though an incautious reader may think that it is a long dissapointing book, I find it to be one of the great literary endeavours of the past century. His way of looking in detail the simple and most trivial life in all its seemingly meaningless details, turns such details in evidence of the connection between the big destinies and the low and selfish passions. A great example of this is when he discovers his own place in time, after considering how he relates to Gilberte and with his hobbies.This second volume of &quot;In search of lost time&quot; constitutes an honest, unidealistic view of love and how its nature is actually connected to the low passions that rule societies."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":".This is a great copy of Vol. 2 of A la recherche du temps perdu [In Search of Lost Time].Each volume in the septrology may be read individually as an independent novel.This is, of course, the very best translation available in English; probably the very best that will ever be available in English: certainly the next best thing to reading the original French.NOTE: Proust is not quick reading, and one who tries to read him too quickly will just as quickly lose the tread of the narrative.This text has its own time scale, and the reader must adjust his/herself to the text--not the other way around.In this stream of consciousness narrative, the narrator (/author) digresses as he speaks (/thinks): he digresses, digresses, digresses; and then, he returns, returns, returns to the point where he began. One has to follow his line of thought: this is the art and beauty of the text.Proust's achievement is one of the greatest edifices of Western art, perhaps comparable only to Wagner's Ring cycle.."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Proust is an odd one -- an essayist and memoirist whose literary ambitions led him to contemplate, not the reality of things, but rather the disparity between our impressions of things, both at the time and afterwards, and things themselves. That disparity, together with various physical afflictions, weighed on him and led him to withdraw from society, and just about everything else, to write. Write he did, for the thirteen years after 1909, grinding out the seven volumes of his \\"In Search of Lost Time,\\" unfortunately without useful editing. His first publisher was a vanity press.\\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower,\\" the second volume in the series, uses the experiences of the author's adolescence to reflect on art, desire, sexuality, death, irony, the force of sense impressions, and of course memory. Much of the text is enlivened or burdened, depending on the reader's point of view, with detailed descriptions of life in 19th century upper class French society. Proust also devotes tons of ink to Darwin-like observations of the behavior of homo sapiens. There are recurring characters to be sure -- the narrator, seemingly Proust himself, and his family (his diplomat father, his upper class mother, and his adored grandmother); the Swann family (upper class Charles, his actress wife Odette, once a widely desired demimondaine, and their coquettish daughter Gilberte); the aristocratic Guermantes family (Mme. de Villeparisis, her nephew the Marquis de Saint-Loup-en-Bray, and the sexually avaricious Baron de Charlus), and the financially strapped Albertine Simonet and her aunt -- but they are typically seen, not through the usual stuff of character development (their actions and words), but rather through the narrator's minute observations of them and his reflections on what he observes. This makes for a good bit of interior monologue, punctuated, as in the case of an attempted seduction and the dissection of a high school graduation essay, by brief bits of Dickensian humor. My friend Richard Epstein, who has taught and himself contributed to the best writing in the English language, compares Proust to Faulkner and Joyce. Interior monologue is an acquired taste. This much is certain. If you like John Grisham or urban fiction, you probably won't enjoy \\"In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower.\\"For my taste, the text is unwieldy, the sentences elaborate beyond belief, the worthwhile observations, humor, and social commentary buried in an avalanche of words, the references to French history and art bordering on the obscure. I wanted to enjoy the novel. I wanted to appreciate the manners. Lord knows I wanted the narrator to get the girl -- any girl -- but when the going got tough, I almost put the book down and got going."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Without a doubt, this is the best piece of literature I've ever had the pleasure to read. Proust constantly amazes me with his talent for exploring life and all it's intricacies and illusions. You'll be blown away by the depth and truth of this masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Reading Proust is like drinking good tea. You don't get drunk quickly and don't get fed up quickly.\\"Within a Budding Grove\\" is a fairly Artsy & Crafty translation of \\"A l'ombre de jeunes filles en fleur\\". It is half way between a novel and a meditation on time, love, writing, painting. The descriptions are beautiful and we get sucked into the Proust universe.I like this story so well, I prepared an adaption of it with the gender of the main characters switched back to their natural and obvious or probable gender, see [....]."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Though Proust is not for the casual reader, the Modern Library edition lightens the load a little: the font is big and thin, the pages small, so your eyes don't get lost in a sea of words; there's a great synopsis at the back so you can track what you've covered and find it again easily (a very big plus); and the volume is nice and thick so you can feel very accomplished. And, no one really says this: the paper is nice. It's nice to hold. Yay Modern Library Paperbacks.The Moncrieff translation is wonderful and gives you what you imagine is the tone of the time (late 19th century). I haven't read the newer translations. If you've made it through Swann's Way (took me two years), you'll know that things actually do start happening, there is a story. So there is much to enjoy here."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Volume two of Le Proust's great work is a sensual delight. Part One (of Vol.2), by and large, is more about Swann's family and, of course, the agonizing and philosophizing in regard to \\"getting over\\" Miss Gilberte. There is much less about the narrator's family which ran the course throughout SWANN'S WAY. Stylistically, BUDDING GROVE is an absolute wonder. We are once again treated to the narrator's philosophies on life's ups and downs (how's that for a summation?). Once he gets to the fictitious seaside town of Balbec, the book surges--taking on the proverbial \\"life of its own\\". The reader is in the hotel room with him...and on the beach...and on the boardwalk, etc. It was a joy to see how Proust/Moncrieff would occasionally work in \\"street talk\\" with the mainstay of aureate and lyrical prose: a woman in Balbec is described as having \\"yellow hair and six inches of paint on her face and a carriage which reeked of harlot a mile away...\\" Delicious. Priceless."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"This book was such a joy to read, I was genuinely sorry to see it end. And of course, it doesn't really end; it just goes on into the Guermantes Way. Rarely does one come across a novel that seems so completely pleasing and visionary in its effects upon the reader. Apart from the general relief one feels in seeing the author finally emerge from his prolonged sojourn in the shadow of his mother, there is also the vicarious pleasure derived from experiencing a long-ago summer at the mythical sea-side resort of Balbec, in the shadow of young women in the flower of youth. You feel as if you are truly there with him, walking the promenade, gazing out to sea, hearing the sea-gulls cry, feeling the sand between your toes, and being nineteen again and living carelessly.Two great characters emerge from this novel who will exercise a profound influence on the young narrator as he matures in future volumes. The first is Robert de Saint-Loup, a dashing young soldier-playboy, whom Marcel clearly adores as a soul mate of sorts. This gives the reader pause; for considering how close the two young men become they manage to still consider themselves straight! Never mind, however, for we eventually learn that Saint-Loup is indeed bisexual, as are so many of the characters in this novel. Secondly we meet the playful, flirty Albertine whom Marcel decides is the one girl in the little band of jeunes filles whom he most wants as his female sexual conquest. Unfortunately, he does not have the capability of relating to her except in the most self-absorbed of ways."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"Volume 3 of 12 of proust's Remembrance of things past is another great example of beautiful literature. In this volume Proust's leaves the innocence of boyhood and ventures forth towards young adulthood. His relationship with young Gilberte grows and eventually he falls in love with the pretty thing. Alas however there are problems and the narrator must face the fact that Gilberte will never be the one for him. All the while Proust's writes of Madame Swann the much talked about woman with a shady past. Though the mother of Gilberte the narrator paints her as a vision of beauty and grace. He is captivated by her as well and in one charming passage describes in great detail a spring coat she is wearing on one of her walks where in it he finds treasures and scents like no other. the reader can feel the coat as it is being described such a writer is Proust. this volume ends with Proust arriving at Balbec with his grandmother and observing the Hypocrisy around him. It is quite comical for no one is spared and each class at that time viewed the other with suspicion and disdain. I was quite disappointed when the last CD was through but I have already ordered volume 4. Naxos has done an excellent job in bringing to life Proust's masterpiece and I can't wait to listen to all 12 volumes. I will savor them however ordering one every so often just to excite my anticipation a bit more. this book contains 3 CDs and includes musical breaks between the reading."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"While much of 'Swann's Way' seems to highlight the narrator's wonderment and obsession with certain things (love, architecture, the aristocracy, the theatre), 'Within a Budding Grove' seems to start a fall to disillusionment as everything begins to become attainable. It still seems that there is some hope for love, until the attempt to kiss Albertine towards the end of the novel places it just out of reach.There also is a glimmer of hope in the character of Elstir, whose impressionism offers a new way of looking at things. Overall, the book is an interesting homage to the journey of youth and we are left with a longing for even more than the 730 pages contain."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"I cannot imagine trying to read Proust's Everest of a novel until I've had enough life experience to be able to identify with his insights. How on earth was a man who died young and was confined to a bed for so many years able to learn so much about life and common human experience, emotion and perception? I don't know how, but I thank God that he was.For modern readers, Proust is definitely an acquired taste that rewards patience. I never thought reading the works of one author would make those of others seem so much easier to read. But such is the case with Proust. Nevertheless, one shouldn't regard his writing as therapy or medicine; it may read like self help at times, with its frequent use of the first-person plural, but it is a story first of all. His writing is just more detailed and insightful than that of all but a handful of modern novelists.Within a Budding Grove is a primer on patience and perception, one that will probably make you a better reader, perhaps a better writer, and certainly a more interesting human being. Struggle on patiently. You will get used to the labyrinthine sentences, paragraphs that run on for pages, and gargantuan chapters (if they can be called that) that don't really begin or end anywhere tidy. Eventually, you will likely come to enjoy it.My only criticism: at times one does get annoyed by the slow pacing. For instance, I knew that this is the volume that introduces the reader to Albertine. But it did take about 600 pages for the narrator to meet her! That said, there are plenty of tasty morsels along the way. Read it, not so much for the simple story or the minutely detailed descriptions, but for the numerous insights and the astounding wisdom."},{"Title":"Within a budding grove, (His: Remembrance of things past)","review":"I waited decades to read Proust and eventually forked out a lot of money and bought all the volumes of the Everyman edition. I consider myself well enough read: Tolstoy, Garcia Marquez, Greene, Lessing, Fowles, Kafka, to name a few. And I also have a rule. If a novel doesn't grab you by the time you have read a fifth of its length, then you are wasting your time. Life is too short. With \\"In search of lost time,\\" I went further. I wanted the enlightenment of the greatest fiction of all time. I gave up after 1000 pages and do not know how I lasted so long. It was a dire struggle. There is no plot. The main character is a nobody. He forms no plausible relationships with anyone. He doesn't do anything. In fact, characterisation does not exist. No one is believable. There is no meaningful narrative or human interest. It has no politics on any scale. The endless trivia is not, I repeat, not poetic. The sentences go on for pages and make no grammatical sense. And even if you can figure out what obscure grammatical structure they are attempting to employ, forget about trying to make sense of them. People talk about Proust's musing over a cup of tea. That's about as interesting as it gets. If the heart of mankind is what you are after, read Tolstoy.

I have surveyed a good deal of the Klan literature, and found this book actually &quot;fairly&quot; good in comparison. Do I think that it is unbiased or totally accurate? - NO. But it is better than most current academic research, which when dealing with a topic such as this goes out of its way to condemn the Klan. From the standpoint of organizational history, this book is the best that I have come across. Wade's social analysis is suspect however. I do recommend it however, for anyone interested in the internal power struggles and organizational history of the Klan. The Klan literature which Wade includes is also fascinating."},{"Title":"The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America","review":"In this book Wyn Wade has given us a very good overview but not an extremely detailed look at the Ku Klux Klan. That is not to say that he has not done his research for he has found lots of material. The simple fact is that a book of this length cannot possibly cover the subject in any great depth. That would require a book at least twice this long, and probably three times as long. This book was obviously not intended to be a Shelby Foote type narrative of the Klan, but the basic survey that it is.Wade has done a good job with the post reconstruction Klan, but he tends to take revisionist history a bit too far. One thing that puzzles me is that he refers to Tennessee as the, \\"the only border state\\" that left the Union. Many historians refer to the Volunteer State as a border state even though it was surrounded by slave states on all sides, so I can let that part of the statement slide. I have never however heard of Tennessee referred to as a border state without at least Virginia and Arkansas also receiving that label. It's not a big thing I realize, but it did bug me.After reconstruction, Wade takes the reader to the history of D.W. Griffith's \\"Birth of a Nation\\", the movie that made the rebirth and rise of the post World War I Klan possible. Then he traces the new Klan through its phenomenal growth to its demise. Wade then moves on to the Cold War anti-Communist Klan, the Civil Rights era Klan, the David Duke Klan, and today's Aryan crowd. He does a fine job of bringing out the personalities of various Klan leaders and giving the lowdown on various politicians who, while not Klansmen themselves, were more than happy to court Klan support. He also does an outstanding job of telling the story of Klan violence, with special attention to the victims.Wade ends this fascinating book with the story of the groups that have been organized to oppose the Klan and the FBI campaign that brought the Klan to its knees. Finally, Wade warns the reader that the Klan is still out there and should never be pronounced dead. The Klan has proven its resilience again and again he warns and his excellent book will give the reader many reasons to be wary of the men behind the masks."},{"Title":"The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America","review":"The Fiery Cross is the best one-volume history of the Ku Klux Klan I have read. I have always had a hard time accepting the claims of the academics that historically, Klan membership in America was a civic-minded, even virtuous impulse on the part of ordinary citizens. (How the academics manage to say this in view of the Klan's anti-ethnic activities has always stumped me.) Wyn Craig Wade reveals the historic KKK in all its aberrant glory. Of special interest, I believe, is his chapter on the KKK's triumph in Indiana during the 1920s. It seems anomalous that this landlocked midwestern Hoosier empire, rather than some southern state, was the KKK's major stronghold during the decade it reached its greatest national prominence. Wade explains how KKK organizers skillfully exploited Indiana's penchants for organized religion, joining clubs, and arrogance. At one point, thousands of people accepted as true a rumor that the Pope was going to relocate the Vatican to Indiana. Why? Simply because Indiana was the most desirable real estate on earth."},{"Title":"The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America","review":"excellent book. The author was a personal friend of mine. I have his other book, Titanic. He took his research quite seriously and did an excellent job."},{"Title":"The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America","review":"The title of the book is very promising. Thereafter, disappointment meets disappointment.The book discribes the history of the clan from its beginnings after the civil war until nowadays.The book is rich of Klan activities describing in detail the horrifying acts which were committed by its members. But, there it stops. It explains the KKK as a reaction to the Union League activity but shortcuts the overall complexity. Although, undoubtely most crimes were committed against African Americans one cannot just focus on that aspect alone. The Klan has had no cohision in its activities, no real focus, no master plan ... no.... Meaning that aspect is missing and I believe this is the essence of the foundation of the Klan. A certain incapability of a large sector of American society, first in the South, then in the North too, to adapt to social, economic and political changes. To these people, the world had turned insane. Since they did not, however, see any other way out, they turned against the weakest link of society and this was the \\"Black Man\\" in the South.Another disappointment is the absence of sources and references. What is the description of a Klan lynching worth if I do not know where the author has the story from?Three stars were given as the book includes a large variety of Klan crimes that may be useful in order to describe what the Klan in certain times and in certain places did.However, it certainly misses an explanation. Facts alone are not good enough. Analysis is necessary. Here the book is weak.Recommendable to buy only if you are interested in plain facts. Book references you will not find."},{"Title":"The Fiery Cross: The Ku Klux Klan in America","review":"With the exception of the appendixes, Wyn Wade has written a book so obviously biased in favor of anti-Klan propaganda tha he may as well have not done any research at all. A telling mark is the fact that Wade dedicated the book to his \\"Radical Republican\\" grandmother. Wade glosses over the horrors inflicted upon the White population of the South during the reconstruction, choosing instead to do everything but pin knighthoods on the carpetbaggers, scalawags, Yankee imperialists and their negro henchmen. Klans of later decades don't fair much better as Wade manages to portray them as either idiot yahoos or psychotics. Wade neglects to mention the many good deeds of the Klan and fails to differentiate between activity of legitimate members of the Invisible Empire and that of criminals hiding behind the orders hoods. Wade is a propagandist of the worst kind and, if there were any justice in the world, he'd be tarred and feathered and hung."},{"Title":"Ancestors and descendants of James and Elizabeth (Gormly) Smyth","review":"I don't understand why there are so few reviews for this book on Amazon, only one. Perhaps it seems to be such an esoteric subject to most people, I don't know. There are many reviews for Hemming's companion book, \\"the Conquest of The Incas\\". This book is perhaps even better, as I believe it involved more research and it deals with a subject that has been generally ignored by historians of Latin American for some reason; that is the exploration of the northern portion of South America, specifically. We know the search for the \\"Gilded Man\\" etc. has been dealt with quite a bit, but the specific exploration of Colombia, Venezuela, the region of the Guianas, and the conquest of the Chibcha Indians much less so. Also this book has something to satisfy the taste of almost any intelligent reader; exotic history, adventure, aboriginal customs, buried treasure, greed, back-stabbing, brutality, perseverance, courage, you name it and again, exploration! This book is not for the the lover of shallow romance novels. It is for the intelligent reader that does not try to morally judge events of the past, which in any case cannot be changed. This book particularly interests me as I lived and owned a house in a region the book covers; the province of Norte de Santander in eastern Colombia., where the conquistadors supposedly buried treasure. The part of the book where the conquistadors of the Federmann expedition encounted dwarf Indians in what is now Venezuela still haunts me. Who were they? What happened to them? I do not believe it was a figment of the conquistadors imagination [like the Amazons] as it seems to be well documented.

Either way, still funny. If you take yourself & everyone else too seriously,don't buy this book.It's funny becuz it paints a rather dismal picture which can be true, but not in all cases. Poverty, bribery, kidnapping, etc. r not funny to the ppl who experience them, but you either laugh or cry.There r some ppl in my family w/numbers tattooed on their arms but they still have a sense of humor. How about u?Mebbe it's what kept em sane.I'm buying my BFF another copy so she won't steal mine & covet all the others in the series. Can't wait to see how they mutilate the other cultures!Is there one by someone in another country about the US?

I read this book to my 9 years old son, and we both enjoy it. He checks the map, reads over my shoulder, retells the things he learned from this book to other people; and the word \\"geography\\" is not some dull and dusty word for him, it sounds like \\"an adventure\\". I have to tell him about some changes, but this makes it even more interesting to him. I got \\"Children's History of the World\\" and \\"Children's History of the Art\\" by the same author.

Like the chocolate assortment, you devour some hungrily, taste some others cautiously, chew some dutifully once you've started them, and a few you toss aside or quietly dispose of tactfully. I wish the veteran publisher and man of letters David Marcus had told us where these \\"best new\\" stories had originated. I presume \\"first time in print\\" means that the authors submitted them to him for selection? I mention this since it does seem a jumble of established and less-known writers, and his brief introduction sheds no light on how these were gathered or commissioned.Since they are then joined here only by fact of the authors being born in (or in a few cases Irish American or Irish in Britain) Ireland, there's no other reason. The Irishness of the selections varies, but with the exception of a couple, few of these recalled the short-story Chekhovian influences that inspired the past century's canonical Irish tale-tellers. One of the contributors, Gerard Donovan, seemed surprised after a reading of his new novel (Julius Winsome-- also reviewed by me), that none of us asked him why he did not write about Ireland. For him, it simply holds no interest. Many of the stories in this volume also reveal little of the local lore and the evocations of nature or the tensions of politics and warfare that the previous two generations of Irish storytellers would have been expected to address in their efforts. A sign of cultural maturity? Rejecting sectarianism? Or testimony to the Anglo-American consumer hegemony that has been embraced by the Irish themselves?I wondered if the story arrangement would reveal such resonance in the sequential order, but I could not find this. So, reach in and judge which ones you think are worth the effort of pulling up. As Amazon has a \\"search inside\\" feature and you can call up the table of contents, I will mention only the authors' names, not the titles of their stories. These are the ones, roughly in order of their appearance, that I thought most worthy of preserving:Roddy Doyle in clipped, no-nonsense fashion, takes us inside the mind of an Irish (presumably by the diction) man approaching middle age whose wife appears to be about to leave him. Gerard Donovan also takes us into the mind of a Midwestern middle-aged man whose sanity has, we slowly realize, left him, although naturally he is unaware of this condition. Both writers offer well-rounded characters, efficient use of details, and know when to shift up and shift down as they control their narratives. Both Doyle and Donovan compress characteristic qualities that mark their novels, with the literary language deceptively transparent at times only to bring us in and trap us with its true opacity.Hugo Hamilton in his two full-length memoirs has delved tangentially into how Ireland exports its self-image through its kitsch. In a well-honed yet very short story \\"The Homesick Industry,\\" he neatly pits the emergence of Hamilton's present-day advanced and globalizing Ireland against the products it manufactures that depend upon its romanticization of an austere and harsh peasant culture. He literally wraps up his story.Colum McCann gives a brief vignette of a boy taken from a war-torn land to safety; George O'Brien includes in his long story a man escaping his Balkan homeland and German violence to find not only asylum but a vigorous suitor in a tale that, if for me was too shaggy-dog and galumphing and just plain too long, most reminiscent in its details and dialogue of the earlier tale-telling tradition of O'Faolain and O'Connor.Neil Jordan also recalls 20c tradition; his take on Othello is clever, with the narrator's voice appealingly irritating, while the end reminded me of Nabakov's \\"And In Aleppo Once.\\" Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n relates deftly the aftermath of a mother's funeral with the realization by the son of his sudden attraction, after a rave on a Wicklow beach, for one of his male friends. Mary Burke nods to Borges in her sly and wry fable that spins off of the ancient myth of \\"Hy-Brasil\\"; Niall Williams tries, if less memorably, to capture the \\"tale-told-to-me-by-a...\\" aura with what adds up to an old-fashioned story with a moral, that takes place on the Peruvian-Bolivian frontier.I never thought I'd be that interested in a story that veers away from an a love affair to a Himalayan mountaineering challenge, but Dermot Somers applies his real-life skill as a climber to verbally maneuver our way with caution through what proves to be quite a gripping adventure. The contrast between the Dublin city past and the raw icy present makes for a bracing and intriguingly handled account. I felt like I entered a chapter from a much longer novel about the climbers, and the depth of what at first read appears a straightforward story is considerable.A couple of other stories held even if for me they did not sustain their initial promise; others may rank these higher. Molly McCluskey observes sharply the details of blaring and assaultive, jittery Dublin as a city crammed with inhabitants who appear to wish desperately to differ little from anxious (post-)moderns in any other trafficked and tech-driven metropolis. Claire Keegan's fairy-tale told within what seems an endless story appealed more to me than the larger narrative. William Wall's set-up of a translator happy in his Mediterranean retirement and the incongruity of his translating Dante's Inferno, with its echoes of the distant North of Ireland and its gentle satire of the publishing world enriches his story, even if as a taut narrative it seemed to me too slack.Edna O'Brien in her impressive style recalls Molly Bloom's ruminations on love and lust, although the story erodes under the fluidity of the steady prose. Bl&aacute;naid McKinney and Mary Morrisy follow suit with their evocations of, respectively, an embittered TV weather reporter and a child's dressing up in mom's clothes. Both writers pile up images and descriptions with exactitude and delight, and even if their stories also were subsumed for me within the language, the language is a delight.These are some of the 23 entries. Although any collection's nearly certain to have its hits and misses, these vary with the reader.

It is basically the day-to-day diary entries of a member of the American Volunteer Group (AVG), the \\"Flying Tigers\\" of World War II fame with additional material to set the entries in context. As such, it should be a valuable historical reference for anyone seeking insight into the internal workings of the AVG, the personal thoughts, struggles, adventures, and misadventures of those in that group, and, in particular, the exploits of those in the First Squadron of the AVG.I found the book to be interesting and quite factual; particularly since the entries in the diary were made at the time the events actually took place and in many instances detailed the actions of the man making the entries. I had hoped, however, that this book would tell the broader story of the AVG, based on the diary entries, rather than simply restating the actual records. But it didn't. As a result, I found the book to be somewhat narrow in scope. I say that since the author of the diary was in the First Squadron of the AVG which was generally remote from the other two squadrons. As a consequence, virtually all of the diary entries relate to the exploits of the Adam and Eve Squadron and the personnel in that squadron. The missions and actions of those in the Second and Third Squadrons (the \\"Pandas\\" and \\"Hell's Angels\\"), such as Tex Hill and Ed Rector were touched upon lightly, but much was left out. Of note, however, the cumulative entries in the diary did present a somewhat different picture of Gregory \\"Pappy\\" Boyington than I have seen in other venues.Since the book is in diary form with many missing dates, it is somewhat difficult to read and, as you might expect in this form, there is some lack of continuity. One diary entry doesn't necessarily relate to the one before or the one after. Nevertheless, this book includes some valuable and noteworthy information and should be of interest to anyone seeking to learn more about the Flying Tigers."},{"Title":"A Flying Tiger's Diary (Centennial Series of the Association of Former Students, Texas A&M; University)","review":"General Bond kept a diary during his year with the American Volunteer Group. Unfortunately, it was slightly edited for publication, so we don't in all cases get his unvarnished view.

There's some historical context provided by historian Terry Anderson."},{"Title":"A Flying Tiger's Diary (Centennial Series of the Association of Former Students, Texas A&M; University)","review":"as one one of the remarkable \\"Flying Tigers\\". Charles Bond was a young man who longed to fly fighter planes but found himself stuck flying four engined bombers. When the chance to resign from the Army Air Corps and fulfill his dream of flying fighters came along he jumped at it and never looked back. His book is a fine record of his time with the American Volunteer Group and is filled with personal insight on his fellow pilots and the very valuable ground people of the AVG. He became an ace and also himself underwent the harrowing experience of being shot down and wounded during his service with the storied AVG.His descriptions of the somewhat lively air combat, his thoughts on Claire Chennault, Greg Boyington, and his feelings about China make for a fine read. Bond had a long and distinguished military career and he retired from the Air Force as a Major General."},{"Title":"A Flying Tiger's Diary (Centennial Series of the Association of Former Students, Texas A&M; University)","review":"Charlie Bond kept a diary of his experiences while flying with the American Volunteer Group, popularly known as the Flying Tigers. This book covers this time in his life, with a brief preamble and a brief postamble. Bond retired from the USAF as a Major General, and had many varied experiences after his tour with the AVG, but this book is 95% Flying Tigers.Claire Chennault, and the AVG, went against the grain. Army Air Corps doctrine was that the bomber will always get through. Chennault thought differently, and showed that doctrine was incorrect during interwar maneuvers, and was allowed to retire for his efforts. He was hired by the Chinese to rebuild the Chinese air force, and was a confidant of Chiang Kai-Chek, and also the very powerful Madame Chiang. He taught his tactics to the AVG pilots, and they set records that were embarrassing to the Army Air Corps hierarchy.Bond explains some of the higher-level activities, but stays mainly with his own experiences as a pilot flying Curtiss P-40's This book really shows the nitty-gritty of life in a war-torn third-world country, and is a must-read for anyone interested in the AVG history, and a should-read for everyone else."},{"Title":"A Flying Tiger's Diary (Centennial Series of the Association of Former Students, Texas A&M; University)","review":"This Book came in near perfect condition.

I respect the work she has produced, but cannot see why a book of this size was produced when there was no lack of research materials for her to work with.The book comes across better as a series of case studies rather than a historical or politcal retrospective, and needs to be reclassified as such. Perhaps I will be accused of nitpicking, but with the right mounting another round of attacks on GLBT rights, we need to understand what resources we have available for our use.As mentioned ealier, this book is worded in a way that would appeal to freshman or new GLBT studies students.

I was completely satisfied with my purchase.Very inspiring book. I will never forget it."},{"Title":"Songs Of Malantor: The Arcturian Star Chronicles Volume Three","review":"Patricia Pereira has written a new book that is full of the same Love and Spirit that has made her two other books treasures in my home. 'Songs of Malantor' is the third book in a continuing series of books channelled from an assortment of 'people' from the star Arcturus. Their thoughts give practical and inspiring advice to us all during these times of great change and Spiritual movement. If you are not familiar with channelled material, it is quite simply thoughts and feelings telepathically received from people or entities in other worlds and dimensions. The thoughts and concepts in Malantor are very uplifted and are moving in ways that older books are not. I see the universal truth in condensed form in the pages of this book that people in all religions hold precious in their hearts. To know that the universe is constructed of a very beautiful building block, namely Love, is reassuring and may lead you to a deeper kind of self-healing as it did for me. Even if you do not believe that the star we call Arcturus has inhabited planets and that they are speaking to us, then you would have to give great credit to Ms. Pereira for her beautiful mind and heart as evidenced by her writing. Here is a quote that particularly struck me as valuable. The beauty contained within it serves to bridge the imagined gap between the New Age seekers and the older established religions, in this case Christianity...&quot;Integrated within these extraterrestrial transcripts are bits of galactic knowledge based on humanity's classic teachings of the one called Jesus, the Christ. He who serves to Earth's evolution is of high-quality celestial energy; we know Him by the essence title Sananda. Christ Essence is Prime Divine Energy for the sun system Sol. He is Light's Ultimate Grace.&quot;And just as this quote reveals the currents that connect different arenas of spiritual seeking, so too does practical advice related to meditation and prayer ring true with everyone:&quot;Internal serenity is conducive to exterior calm. Mental tranquiity is a by-product of routine deep meditation, quiet moments when the mind is kept purposefully still... Learn to erect a mental bridge to intentionally link your thoughts. Allow your mind to bring forth in beauty. Your mind is an artist. Paint majestic pictures with it. Use creative-visualization techniques and affirmation exercises to open your intuitive eye, to strengthen your neural receptors, and to invigorate the mental-energy pulses your brain transmits to your body's tissues and organs.&quot;This is very practical advice cloaked in very poetic prose. It seems that this third book in the projected four-book series has grown in complexity and eloquence while it keeps intact the pragmatic details of its extrasolar messages.For anyone on any branch of the spiritual path, I recommend 'Songs of Malantor'. It is a wonderful entrance to the voulminous channelled material avilable these days. The beauty and love it conveys will outshine any preconceptions of what channelled material is about. It will be especiallyly rewarding for those of you who already read channeled writings and are familiar and comfortable with such wisdom. I feel that this extraterrestrial love and wisdom is the 'new wine' being poured. Take advantage of this milepost that indicates how far as a species we have come when we can see past the limitations and prejudice of the past.Thanks to Patricia Pereira and the folks at Beyond Words Publishing! All is right with me except that I continue to miss Tashaba, the feline energy from Sirius in the previous books. How could I forget a beloved one who purrs, &quot;Come! Come to the stars with Tashaba!&quot;"},{"Title":"Songs Of Malantor: The Arcturian Star Chronicles Volume Three","review":"SONGS OF MALANTOR is a book distinguished by its beauty of appearance, its beauty of words, and its beauty of thought.

However, I found this book to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the science behind several alternative and new-age approaches to healing. It covers everything from acupuncture to Zen philosophy and discusses the scientific studies that have been conducted to determine whether various approaches actually work (she also devotes several pages to the placebo effect).As a scientist, I am very critical of &quot;pop science&quot;, &quot;miracle cures&quot; and unproven alternative medicine. I also know just because something is published in a book (or on the internet), there is no guarantee that the information is accurate or true. However, I trust Dr. Cassileth's professional credentials. In addition to the professional history mentioned in the editorial review, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (one of the top cancer centers in the country) just opened a new department of Integrative Medicine devoted to &quot;addressing the body, spirit and mind&quot; and Dr. Cassileth was made the head of this new department.Despite the title of the book, much of the book focuses on complementary (rather than alternative) therapies that can help patients get through physically and psychologically difficult medical treatment (such as cancer treatment). She also debunks several trendy but scientifically invalidated or unvalidated cancer treatments. She also discusses the potential dangers in the lack of regulation of the herb and supplement industry, while pointing out which of the herbal remedies and vitamins have been shown to have some health benefits.The book is written for the nonscientist, which means that the info is accessible and easy to understand. Science junkies like myself may be left wanting more info on mechanism, and I was quite disappointed by the lack of a reference list citing the various studies of alternative/complementary therapies that have been published in scientifically credible journals.Anyway, if any of you are interested in complementary therapies and ways to reduce stress in your life, I highly recommend this book. I think it's one even your doctor would approve of :-)"},{"Title":"The Alternative Medicine Handbook","review":"It was a dismal surprise to read this book and discover that although the author covered many alternative therapies, he consistently stated that \\"there is no evidence that this (supplement) is effective\\" - which was often untrue. I suspect the author is not actually in favor of supplements as an alternative treatment or preventive measure. There are far better books out there on this subject."},{"Title":"Primitive Christianity in its Contemporary Setting","review":"This book came out in the 1950's and was translated into English by Reginald H. Fuller. Predictably, this book is not light reading. This volume makes it apparent why Dr. Bultmann was and is a prominent theologian. This book has 5 main sections: The Old Testament Heritage, Judaism, The Greek Heritage, Hellenism and Primitive Christianity.Professor Bultmann points out various unique features of ancient Hebrew religion. Their &quot;strong sense of history and election...distinguished Israel from all other nations.&quot; Also, &quot;a non-sacrificial form of worship&quot; such as occurred in the synagogues was unique. Finally, having a God who was not tied to the land was unusual. But the author does believe that the Persians or Iranians influenced ancient Judaism in several doctrines. The resurrection of the body and &quot;hell as a place of torment&quot; came from the east. Also, Babylon and Persia influenced Jewish apocalyptic writings.Bultmann also has important chapters regarding the Mystery Religions, star worship and Gnosticism. According to the author, &quot;Christian sacramental theology differs little from that of Gnosticism...&quot; However, Christians did not adopt the Gnostic idea of the pre-existence of the soul. For Gnostics, their redeemer came before history began. With Christians, Jesus was part of recent history.With Paul and the Stoics, the author sees overlapping ideas and vocabulary. But one key difference is the source of freedom. &quot;The Stoic is free because of his reason.&quot; With Paul, a Christian is made free by the grace of God. The Lord's Prayer is similar in content to Jewish prayers of the day, but it is unique because of its brevity and simplicity. Finally, it is shown that &quot;the early Christian doctrine of man&quot; is very different from the Greek view.In summary, this book succeeds in describing what preceded Christianity, what surrounded it and the early forms it took."},{"Title":"Oh, Please Help Me Save The Tree!

It is probably the first non-Star Trek Sci-Fi book I read as a child and hooked me on the story-telling capabilities of Leigh Brackett. The stories pretty much cover the gamut of man-vs-machine, man-vs-god, man-vs-man. They also address racism, slavery, the despair of being only human in this immense galaxy and the hope and delight in being human in this immense galaxy. The writing style is haunting. The titles are evocative. Try &quot;The Lake of the Gone Forever&quot;, &quot;All the Colors of the Rainbow&quot;, &quot;The Citadel of Lost Ages&quot; or my personal favorite, &quot;The Shadows&quot;. These stories still make me laugh and cry and I am now 38 years old. I hope the publishers will wake up and do a reprint of this book someday."},{"Title":"Dodger Dogs to Fenway Franks: The Ultimate Guide to America's Top Baseball Parks","review":"Great book, I've read it numerous times and every time I enjoy a different aspect I overlooked in the past. From the author's obsession with Frank Sinatra, his driving and dining experiences, to his detailed and gastronomical adventures in baseball parks across America this is one of my favorite road trip books"},{"Title":"Dodger Dogs to Fenway Franks: The Ultimate Guide to America's Top Baseball Parks","review":"I have owned the book \\"Dodger Dogs to Fenway Franks\\" virtually since its publication in 1989. As a baseball fan for many years, I had always myself fantasized of taking the trip Mr Wood did to every baseball stadium in America. Bob Wood's book is quite simply, one of the best books I have ever read in my life. It is a combination of baseball, travel, thrill seeking, and a trip of pleasure that every baseball fan can dream of. While reading the book, I could feel what it would have been like to sit with Mr Wood in his car on that trip. Despite weather, a robbery of his possessions in Northern California, a tight budget, and incredibly long drive, and an impending baseball strike that threatened to wipe out his dream of getting to every stadium, Bob Wood perservered and finished his journey. He achieved his goal through it all, and provided an exciting book that any baseball fan who has ever dreamed of taking the trip should be proud to read. I salute Mr Wood and his accomplishment. While is is now 18 years after his trip, it remains my favorite book of all time, fiction or non fiction. Bravo, Bob, you have created a masterpiece. A book that baseball fans and any readers should be proud of and salute you for."},{"Title":"Dodger Dogs to Fenway Franks: The Ultimate Guide to America's Top Baseball Parks","review":"This enchanted ride through one summer of baseball and hot dogs is not to be missed.

I am very excited to have bought it from Amazon and added it to my library. The rating system will appeal to both the diehard and casual baseball fan.

Seems obvious, but the obvious is seldom stated. She is certainly well-schooled in both fashion and photography. However, neophytes will find it difficult if not impossible to recognize each photographic process even with the best of written descriptions. This skill is attained through experience.Readers may also be in danger of inaccurate dating if they take the guidelines provided in this book too literally. For instance, the popularity of carte-de-visite photographs may have peaked in the 1860s in Philadelphia, but they do not even appear until 1869 in frontier areas and are certainly more typical of the 1870's in Ontario.The chief strength of this book as a resource is in the captions to the illustrations, which include the name and location of the photographer, the photographic format, the name of the sitter(s) if available as well as a few comments to indicate significant aspects of the costume. We don't have to jump to endnotes: the information is right there. Bravo!Harris also knows to use \\"circa\\" (c.) to indicate that the date is a best guess. --And therein lies a weakness. This is yet another work in which photographs have been chosen to illustrate a history, as opposed to basing history on dated photographs as documentary evidence.The warning that dates written on backs of photographs are \\"frequently added long after the photograph was taken\\" disquieted me. Although Harris is absolutely correct to warn us never to make assumptions, I worry that beginners will devalue what might be critical evidence. The fact is that folks often wore out-of-date or very personal choices in dress and that 'questionable' date may turn out to be right.I gave this book three stars out of five for the above reasons, and because it is neither indexed nor sourced. An index based on photographer/city/sitter would have been very useful, and there is no bibliography."},{"Title":"Victorian Fashion in America: 264 Vintage Photographs (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","review":"I liked this book because, although it is mostly studio portriats of Victorians, they are often in everyday dress. If you like old photographs, you like this book, and if your looking for some 'design' elements for historic costumes then you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Victorian Fashion in America: 264 Vintage Photographs (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","review":"Costume resources from this period tend towards drawings from period magazines, and use highly stylized model forms. This great collection of pictures shows a wide range of people, in a fairly wide range of clothing types. The limitations of period phots are that the clothing is almost always the fanciest outfits the person owns, and does not reflect day to day wear. Other photos are clearly theatrical costume, but the author has clearly identified them as such, even where the oroginal information is missing.As with any black and white source, colors are left to your imagination, but the details of finsh and construction that can be gleaned from the photos makes this a necessary tool in researching clothing of this era. Teamed with a Harper's Bazaar drawing reference, and an accessory reference, and you are ready to start making your own victorian clothing!"},{"Title":"Victorian Fashion in America: 264 Vintage Photographs (Dover Fashion and Costumes)","review":"This book is chock full of photos and information...I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the images though.

It definitely won't provide good enough instruction to learn any of the basic techniques or kata, and it isn't very comprehensive, only useful for the extreme beginner while they're still in the beginner stages. The book also only covers the forms chosen for the Seitei Jodo set, ignoring the traditional form sets. A much better book would be the book &quot;Jodo: the Way of the Stick&quot; (aka La voie du baton, I think, the book is split into both English and French sections), which provides a much more comprehensive set of explanations, techniques (covers omote, chuden, and ranai: the Seitei forms are miscellaneous kata chosen from these sets), and background on SMR jodo and budo in general."},{"Title":"Jodo-Way of the Stick","review":"While I won't recomend this book as a must have, it is good for reviewing what you have been taught by a reputably instructor. It's ok for helping one remember terms and as a rough approximation of the actual Katas. However the pictures show poor posture and little or no actual idea of what is happening in each Kata. Don't bother with this unless you study Jodo. It's too bad that this is the only book available in english."},{"Title":"Jodo-Way of the Stick","review":"While the book alone cannot be used to learn Jodo, it is a valuable supplement to training.

This has some anecdotes about the authors time in Japan, History of Jodo, information on the Jo and Gi, before covering various techniques and ways of applying them. The techniques are clear to read and there are black and white photos throughout to further clarify the points raised. Ultimately this is best used in conjunction with training with a Sensei at a dedicated Jodo Dojo and this would make a worthy reference book for use before and after classes. This was originally written in 1984 and hence the style is a little dated now, but overall this is a clear and informative look at this art and is worth considering at some point.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"Title":"Jodo-Way of the Stick","review":"There are a number of technical errors to watch out for in the text and sequencing of pictures. This book is mainly good only for the historical anecdotes."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"I just finished this book last night and I would have to say that it was only average. The storyline for the book was alright, if deviating a little from what I would expect for the Knights to do and allow in that area. However, there just seems to be little things that keep this from becoming a much better book than it is.First of all, there are a lot of times when I am reading the book, that I go wait, what just happened. Something will be going on and then all of a sudden something will happened and it is not really built up to or explained, it just kinda happens. AThe biggest problem however is with the inconsistencies in the book (in my opinion). For one thing he has gnomes in the book for a large part of it, however, with exception of when they introduce themselves and try to spit out their volume long names, they do nothing really gnomish (well there is one thing but i dont want to ruin it for anyone). If anyone has read any of the other Dragonlance books, this is just not how gnomes are, especially if you pick up Conundrum which is all about gnomes. Really I think some further development would be good here.Other than that there are small things, such as I know for a fact that he references Aurak Draconians as being the only draconians that can fly. Completely wrong auraks are quite rare, and have NO wings at all (Sivaks are the ones that can fly). This is something that all he would have had to have done was glance through the DL Campaign Setting. There are other inconsistencies along these lines too.Bottom Line: I hope that the next books in this series improve much, I think there is a decent storyline and development of many of the main characters going on. Now it just needs to go to the next level."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"\\"What happened?\\" I continued to say this phrase to myself throughout my reading of this often frustrating novel, although usually with more colorful words sprinkled in, ranging in depth and skill use...My biggest problem is probably one I created for myself: high expectations. I was really looking forward to this novel for four reasons. One, Douglas Niles wrote it and he often does a good job (granted his last outing with Wizard's Conclave was horrid). Two, cool cover art (I'm a simple creature dazzled by pretty pictures...I admit it). Three, it is set place after the War of Souls so you don't get that \\"happening during\\" junk that has filled dragonlance for the last few years, that eventually leaves you feeling like you've read this story over and over again. Four, it is almost four hundred pages long, which for a dragonlance novel is a big deal, because so often the authors are stuck to the three hundred number on punishment of torture or something if they go over it... and the novels usually suffer for it.Length has nothing to do with the suffering in \\"Lord of the Rose\\". It's a novel that has an awesome premise and a very good plot to it, but the prophecy of its greatness just wasn't fulfilled. Basically we join the action when Solamnia is rebuilding, having taken over most of the major cities for the Dark Knights, and are now continuing that work while the three factions (crown, sword, rose) each surrounding one of the large cities, are feuding over the small city of Garnet and the gem mines near it. If matters weren't bad enough, a powerful lord was recently murdered, his flaming sword of prophecy stolen, and the Assassin still roams the land. Not to mention there are about a bajillion goblins forming into an army ready to smack the knights around.However, despite the great set up, Niles bogs this novel down with a horrible writing style that just has you shaking your head, groaning in pain each time he uses phrases like \\"and he looked\\", \\"in fact\\", \\"now this\\", \\"for it was said\\", etc. He so often tells you what is happening instead of painting a picture that it makes you want to cry. Because of this the descriptions are \\"blah\\", like reading a bad history novel, and the fight scenes are often so \\"blah\\" that I would just skip over them, thinking \\"if you read one you read them all\\". Added to this, some of the dialogue is corny, over the top, and unrealistic.The style began to really bug me until I finally went back to one of my bookshelves and started to rummage through it, searching until I found all my Douglas Niles books. At first I thought that maybe his writing was always like this and I was just in a bad mood or maybe I remembered him being better because I was younger when I read his books. But neither of those were the case. The writing in his other novels I skimmed through were sometimes a little off, but it was descriptive, had good flow, very rarely did he use the phases mentioned above, and there wasn't an amateur feel to it like \\"Lord of the Rose\\".Final Thought: So what happened? How did a novel by an author that has written thirty novels, many of which were very good, with such a great plot, end up so amateur? Maybe he rushed it. Maybe the editors didn't push him enough, maybe...maybe...maybe. We'll probably never know. I probably expected too much and I'm probably being too hard on this novel, but it feels too uninspired and has so much wasted potential. I really hope the second novel in the trilogy is better, but I'm not going to look forward to it like I did the first. A 2.5 out of 5, rounded down.Added Thought: Get ready for gunpower and guns dragonlance fans, because they are well on the way to Ansalon."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"After reading the four reviews, I expected an inferior book. However, such was not the case. Perhaps there are some (minor) mistakes, but do these mistakes really matter considering that the plot is great? Do we really care about how Draconians look when Jaymes is finding out who the assasin is? I did find one weak spot which is that Jaymes is looking for the explosive material while we know nothing about why he needs it. However the rest of the book is perfect! I especially liked Coryn's involvement in the plot and the mystery of who is the murderer. I was disappointed when I found out that the bad guys have Hiddukel's help while the knights (and Jaymes) don't have Kiri Jolith's help. Also I enjoyed the way in which the author made Princess Selinda an important character, which was not as I expect from a princess of Palanthas. I truly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"Great book, well written and exciting.

Especially with all the dukes and whatnot. Jaymes is a character I never grew to like or actually care for. A little too much convenient magic in this book and way too much teleporting. Plus characters seemed to move armies all around the land as if water. I'll continue the series."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"I will start by saying that I have not read any of the other titles in the Dragonlance realm - that's right, not one of them. I picked this book up on a whim, I was looking for something in the Fantasy genre to read as opposed to ANOTHER Sci-Fi book. That being said I was pleasntly surprised by this read, I rather enjoyed this book and have subsequently recommended it to some of my friends. The characters were ones that you can picture in your mind and the settings left me with wonderful images of great mountain ranges and incredibly majestic castles. I felt that this book was worth the 7 or so dollars I spent on it. All in all a good read."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"I thought this was a good book as far as reading goes. I didnt like how their was so much time in between the books or that they are moving this series into a more technologicaly based warfare. The characters were interesting and well-rounded. I thought he could have gone into a more detailed description of the battles that take place. All in all i liked this book and cant wait for the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"Let me first say that this trilogy has a lot of promise. I have always enjoyed reading about the knights of Solomnia... yet, this book just didn't do much for me.It's not a terrible book by any means,but at the same time when you see the name Douglas Niles as the author you some how expect more. Maybe Niles is a victim of his own sucess and this is simply a small bump in an otherwise great writing career.I think some of the problems in this book revolve around editor errors. After all the final say of when a book is printed rests witht he editor. They are the final check and balance for continuity. There are some aspects of this book, where you will read a paragraph and suddenly jump to somewhere else with no warning leavingtohe reader to wonder what just happened.When you get by the editorial mistake the actual story is a very good read. Great action sequences and characters, but the editing will bring down it's overall score.Again, I think with a different edior for the second book, this trilogy has a lot of promise."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"I was really, really looking forward to this series, because out of the entire 'universe' of Dragonlance, I find the Solamnic Knights and their culture to be the most fascinating.That being said, I had to put this book down several times. It was bad. At other times, I just rolled my eyes and skipped ahead a few pages, which I never, ever do. The battle scenes were well written in my opinion, but the characters are just so bad. They were flat, boring, they didn't develop or learn from their mistakes.And while I'd never describe myself as a feminist, I found myself at times out right offended by the way the female characters were treated in this series. Gone were the strong female characters like Laurana and Kitiara, replaced instead by women who at the first sign of showing any strength or character get killed or knocked up, and locked away. Or spend their time fawning over the main character, which just gets obnoxious. Grow a spine, ladies.The first book was ok, the second I struggled through, but still held out hope. The third, I admit, I just had to skip entire sections, looking for SOME redeeming parts. But there were none. I'd like my money back Mr. Niles."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"Not that great I'm afraid. The story line needs serious rework in order to be decent. The unerlining concept of this book is sound, but the execution leaves lots to be desired. Read something else unless your a die hard fan.If you like books like this one, might I suggest another I've recently come across. The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. It's another fantasy adventure sure to please. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"Unlike other reviewers I have read on this subject, I either had not read other Douglas Niles books, or did not remember the author. With this in mind, I did not have over-the-top expectations for this book.I did, however, believe that with venturing out into the Post-War of Souls era, that there was little that could be done to screw the book up. It couldn't have that \\"I know whats going to happen\\" feeling, and with the Queen of Darkness gone, seeing who stepped into her shoes would be exciting all on its own.Even these small expectations were dashed against the wayside.While it was difficult to predict what was going to happen, that was mostly due to the convulated plot lines....along with the fact that the prevalent God was Hiddukel, the Prince of Lies. While having Hiddukel as the main evil God does add a new twist to the series (Takhisis never really had people act faithful to Paladine while serving her), it was not quite as exciting as one might think.The whole murder mystery surrounding Lord Lorimar's death is certainely intriguing, but Jaymes does not seem to start his quest to unravel it until near the end of the book. Until then, he is searching for gnomes who do not act....well....gnomish, in the hopes that they can make him some exploding powder (unimaginatally called compound), that he has no immediate use for.That is what I believe seals the fate of DragonLance. Introducing gunpowder into a series that has drawn in thousands with stirring swordfights and magical battles is a fatal mistake that will be difficult to recover from. Instead of hearing tales of honorable knights holding the line against bloodthirsty savages, we'll be hearing barroom stories about snipers.While that may sound a little extreme, it is the only fate I can see if gunpowder is kept in the series. Could the same effect not be accomplished with a spell? That would at least fit well into the series.Hopefully the next novels in this series will not fill me with the sense of doom I get when I read this one."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"First of all, I'd like to say: For all of you out there that are going to read this book-THIS IS NOT A REGULAR DOULAS NILES BOOK!(In a bad way ,I mean)Other titles such as \\"Flint the King\\" and \\"Wizards Conclave\\" ,by this author,were much better. Usualy Douglas makes you really turned in by his writing . When I first picked up this book, I was expecting another fascinating novel and a pretty good read.But I was really let down by one of the best authors the Dragonlance world ever had .The next thing I want to talk about is the lack of reserch done in the creating of this novel ... Aurak draconians have no wings and can't fly,though,auraks have great talent in magic.(only sivaks can) ,when a black Dragon spawn dies he does not melt into acid but explodes and showers a non fatal acidic spray on all its surroundings. Another thing about BLACK Dragon spawn is that most of them are not ordinary spawn .As known with Jean Rabes \\"Dahamon saga\\" the black dragon overlord prefered mutant spawn made not out of humans, but from other races such as elves and dwarfs and such.so if you are writing about a huge colony of black spawn you should make more of them to be mutant spawn.The gnomes are another case that i will say in 3 words: NOT GNOME LIKE!. And last but not least, I never heard of the order of solamnic knights divide like that in the war of soul trilogy... but its and interesting twist I must say....All in all the worst title of douglas niles i've ever read and if he dissapoits me again I will stop getting his titles.."},{"Title":"Lord of the Rose (Dragonlance: Rise of Solamnia, Vol. 1)","review":"--- Spoilers in Review ---Simply horrible, the whole deal of it, starting with the gnomes who are \\"friendly scienticts\\", second the goblins who become masters of strategy that outmanover solamanic knights ?

He is best known for his opposition to poverty, social exclusion and the Mafia on Sicily, and is considered to be one of the protagonists of the non-violence movement in Italy. He became known as the \\"Gandhi of Sicily\\".Danilo Dolci was born near Trieste, northern Italy in 1927, a son of a devout Slav mother and a sceptical Italian father who worked for the railways and became a station master. Dolci originally studied architecture in Rome, Milan, Switzerland, and also trained as an engineer. As a student he published works on the science of construction and the theory of reinforced concrete. He was hailed as a man with a brilliant future.Dolci first came to Sicily because of its ancient beauty, in particular its Greek buildings, spending time studying the ruins. In 1954 he returned to rural western Sicily and stayed for the rest of his life, throwing away a professional future. He settled in Trappeto - a slum area of Partinico, a province of Palermo - in an area notorious for banditry and poverty. Dolci married one of his neighbours, a widow with five children. From their small house with none of the usual conveniences he launched his campaign against the misery that surrounded him.Dolci, his family and followers faced the hostility of the church, the government, landowners and the mafia. He charted his work in a book - The Outlaws of Partinico.\\"The illness of violence cannot be cured by greater violence\\"Dolci could see that men became bandits because they had no money for medicines and started committing kidnappings and robberies. Generally, he said, local people thought it was wrong to deny a person the right to risk their lives for their family as they were expected to do so in the armed forces for their country.\\"There was no law and order\\", which meant that the local people had to become a law unto themselves. Once people had sold all of their possessions to buy food, they were forced to break the law. Because of the poverty there were countless robberies. Every new day brought hundreds more as everybody was forced to steal. Times were so hard that the poor even stole from each other. Because the police were not respected and could make matters worse, much crime was not reported. \\"The people lost all self control\\" and \\"the hungry became bandits.\\"Another big problem was that of police persecution. Dolci claimed this was \\"at the bottom of the banditry\\" in the area, made worse because the people were so hungry. Abuses committed by the forces of law and order included summary arrest, torture, thievery, bribery and other forms of corruption. In chilling accounts of police brutality, Dolci recorded how Sicilians were tortured with water-boarding, electric shocks, beatings, sexual abuse, verbal abuse, burning with cigarettes, suffocation and summary execution. Also the police would rob ordinary people's houses. Once corrupt officers knew there was food or resources at a particular location they were likely to continue until it was all gone.The police occasionally arrested suspects and after torture and other interrogation techniques produced a confession. Often, after months or years in jail, many suspects were found not guilty and released by the courts. Faced with this, the Carabinieri took to arresting whole families in an attempt to force wanted men out of hiding. On one occasion, the police rounded up everybody they could across a huge area of the countryside. So many contadini were detained that the police barracks was full and many suspects were locked up in a disused distillery.In this way, many bandits - in reality, the rural poor - were forced into exile and lived as \\"wild beasts.\\" So the poor peasants were caught between the law, landowners and Cosa Nostra. However, thieves that were protected by the mafia were able to prosper, while others were turned into the police or murdered.Animals that were stolen by the mafia were often disguised by the thieves so their original owners would never recognise them again. Also, Cosa Nostra had contacts with other criminal organisations on the mainland and would regularly ship stolen animals to them for distribution or the knacker's yard.Yet \\"The police knew all about the mafia and were sometimes hand in glove with them.\\" Not surprisingly, the links between politicians and the mafia were more obvious during election periods. Across the whole of Sicily Cosa Nostra exercised an intimidating influence on politics. Although many of the mafia were very powerful, most of them were uneducated and had never been to school. They often had to get their sons and daughters to keep their accounts and read letters and communicate with them when they were in prison.\\"The illness of violence cannot be cured by greater violence\\"Partinico, Trappeto and Montlepre had a combined population of approximately 33,000 yet only one of the 350 outlaws from the area was raised in a family with both parents reaching past the third elementary grade of school. Dolci calculated that the \`bandits' he studied completed 650 years at school compared to more than 3000 years in prison.\\"There is a world of the condemned in our midst; condemned to death by we ourselves.\\"In a cost benefit analysis, Dolci noted that it cost 13 million lire per month to pay for the prison service, security forces and police force on Sicily, yet there was no provision for relief for families of men in prison or who had been killed. In less than 10 years over 4 billion lire was spent on repressive actions while over 4000 people were unemployed.In an attempt to work out the scale of the problem, Dolci and his followers began to measure all kinds of social facts in the area. They counted people, families, the unemployed and land. They quickly realised that underemployment and unemployment were serious ills and this was made worse by the seasonal nature of the work - men might only get paid for 6-8 months. Other important issues identified by Dolci were waste and inefficiency. For example, agriculture suffered greatly from lack of water and fertilizer.The whole island suffered from lack of educational attainment. Dolci noted there was significant under-attendance at schools, no public library or theatre in the town, and in the poorer areas, no running water or drains. The area had hardly any poor relief, a very high infant mortality and a very low standard of education. Medical care was poor or nonexistent, and what there was suffered from a shortage of staff, equipment and medicine.One of Dolci's great achievements was to chart the actual deprivation in Sicily. One of the ways he and his helpers did this was to go out and interview ordinary people about their lives. This work produced some fantastic accounts of ordinary Sicilian life and they also created tables showing the lack of schooling of so-called bandits and their parents. The tables recorded time in prison, exile and on probation and comments show many were killed or injured through their encounters with the police.Dolci argued that if real efforts had been made to find gainful work for the people of Sicily then most criminal acts would have been avoided. In an area where land is scarce and unemployment and underemployment is common, it was not surprising that men were prepared to steal to save the children from starvation. People in the area were so desperate, that Dolci recounts how they were stealing metal from an ammunition dump when a shell exploded and killed 23 people including children. In Montelpre there were no public lavatories or showers and Dolci said the children mostly ran \\"wild in the streets.\\"Dolci suggested using the money for the upkeep of the police to build the dam on the river Jato which would enable the local people to irrigate their land without paying the mafia for the privilege.Dolci estimated the money spent in10 years on the legal system, prisons and the police force and argued that if this had been spent on supporting the population then law and order would have been maintained. He also suggested there should have been one social worker for every police officer.Dolci argued that we must work towards the truth - to bring transparency and light into the dark places - to show up the poverty and the desperation. To achieve this end, Dolci deliberately exposed volunteers to some of the worst slums Sicily had to offer - often the sights and smells were too much for educated westerners to bear.He recorded stories of child abuse at the hands of nuns at the religious schools in Sicily. Children recounted being locked in small dark rooms, being beaten and tied up, made to stand in cold places, being sent to bed hungry and being made to stand on sharp objects.As can be seen from the above, to be a poor child in Sicily was to be at risk of abuse from many sources. Child prisoners suffered especially. With no social security and any provision for families of convicted men, they were at great risk of starvation and ultimately death. Not surprisingly, prostitution flourished with the poorest women being bought and sold for a small amount of money. As usual, violence was employed to keep women in line and make them work for their mafia bosses. Echoing Jesus's words, \\"forgive them lord they know not what they do\\", Dolci claimed we hurt each other and damaged the planet because \\"we know not what we do\\".\\"Perhaps we are beginning to believe, at last, that to sow good is to reap good.\\"Dolci realized that Partinico, the small town he was working with, was a microcosm of the whole world. The conflicts and challenges he found there were repeated a billion times over globally."},{"Title":"Legal Research and Writing for Paralegals (Teacher's Manual)","review":"Pissed. Didn't recieve.

To my surprise, I learned a lot.I spent the whole day today in a law library working on a homework assignment. I keep thinking to myself how grateful I was to the author for writing this book because it helped me tremendously with the assignment.

I realize that this is a very general review and more specific reviews are very helpful. However, I don't think you go wrong if you get this look to do legal research, and you can always send it back. My only regret, is that I didn't get the hardcover.

A lot of the special factory tools are almost impossible to find and this dissapointed me quite a bit. As it does not cover later engines, transmissions, etc. it would be helpful to have other manuals and books to help you with your VW restoration. Books I would recommend are the later VW model service manuals by Bentley and Haynes and the How To Rebuild book by Tom Wilson. If you want to tune your VW there is Bill Fishers How to Hotrod book which is ancient (1971) but still very relevant to tuning aircooled VWs. If in doubt you can participate in online VW forums and ask questions. It took me 6 months to rebuild my VW motor following instructions in this book and other service manuals (Haynes, Autobooks). 5 of those 6 months were for research and getting all the necessary tools ready.

I have read all of Mr. Gregory's books, listened to most of his CD's, and attended several of his lectures at universities throughout the country. Unfortunately, and somewhat amazingly, most of his books are out of print! This is possibly due to his refusal to become &quot;mainstream&quot; at any cost. Nevertheless, &quot;Callus On My Soul&quot; is a great way to catch up and see a lot of what you've missed . . . And chances are, you've missed a lot! Whatever you may think about Dick Gregory, this is irrefutable: He has always been (and remains) funny, controversial, angry, obsessed, and a true Holy Man (in the tradition of Jesus Christ himself) . . . AND &quot;Brother Greg&quot; has never lied to you! His previous books include &quot;No More Lies&quot; (History), &quot;Dick Gregory's Political Primer&quot; (Political Science), &quot;The Shadow That Scares Me&quot; (Sociology), &quot;Nigger&quot; (his autobiography), &quot;Up From Nigger&quot;, &quot;Code Name Zorro&quot;, &quot;From the Back of the Bus&quot;, &quot;Write Me In&quot; (he collected 1.5 million write in votes for President of the United States in 1968), &quot;Dick Gregory's Bible Tales&quot;, and &quot;Dick Gregory's Natural Diet For Folks Who Eat&quot; (look for them at used book stores or perhaps at amazon.com, but . . . This book is arguably his best! The easiest to find is &quot;Nigger&quot;, and remember, if ever you hear that word . . . They are advertising one of his books . . . And contributing to his income!"},{"Title":"Callus on My Soul : A Memoir","review":"To those who might consider this a biased review, I want to first say that reading this book will transform your life and your beliefs about about everything. From the truth about racism to facts about love and humor.I want to say that I have have had the honor, the pleasure and the God-given reward to have been the friend of Dick Gregory for 36 years. So if you were to judge my words on a prejudice you would be right. But that just makes me a more informed reporter regarding whether or not you should read this book.Over the past 5 decades we have benefitted from what he has done. Dick Gregory has spent, going to jail for us to break the bonds of prejudice? We are certainly grateful that someone so courageous as Dick Gregory has used his fame, the notoriety he earned from his wit and wisdom to communicate -- though he made it a point to forever stop performing in nightclubs, though it cost him millions of dollars, because he knew it was a travesty to sell liquor or cigarettes to people because these were deadly substances. So he gave up the wealth that so many stars, entertainers, celebrities, etc. had access to. Why? Because he was a man of truth. He remains a man of truth.While he had married the woman of his dreams, the woman of his life, Lil Gregory (forgive me for using the familiar first name but after knowing them for 35 years it's second nature to me now), he also sought to communicate the tragic, and heinous ills of society's prejudice and racism, through a method of communication that he learned in school. In 'Nigger' the first Dick Gregory autobiography, and in &quot;Callus On My Soul,&quot; the second autogiogaphy by Dick Gregory and Shelia Moses, he told of his dilemma for survival.He was small and not able to prevail on the street corner or in the schoolyard without something extra. Had he been a giant, strong and awesome physically, it would have been easy. But Gregory was smart, he was gifted intellectullay and most of all he was funny, comical, and had a talent for humor. If you can make people laugh, you can lower their defenses. So Greg began a lifetime of making people laugh. It started with a need to survive but it continued to flood a nation which had never seen the wit and wisdom of such a person.At the same time, Gregory was in command of his physical self. This would be something that would define his life many years later. While in his school years, he became a champion long distance, cross-country runner, and eventually he became the champion of the State of Missouri.Humor was his entry into history and his commitment was his entry into a life of dedication to the civil rights movement with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and many others. The experiences he relates in his book are enough to give you chivers because of his creativity, born of his talent for humor in some cases, but also his courage, such as to call for and be granted a face-to-face meeting with the Ayatollah Khomeni during he incarceration of the Americans who worked at the U.S. Embassy in Iran.Gregory is loved wherever he goes. He's the most sought after lecturer at all U.S. colleges and has been for more than two decades. But he's not only an extraordinary example of a father of ten grown kids who are all people for society to acknowledge as the kind of people we all would like to have as our children, ttheir achievements being so admirable that it might look as if Iwere fabricating them to make this look good for Gregory. But he's a man who we can all learn from, he knows no boundries, between men or women, racial divides, religious differences, or any other type of bigotry. You must at least read about Dick Gregory, because he is a man of humor, which is the greatest stress reliever of all pursuits, but because he will give you some very clear insight into what you can do to improve our world. And you will be better for it."},{"Title":"Callus on My Soul : A Memoir","review":"I am so awed and inspired by reading Dick Gregory's latest book. His life reads like an adventure through the most turbulent times of the 20th century. Friend to presidents, civil rights leaders, and industry giants, Dick Gregory doesn't fail to enlighten, inspire and fascinate the reader. He has been there done that for over 35 years. Now that our country faces a crisis, I hope Dick Gregory will be there for us with his commentary, his insight and wisdom.I wish he would have written more about his successes in the '80's with his weight loss programs, his work with the National Organization of Circumcision Information Resource Centers (NOCIRC) and his circumcision trauma, the Black Panther party, Tupac Shakur, the Bush family, and his vision for the future.Ah, but hopefully his next book will include that! I recommend this book highly. I only wish I could hear him lecture in person."},{"Title":"Callus on My Soul : A Memoir","review":"Brother Greg believes O.J. is innocent. That is hard to believe, and there is some paranoia with his thinking. Conspiracy theories make for good fiction, but some of it is enlightening and believable. Mr. Gregory is a great man, and has a lot of knowledge. He is very smart. He is very funny, but he is also obsessed. If he calms down, he would do better. I love him. He is trying so hard to stop world hunger, and wants people to be slim and trim, and not fat as a pig. He wants justice. If people were more like Mr. Gregory, the world would be a much better place."},{"Title":"Callus on My Soul : A Memoir","review":"Another hero in African American &amp; American His-story. This book should be on the shelf next to The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Sure to become a classic!!! How many people you know have worked this hard?"},{"Title":"Callus on My Soul : A Memoir","review":"With choices come sacrifice, and in Dick Gregory's book CALLUS ON MY SOUL, he tells the story of his life and shares with readers both the positive things he gained and the things he has had to forego as a result of his decisions. He tells of his childhood, which included a life of poverty, racism, and an absentee father. But more importantly, Gregory shares how he learned as a child to use humor as a way to transcend his difficult life experiences and gain peer acceptance. This would serve as an omen for the important role that comedy would play in his later life. As Gregory tells of his developing career as a comedian, readers quickly see the sacrifices that he and his family made in order to achieve the level of fame that he ultimately became known for. A great portion of the book is dedicated to Gregory's experiences and commitment to social causes. He relates to readers his experiences in the civil rights and human rights struggles, and tells of his personal experiences with both noteworthy and little known social activists. He tells of how he and other activists sacrificed their careers, physical safety, and time with family in order to stand up for what they believe in.Because Dick Gregory has played such an integral role in so many historical events relating to civil and human rights, this book is so much more than a memoir. Anyone who picks this book up receives a new insight into many of the events that shaped the history of the United States. In addition, Gregory shares his own political views and opinions with a boldness and clarity that makes it evident that he is indeed an activist at heart. He also tells of the unwavering support of his wife and ten children as he fasted, went on cross country marathons, and even traveled the world leaving them at home.

From the first page, I was drawn into his experience as if I were actually transitioning through pre-Civil Rights Era, the Movement, and the post-era that has evolved into today. Sometimes the pain of Gregory's experiences was so real that I literally felt the dull pain of sympathy in my gut, the tragic feeling that accompanies love or indignation.

As white as he was, he was never going to drive a Mercedes or go to Paris. So the only thing a redneck had to play with was niggers.\\" and that is why when civil rights workers started educating the black folks about slavery the white rednecks were willing to kill to keep them.

Enjoy the comic aspects of the moment; the play will take care of itself. Downer argues that Sheridan envisioned The Rivals as a series of comic scenes, not necessarily a tightly woven plot.In his preface Richard Brinsley Sheridan reminds the readers that this play was not initially well received and, in fact, he had to withdraw the play to remove imperfections. His later version was more successful and today The Rivals is one of the few English comedies from that period that continues to interest modern audiences.I found the beginning slow. The author's wordy preface was followed by a prologue in which two lawyers plead with the audience to give this play fair consideration. On the tenth night a new prologue replaced the pleading as it was now obvious that the revised play was indeed successful. In Act 1 I had some difficulty keeping track of the characters and I chose to reread the first act before proceeding. Thereafter, the going was much smoother and I began to appreciate the foibles of the characters and their confused machinations.The protagonist, the young Captain Absolute, was sensible for the most part, although his plan to woo the capricious Lydia Languish was obviously destined for trouble. The other characters included his excitable father Sir Anthony Absolute, his father's patient ward Julia, the silly Mrs. Malaprop, the comic gentleman wooers Faulkland, Acres, and Sir Lucius O'Trigger, and the conniving servants Fag, David, Thomas, and Lucy. While Sheridan does encourage us to laugh at his characters, his satire is gentle. His characters are not at all unlikable, just a little eccentric and possibly not overly intelligent.I recently read and reviewed Sheridan's enjoyable The School for Scandal and I recommend that the reader new to Sheridan begin with it rather than The Rivals. Both plays are short and can be read with little difficulty with the help of an occasional footnote. For my reading of The Rivals I used the Crofts Classics edition in which Alan Downer provides a useful introduction, a list of key dates in Sheridan's life, footnotes, and a bibliography. I give four stars to The Rivals. I previously rated The School for Scandal as five stars."},{"Title":"The Rivals","review":"This is the first major comedy by Sheridan, a radical Irish actor and politician in George III's England. Not quite as complex and astute as his later She Stoops to Conquer, the Rivals remains a warm, unforgettable, and very, very funny play.Here we meet the chatty Mrs. Malaprop, who proudly tells us &quot;if I reprehend anything in this world, it is the use of my oracular tongue, and a nice derangement of epitaphs&quot;; her niece Lydia, lost in the world of lurid half-bound romantic novels; Sir Anthony Absolute, often wrong but never in doubt; Sir Lucious O'Trigger, of BlunderBuss Hall; and the rest. The dialogue and plot devices are well-crafted and funny; the social commentary is perceptive and satisfyingly naughty; but what stays with you is the humanity of each of the characters. These are not the charicatures of Restoration comedy, but personalties the reader will remember; ridiculous like all humans, but engendering empathy as well as laughter."},{"Title":"The Rivals","review":"My review is not on the content of the play, but on this particular edition of the play.I know everyone has their own reading style, so this may not bother everyone. However, when I'm reading an older piece of literature, I enjoy looking at footnotes. I'm sure that some skip over them, but I do not. In this edition, however, the footnotes were there, but there were no indications in the text to let me know when to look at the footnotes. The only indication was the line number, which was written right before each footnote. This was irritating to me, and so I went through the whole play ahead of time and marked the parts where I had to look for footnotes, which was very time consuming.I would definitely recommend reading the play, because it is very funny and there are a number of interesting literary devices going on that I won't go into here, but I would not recommend this particular edition (New Mermaids)."},{"Title":"The Rivals","review":"Ordered this book for a college english class.

Perhaps my only complaint, however, is the overall quality of the book, which is printed on thick but evidently acidic paper as opposed to coated/glossy paper typically found in DC/Image compilations which I personally prefer. Nevertheless, this is still a good buy even for those who do not usually follow the Marvel mythology since the story is more or less self-contained.I hope they follow this up with a SECRET WARS II compilation (probably unlikely since the second series was comparatively unpopular) with maybe the SECRET WARS III story (as seen in Fantastic Four) included therein.

To find out, it conducts an experiment transporting a couple dozen people to another world and has them bash each others brains out. Predictably, the good guys win.What's good about the story: there are a few twists which enhance the value of the book, firstly, the X-men fiasco, then the Galactus event, the Doctor Doom thing and the somewhat weird ending.The fighting scenes are good, and the powers of each character seem to get a good run.However, there are quite afew areas which the story could improve on. Firstly, like most storylines, the ending is far too abrupt, leaving you somewhat disorientated by the sequence of events. Secondly, none of the characters get any real development (with the exception of Rogue), so the outcome is basically that this whole storyline is produced for an \\"ultimate slugfest\\" theme. Thirdly, the slug fest really isn't much of a slugfest. (and here I contradict myself) There is alot of fighting, but there is so much attempted to be crammed into so little space that none of the character's powers really registers, and it seems to resemble a super-powered bar brawl more than anything else. Finally, there are some really weird things which happen in the story which sorta leaves you thinking \\"huh? what was that all about?\\"It's a good read, i'll admit to that, but Marvel has had much better to offer. The idea was pretty refreshing, and could have been developed alot better, but in the end, it stops short of being anything truly memorable.

It is not a worthless comic but it is pretty bad."},{"Title":"Secret Wars","review":"Ok so it's not deep and the writing while great, is not watchmen level, but the whole thing is just fun, it's a series of battle with some great character moments and even long lastign effects like venom's alien costume showing up for the first time.i really loved the moments like when Hulk lifts a mountain, doom uses his normal tricks to take over, the rifts we see and firnedships formed.don't go looking for the most deep, just one of the most fun crossovers ever, and since it was it's own mini, you don't need to read all the rest of the monthly issues unlike some crossovers, this was very self contained to the mini, the fallout was then put in the monthly books, but you don't have to see those."},{"Title":"Secret Wars","review":"Too many battles with lame villains, no decent character development; bizarre plot developments are never explained, especially with Galactus. The X-Men are very poorly treated, with Wolverine being overly aggressive and Colossus falling in love with an alien woman for no reason. Cyclops, Rogue and Storm don't do a whole lot; neither does Spider-man, although he does get the famous alien costume (in three panels--not worth getting the book for). The Thing's turning into Ben Grimm is never explained (or maybe it is in the next &quot;awesome&quot; crossover). All in all, you should only get this if you're a big fan of Captain America, Mr. Fantastic, Dr. Doom or The Molecule Man."},{"Title":"Secret Wars","review":"This series was clearly not published for the purposes of having a well developed story that would hold any significance in the Marvel Universe. It is even explicitly stated in the text that this was nothing more than a means to market the franchises most popular characters through an underlying theme in order to sell action figures. Now I wouldn't have a problem with this if the characters were actually fleshed out and if the story actually held any weight in regards to how the Secret Wars event subsequently affected them.Secret Wars is a poor excuse to bring Marvel's best together in an aimless battle for survival. Now again, I would be okay with this battle royal module if the fight scenarios and the way in which these characters interacted were actually fun and interesting, but sadly this is not the case. So there's no story, there's no purpose, but to add insult to injury the dialogue is terrible, Jim Shooter exposes himself as A POOR MAN'S STAN LEE with corny catch phrases, and the personal struggles that some of the characters undergo are just bothersome and disturbing.THIS WAS JIM SHOOTER AT HIS WORST. Peter Rasputin (Colossus) is struggling with his pedophilic desires, the Wasp is overly feminized with her apparent obsession with cosmetics, and there is a tremendous amount of emphasis on the fact that Iron Man is black. James Rhodes is constantly referencing his skin color as means to exemplify the color blind notions held by the white characters and what's worse is that in one particular interaction with Captain Marvel, this character is projected in a manner that equates being black with being undignified and the polar opposite of the classy Tony Stark.TO BE FAIR, this was Marvel's first attempt at publishing a series that was inclusive of all it's major heroes/villains. For readers who are looking for any excuse to have all their favorite characters under one umbrella, this is a good one time read for sentimental or historical purposes. For those looking for a well developed story line, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Secret Wars","review":"Awesome story with a LOT of roots for your favorite characters!

All of the main Marvel characters are here, and even today its a fun read, though a little dated and the characterizations are a little out of date. Yes, it helped to start the mass cross-overs that later overwhelmed comics in general. But, this one is fairly well written, has excellent art for its time, and was a cross-over that actually had real impact in the ongoing books. This includes the replacement in the Fantastic Four of the Thing by the She-Hulk, the Hulk turning back to his more savage nature, permanent changes to the Molecule Man, Magneto sliding to the good side, and of course, the introduction of the black costume to Spider-man (probably the best of the changes in costume to occur over the years to different heroes) which eventually led to Venom, a great villain who was played out after awhile. The Doctor Doom characterization is dead on, and is one of the finest Doom stories. The only heroes to get a short thrift are the X-men, who are not portrayed particularly well, outside of Colossus. (And Daredevil, since he was totally left out). I recently gave it to my ten year old cousin and he was hooked on the Marvel Universe as well. It's not high concept, it's not full of philosophy, it doesn't try to change the world, it's just a really fun book.

Sound familiar?Anyway, a whole bunch of popular Marvel Heroes and villains are kidnapped from earth for a small time via an all powerful being called the Beyonder, sent to a planet, and ordered to beat each other up, basically.Much craziness and violence ensues. Hulk get mad, Hulk lift mountain range, etc."},{"Title":"Secret Wars","review":"Secret Wars is perhaps the most unnecessary story ever told in comics, period. As Tom DeFalco makes clear in the introduction to this book, the 12-issue series was simply designed to sell toys. Continuing to admit that the toy line didn't sell well, he contends that the series was a best-seller and generated massive sales for Marvel. Well, generating massive sales and earning them are two different things in the comic world, where back issues of once-blockbuster comics often end up not being worth the paper they're printed on. While SW certainly was a huge deal in the '80s, there was one big question in my mind, 20 years later: was the hooplah justified?See, I was there when Secret Wars made its debut in comic shops throughout the US, and like any other 13-year-old, I was thrilled to see my favorite heroes and villains square off on a grand scale, similar to the old Silver Age DC team books. In Secret Wars, the stakes were high, as the winning team, heroes or villains, would receive their hearts' desires from an entity known only as \\"The Beyonder\\", who had spirited these characters away to an alien world and goaded them into combat. Even better, some events from Secret Wars tied into other titles and had major effects, most notably Peter Parker's alien costume. Having these fond recollections, I shelled out a wallet-busting thirty bucks for the new softcover printing, despite having sworn recently that I would never buy another of Marvel's overpriced, glossy-paper trades again.You read that correctly - thirty bucks retail! The most I have ever paid for a Marvel trade paperback. So expensive apparently because it's printed on the glossy paper, as if we're being told \\"this is something special\\". If only I had stuck to my guns.Anyway, twenty years later I read this story and find that Tom DeFalco's introduction is absolutely correct: this is a 350-page advertisement for a toy line, and an utter crap-fest. The story, by Jim Shooter, is clumsy at best - very surprising for such an accomplished writer. The initial issue sets up the plot at breakneck speed, skipping quite a bit of exposition and leaving out major points that, when introduced later, are inexplicably glossed over (for example, supporting characters that appear from nowhere). Then, frequent stalls and boring characterization continue for the remainder of the book. By the 4th issue, I just didn't care anymore, but I had to force myself to finish in order to give a complete review. The further I read, however, I became aware of printing problems that I see more and more frequently in Marvel's overpriced and so-called \\"high-quality\\" books: sloppy coloring and low resolution. While they certainly did put some effort into Mike Zeck's beautiful cover, the interiors are dull and soft, apparently having been reprinted from the comics instead of the line art. So what I'm saying is, there is no way in my mind that I can even justify paying the discounted price for this mess. It's bad enough that the story is awful, but then to charge so much for putting this in a glossy format with little concern for quality is unconscionable. Marvel, you have deemed a 3rd-rate story worthy of fancy treatment, yet not followed through. You get an F."},{"Title":"Secret Wars","review":"I read this series back when it first came out and recently got a chance to see it collected in this volume.

For the past couple of years they've been working on a 12-issue limited series called &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;! It has something to do with all their heroes getting involved in a huge cosmic conflict!&quot;&quot;Great idea! I'm glad we thought of it! SO...how can we milk the likely popularity of DC's endeavor?&quot;&quot;Why, that's easy! We'll hastily come up with our own derivative version, only not as well-written, not as well-drawn, and not as significant to the overall structure of our comics universe...not that we'll point any of that out to the readers!&quot;&quot;Genius! Pure genius! And years from now, we can reprint all the issues in an overpriced paperback volume with ridiculously poor reproduction! I can see those faded ink lines now! Bwah ha ha!&quot;&quot;It's agreed then! Rush '$ecret War$' to market, and make it snappy! Let's try to get it on the racks before DC's 'Crisis'!

I remember when this series came out and how it was put out around the same time as DC's Crisis on Infinite Earths on purpose and I also recall reading a Mile High Futures review that panned Secret Wars as a blatant attempt to compete with Crisis rather than come up with a great story that would bring the Marvel Universe together for some cosmic menace or something equally absurd. The Beyonder has to be the most contrived &quot;villain&quot; ever and the point of this story is that there is no point other than the strange Beyonder who has infinite power, but doesn't understand humans! He couldn't just read their minds or absorb a brain or something? The peripheral stories that took place after the Secret Wars ended were far better such as how Colossus dealt with his &quot;love affair&quot; in the X-Men and how Spidey got his alien costume in Amazing Spiderman. Mike Zeck's art is kind of weird (what's with the narrow ankles and massive thighs?!) but I thought it was still not bad (his better work was on Captain America where JM DeMattis penned some good stories and on the Punisher miniseries with Steve Grant). The problem is the dopey story by Jim Shooter. For 12 issues we get the heroes and villains getting played like chess pieces by the Beyonder and that's it! Nothing happens of any consequence other than a great deal of pining and whining and sporadic battles as the heroes are led by Captain America as their general versus Dr. Doom and company. I'm simply amazed that this book has an overall average that is so high! There's just no justice in this world! Please don't give Marvel any more money for this stupid series. Even as a kid I thought it was garbage, but in those days I paid .60 cents and used to buy a bunch of comics so it wasn't a big deal. No way am I paying for a tradepaperback for this junk now though.

Secret Wars was the original 12 part mega epic comicbook tale. All of the major players from Marvel were involved from Spider-Man to Dr. Doom, from Wolverine to Galactus. All taken to a strange new world which the characters call Battleworld. The point of the story is for the Beyonder (an all powerful being) to find out which side is better good or evil. So he pits Earth's greatest heroes against the best villains. What ensues is an all-out Marvel Superhero millitary campaign. With fun developments along the way: Spider-Man's Black Costume, the introduction of a new Spider-Woman, The X-Man Colossus falling in love with one of the inhabitants of battle world. All had far reaching impact on future Marvel books.I thrilled when I finally collected all of the original issues of this series. A very fun read for any one looking to enjoy a great super heroe adventure. I don't know why the other reviewers chose to knock this book I guess they don't like heroic epics."},{"Title":"Secret Wars","review":"Marvel Super Heroes Secret Wars has spurred a lot of debate in the last twenty years. Many fans dismiss it as nothing more than a year long commercial for the Mattel action figure line. Others dismiss it as a blatant attempt to rush out and upstaged DC Comics Crisis on Infinite Earths far more historical series that came out at roughly the same time. Neither of these claims can be denied and even Marvel has admitted the transparent commercialism of the series. Still, when it comes right down to it, while perhaps nothing critical to the Marvel Universe came out of the series (Other than Venom) one certainly can't deny that it was an enjoyable series to read. It was a 12 page battle royal pitting most of Marvels top heroes against their top villains on neutral territory, all for the amusement of the God-like being known as The Beyonder.The Beyonder was an all-powerful being from beyond our universe. His origins would be explained in much more detail in Secret Wars II. But basically the Beyonder entered our universe through a pinprick in the fabric of reality and became curious as to our world, and particularly Earth. The Beyonder then created a world and plucked out a few dozen heroes and villains and basically told them to battle each other to the death to get whatever they desired. The selection of heroes was pretty solid and included Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Spider Man, The Banner Hulk, Wolverine, She-Hulk, The Fantastic Four, Cyclops, Storm, and Professor X. The villains are much more of a mixed lot which includes heavies like Dr. Doom, Kang, Magneto, and Ultron, but some curious minor leaguers like Wrecking Crew, Titania, Klaw, and The Molecule Man.Each issue is basically a big slugfest as the two sides vie for the upper hand with Doom leading the way for the bad guys. While all of this is going on Galactus shows up on no side and with every intention of devouring the energy of the world created by the Beyonder. Doom of course can never be trusted and soon backstabs the rest of the villains by actually stealing the power of the Beyonder and becoming omnipotent. Doom would destroy all the heroes but the Beyonder restores them to life and they finally defeat Dr. Doom. As the heroes win, The Beyonder grants them whatever they desire which is just to return home. Their wish is granted and the story comes to a close.As mentioned, perhaps the only real significant event that came out of the whole storyline was Spiderman finding the strange alien material which he took as his new, black costume. This material would turn out to be an evil alien symbiote that would eventually become Venom when it merged with Eddie Brock. Of course this happened almost four years later when Todd McFarlane was on his memorable run on Spiderman and there's no evidence that Secret Wars writer Jim Shooter ever had this in mind when he created the suit.The art by Mike Zeck is solid if unspectacular. Zeck has done better work, notably on The Punisher. The art in some of the issues looks a bit rushed lending credence to the argument that Marvel wanted the series out before DC's \\"Crisis\\". Taken on just the merits of the story it's an enjoyable read. I've read it numerous times over the years because it really was the first such mega-series event of its kind that included almost every major hero. These cross-over event stories have become common place today, but was still monumental back in 1984. Thus while the story itself had no great historical influence it still must be considered a landmark in comics history.Review by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Secret Wars","review":"Nothing has ever made me appreciate Stan Lee more, than reading someone else try to do his shtick. Comic books are silly, I accept this, but when Stan Lee wrote them, everyone had a real reason for doing things. Yes, they felt the need to talk about it a lot, and the science never even tried to make sense, but there were real people in there. This is not the case with Secret Wars. I feel like the creators are just making it up as they go along.The dialogue in this book is strikingly bad, which is partly because it was written in the 80's (my favorite line: \\"Like tubular to the max!\\" -SheHulk) but their are other comics from this era (Daredevil, Batman) that were above this. In general, there is too much gobbledygook and no real motivation for what comes out of their mouths. There is also some really yucky thought bubbles, mostly from Colossus (sic: \\"I miss Katya. I had so many plans for what we could do together when she is old enough\\") which make you understand why Frank Miller abolished them.Once the action actually gets going-- and it takes a while-- the story becomes more interesting...somewhat. Doctor Doom is surprisingly well-written, so much so that he jumps off the page; he is even generally better drawn than the other characters. I also enjoyed the weird romance between Volcana and the milksop Molecule Man. In general, the villains fared better in this book than the heroes; the one exception is Spiderman, who kicks the whole of the X-Men's butts in a memorable scene, and later gets a suspicious new black suit that modern readers will quickly recognize.I think this was the first \\"event\\" comic of its kind to be released, preceeding the Crisis on Infinite Earths (also a snoozer) by a few years. This is now the bread-and-butter of the comics publishers, so it is interesting reading how it started.

Today, I still like it, even if my enthusiasm isn't nearly as high.In the early-to-mid 80's, Marvel gave us 2 groundbreaking limited series in Contest of Champions in '82, and Secret Wars in '84. These were special in that they featured nearly *all* the company's main heroes together in one story, and in one place & time.Highlights here for me...*Spider-Man's new costume. It goes from traditional red & blue to intriguing black & white in issue #8. It's also one of my favorite cover images in this series.*Everyone vs. Galactus. It's standard heroes vs. villains, and even tensions between heroes, right up until Galactus starts eating the planet! The united assault on Galactus begins in issue #9.*The genius and face of Dr. Doom. Here we see Dr. Doom take on a seemingly omnipotent entity, with startling results! And we get to see his *perfect* face without his mask for the very 1st time in issue #11....And I'm sure many fans could easily add to this list.There were at least 2 immense, history-making changes brought about by this series. The 1st was that we got to see Spider-Man's *1st ever* significant costume change, which was an *amazingly* big deal at the time. The 2nd was that this was Marvel's 1st ever, line-wide, editorial event, and it was specifically designed to sell kids toys(!). That toy line turned out to be not very successful, but the line-wide \\"event\\" concept certainly seemed to stick.

Some of the issues he addresses are not issues today. But the premise behind the book is timeless- the authority of the Word of God. Even though liberalism may not be as strong as it was 50 years ago, today Christendom is wandering farther and farther away from the authority of God?s Word. This fact can be seen in the growth of cults. It can also be seen in how Christians today depend on human authors instead of God?s Word. Yet another manifestation of this wrong notion is the branch of Christianity that replaces God?s Word with emotion and feelings. So though the issue of Liberalism may not be significant today, the issue of authority definitely is.I read the book for a class on ?The History of Fundamentalism in America?. The book does not really trace the history of Fundamentalism, but the book does cover the central issue in the Fundamentalism/Liberalism debate. Before reading the book, I would suggest reading the first two pages of the conclusion, where the author gives an overview of the entire book. The book is very logically laid out, with each chapter subject building on top of the last chapter subject. The only chapter I had problems with was the chapter on faith. The author tries to explain man?s inability to express faith, showing the author?s reformed presuppositions. I didn?t understand how this tied into the argument and flow of the book, and I think the notion is unbiblical (but this is a discussion for a different book review). The main argument of the book was one of presuppositions (as found in presuppositional apologetics). On page 109 the author writes, ?We should not abandon faith in anything that God has taught us merely because we cannot solve all the problems which it raises. Our own intellectual competence is not the test and measure of divine truth. It is not for us to stop believing because we lack understanding, or to postpone believing till we can get understanding, but to believe in order that we may understand?? This is the core issue of authority- are we going to trust our own minds, or are we going to trust God?s Word?I would recommend the book to any Christian. The book will challenge you to take on a stronger stance for the Word of God, and it will show the foolishness of doing otherwise."},{"Title":"\\"Fundamentalism\\" and the Word of God","review":"Solid, dependable but dated exposition of the original Fundamentalist position (ala Machen) before the term got stolen and mis-apportioned to a more narrow sect within the Christian community. Packer clearly states that the term is not \\"useful for Evangelicals today\\" (1958) and he was and is right. The book is well worth reading, along with Machen's \\"Christianity and Liberalism\\" for a strong sense of the basic challenges orthodox, Evangelical Christians face. In the post-modern era those basic challenges are still present though now characterized in different dress. As Packer says (pg. 42)- \\"The problem of authority is the most fundamental problem that the Christian Church ever faces.\\" Absolutely true and now as much as ever. Packer's work has abiding interest for anyone seeking to establish themselves within the flow of Christian apologetics and self-understanding."},{"Title":"\\"Fundamentalism\\" and the Word of God","review":"The fundamentalist movement began as a response to the rising liberalism of the 19th century, especially as found in the church. In contrast to the dictates and the wisdom of modern men stood Holy Scripture, which was to be the sole authority. That much they knew:'The problem of authority is the most fundamental problem that the Christian Church ever faces.' p 42But they also knew their convictions would not go unchallenged:'Modern man, sceptical and indifferent as he is to dogmatic pronouncements about the supernatural order, may find it hard to take seriously the idea that one's eternal welfare may depend on what one believes; but the apostles were sure it was so. Theological error was to them a grim reality, as was the spiritual shipwreck which comes in its wake.' p 43On the other hand, JI Packer also extends a historical reminder to those who err in thinking that J Gresham Machen was fundamentalist. 'He saw fundamentalism as a debased evangelicalism which at point after point was at variance with that for which he stood.' p 36 Packer quotes Machen's own analysis which shows that he could not resign himself to the fundamentalist position: 'The emergence of new emphases and the lack of others, the presence at times of a zeal not according to knowledge and the frequent absence of historical perspective...Oftentimes pietistic and perfectionist vagaries have come to be accepted as the hallmark of fundamentalism. And a one-sided other-worldliness, often associated with a dogmatic commitment to a futuristic chiliasm, has come to be widely regarded as essential to fundamentalist orthodoxy.'Ned B Stonehouse,J Gresham Machen: A Biographical Memoirp 336"},{"Title":"\\"Fundamentalism\\" and the Word of God","review":"There's not much that J. I. Packer writes that isn't worth taking the time to read. His arguments are sound and well-written, and his thinking bears emulation. His works on reformed thinking and evangelism are seminal.This particular work is focused specifically on so-called fundamentalist thinking and the evangelical position on Scripture. It's well-written, and his chapter on Authority in particular is spectacular.However, the book is largely contextual, set against the emergence of \\"anti-fundamentalism thought\\" in Britain in the 40s and 50s. This makes much of the argument in the book dated, and if you're not familiar with thought in the mid-20th century, or at a minimum, the issues surrounding conservative and liberal positions regarding the authority and inspiration of Scripture, it's easy to get lost.Still, this is a good work, again, worth the price for the writing on authority and Scripture's view of itself."},{"Title":"\\"Fundamentalism\\" and the Word of God","review":"There are certain books that have a very short shelf-life, either because they're highly topical or they make pop-culture references that no one will get in 15 minutes.This is not one of those books.\\"Fundamentalism\\" and the Word of God was first published 51 years in the midst of the British \\"Fundamentalism\\" controversy of the 1950s--a controversy centering around the authority of Scripture.At roughly the mid-point of the 20th century, Theological Liberalism gave way to the \\"Biblical Theology\\" movement. Rather than completely shuffling off historic faith, \\"biblical theologians\\" sought to get to the heart of what the authors intended; to \\"read the Bible from within,\\" as it were. A noble goal to be sure.However, their approach was to study the Bible as an unbeliever so as not to presuppose certain assumptions regarding faith, including disregarding the Bible's internal witness as the divine revelation of God. The result was that essentially everything was up for grabs.The validity of the virgin birth, the resurrection, Christ's divinity, the nature and necessity of the atonement, the Bible's divine inspiration... Any and all were up for consideration in the name of \\"biblical criticism.\\"Sounds familiar, doesn't it?This book could have just as easily been written in 2009 as in 1958. Today, just as then (and indeed throughout history), there has always been movements that desire to have authority over Scripture (either in the name of Tradition or Subjectivism), rather than come under its authority.To take the Bible at its word as the infallible, inerrant (meaning \\"wholly true and trustworthy\\") Word of God--inspired by the Holy Spirit and written by men, with the purity of His words maintained by His providential rule, is seen as outmoded, backwater thinking by many today, even some professing Christians.In \\"Fundamentalism\\" and the Word of God, J. I. Packer offers rebuttal and sharp rebuke to those who would unwisely seek to sit in judgement of Scripture. Rarely mincing words, Packer is blunt, direct and powerful in his arguments, as he provides readers with a foundational understanding of the doctrine of Scripture as found within its own pages. Perhaps the most powerful words in the book are in response to the criticism that conservative Evangelicals (the so-called \\"fundamentalists) demand that people stop thinking the moment they become Christians; that faith trumps reason. Packer writes:\\"The true antithesis here...is not between faith and reason (as if believing and thinking were mutually exclusive), but between a faithful and a faithless use of reason. The question is not whether we should think, but how we should think; whether or not our thinking should be controlled by our faith. The real difference between Evangelicals and those how call them obscurantists lies in the realm of method... Our critics say that the way in which we deal with the Bible is fundamentally dishonest. We reply that the way in which they deal with the Bible is fundamentally un-Christian\\" (p. 140).He continues:\\"Should the principles governing our study of Scripture be drawn from Scripture itself, or not?...[Those] who acknowledge the authority of Christ as a Teacher in other matters, ought equally to acknowledge it in their approach to the Bible; they should receive Scripture as He did, accepting its claim to be divinely inspired and true and studying it as such. Those who pooh-pooh such an approach as obscurantist, unscientific and intellectually dishonest, should remember that they hereby stigmatize Jesus Christ, who taught His disciples this approach and thereby excluded any other\\" (p. 141).Packer rightly argues that the call is not to stop thinking, but to stop thinking sinfully. What the arguments against biblical authority are really calling for is bad Christianity fueled on nothing but the pride that seeks to make man the measure of all things. \\"Liberalism declares in effect that Christ was wrong, and labours to correct Him... [and] subjectivism, which makes human judgement the arbiter of divine truth, is just an expression of this pride\\" (p. 161).\\"Fundamentalism\\" and the Word of God is a powerful work and one of the few that is truly timeless. Packer's passion and theological prowess are on full display as he contends for truth and exposes the errors lying behind the perennial problem of subjectivism. It's not light reading, obviously, but it is essential reading."},{"Title":"\\"Fundamentalism\\" and the Word of God","review":"J I Packer is blessed with the ability to write concisely and clearly about the ideas he wishes to express but he is not blessed with an accurate understanding of non-evangelical views on sola scriptura. And although he is aware that the pivotal issue at stake for evangelicalism is \\"Authority\\" he seems to be unaware that Protestantism prior to the 19th century did not express its confidence in scripture in the same way nor with the same meaning as a modern British or American evangelical would.Mr Packer's analysis is not especially bad but it is nevertheless seriously lacking in historical perspective, furthermore he does not seem to be aware that one source of criticism of the kind of fundamentalism that he is defending comes from the Catholic and Orthodox Churches where authority is seen from significantly different perspective from the one that Mr Packer takes himself. These shortcomings seriously limit the value of his analysis of fundamentalism in relation to scripture as presented in this book.Traditional Protestantism expressed in the writings of the early Protestant leaders regarded scripture as the sole infallible rule of faith and life for Christians but scripture was not regarded as an inerrant source of information on every topic that is mentioned in the sacred page. Fundamentalism as expressed in the writings of men like B. B. Warfield, J Gresham Machen, Edward J Young expresses confidence in scripture as both the only infallible rule of faith and life for Christians and also as an inerrant source of revealed truth on every topic about which the sacred page expresses itself. Adding inerrancy* to infallibility* is a significant extension of the traditional Protestant view of the authority scripture and it is a very significant departure from the traditional Christian view of the authority scripture as expressed by the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.J I Packer's analysis ignores the two changes mentioned in the previous paragraph and because he ignores these significant changes (and they were both present and clearly visible when his book was first published in 1958) one cannot avoid concluding that he has failed to offer an adequate defence of evangelicalism.[* Note: Infallibility and Inerrancy have quite different meanings within evangelicalism and within Catholicism, this is evident from the statement of Catholic belief expressed in Dei Verbum - the Dogmatic Constitution on Scripture from Vatican II]"},{"Title":"Count With Me!

Did you know that what your conscious mind does not filter out may actually be accepted by your subconscious just as though you were receiving hypnotic suggestions?If you are either a business owner or a manager involved in sales or marketing, you owe it to yourself and your company to read a copy of Media Hypnosis by Lonny Kocina (Mid-America Entertainment Inc., 2002). Imagine how the power of the media, properly used, might benefit your business.We are entering a new era that makes traditional advertising costly and obsolete for most businesses. Even though TV and radio may have a hypnotic effect on people, increasing numbers of viewers and listeners are trained to filter out traditional advertisements...yet many people accept news stories as truth.While the author effectively discusses the hypnotic effect of the media, he exposes the obsolescence of most commercial advertising. He also explores the history of the public relations industry, and competently explains why the PR industry must change with the times. Instead of placing costly ads for clients, a good PR professional will develop news stories and press releases that inform the public about a client's products and services.This is where the author's company, Media Relations, shines brilliantly! His firm is a public relations firm, and his book provides vital information that any business owner or manager needs to know before hiring a public relations firm. Yet unlike traditional PR firms who charge by the hour, the author believes that a truly effective PR firm should charge only for results.Once you develop a good PR campaign, be aware of the fact that your news stories may be entering the subconscious minds of many viewers and listeners while they sit in a hypnotic trance. As a certified hypnotherapy instructor (and author of two hypnosis texts), I agree with Lonny's opinions regarding the hypnotic effect of the media.As a small business owner myself, I wish that a copy of Lonny's book could go back in a time machine to a younger version of me! Some years ago I hired a PR firm, only to pay thousands of dollars for promises without results. They did manage to place a few ads for me - which resulted in an avalanche of telemarketing calls from numerous advertising agents trying to sell me more advertising space. Does this sound familiar?If you've wasted any money at all on non-productive ads, Media Hypnosis is a must read! In fact, I believe that his book may change the entire PR industry.Roy Hunter, M.S.Author of The Art of Hypnosis (Kendall/Hunt Publ., 3rd ed. 2000)Author of Master the Power of Self-Hypnosis (Sterling, 1998)&lt;"},{"Title":"Media Hypnosis: Unleashing the Most Powerful Sales Tool on Earth","review":"I read this book in one afternoon, and plan to pass it on to other business people I know.

There wasn't a moment during this book when I was forced to make an allowance for \\"artistic license.\\" These characters - from the young daughter who is caught in the middle of divorced parents to the neighbor who has enough charisma and depth to her personality that you want to read a book just about her life - really jump out of the book and aren't just incidental to the main characters. KG also doesn't force the romance; the kindness and affection which grows between the two women feels like a very natural progression.This is an excellent read! I agree with K.

After a long night of running from the law, Spencer hides and falls asleep in the back seat of a car in a Wal Mart parking lot. Unfortunately for Ruth, she discovers the sickly, unwanted passenger only after she arrives back at her new home.

GKC was known for a handful of short story collections featuring his detective priest, Father BrownThe Complete Father Brown Stories (Penguin Classics), but that's not the only sort of mystery he wrote.These eight stories differ from the Father Brown tales in a certain respect. \\"I am a man, and thus contain all devils,\\" Father Brown once said in an unusually lively retort in one of the stories, and that was how he solved crimes. He didn't think himself above any man, nor free of any man's temptations to crime and sin. Father Brown is like the Shadow of radio fame. \\"What evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows.\\"Chesterton was the first president of the Detective Club when that genre was young and vigorous. He loved reading Conan Doyle and the other early mystery writers. Dorothy L. Sayers, author of the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries, also was in the club and was its second president. However, GKC's mysteries are a bit different than Sherlock Holmes. In the latter, Conan Doyle is careful to give the reader all the clues that eventually will lead his sleuth to unravel the case. This was one of the rules of the Detective Club, that the reader must be given all the evidence. This is also so in the case of the present volumes, eight stories concerning the poet and painter, Gabriel Gale. But that's where any similarity to the Baker Street sleuth ends.These are thoroughly delightful mysteries, and the Dover edition is well-edited and inexpensive (and eligible for Amazon's 4 for 3 promotion). Other very different GKC mysteries include Four Faultless FelonsFour Faultless FelonsThe Club of Queer TradesThe Club of Queer Trades, and The Paradoxes of Mr. PondThe Paradoxes of Mr. Pond (Dover Books on Literature & Drama). However, his novels are also mainly mysteries. These include ManaliveManalive (Hilarious Stories)The Man Who Was ThursdayThe Man Who Was Thursday: A Nightmare (Penguin Classics), and The Ball and the CrossThe Ball and the Cross, the last of which appearing as brief cliff-hanger serials in a weekly newspaper. Then there are the various collections of Father Brown stories, two series of which were made into TV shows in Britain and ran on the PBS series, \\"Mystery!\\"Father Brown - Set 1,Father Brown: Set 2.The Poet and the Lunatic appeared seven years before Chesterton's death in 1936. At that time, he was still an engaging, lively, thoughtful writer, as shown by his autobiography, completed only a few months before he died. Many of his books have slipped out of copyright, like the present volume, giving publishers incentive to reprint them. I applaud Dover for having brought this volume out which will appeal to a wide audience of readers, many of whom only want to get their heads into the heavens, and like Chesterton, gaze in wonder."},{"Title":"My Two Grandmothers","review":"This book is must read for young children that have Jewish and Christian parents.

A book for all to read."},{"Title":"From a Baker's Kitchen: Techniques and Recipes for Professional Quality Baking in the Home Kitchen","review":"Easy to read, easy to follow instructions - excellent book for beginning or advanced baker."},{"Title":"From a Baker's Kitchen: Techniques and Recipes for Professional Quality Baking in the Home Kitchen","review":"\`From a Baker's Kitchen' by poet, teacher, and writer Gail Sher is easily one of the very best books on bread baking I have seen, out of the dozen or so I have reviewed in the last year. This is not to say that the many volumes by Peter Reinhart, Joe Ortiz, Nancy Silverton, Bernard Clayton, and Rose Levy Beranbaum are not some of the very best cookery books I have seen overall. It is just that in this classic tutorial on breadbaking, Ms. Sher has presented this material in a way which is more accessible to more home bakers than the more technical works of Reinhart and company.One of the most liberating statements early in this book is Ms. Sher's claim that the home bread baker is actually in a better position to bake quality bread than the commercial baker, who is constantly encumbered by pressures to produce a correct number to match sales, use materials and labor economically, and make a backbreaking schedule while maintaining a reasonable quality in their product. Within reason, the home baker should not have any time pressure and the cost of a small quantity of good ingredients should be of no concern. The home cook does need to be aware of things that are no problem for the professional. These typically are using fresh ingredients and sensing baking endpoints simply by sight. The professional baker gets fresh ingredients in daily or weekly and does the same thing daily, so these come naturally.One of the first things, which convinced me that this is a really great introduction to baking, is when the author gives an overview of all leavening methods, giving each one equal attention. When I started baking, I was fully aware of the importance of yeast and only aware of chemical leaveners in passing. It was almost two years of baking and reading before I realized the importance of aerating leaveners, epitomized by foams of egg whites in, for example, angel food cake, but also accomplished with other ingredients such as butter layers in puff pastry.The first section of the book deals with \`bread ingredients'. While Ms. Sher does not go into as much detail on the chemistry of gluten formation and the biology of the wheat berry as, for example, Rose Beranbaum, this book covers the whole range of flours, including such odd bodkins as triticale, potato flour, and millet. The triticale flour has a combination of properties of wheat and rye, with a light sweetness from the contribution of rye genes.The second section deals with the \`methods and principles of bread baking'. The motto for this book is the first paragraph in the chapter on dough where it says:\`The Point cannot be stressed enough that bread baking is an art replete with choices. You can slow it down or hurry it up, overbake for a crunchy crust or overrise for a chewy loaf with big holes. The correct thing is what you want. You are in control and, if you understand what bread is about, you can tailor any dough to suit your exact specifications.'What a liberating notion. This whole book, of course, is dedicated to telling you what bread is about.There are many small things about this book that I love, but the one big thing that will make this book eminently useful to the amateur as an introduction to yeast breads is the fourth section of the book on \`the sponge method'. For those of you who are familiar with artisinal bread baking, I should point out that this book simply does not cover this topic. It's strength is in a broad survey of bread baking techniques suitable for the home plus an in depth tutorial on the steps involved in the sponge method using commercially packaged yeast. The main advantages of using a sponge are that it gives the yeast free rein to grow in the absence of inhibitors such as salt and fats. Once the sponge has got a good head start at developing the gluten, other ingredients can be added much more easily than with a conventional dough where the yeast is simply bloomed and added to all the flour and water, followed by salt and fat(s).Building all the following yeast bread recipes on this one method enhances the careful exposition of the sponge method. This means that the making of each recipe builds on a single skill whereby you become more familiar with all the choices you can make to branch off from one common technique.Following the exposition of the sponge method and its recipes, the book deals with many different recipes for non-yeast quickbreads such as corn breads, spoonbreads, biscuits, teacakes, batter breads, gingerbreads and muffins. For its size, my favorite section by far is the selection of recipes for leftover bread. You can find dozens of these techniques spread across hundreds of cookbooks on French and Italian cuisine, but here we have all the best ones in one place.While the book does not go into as much detail as some more recent titles, there is still a lot here I did not know. For example, while many writers have touted instant dried yeast over \`active dry yeast', the author points out a few drawbacks of this product. The author also gives an excellent overview of the many different ways bread can be rolled and laid in baking pans and the many different ways in which bread can be scored. I have seen most of these techniques in other places, but this is the only book that pulls all of these things together in one place.Ms. Sher gives much credit for her inspiration to Elizabeth David's book on English baking. As I am a big fan of Elizabeth David's writings, I am looking forward to reading the fountainhead of Ms. Sher's excellent book.Superb introduction to home bread baking. Highly Recommended!"},{"Title":"From a Baker's Kitchen: Techniques and Recipes for Professional Quality Baking in the Home Kitchen","review":"I wanted to know an easy way of making bread at home, and this book delivers very well. If you are only looking for recipes this isn't the book. There is a lot of information on the details of equipment, flours and methods.

I grew up in a family that was always baking and cooking, so I was no stranger to the kitchen. But Sher is such a clear writer and teacher that she could teach a complete beginner, too. I learned how to use the sponge method (an extra step to let bread rise) to make my dense, whole wheat breads lighter. I learned the best muffin and tea bread recipes - the kind people go out of their way to ask for over and over again. She teaches the science, technique, and art of baking with such intelligence. I cannot say enough about this book. I logged on to buy several copies to give as gifts.

The explanations of the ingredients used for yeast and quick breads are valuable to my understanding of procedures and the end product. Even though the original edition was published more than twenty years ago, the knowledge she passes on remains useful.I find that most of the recipes are for more loaves than my wife and I can eat in a week so I'll have to find room for the fermented dough or finished loaves in the freezer. Some of the ingredients that Ms. Sher uses aren't going to be found in a lot of supermarkets but that doesn't dampen my enthusiasm for trying out what I've learned from her book."},{"Title":"From a Baker's Kitchen: Techniques and Recipes for Professional Quality Baking in the Home Kitchen","review":"I have never made a loaf of bread before, but my wife wanted to make bread so I bought this one based on the book's reviews. Before she had time to read it, I picked it up and read through the book (easy to do in an afternoon), and when my 7 year-old saw me reading, she asked to make a loaf with me. What dad could say \\"no.\\" So together the cooking incompetent dad and the 7 year-old made four loaves that came out great.As for the book: It starts with a very good review of the ingredients and what each means to the bread. Lots of do's and don'ts that will save a lot of pain. It then discusses the basics of equipment (most of which you have in your house already), processes and the \\"sponge\\" method, along with how it can apply to any recipe that the reader happens to be using. It then follows with tons of recipes. It is an easy read, flows naturally and clearly has the novice in mind.It is done in a way that a non-baker can understand both the how and more importantly the why, without overwhelming the reader with jargon or specialty terms. After reading the book I am comfortable that I can make a variety of different types of bread. Maybe I will let my wife have a turn baking and enjoy the fun of making bread with the kids.Highly recommended for any dad looking to bake with the kids."},{"Title":"From a Baker's Kitchen: Techniques and Recipes for Professional Quality Baking in the Home Kitchen","review":"This is more about the Kindle usage, rather than this book. I don't feel that I got a true test of this book in Kindle version. I have purchased a few Kindle books, 2 being cookbooks, for my iPad. Kindle books do not include an index of recipes you can go to- a very important part of using a cookbook for me. So I have had to bookmark each recipe to find them quickly. Ugh! There is a table of contents. No color pictures, which is a disappointment. I didn't know that until I purchased, which I should have checked. I will go back to paper versions, since I like color and really need the index since I tend to reference multiple cookbooks, looking for a particular recipe. I do like the fact that Kindle books can be archived, unlike iTunes books. I lose them if I ditch my IPhone and iPad. Maybe they will add an index and color to compete with new color competitors."},{"Title":"From a Baker's Kitchen: Techniques and Recipes for Professional Quality Baking in the Home Kitchen","review":"Ms. Sher's book consists of three main parts: techniques, about 80 pages, yeasted bread recipes, about 60 pages, and quick bread recipes, about 60 pages. Miscellany and references add about another 60 pages. There are fairly clear instructions, as some reviewers have remarked, making it likely that readers will get usable results from recipes on their first tries.Most of the recipes are variations around a few themes, but there are rarely coherent explanations linking the themes with the variations. The clarity of instructions is counterweighted by a slim variety of themes and by the lack of context and explanation. For example, there is no description of how the recommended techniques evolved from genuinely traditional techniques using sourdough leavening and unrefined flours.Yeasted bread recipes all call for active dry yeast, developed in the U.S. during the 1940s, as prepared using the sponge method, developed in mid-nineteenth-century Austria. However, little history is provided and no description of what happens with this method's many variations. The approaches called out by recipes are sometimes extreme, combining a quarter to half the flour, most or all the liquids and all the yeast into a sponge.While the instructions are usually clear, they are not precise, and some key topics are missing. For example, there is no description of the wide ranges of variation in commercial flours with the same names. Sources for key ingredients are never mentioned. Almost all quantities are specified as volumes. That will do for liquids, but reliable baking needs the weights of dry and whole ingredients. The topic of bakers' percentages is missing. Control of oven temperature is stressed, but an approach often recommended for introducing vapor is water spray, which disrupts the control of temperature.Some recipes seem more complicated and laborious than necessary, adding embellishments but not teaching the basic style of a bread. Ms. Sher rarely provides guidance or explanations for complex ingredient schemes or for extra steps recommended. Amounts in many recipes are large for a home baker. For a first try they should be reduced by factors of two or more. A beginner may be able to develop some confidence from this book, but a reader aiming at \\"professional quality,\\" as the book's subtitle claims, will need a more comprehensive source of information."},{"Title":"Explore the Book: A Basic and Broadly Interpretative Course of Bible Study from Genesis to Revelation.

It's not a product of drug ingestion but is instead the flash of a remarkable imagination.The stories and poems in this book beg to be read aloud so as to get the clang-tint of the man's music.

Outlandish as it may seem, this is the message of Dr Chang's book.

Ejaculation thus depletes the man, leaving insufficient energy to fully satisfy the woman. Dr Chang is well-versed in Taoism, and the techniques he presents not only enhance the sex life for both men and women, but improve health in general. Sex energy is often likened to fire because it can consume or transform. Due to ignorance many people are consumed by their sex energy. Dr Chang shows us effective ways of using sex energy to transform ourselves into more complete and dynamic human beings.

She had so much to make up for, and she planned to start by dragging Mac into her bed. She had no experience with anything, and planned to try everything.What started out as a short-term mind blowing affair quickly escalated to an inferno that neither Jessie nor Mac could control. She was falling for him hard, but there was something he was holding back from her. She knew he cared for her, but there was a darkness that she couldn't touch or get near. Jessie knew he had some issues to deal with, and had to do it on his own, or they could never be together permanently.Jessie and Mac are characters full of heart that have chemistry chemistry chemistry! This book is sexy, erotic, and just plain hot. They both also have their own story to tell, and they are heartbreaking. There is a very good balance between the eroticism and story. Definite must read."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"In true Sarah McCarty fashion this book sizzles and keeps the reader enthralled with the story. I would have liked a little more character building for the side people but only because I would like to see another book in the series."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"I love Sarah McCarty books. Love, love, love her historical western novels. Was so looking forward to this contempary novel and was so disappointed. I just couldn't get into the story, didn't particularly like the main characters. Over all me just no likey."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"Not up to the Promises series by far. Weak story line. All in all, a major disappointment!"},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"I read - and loved - Promises Linger by this author, and was so looking forward to Mac's Law that I bought it without coming here to read the reviews first. HUGE mistake! If I had, I never would have spent good money on what turned out to be a bad book. It was great until, as another review has lamented, the couple was no longer monogamous. How is extra partners ROMANTIC? Erotic, maybe, but certainly not what I want in a sexy romance novel. I will not be buying anymore of McCarty's books, as I cannot trust her to keep a true romance going from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"I have never read a book by this author and never again. There is no plot to the book and I continued to read looking for a storyline but could not find such. I have not finished this book and don't intent to. I always donate my books to the library and non profit organizations but this will go in the trash. Wish I could get my money back. So it's erotica, big deal, but erotica books have plots and make sense. I think Ms Mcarty should keep her day job and if this her day job she should learn how to write for a living."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"Award winning author Sarah McCarty has once again produced another amazing piece of literature! Jessie is a woman filling the position of cook on Mac's ranch, looking for man to fulfill her every desire, and Mac is just the Alpha she needs!I have yet to read a McCarty novel that I didn't like and MAC'S LAW is no exception. It was a very intense and memorable read. The passion and sensuality just smolder throughout the novel, and the growing love between Mac and Jessie makes the story all the more romantic. If we all could be so lucky to have an Alpha like Mac fulfilling our every desire!MAC'S LAW is longer than many erotic romance books at 356 pages, but flows so smoothly that I finished it in only a few hours! I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read! And as MAC'S LAW is only the first book in the UNCHAINED series, we have more sexy Alphas to look forward to!"},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"I really enjoyed this author's ebooks of the promise's trilogy but this book while the premise is good, young woman held from living life to the fullest due to parental illness wants to experiment sexually, but when they start having extra people participating in the action that is just too much. It was a really good book from erotica standpoint but I don't like threesomes and that spoiled this book for me"},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"Jessi Sterns has always been the good girl. She's been taking care of her mother for so long and now that her mother has died, she's finally free of responsibility and she's determined to make up for lost time. Armed with the contract for a job opportunity, she steps off the bus in Round the Bend, Texas and is immediately thrust into the wild and crazy nightlife of this sleepy little town. Mac Hollister comes to her rescue from a slightly loco, wannabe Injun and he's pondering the possibility of an affair when she tells him that she's his newest cook. Mac takes one look at her and knows this manicured little honey blonde is the worst kind of distraction and he does his best to dissuade her from the ranch life. Jessi has been cooped up for so long and being out in the bright, wide open brings joy to her heart and she enjoys teasing this bad boy cowboy right out of his mind. Not one to beat around the bush, Mac and Jessi quickly fall into a red, hot love affair that is unbelievably spicy and naughty. Their scorching love play will set fire to your bed sheets and pretty soon you are going to create your own sexual to-do list based off this book alone!Ay Carumba! This was scorching. Whew! I haven't read very many Sarah McCarty books, but this was the most blush inducing. Silver bullet + Mac = HOLY %$#!@! I had to tell my husband about this scene and now he won't put his back to me. He's facing off against me like we're gunslingers or something. Geez.While Mac might be a walking, talking testament to the phrase, \\"They grow things bigger in Texas\\" this bad boy has a soft side and it's easily bruised. When Jessi is hurt on the ranch, Mac immediately lays down the law and tries to wrap her in cotton wool. Jessi isn't having any of that and demands that before he takes her heart, he needs to heal his own first.I have to say, I am not a member of PETA. But I was really squeamish about the whole chicken/axe scene. Mac is trying to push Jessi away and one of his plans is to make ranch life unbearably hard for her and he forces her to slaughter her own chickens. She's got the chicken and she's got the axe and I nearly stopped reading. I've read books where the heroine is horrifically abused. I've read scenes of unbearable torture (Heartsick, anyone?) and I've never felt as I did with that chicken. I'm sad to say if that axe had fallen by her hands, I would have had to have stopped reading. I was seriously bracing myself and I was gingerly turning the pages. I'm happy to say that the chicken lived but I also think I lost respect for myself. Oh, well.The ending of this book was a little abrupt. Especially after all the many sex scenes. (what did you expect?) But I thought it was also so poignant and sweet. Mac has some momma issues and Jessi demands that he deals with it and when he comes back for her and tells her about his therapy, I thought it was absolutely wonderful that Sarah McCarty included his feelings. It gave meaning to what is essentially just hot, steamy erotica, and I thought it was empowering. There are two close but no cigar menage scenes (though I would classify the second one as a menage) with Mac's friend, Zach, and I really, really hope that Sarah McCarty continues this series with his story. Jessi leads this poor guy on not once, but twice! I felt so bad for him!I highly recommend this book. It's really sexy and also really, really funny. Especially the first half of the book. Mac's Law will keep you panting and laughing and I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"I loved this book...it was even better than the Promises series. Contrary to what one of the previous reviewers mentioned, I especially loved the last scene with the heroine, Zach and Mac. I thought it was unbeleivable erotic...this is after all an erotic romance, and I love a steamy menage scene in mine!"},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"THE BOOK HAD ABUNDANCE OF SEX, WHICH WAS COOL!!! BUT THE MAIN CHARACTHER JESSIE HAD STUPID HANG UPS ABOUT A PAST LOVER THAT SHE NEVER REALLY HAD SEX WITH, AND SHE WAS SO OBSESSED WITH HAVING ANAL SEX THAT IT SEEMED LIKE THAT WAS ALL THE STORY FOCUSED ON. I ONLY GAVE IT THREE STARS BECAUSE OF ALL THE SEX."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"All I can say about this book is Oh My God! This has been the single most intense book I've ever read, they absolutely do not get any hotter than this one. I don't think I've ever blushed or squirmed in my seat as much as I did throughout this book and I LOVED IT!All of Sarah McCarty's books are out of this world and hotter than you know where.You absolutely do not want to miss out on this one!"},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"Holy cow! This book was so hot that I almost ended up as a big puddle in the middle of my bed! Mac is an extremely sex, demanding man - my type of man! His friend Zach is just as sexy.

McCarty's \\"Promises\\" series are also well developed, sexy stories that don't disappoint!"},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"I must disagree with the reviews who think this book was about \\"sharing\\". There were one or two minor scenes and it didn't even go all that far. This book, as with all of Sarah McCarty's, was filled with wonderful, well fleshed out (no pun intended) characters. I won't bother to summarize, as many already have. Suffice it to say that Sarah is an auto-buy for me. She always delivers three-dimensional characters, great storylines and hot alpha heros."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"This book had an abundance of sex scenes but that seems to be all there is. The plot is a bit lacking so there's isnt much of a story here.

Full of emotions, laughter, and the hottest love scenes that will leave you gasping for air and on the edge of arousal. Sarah McCarty's attention to the minutest detail never fails to pull me right into her stories. I felt like I was on Mac's ranch for I could smell Jessica's cooking, hear the shuffle of cowboy's feet coming to dinner after a hard day's work, and hear their comaraderie at the breakfast/dinner table.Ms. McCarty's love scenes are so full of intimacy and emotions that sometimes I felt like a voyeur. Speaking of which, Mac and Jessica explore that, plus so much more. I became an instant fan of Ms. McCarty's after reading her first book PROMISES LINGER; her books are seamless, and she is the master at fleshing out secondary characters. MAC's LAW is Book One in Ms. McCarty's Unchained series, and I am very much looking forward to what she has in store for us with some of Mac's hunky friends."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"Having heard such wonderful things about Sarah McCarty's writing, I couldn't wait to read one of her books for myself. And, who can go wrong with a hunky, stubborn alpha cowboy and the one woman who can keep him in line?I loved Mac's Law. From the very beginning this story is a fun romp with laugh out loud scenes intermixed with serious drama. This story makes the reader run the gamut of emotions, and the entire time the reader is cheering for Jessie and Mac to end up happily ever after.Jessie comes across with just the right touch of vulnerability after taking care of her ailing mother for the last 10 years, and strong determination. Her desire to work on Mac's ranch, and her presenting him with her sexual \\"to do\\" list, makes her a strong, modern-day woman who knows what she wants and isn't afraid to go after it. Mac, having lived through his mother's horrible depression, tries to wrap anyone he loves in cotton, and Jessie forces him to think, and to grow.With sizzling sex, deep emotions, and great romance, Mac's Law will have something for everyone."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"If there are reviews available for a book, I always read through them because who better to recommend a book that a fellow book lover? Having said that, in the years that I've used Amazon.com this is the only the second review that I have ever felt compelled to write. I'd give more than 5 stars if I could!After falling in love with the Promise series, I was very excited to read this first book in the Unchained series. One of Ms. McCarty's trademarks is her skill at creating scenes and situations that allow you to really connect with the characters and keep you cheering for them throughout the entire book. As with the Promise series, the character development in Mac's Law was fantastic and the love scenes were so hot I had to keep on checking my book for scorch marks! There is also a wonderful balance between love and lust which culminates with a menage scene that was so thoughtfully written, I felt that it really enhanced the beauty of Mac and Jessie's bond.I've read thousands of books and have only kept a handful on a \\"keepers\\" shelf (a total of eight books to be exact) - if Ms. McCarty keeps writing (please God yes!), I can see my collection expanding!"},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"Jessie longs to unleash her pent up sexual desires and once she sets eyes on Mac she knows he is the man to do it. Mac does his best to discourage Jessie because he \\"thinks\\" she is not the right woman for him, but Jessie knows better. Little does he know that Jessica has made a \\"to-do\\" list and she plans to live out most if not all of her fantasies with him. Mac and Jessie are multi-dimensional characters with sizzling chemistry, both in and out of the bedroom.Keep a bucket of ice handy when reading about Mac and Jessie! As usual Ms McCarty does not disappoint and takes the reader through a gauntlet of emotions. I know when I read a Sarah McCarty book I'm going to laugh, cry, cheer for the hero/heroine and squirm around in my chair from the HOT love scenes!The secondary characters are so memorable that when you are finished with Mac's Law you won't be able to wait until the next Unchained book comes out. HINT! HINT! Zach needs his own story!KarenB"},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"When Jessica Sterns applies for the job as a cook on the Circle H ranch, she expects the owner to be old, gray, and crotchety; but when she runs into Mac Hollister, all six feet of gorgeous masculinity, she quickly realizes the error of her assumption. The man radiates testosterone and sets her hormones on fire and she can't believe her luck when she finds out that he's her boss!When Mac meets Jessie he quickly learns there's more to her than meets the eye. When he finds out she's the J. C. Sterns that applied for the cook position on the Circle H, he immediately dismisses her tells her there was a misunderstanding, but Jessie doesn't back down. She stands her ground and insists on a chance to prove herself. Mac reluctantly agrees to a two-week trial.On the outside she appears fragile and feminine, but Jessie is a woman who knows how to take care of herself and she's got a steely determination that has Mac wondering just what other surprises lurk beneath the surface. Oh, and what wonderful surprises she's got in store for him! The biggest surprise a list of sexual to-do's which he agrees to help her fulfill without qualm.The sparks fly between them and one by one they check off items on the list. As each item gets checked off, their emotions for one another get stronger and stronger. It's when they reach the last item on the list that Jessie realizes that she only wants to live out her fantasies with Mac. Forever.Sarah McCarty has done it again! Unchained: Mac's Law is a fabulously sensual read that will have you laughing out loud in some parts, and squirming in your chair in arousal in others. The depth of Ms. McCarty's characterization is nothing short of phenomenal. With each and every book, I feel like I can personally relate to each of the characters and that I am in the story with them. The sex between Mac and Jessie is scorching, as it is between all the couples in her books. But, Ms. McCarty adds something new to her writing: the element of a partial-menage. While I am not a fan of menage, I understand the deeper meaning behind the partial-menage so I was not at all put off by the addition of this; in fact, I found it to be a very touching part of the story. If you read the story, you will see what I mean, and if I tell you any more I'll ruin it for you, so I'll stop here.Unchained: Mac's Law is by far one of the best books I have ever read, as are all of Sarah McCarty's books. If you're looking for an emotional yet sexy, fun yet tender story of two people finding love, then you have definitely found it in this erotically romantic tale! I am definitely looking forward to the next installment of the Unchained series, and I can't wait to see where Ms. McCarty takes me next!"},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"After flipping through this book before reading, I almost didn't read it. The NEAR menage ALMOST made me pass this one up. That would have been a real shame. I thought \\"well it is a Sarah McCarty\\". All I can say is WOW. I had read the 3 in the Promise series so I knew that no one, and I mean NO ONE, does it better than Sarah when it comes to writing. This was no exception. Mac and Jessie stole my heart. I loved the near menage when they realize that they want no one but each other. I only hope Zach will get his own story soon. I laughed, I cried and I hated it when it was over. Sarah's books are definately re-reads for me."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"This book centers on Jessie--out heroine--propelled with single-minded purpose toward finding the sexual fulfillment she has dreamed of; fulfillment she has created for herself in fantasy only. Until now.That she finds in Mac, her designated guide, a man whose skills and experience put him firmly outside the bounds of this genre's more traditional romantic hero, only adds to the uncertainty and excitement for Jessie and the reader.Adding to the sexual excitement is the breath-hitching tenderness promised in every Sarah McCarty read. She takes special care of these characters--as she does throughout all of her work. The result is a love born of adventure, intelligence, respect, sensuality and--to keep the reader in a near constant state of frenzy--appetite.Pushing the boundaries a bit more than in her previous work, McCarty employs a near menage at the story's powerful conclusion, skillfully using the scene to culminate Jessie's fantasy To Do list. Here, McCarty commands courage from Jessie, Mac (now deeply in love and equally possessive of Jessie) and the reader.Given the care McCarty shows her characters, I was initially startled when she invited another into Mac and Jessie's bedroom. Trusting the author however, I rose to her challenge and was pleasantly surprised when exhilaration replaced trepidation. When I finished this book, I was still cheering the romantic couple."},{"Title":"Mac's Law","review":"Okay, I know it's erotica, but this book had one (or two) sex scenes too many. I felt exhausted and sore. The ending made no sense at all, but you don't read these books for the plot.. However, that being said, with judicious reading and skimming, I feel this could be a very fine book (ie it just need better editing) And despite my criticisms it's still a keeper for me.

Although she is skeptical of modern attitudes about sex, Kara finally decides to find the perfect man for a love-free fling. Perhaps enjoying sex for sex's sake will free her from her nesting instinct well enough to not jump so fast when the next sexy guy comes along. And who better to aid her than Ross Gabriel, her best friend. After all, Ross is more into comic books and commitment, assuring that Kara will not get too involved.Ross has no desire to climb the corporate ladder of success with its necessary encumbrances of mortgage and wife. That is, until Kara captures his attention. Perhaps he will never want to be upper level management, but Kara inspires dreams of permanence that he has never before entertained. Too bad Ross blows his opportunity while he wrestles with the conundrums of freedom verse responsibility. Meanwhile, other guys are noticing Kara's transformation and Ross had best decide what he wants before it gets away forever.Author Dawn Atkins brings her gift for amusement to the Blaze line, proving love and sex are not so easily separated in FRIENDLY PERSUASION. While her lightly glib tone may frustrate readers seeking the Blaze line's traditionally sexually heated pages, Atkins does combine sexual exploration with fantasy to achieve heated possibilities. Further, Atkins fans will be pleased to see her expanding into the Blaze line and hope for more of Atkins' fun, sexy romps. FRIENDLY PERSUASION comes recommended."},{"Title":"Friendly Persuasion (Blaze, Book 93)","review":"Dawn Atkins' strengths are her deep characterization and vivid voice. I particularly adored Ross, the loveable, colorful hero of Friendly Persuasion. The fantasy scenarios he creates with the heroine as two good friends become lovers are as varied as they are hot. The secondary romance was also involving as the heroine's best friend goes through an emotional transformation; even though we all know how romance novels end, I wasn't sure how the subplot would turn out. Kudos to Dawn Atkins for another fun yet believable romance between &quot;real&quot; people."},{"Title":"Friendly Persuasion (Blaze, Book 93)","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters were refreshingly fleshed out and believable, the dialogue was natural and flowing.The only thing I didn't quite like was that Ross, the &quot;hero&quot; of the story, ultimately conforms to the heroine's ideas of the type of man he should be. True, he comes around to her way of thinking &quot;on his own,&quot; but nonetheless I didn't appreciate that he had to in the first place. Other than that it was a good read, particularly comparatively speaking."},{"Title":"Pocket Guide to Nursing Diagnoses, 7e","review":"This book was selected for inclusion in &quot;Core Collection in Nursing and the Allied Health Sciences&quot; from Oryx Press, 1990."},{"Title":"Prophets & Poets: A Companion to the Prophetic Books of the Old Testament","review":"Emmerson has edited an interesting compilation of articles designed to enhance one's reading of the prophetic books and provide current applications for Christians. Applications are scattered throughout the book but seem a bit disjoined from the text. About a dozen contributors attempt to guide the reader toward a better understanding of the message of each book (or prophet) but the presentation is uneven. Rogerson, for example, spends significant time sifting passages to find what represents the real prophet and what comes from later editors or the community. He still holds to the old dictum that negative (e.g. judgment oracles) represent a more original word from the prophet while positive notes (e.g. salvation oracles) are later and usually post-exilic additions. Entries by John Barton and Grace Emmerson are among the better providing more real guidance on the prophetic writings. Some of the applications are helpful, some wrong (\\"Israel\\" used for Jacob, makes three, not two, ways it is used in the OT, 52), and many are in the form of thought provoking questions. This book, which has a greater number of typographical errors than most, would be helpful to a beginning student but other, more evenly presented works, are more helpful."},{"Title":"The Long March: The Choctaw's Gift to Irish Famine Relief","review":"(I got this book in Dublin, Ireland, recently.)This is a truly delightful book. The drawings are lovingly created and the story is both touching and well written. What makes it even more compelling is that it is based on a wonderful true act of human generosity over 150 years ago, from one impoverished people to another, who, although worlds apart in both distance and cultures, had a common enemy, in hunger and oppression.The author travelled to Oklahoma to research the book and has gone to great lengths to ensure the drawings are authentic as well as inspiring. I particularly like the drawings of the great-grandmother and indeed,the clever shadow of the American eagle when Choona raises his arms in the final drawing as well as the subtle, celtic symbols to be found in this same drawing. &quot;The Long March&quot; is a must for the millions of us with Irish-American heritage - every Irish American child should read this book!"},{"Title":"The Long March: The Choctaw's Gift to Irish Famine Relief","review":"In 1847 an impoverished displaced group of Choctaw Indians collected from their meager resources the sum of $170 to send toward food relief for the Irish Potato Famine.Through the memories of Choona, now known as Tom, who is very, very old, we learn of how he, as a young man, at last learned of that part of his family's history about which no one would speak &amp; yet everyone looked so wounded. The Long March, when his people were forced to walk from Florida to Mississippi all through one fearsome, killing winter.The Long March is rich in American history &amp; memory. The marvelous drawings create a magically real place. This is a must for anyone who loves looking at other ways to live in community; other ways of teaching the spirit to grow &amp; learning about courage, wisdom &amp; respecting the memories.An amazing book - to be read &amp; read again &amp; again &amp; the pictures to be studied &amp; dreamed over. Beautifully evocative."},{"Title":"The Long March: The Choctaw's Gift to Irish Famine Relief","review":"This book seems to be a wonderful portrayal of a Native American family and community and their culture and history. One point that I appreciate is that the author tried to stay true to the Choctaw cultural activities, arts and lifestyle in the beautiful drawings and text. The author did not meld several different tribal cultures together as a homogenous \\"Native American culture.\\" The message of the book also helps young readers to respect the sacrifices and values of the tribe, as well as to question the way Euro-Americans treated them in the past. A treasured book."},{"Title":"The Long March: The Choctaw's Gift to Irish Famine Relief","review":"An old man, now called Tom but once called Choona, tells a story from his youth, the story of how and why the Choctaw came to the aid of the Irish suffering starvation in 1847. He relates that when news of the Irish famine reached the village a meeting is called to discuss what could be done. At the Tribal Council, Choonas' uncle Moshi relates the story of the Irish suffering and says the tribe has been asked to help. The silence is deafening. Soon enough, objections arise, \\"Why should we help the Nahullo?,\\" (whites) is the popular and understandable refrain.For the Choctaw had suffered greatly under the harsh rule of the white man, the forced relocation of the tribe from Mississippi to Oklahoma had killed young and old and nearly destroyed the tribe. Then Choonas Great Grand Mother begins to talk, she tells the history of The Trail of Tears; she speaks of the starvation, the pain and suffering endured and she shows how the Irish now walk their own Trail of Tears. Needless to say, her arguments carry the day.Choona however, is not convinced. Back at home he raises objections, his Great Grandmother addresses his objections by telling him of some unknown history, with that things snap into focus and his heart is turned. He votes to send the money.The author, Marie-Louise Fitzpatrick presents the Trail of Tears and An Gorta Mor as journeys on the Via Dolorosa, the Choctaw and Irish walk The Way of Sorrows, their common suffering unites them. There's more to this suffering of course, just as The Word becoming flesh sanctified the flesh, the suffering of the Incarnate Word sanctified suffering. Great as the suffering of the Choctaw and Irish was however, it did not match Christs. Christ suffering, His offering, was in atonement for all sins through all eternity; His suffering was an eternal offering. Because of this, both Choctaw and Irish walked with Christ as He walked the Via Dolorosa and He sanctified their suffering.This is a great story and deserves to be widely read. As it is written for children from 4 to 84 it can be read and examined on different levels. Its utility for helping examine the human condition to children is self-evident. Serious issues are presented in an age appropiate manner, the story is so nuanced however, the deeper sub-text of the story can be examined as the child matures. Again, the story is top notch and the illustrations superb, this is a remarkable book. Both, Gregory E. Pyle, Chief of the Choctaw Nation as well as Gary Whitedeer, Keeper of The Treasures mark this book with their imprimatuer."},{"Title":"The Long March: The Choctaw's Gift to Irish Famine Relief","review":"This book is worth getting for the artwork alone. The story itself is about a forgotten piece of AmerIndian - Celtic history that is worth remembering: How the impoverished Choctaw tribe turned the tragedy of The Long March into a blessing for a people an ocean away.This story is true but the parable quality makes it especially worth reading: How this Indian people, the Choctaw Nation, decided to help a specific group of the white race that had afflicted them. In a time of Ireland's great distress, the Choctaw, forgave and reached out to these starving people in simple understanding of the hardships the Potato Famine was creating.The book is written by Marie-Louise Fitzpatrick who is from and who is Irish and lives in Ireland. She reseached the events of this humanitarian gift in conjunction with the Choctaw tribe.The magnificent art work was done by a Native American man, Gary WhiteDeer who lives in Ada, Oklahoma. He has a tremendous talent and ability. He depicts the despair and horror of The Great March that uprooted so many Southern Tribes. He show the whole tragic incident of great cruelty the grueling trek to Oklahoma during the Presidency of Andrew Jackson. Yet WhiteDeer fills these same pictures with sympathy, understanding and shows the great strength, courage and determination of these people to survive.I am Irish steeped in Irish history, legend and myth, yet I had never heard the story before. I know several of the Choctaw Nation with whom I shared the book, and they, too, had never heard the story. This is one piece of American - Irish history that SHOULD BE remembered and this book does it with clarity, charity and style.Although The Great March is supposed to be a children's book, I highly recommend it to teachers of Anthropolgy, History, Art, Philosophy and Psychology at an adult level, as well as to high school teachers of these subjects, and teachers and parents of grade school children for whom this book was specifically written."},{"Title":"The Long March: The Choctaw's Gift to Irish Famine Relief","review":"An excellent book.

It isn't an economic analysis in the sense of theory and mathematical proof, but it is instead a straightforward discussion of (in detail) why the attempts at reform were not fixing the underlying problems of the Soviet approach.The planning agencies and the hierarchy of centralization are discussed a length (though I would have liked more details on the internal workings of the Gosplan myself), \\"centralized pluralism\\" and problems of decentralization are discussed, you'll learn about normed net profit and other approaches to tracking planned output, also investment, wages and differences between industry and agriculture, inflation, choice and of course incentives and calculation problems in each of these areas are all discussed at great length. Finally future options are discussed - as this was pre-collapse.The best thing about this text is the detailed analysis of why incentive structures have failed in socialist experimentation and why all myriad of reforms undertaken did not help. The data and anecdote from the real world experience is compelling. This unbiased accounting of the issues is priceless.To give one quick gem from the book: one of the earliest reforms was a slight decentralization, since central planners could not determine exactly what each firm could produce. Ministries were set up with local level planners and what amounted to big public firms which could decide exactly how to fulfill a more general plan or target. Planning, rather than profit-maximization, means that Soviet firms must reach a target, and incentives put in place so that workers and managers will work toward fulfillment (be they monetary or otherwise) will encourage those who make decisions on how to reach the target attempt to produce the most at the least cost to themselves (in terms of labor, for example).So, planners provide a target - and it tends not to be in money terms (since prices of inputs will be set by planners and may not be cost effective for the other firm to use, etc, but you'll see it doesn't matter). So, they will choose a target such as 100 tons of boots. The firm will then have to choose how to reach this target. So, they find the most heavy material to use for boots. They produce much less than expected, often making a horrible final product, but follow the letter of the plan and cannot be punished.So, the planners change the target. Instead they ask for a certain number of boots. The next batch are made from the flimsiest of materials, made appreciably smaller or all in the same size, run through the machine at the least cost, making it faster and cheaper to produce in hopes of squeezing some extra funds out of savings or shortening the work-day.So, then the planners to to combine requests, but the process continues. You cannot tell them exactly the size, color, weight, dimensions, materials -- because the central planners cannot know what inputs exactly and demands exactly that you must work with. That is why the Soviets were trying to decentralize in the first place!So, pipe firms were told to make x number of tons and used the heaviest of metals - but when it was changed to meters, they produced light cheap pipes that were unusable and everyone agreed that they must switch back. They used tons for everything even plastic dolls! Monetary aggregate measures also would lead to bad mixtures of inputs, no single measure was impossible (or even difficult) to use to advanatge. Cloth was planned in linear meters and led to long thin strips of cloth being made; if square meters were used they would be made too thin, while they needed to be sturdy and durable.One transortation firm was told to carry so many hundreds of tons of materials so many kilometers per year, in hopes that they would spend the day hauling the materials between the other firms in order than inputs were brought to the firms which needed them. They succeeeded in encouraging the trucking firm to drive in circles all day!!They even drove empty, in order to clock more kilometers with which to multiply the number of tons hauled... yes and geologists also fulfilled planning targets of \\"number of meters dug\\" so that the old adage of digging holes and filling them up again was never truer."},{"Title":"Death from the other side: Your ministry to the bereaved","review":"This book is difficult to read but not impossible. I've read other books on Soviet economic structure and production, but this one is fairly dry and boring. a good book if you can muscle through it and if you want to learn something.

Although she writes wittily about her affair with Burt Reynolds, her marriage to cult filmmaker John Carpenter, her liaisons with various Hollywood personalities, and behind the scenes mayhem during the filming of \\"The Fog\\", \\"The Swamp Thing\\", \\"The Cannonball Run\\", and her hit television sitcom \\"Maude\\", her memoir is more about her personal journey as a wounded woman who ached for peace and joy in her relationships with men.Her candor is refreshing. She does not flinch from sharing with the reader intimate details about sex, psychics, gurus, and her quest to heal the trauma of being abandoned by her father when she was still a child. The forty or so chapters around which she has arranged her material reveal a vibrant woman who wanted to experience life fully, to learn from her experiences, to heal her wounds, and to grow as an actress and woman.Though she deals candidly with \\"heavy\\" subjects, her style is never maudlin or judgmental or self-pitying. She is able to find humor and farce even in the most intense situations of life.So read this book as a Hollywood memoir full of juicy revelations if you wish. But the pleasure I got from it was not reading about her career arc but her personal journey as a woman through the rapidly shifting zeitgeist of the past five decades.In time, her well-rounded memoir will grow in stature."},{"Title":"There Are Worse Things I Could Do","review":"Adrienne Barbeau has written a completely delightful autobiography. I loved it, and only put it down when I had no choice. Her life is fascinating, and her writing style is funny, touching, and endearing. The description of her wedding had me laughing uncontrollably, while parts about losses in her life had me almost in tears. I have been busy since I finished this book recommending it to everyone I know who reads! I sincerely hope Adrienne Barbeau will not stop now, but will write, and write, and write.Sally Fallis"},{"Title":"There Are Worse Things I Could Do","review":"Adrienne Barbeau's first book is a wonderful testament to a life lived. Good, bad or indifferent she propels her readers to LIVE.Memoirs are always tough, and Barbeau nailed it! Even if I did not know her voice, from the many films, plays and TV shows she has been a part of, her written voice comes through so clearly. It is simultaneously kind, comic and sad without ever being maudlin.Barbeau has a wonderful ability to take the reader in as if writing each reader a note about the day to day, and then she turns things that note around. You are reading a note from a friend and then realize that: Yes she was married to one of the most notable directors of horror in the U.S, yes she had an affair with Burt Reynolds. And yes she has had many loves in her time. Wow! But rather than delivering a tell all revealing the warts of others - although we do read a bit about those warts - Barbeau manages to undauntingly keep the focus on herself. While laughing at herself, and her foibles as a person with loves gained and lost, she takes the comic and imbues it with such heart the reader can visualize how double sided comedy is within each us; as when we laugh at ourselves, there tends to be some sadness lurking - conversely she explores her own tragedies such as the passing of her mother and her best friend, and reveals hope.When reading this book, I was reminded of being lost on occasion. In THERE ARE WORSE THINGS I COULD DO, the reader, along with Adrienne, takes a journey. Barbeau reminds us that when we are lost we seek acceptance, regardless of what that acceptance might mean. But as we lose ourselves amidst gaining acceptance, we discover how within that losing, we can all find ourselves anew.What is so fantastic about this read is Barbeau's refusal to be consumed by circumstance.She keeps on going, keeps living, and keeps growing. For me as a woman, what is so particularly compelling about this book, is that she lets all women know that age truly, does not matter. And she does this simply by revealing her life, not by being pedantic. This is a message to all of us, to keep on keeping on. Ultimately she finds the love she so deserves, and rediscovers her muses: her children. Still, Barbeau reminds us that each day is a blank slate. and although Adrienne has found her muses, she keeps working at her life - understanding that with each day, ones life may need some reconfiguring. And that reconfiguring is a good thing...I was lucky enough to hear Barbeau read passages from the book, and the reading added a wonderful dimension to my understanding of her experiences. Her timing is impeccable, and I hope her publisher will push extensively for a nationwide tour with the author."},{"Title":"There Are Worse Things I Could Do","review":"WOW!!!!

It is based on the journals she kept which she \\"began in 1955.\\" She \\"wrote every day for the next forty years.\\"The above excerpt tells you generally what the book is about. Along the way, Barbeau tells us about \\"relationships and love affairs, emotional highs and lows, friendships and loss.\\"Highlights of this book include talking about her two hit TV shows (\\"Maude\\" and \\"Carnivale\\"), her major movies (\\"The Fog,\\" \\"Escape from New York,\\" \\"Swamp Thing,\\" and \\"Creepshow\\"), her relationship with 1970's superstar Burt Reynolds, and her two marriages (the first to horror and science fiction director John Carpenter).The title of this book is the title of a major song Barbeau sung in the original Broadway production of \\"Grease\\" which was \\"a major turning point in [her] life.\\"This autobiography is well written. What I especially liked was Barbeau's directness and the fact that you could easily follow the timeline of her life story.Included in the book's approximate center are over forty black and white photographs. My favorite is the one that has her character in the movie \\"The Convent\\" gunning down nuns (or as she says \\"blowing away nuns\\").Barbeau throughout her book doesn't come off as self-absorbed or an airhead. Instead she comes off as a smart, witty, loving, and giving person who, as this book chronicles, is a survivor.Finally, I did find a few problems:(1) I felt that Barbeau was holding back on certain details of her life story. For example, we are not told anything about the book's provocative cover photograph (shown above by Amazon). I learned that this is Barbeau's 1978 pin-up poster that actually rivaled Farrah Fawcett's poster of the same decade. Why are we not told anything about this?(2) Many of the stories in her book are not followed up and this might be frustrating for some readers.(3) She tends to sometimes flip-flop back and forth between present and past tense.In conclusion, this is a good, solid, witty, and revealing autobiography about an actor who has been in the \\"biz\\" for more than four decades. It is definitely better than the standard actor autobiography!!(first published 2006; introduction {entitled \\"The Journals\\"}; 40 chapters; main narrative 335 pages; acknowledgements {entitled \\"Thank You\\"})+++++"},{"Title":"There Are Worse Things I Could Do","review":"It is both a brave and generous act for Adrienne Barbeau to share her remarkable journey, and she does so with great grace, honesty and humor.

Alas, she is very much a woman, an actress and singer, who, among her many roles, has played no small part as a feminist icon redefining what we think women can do on camera and off. But don't presume you must be a fan, or even familiar with her work to enjoy this book, this memoir stands on it's own.

The problem, as she admits at the start of the book, is that the thousands of diary pages contain almost nothing about her acting. So she has few details of the major performances she has been involved in. Instead she has plenty of information on her relationships, her loves and her many attempts at therapy. As long as you accept her limited career memory, it makes for a good book because she knows how to tell a story. And even when she lacks some details about her working background she manages to find something in her personal life to make the stories memorable.There are some gaps that stick out--she claims she lived over three years in New York City before getting hired for a role there, yet she doesn't really say how she could afford her own apartment other than being a go-go dancer at some clubs (while paying for expensive acting lessons and therapy up to three times a week!). She claims to be incredibly naive, such as falling in love with a gay man or working for a Mafia boss without knowing the guy's background to the point that at times it's a bit hard to believe that she is as dumb as she claims to be.She gets a couple minor facts wrong (Fred Grandy was not an \\"Ohio congressman\\"--he was from Iowa) but for the most part she breezes through the actors she worked with. But she refuses to give the names of some of the famous people she had affairs with, which detracts slightly from the credibility of the book.As good as the book is, there is a sadness throughout, in which she never seems secure and doesn't know why. She gets into a hit Broadway show and then immediately wants to quit. She is drawn to men who are unavailable for long-term romantic relationships. She sabotages her career with some odd choices.That insecurity is obviously from her dad abandoning the family when she was a child, but for years she had a difficult time admitting that. Instead she hopped from man to man and comes across as not only amoral but often immoral. So although she claims a wide-eyed innocence, the truth that comes out of her story is that instead of confronting her childhood issues head-on, she pushed them to the background and chose from an early age to support liberal lifestyles that were not so innocent. Instead of learning the lessons to help her achieve the personal growth she claims she wanted so badly, she often drew wrong conclusions when life didn't work out the way she liked.It's certainly one of the better written celebrity autobiographies because of her talent at the printed word. You only wish she had made better choices and accepted herself years before writing this."},{"Title":"There Are Worse Things I Could Do","review":"In spite of its...ahem...eyecatching cover, this is a fairly depressing book. Adrienne Barbeau seems to have had a fairly depressing life. With exceptions, after reading this book, one cannot imagine ANYONE ever going into the movies or acting at all. One must give credit to Barbeau's acting talent. In spite of being generally miserable off the screen, she still gave solid notable performances in all of her efforts.

Moreover, if the book is meant for a broad public, the risk is to write something of difficult understanding for the reader. Therefore, it is a pleasure to present this book whose authors are two Russian theoretical physicists. With intelligence and sensibility, they underline the poetic of physics giving us a description of its ''art'' trough an easy formal language.The first part of the book describes particular aspects of the mechanisms of natural phenomena, such as the way whales can communicate at great distances, or the rivers of the northern hemisphere erode the right bank while the opposite will happen in the southern hemisphere, or why the lakes have single emissaries when the rivers can have up to hundred of affluents.But more complicated phenomena will be explained as well, with reduced use of mathematical formalisms. Hence, it is possible to learn how to listen more carefully at the sound of a violin or how microwave ovens work.Eventually, in the last part of the book, the authors start to give an introduction to the world of quantum mechanics describing many aspects of contemporary physics, like the problem of high critical temperature superconductors.This book is very stimulating and perfectly addressed to who begins to become interested or simply curious of the mechanism that regulates some physical phenomena of our life. But at the same time the experienced reader also can easily find some peculiar aspects of the physics around us.This book originates from the curiosity of the two authors towards the world and the mechanisms that regulate it and their ability acquired in many years of dedication to their scientific work. Lev Aslamov, unfortunately prematurely died, and Andrei Varlamov, have been, for many years, collaborators and coauthors of the scientific Russian review: &quot;Kvant&quot;. They are also two of the maximum representatives of the Russian school of theoretical physics. Important is their work on the physics of superconductors. I personally know Andrei Varlamov for some years; I have always appreciated his effort to transmit enthusiasm in all the things around himself. This book is the fruit of this kind of enthusiasm."},{"Title":"The Wonders of Physics","review":"Unlike many other similar books, this one really emphasises the little things around us that physicists find a simple delight in understanding. There is a great range of topics (27), which you can read in any order you wish.This book is accessible to a wide audience due to its range of topics (from how a violin works, to modern superconducting technology) and excellent writing style. Yes, there are some equations, but you can skip over them without missing the main ideas of the chapter.I read it first as a freshmen in college and can still get something out of it today as a PhD candidate in physics. A great book to keep in a science library at school or home."},{"Title":"Requirements Engineering","review":"This book presents in the space of some 200 pages, split into 9 chapters, a clear and concise introduction to a state-of-the-art approach to requirements engineering (RE). It starts out by introducing a generic RE process, which is then instatiated, later in the book, into concrete processes for generating stakeholder requirements (i.e. user requirements) and system requirements.The beautiful thing aboout this generic process (and the concrete ones to follow it) is that V&V; and change management are intrinsically part of it. The authors are particularly strong in their treatment of traceability. They have gone into an unusual depth. The book has some good advice on writing better requirements . In particular, I find the idea of requirements boilerplates (i.e. templates for each class of requirements) extremely useful. The book concludes with an introduction/demonstration of the DOORS RE tool, from Telelogic (the affiliation of two of the authors).Overall, this is an excellent book that every requirements engineer, should have on their desk."},{"Title":"Requirements Engineering","review":"I work in a large financial institution with projects that span across lines of business. I train on process improvement and requirements is one of the key areas I focus on. This book is short and to the point. It provides good examples and is a great read for someone who is just starting out in requirements management or requirements documentation. It provides information on the management aspects of requirements work and practical advice on requirements ellicitation."},{"Title":"Requirements Engineering","review":"CONCLUSIONThis book really didn't hit the mark for me. It mainly falls down in not clearly communicating its content. It tries to cover a fair bit of territory in a small book, and the result is you can only understand it if you already know the content, which pretty much defeats the purpose of reading it.GENERALA fair bit of the content covered things that I wanted to know more about, but I found that the book either told me things I already knew, or else covered things that I didn't know but didn't explain them properly. It is pitched at a reasonably high level, so if you are newer to the area you would get lost or baffled quickly.It is a fairly short book, at a little under 200 small pages, and so coverage of some areas was very brief and as a result not informative.The authors are from a software background, and although they have tried to make the book applicable to any systems engineering process, their software background does come through. Often content is explained using concepts and language from software engineering, which may not communicate well to those from other fields.There is some use of examples in the book, and this does help to explain the concepts, but I found many of the examples were too limited or trivial to provide a deeper understanding.CONTENTModelling section. Techniques were only briefly covered, and although the fact that there is an intimate relationship between modelling and requirements is stressed early on in the text, there is no significant explanation of how to use modelling to help generate requirements.Chapter 4 has quite a good coverage of spec writing, but really quite brief (just 14 pages). Nothing specific is mentioned about reviewing, apart from the implication that the criteria for good requirements stated should be the basis for reviewing. The boilerplate requirement concept was quite good.Perhaps the best chapter in the book for me was Chapter 7 on advanced traceability. This had some good ideas that were generally well explained, although at times the explanations used concepts and language that were targeted towards software types.FORMATTING AND PRESENTATIONDespite my real desire to learn more about requirements engineering, I couldn't help my attention and interest level taking a dive whenever I read more of this book. It's hard work to digest - both in the writing style, the graphics, and the whole approach to informing the reader. Little effort has been giving to making the experience enjoyable or easy.Diagrams are very basic, and typically uninformative. Have a look at the diagram on p116 in the \\"look Inside\\" function as a typical example. If figure 6.1 makes the text on this page clear to you, then disregard my comment about the diagrams being uninformative for your case.Formatting of the document (eg font) is very dull, which adds to the lack of readability. There are also occasional editorial problems, like sentences chopped off with out an ending.Maybe I'm being a little harsh on this book, because at the same time I was reading a book called \\"The non-designers Design Book\\", about designing documents. The Design book was a model of clear presentation, visually attractive, lots of clear examples and enjoyable to read, which Requirements Engineering was none of. Although the Design book is pitched straight at beginners, after reading it, the flaws in the design of Requirements Engineering book as a document were very obvious."},{"Title":"Requirements Engineering","review":"The reference continues to be a classic and essential foundation for the growing requirements management domain, an area greatly needed in the complexity of software and systems engineering. It provides guidance to users, managers, developers, quality assurance, security experts, and analysts to overcome the basic challenges in systems development."},{"Title":"Requirements Engineering","review":"I have read a number of books on requirements engineering and I found this one to be by far the best aligned with my way of thinking for a number of reasons. It is very concisely written and therefore could be read, digested, and applied within a few weeks. The plentiful examples were realistic enough for me to understand every concept introduced. Many useful modeling techniques were introduced and explained. A good balance of text and matching clear diagrams were presented throughout. The methods and principles could be applied to relatively simple systems as well as being scalable to more complex systems. The authors didn't try to cover all aspects of systems engineering, but did reference other systems engineering concepts in a meaningful way such that requirements engineering could be placed in context, for example, the linkages to design and testing are explained, but those subjects are not. Different kinds of requirements, and their relationships to each other, are described and differentiated crisply. I spend a significant amount of time writing and managing requirements and I found this book very helpful. I refer to it frequently."},{"Title":"Requirements Engineering","review":"This book is a very difficult book to read. The diagrams are really not made in a proper way some boxes seem to be going out of the diagram. The text is meant to be for people to start off on Requirements Engineering but it isnt.It thinks the person already understands everything. The material is presented in a very dry manner.Examples are given for sailing. Everyone does not have a sail boat or a passion for sailing. The author goes on to talk about user and system requirements and finally gives better examples for them all the way in traceability, where you finally understand the difference to some extent. Very poor examples. They are no slides for this book to be used as a main course book. There is not really an teaching material for an instructor to use. I am forced to use this book to teach a Requirements Engineering course and have already suggested that this is not a good book at all to teach undergraduate students of Computer science. First of all the author says this book covers system engineering and keeps on jumping between software and system engineering."},{"Title":"Baby-Safe Houseplants & Cut Flowers: A Guide to Keeping Children and Plants Safely Under the Same Roof","review":"It looks like this book may be hard to find, but it's worth the extra effort. It is very informative without becoming overly technical, and espouses common sense precaution without crossing the line into hysterical crusading (well...except for a tiny bit of &quot;scare tactics&quot; at the very beginning). Authors John and Delores Alber preface their book some basic recommendations for how to avoid problems, then acknowledge we're human and set out to arm us with information.The first sections focus on basic groundrules. They range from 'use common sense' to &quot;be prepared for emergencies,&quot; and the authors makes specific suggestions both for precautionary measures and for emergency response. This is followed by a brief section on how plants are properly named (critical to accurately identifying a plant), a list of common plant toxins &amp; how they damage, and plant selection tables for picking out innocuous plants. Then the focus switches to identifying hazards.The main body of the book is an identification guide to common houseplants and florist flowers focusing on toxicity potential. Plants are organized alphabetically by genus and species, and each entry lists common names as available. Entries include a general description of the plant, an sketch illustration, any noteworthy species or varieties, and an evaluation of its dangers with specific precautionary recommendations and reference listings for further investigation. The index is satisfactorily comprehensive, containing both scientific and widely popular common names.What I really think makes this book stand out is the amount of background the authors provide on their findings. Rather than just say, &quot;Safe,&quot; &quot;Unsafe,&quot; or &quot;Prosecutable,&quot; the Albers tell you who has made the evaluation (often Poison Control), whether it has been researched formally or is simply a compilation of observations, and any reservations they may have concerning the finding. They tell you straight up that they plan on erring on the side of caution, but they give you more than enough information to let YOU make the final call on whether the plant needs to be shunned."},{"Title":"Baby-Safe Houseplants & Cut Flowers: A Guide to Keeping Children and Plants Safely Under the Same Roof","review":"This book is very comprehensive, more so than the poison control center lists that I've seen. From the book I learned things about toxicity of orchids of which orchid-growing experts were unaware. The authors also address the toxicity of things other than houseplants and cut flowers themselves, such as pesticides that might have been sprayed on the leaves of houseplants and preservatives with which cut flowers may have been treated. This book would make an excellent present for parents of young children."},{"Title":"Baby-Safe Houseplants & Cut Flowers: A Guide to Keeping Children and Plants Safely Under the Same Roof","review":"This book is very thorough in it's descriptions of the houseplants and their toxicity. It includes sketches of the plants for identification. It makes recommendations about whether the plant is safe for homes w/ children, should be kept out of reach of children, or should not be in homes with children. I found it a very helpful tool in childproofing my home."},{"Title":"Baby-Safe Houseplants & Cut Flowers: A Guide to Keeping Children and Plants Safely Under the Same Roof","review":"Good book but no color plates.

The only thing I could wish could be added would be some information on managing object oriented projects (something I have had to improvise on...lazy as that sounds!).

First, theinformation is very out of date. You cannot expect a book written 1992(I believe) to be highly applicaple to today's technology. Second,...[the amount I paid] is way overpriced for a &quot;paperback&quot;(I'm still trying to figure out what &quot;text book binding&quot;means) that is as skimpy on information as this. Close to 10 pageswere dedicated to listing project management software that doesn'texist today.For the value of your dollar, you could probably gettwo other books with 4x the information."},{"Title":"Inside Sahara","review":"This is a very beautiful coffee-table-style book containing almost 200 pages of pictures taken by photographer Basil Pao. It is large format (31 x 25 cm) and hardcover and printed on glossy paper. A pleasure for anyone with an eye for beautiful pictures and/or an interest in the Sahara area of northern Africa.This book should not be confused with the book \\"Sahara\\" by Michael Palin. That book also contains a lot of pictures by Basil Pao, but in that book the pictures are secondary to the text written by Michael Palin.\\"Inside Sahara\\", on the other hand, is exclusively Basil Pao's book. Michael Palin's name is featured on the cover, but his contribution consists only of a 2-page introduction.Both books are, of course, based on the trip that Michael Palin and a film crew did, traveling around the Sahara Desert in 2001 making a television program for the BBC.Most of the pictures in \\"Inside Sahara\\" feature people in one way or another. This may seem surprising - I had expected more pictures of landscapes and edifices and statues, etc. But on reflection aren't people what we people really find the most interesting, wherever we go?The best pictures are featured as stunning two-page spreads. All of the pictures have captions explaining what is happening in the picture and where it was taken.My only criticism is that there are 12 pages that feature 75 \\"behind the scenes\\" photos of the filming crew that accompanied Michael Palin on the trip. These pictures are so small (6 x 4 cm) that it's difficult to see what they are supposed to show. These 12 pages could have been omitted, or used for better purposes.Highly recommended for anyone who loves beautiful photographs, especially photographs of interesting people in a largely unknown part of the world.Rennie PetersenPS. For those who might be interested, I've written an Amazon \\"So You'd Like To\\" guide about Basil Pao and his participation in the Michael Palin trips and the books that have been produced by Basil Pao and Michael Palin. You can find it by clicking on my name and then finding the link to my \\"So You'd Like To\\" guides a little ways down on the left of my profile page."},{"Title":"Inside Sahara","review":"Superb pictures, illustrating the reality of desert life, and the people of the desert in their many ways of life. Great book!"},{"Title":"Freedom to Differ: The Shaping of the Gay and Lesbian Struggle for Civil Rights","review":"but I would not use it as the sole text for an upper division course on GLBT theory (Vaid, Turner and D'Emillo) would be better choices.Miller summarizes the struggle for GLBT equality, the historical successes and failures of the later 20th century, but there was not enough material for my personal tastes. I respect the work she has produced, but cannot see why a book of this size was produced when there was no lack of research materials for her to work with.The book comes across better as a series of case studies rather than a historical or politcal retrospective, and needs to be reclassified as such. Perhaps I will be accused of nitpicking, but with the right mounting another round of attacks on GLBT rights, we need to understand what resources we have available for our use.As mentioned ealier, this book is worded in a way that would appeal to freshman or new GLBT studies students. It is important that people of all sexualities understand the struggles for LGBT rights and its continued relevance."},{"Title":"Reading Between the Numbers: Statistical Thinking in Everyday Life","review":"As a professional chemist, I do not look back on the statistics courses I took with particular fondness. While I didn't find them very difficult, neither did I feel that provided me with any deep insights. It was with this, lukewarm attitude that I first picked up Reading Between the Numbers. And then I noticed Chandler's quotation in one of its early chapters. Statistics and Chandler?! This must be interesting. I purchased the book and wasn't disappointed. I found the statistical concepts explained in a way that is both simple and insightful. And the book reminded me that I should have reviewed the topic, which is so important for my work, long ago. But I found the book unique in other ways as well. First, the book is relevant - there is not one concept in it that is not in some way connected to the real world. The author takes special care to show how and why statistics is important in both our professional and everyday lives. The concepts in Reading Between the Numbers are related to applications and vice versa, so that I can now see both sides in a new and more interesting light. Above all, I now feel that the ideas underlying statistics are more accessible to me than before. Second, as in many fields, the more advanced topics are based on earlier ones. And throughout, that author provides reminders of the basics so that I didn't find myself having to return to earlier chapters in order to understand later ones. It seems to me that author was simply sensitive to the needs of nonprofessional readers, which is a rarity in professional books. Finally, Reading Between the Numbers a joy to read. It is written as fiction rather than science and is often very funny. That the author has a rather quirky sense of humor is clear. That he has succeeded in combining it with statistics seems to me no small achievement."},{"Title":"Reading Between the Numbers: Statistical Thinking in Everyday Life","review":"One of the clearest explanations of basic statistics I have read. The author goes to great lengths to explain the issues pros and cons behind measures of central tendency and variation, in a way that is accessable to the layman. HE doesn't feel the need to fill each page with statistical Notation which is refreshing, and gives a lucid description of the difference between Parametric and non Parametric methods, the concept of which I think has escaped even the most seasoned statistics user. Goes all the way to Analaysis of Variance without hardly an equation. The style is more than a little quirky, (the Historical and literary preambles to some of the later chapters may frustrate some) but i'm OK with that. Good job Joseph"},{"Title":"Reading Between the Numbers: Statistical Thinking in Everyday Life","review":"I'm only 60 pages through it and have taken college level statistics courses but I'm still enjoying the book. Provides interesting and relevant beginning statistics examples."},{"Title":"Reading Between the Numbers: Statistical Thinking in Everyday Life","review":"I should firstly add that i've only read half the book but i am hoping that the trend of the book continues throughout and assume it to be just. I thought this book was a marvel at taking a topic normally not too interesting to people outside the field. The author managed to take this topic and make it interesting with his weaving of history, stories and explanation of why the formulas were created and used. A great into or refresher for people thinking about measuring data or using any form of statistics."},{"Title":"Reading Between the Numbers: Statistical Thinking in Everyday Life","review":"Best explanation of statastics basics I have come across. Gives anyone with basic math, and I do mean basic, a good understanding of statistics. How it can be appropriately used, what the basic concepts are and how to understand results you see from others. As well as how powerful a tool it can be in many areas of life if you only know the concepts.I think statistics on this level should be required education for anyone exiting high school. So many times stats are thrown about and without some knowledge you dont' know what makes sense and what doesn't. This book would give you that knowledge. And anyone without this level of knowledge in the modern world cannot really call themselves educated."},{"Title":"Charlie the Tramp","review":"Charlie The Tramp is a terrific story about a beaver (Charlie) who wants to pursue his boyhood dream of becoming a tramp. He says that tramps just tramp around all day, enjoy the good life, and sleep in fields with daisies (or in a barn if it rains). His parents are haltingly indulgent of his dream, while his grandfather harrumphs around with &quot;That's what it's like these days... little beavers want to be tramps...&quot; comments. He eventually &quot;comes of age&quot; one night as a trickling stream keeps him awake and he spends the night building a dam. The next day as his parents are looking for him they find the dam/pond. They wonder who built it and comment that it looks like the sort of pond that Charlie's father would make... only he is certain that he didn't make it. Charlie wakes up and says that he made it and is heartily congratulated for a fine job of building a dam. Even grandfather admits &quot;That's the way things are these days... more and more tramps become beavers.&quot; There is some gender stereotyping (mother races home to make flapjacks for all) but other than that, it is a quality children's book. There is a strong family message and asserts that children should be allowed to chase their dreams. For if they were given the proper guidance in their childhood, they will make good choices and do the proper thing. It was one of my favorites as a child and it is a shame that it is out of print."},{"Title":"Charlie the Tramp","review":"This is a very sweet book about a beaver family.

They are well written - because they are designed to be easy to read, and motivate your child to want to read more. I haven't used any other system - rather than read my children a lot of books - but this series will help your child want to read for themselves. I think that's why these books are so good - your children will start saying \\"Let me read to you,\\" instead of \\"Will you read me a story.\\" I think that's a terrific moment in any parents life - when you hear the words from your 2-4 year old saying, \\"Let me read to you.\\" I can't recommend these books, and this series highly enough."},{"Title":"Bob Books: For Beginning Readers, Set 1-12 Vol.","review":"These are the best books I have come across in teaching very early readers.

I thought the illustrations were a little bizarre, but the girls like them, and some of the stories are a little silly, which is fun. They also like the stickers - since both of them are reading through the series, they each pick out stickers to put on different parts of the book cover after they've read it.

The book works more as a quick reference, rather than other M1 books which may or may not have a lot of reading just to find parts differences. After getting this book I realized my Q.H.M.C. carbine had only a few original &quot;as manufactured&quot; parts on it and the rest of the gun was a mixmaster of assorted maker parts. With this book I have been able to quickly see what stampings are on a part I need, different variations and improvements within a certain part,and tips to tell the difference between authentic and repro parts. Drawings are included to aid in parts identification and I.D. different types (type I,II,III,IV, etc.)within a part. Other areas of the book touch on receiver differences and militaria accessories for the M1. If your not into the historical restoration and just want a &quot;shooter&quot;, then this book is not for you. My copy is well used and getting greasy, I will definitely get Riesch &amp; Poyer's reference book for the M-1 Garand."},{"Title":"US M1 Carbines: Wartime Production, 4th Editon","review":"The positive aspect of this text is that it lays out the data in a clear and concise tabular format. Thus, a collector can use the book to quickly and efficiently assess a rifle's theoretical originality prior or subsequent to purchase. \\"Parts Charts\\" for each carbine part, which contain the variety, manufacturer, and possible markings for said part, make this an even handier format than the other US references in the \\"For Collectors Only\\" series.The big problem with this book is that it advocates destroying/sterilizing the history of these carbines, which is exactly what the audience (collectors) should strive to avoid. Specifically, Riesch advocates using spare parts to \\"restore\\" a carbine to \\"factory issue\\" (p. 7). Later, under the heading \\"Collecting Imported M1 Carbines\\" (p. 113), Riesch states \\"Many collectors have, and are continuing, to purchase, these imported carbines with the intention of finding the correct parts needed to restore them to their original configuration. These can present a collector with a challenging, and rewarding endeavor, and will certainly increase the value of their carbine.\\" This is patently false!Firstly, by discarding parts from an otherwise as-imported or as-arsenal-refinished carbine, you are sterilizing it of its history. Second, when you arbitrarily replace parts in a military arm, you are *not* making it \\"factory original\\" or increasing its value, but rather bringing it even further from its martial provenance and configuration. Collectors desiring a factory original piece are paying for exactly that, not for a gun that some bubba tracked down spare parts for, and reassembled accordingly, so that it would *appear* factory original. Barring fraud or misrepresentation of the piece, an arsenal-refinished carbine is worth more than a hodgepodge of pieces some \\"collector\\" picked out at gun shows.Further, the parts that a Lend Lease country employed are part of that carbine's unique military history; it's difficult enough to discern a US small arm's history without new collectors being encouraged to sterilize away all signs of it. The advocacy of doing future generations of collectors such a vast disservice is significant enough to knock an otherwise four-star text down to two stars.Buy this book for its data, but not its advice to \\"collectors\\"."},{"Title":"US M1 Carbines: Wartime Production, 4th Editon","review":"There is no 1 book that covers everything to do with the M1 Carbine. This book clearly was not written for the purpose of covering the M1 carbine from A-Z. The focus of the author is on each individual part, the variations, and the markings the original manufacturer put on their parts at various points in time. This book is about documenting the parts of your M1 Carbine, knowing who made what, and which carbine it was likely on.For a buyer, it will tell you what you are looking at in the way of original parts. M1 carbine parts were shared amongst manufacturers, in an effort to get the rifles out to the troops. Typically they are a mixture of parts from several manufacturers. Without this book, you wouldn't be able to tell the difference.For people starting to get to really know the history of their M1 carbine, this is where you start, with this book. Then move on to intermediate and advanced.Collector's usually own more than a few books. Many of them have this one as a quick reference aid. No other puts it so clear, simple, and easy to find.If you are looking for a book for shooting the M1 carbine, try The M1 Carbine Owner's Guide by Ruth and Duff. If something breaks and you want to replace it with an authentic part, then look inside this book.I recommend it to everyone just starting to get to know their U.S. M1 carbine. Post WWII commercial variations are not included. Original WWII M1 carbines, their parts, and manufacturers, are detailed. It does a great job of it. Simple and to the point.As to the restoration issue, the first reviewer is absolutely correct when he says piece by piece rebuilding an M1 carbine destroys it's history and value. Those who seek to do so should do a fair amount of research first. The conclusion you come too will likely stop you from using this book for that purpose."},{"Title":"US M1 Carbines: Wartime Production, 4th Editon","review":"This book is great for those who want to learn how the M1 Carbine was created in mass numbers in such a short time or where the parts and accessories for an M1 Carbine came from. The author does try to \\"originate\\" a carbine by encouraging owners to pursue parts and accessories from a single manufacturer to get a \\"like WWII condition Carbine\\". Many enthusiasts would disagree and tell you to keep your rifle as is. The ones imported from other countries have just as much history in them than the ones in WWII, and in fact maybe more history. This is a great read for collectors and historians alike and a must own for any Carbine owner."},{"Title":"US M1 Carbines: Wartime Production, 4th Editon","review":"This is a very good book for beginning collectors of M1 Carbines.

Worth the price."},{"Title":"The Garden of Eating","review":"Although I had an already vast collection of Kosher cookbooks I was thrilled to add this one to my library. The Garden of Eating was obviously written as a fundraiser for Yeshiva Degel HaTorah in Monsey, but it far surpasses anything I've ever seen of that genre. In addition to all the traditional recipes one would expect to find (gefilte fish, kugels, soup, etc.) there are many new and innovative recipes that reflect today's newer eating styles. Many use whole grains, vegetarian ingredients (including Tofu!) and contain much less fat and sugars than the more staid versions of the same dishes. With the exception of the dessert section, all recipes have nutritional information as well. There are creative ideas for children's parties, Shaloch Manos (Purim Gift Baskets) and enertaining that I found both interesting and helpful. This book would make a welcome addition to any cook's book shelf, from the novice to the true balabuste (capable homemaker)."},{"Title":"The Oracle (Wizard War Chronicles IV)","review":"First of all, especially if you live in the USA, this book is MUCH better than it looks. I have seen a US edition which depicts the heroine as a youthful and voluptuous girl in what appears to be chain mail underwear. The edition I own simply has a snowy landscape on the cover, the only figures visible being clad appropriately for the weather.This book has LOTS in it. There is the clash and death of cultures (focused on more than the military aspect), lots of detail in the characters and societies, gritty and unheroic events and plot, and best of all, distinctly different and most unheroic (in the Hollywood or normal fantasy novel sense) characters.Yen Olass, the main female character, has had it tough. She most definately could not pass for the bikini babe on the US edition cover. She is stocky, middle aged, tough, and passes for a man for part of the novel.

He may be the only fantasy author who has confronted the probable 'reality' of a woman's life in the traditional fantasy environment and the result is a book which may be too drepessing for some readers. Despite this, it is a humourous and entertaining read which, although it lacks the polish and sheer inventiveness of the later books, well repays the effort of reading. In short, Hugh Cook has written better, but not many other authors have."},{"Title":"De Havilland Mosquito: An Illustrated History","review":"Excellent book for the Mossie fancier, even better for the scale modeller. Fantastic view of various stages of construction, great number of revealing photos, and beyond that a good read."},{"Title":"The ecclesiastical history of the English nation","review":"Bede (Latin Beda), also known as Saint Bede or, more commonly, the Venerable Bede (ca. 672 - May 27, 735), was a monk at the Northumbrian monastery of Saint Peter at Wearmouth (today part of Sunderland), and of its companion monastery, Saint Paul's, in modern Jarrow. He is well known as an author and scholar, whose best-known work, Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (The Ecclesiastical History of the English People) gained him the title \\"The father of English History\\". Bede wrote on many other topics, from music and metrics to Scripture commentaries.His works show that he had at his command all the learning of his time. It was thought that the library at Wearmouth-Jarrow was between 300-500 books, making it one of the largest in England. It is clear that Biscop made strenuous efforts to collect books on his extensive travels. Bede was proficient in patristic literature, and quotes Pliny the Younger, Virgil, Lucretius, Ovid, Horace, and other classical writers, but with some disapproval. He knew some Greek but no Hebrew. His Latin is generally clear and without affectation, and he was a skillful story-teller. However, his style can be considerably more obscure in his Biblical commentaries.Bede practiced the allegorical method of interpretation, and was by modern standards credulous concerning the miraculous; but in most things his good sense is conspicuous, and his kindly and broad sympathies, his love of truth and fairness, his unfeigned piety, and his devotion to the service of others combine to make him an exceedingly attractive characterBede's writings are classed as scientific, historical, and theological. The scientific include treatises on grammar (written for his pupils), a work on natural phenomena (De rerum natura), and two on chronology (De temporibus and De temporum ratione). Bede made a new calculation of the age of the earth and began the practice of dividing the Christian era into BC and AD. Interestingly, Bede wrote that the Earth was round \\"like a playground ball\\", contrasting that with being \\"round like a shield\\".This book is the most important and best known of his works and is also known by its Latin title as the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, giving in five books (about 400 pages) the history of England, ecclesiastical and political, from the time of Caesar to the date of its completion (731). The first twenty-one chapters, treating of the period before the mission of Augustine of Canterbury, are compiled from earlier writers such as Orosius, Gildas, Prosper of Aquitaine, the letters of Pope Gregory I, and others, with the insertion of legends and traditions.After 596, documentary sources, which Bede took pains to obtain, are used, as well as oral testimony, which he employed with critical consideration of its value. He cited his references and was very concerned about the sources of all his sources, which created an important historical chain. He is credited with inventing footnoting. (Due to his innovations like footnoting he was accused of heresy at the table of Bishop Wilfred, although the actual accusation was for miscalculating the age of the world, his chronology being contrary to the calculation of the time. The controversy is linked to footnoting because Bede cited another source in a note, rather than opining himself; others misunderstood the significance of citing another source).So brush up on your Old English and don't be deterred by some of the spotty pages - this is a very important work!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"At last! I have finished my journey with the Pequod! I actually enjoyed this book, whereas other people in my class did not or did not read at all. I liked this book!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is not an adventure story - it is an allegory of the human condition amidst the setting of the whaling profession. Mankind's varied quest for greed, lust, longing, vengeance and fulfillment. Moby Dick is all of these human yearnings and more in one book. If you want an adventure story there are other books out there that will quench your thirst, but if you approach Moby Dick the same as most unwilling High School students do. You won't even get a 100 pages into it and will become disillusioned and discouraged because it wasn't quite the adventure story you were hoping for and the end result, You Will Never Finish It! Leave your expectations behind. Moby Dick is great Literature! But it isn't the formulaic rhythm we find in today's bestsellers. In fact in 1851 it wasn't the normal piece of literature people EXPECTED it to be. Cast aside these expectations, and take your time. This will not be a quick read. If it takes you a couple of months or a year, stay with it. In fact read other books while reading Moby Dick. Like I mentioned before, it is not a quick read, it will be one you savor and slowly digest. Think of a glass of fine Cabernet. You sip that glass, you don't gulp it. Just keep reminding yourself when you come to certain parts of the book that doesn't seem to have anything to do with the overall narrative thread of the story that Moby Dick is an allegory of the human condition of greed, lust, longing and vengeance. This piece of literature is an overall experience that will linger with you for years to come - if you allow it to do so."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Perhaps the greatest story I have ever read. The characters come to life and seem to jump right off the page. A must read for anyone interested in classic literature."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"When Herman Melville first sat down to write Moby-Dick he had been scorned by many and praised by similar amounts for his outlandish texts Typee and Omoo. Both were decidedly anti-Christian and what seemed to be pro-cannibalism. A weaker mind, a lesser person, might have turned tail at such notions and collapsed into himself, but not Melville. Instead, he wrote a tour de force book that has become increasingly popular (unfortunately for Melville since this occurred after he left the physical world) as the years progressed. At first, the novel was hardly a hit, but after his death a revival took place that has continued up until the present day. This book, the Norton Critical Edition, is a perfect gem for those of us that wish to know more about Melville, his life, his past works, and the critical analysis of the text.Most already know the story of Captain Ahab and his obsession with revenge upon the White Whale, the infamous Moby-Dick, and how Ishmael, along with the rest of the crew, get snatched up into Ahab's whirlwind, monomaniac obsession with combating and destroying this one-of-a-kind beast. The story itself could be condensed down into a much smaller text, but Melville's own obsession with the giants of the deep along with his passion for sailing shines through in long winded chapters describing details that the common reader may not care to know. That being said, it is often a difficult read because of the way it is structured, along with the Shakespearean language and heavy handed motifs. However, the darkness, the depth, the absolute diabolical complexity of the story consumes the reader and draws them along just as inexhaustibly as the Pequod under Ahab's ruling thumb.The novel is an absolute gold mine for critical analysis. It can range from the forces of nature vs. mankind, the expansion of technology upon nature, the terrors of obsession, the heathenism of reality vs. that of cannibals, perhaps the conflict between rationality and obsession, Christianity and the Devil, etc. Well beyond his time, Melville provides the future world with an intellectual cacophony of thought not yet met in American literature during his time on earth. It could be argued that he put American literature on the map for the rest of the world (especially the British juggernauts) and defined the literature that would proceed in the following years once the world caught up to Melville's way of thinking and courageous action of putting it down in typeface."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Such a boring book. I learned things about whales that I didn't want to know. Finished it, and was glad that Moby Dick won!!!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I hadn't read Moby Dick since college, many years ago. Sitting on a plane in August, I glanced over at the book in my seat mate's hand. He also was reading Moby Dick! What are the chances of such a thing happening: two individuals, one in his twenties, one in her seventies, each reading for pleasure a book published long ago?Although there are long passages of the book with more detail than I perhaps wanted to plow through, the characters are marvelously drawn, the plot is famously wonderful, and there is even a good bit of humor. Moby Dick is still a great read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"What worthwhile thing can be said about Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\" that hasn't been said before? Some love every ounce and letter of the novel, down to the last tackle, harpoon, and halyard; others could do without the lengthy elaborations on whaling's intricacies contained within the intervening quarter of the book. Some may feel put off by Melville's literary mannerisms; others may consider him on par with the greatest literary minds of the English language, citing men such as Shakespeare as the only real comparison. Regardless of either of these opinions, one thing is certain to anyone who truly delves into the matter: taken by itself, Melville's \\"Moby-Dick\\" is without question the greatest American novel, and one of the greatest works of fiction ever penned. An ambitious claim for a book? Yes. An unmerited one with respect to \\"Moby-Dick\\"? No, and without a shadow of a doubt.To begin with, take the style of \\"Moby-Dick.\\" A prose so descriptive and bursting with meaning that, indeed, we have to look to the other masters of the English language to find comparison. Melville's ability to devote an entire chapter to explaining the symbolic meaning of the \\"whitish color\\" of a whale while managing to both pull it off beautifully and weave it seamlessly into the story is a meritorious achievement in and of itself. Indeed, those who talk of F. Scott Fitzgerald's color symbolism in \\"The Great Gatsby\\" as being without parallel should take a closer look at \\"Moby-Dick,\\" specifically observing what Melville does with the simple color white. Sure, it's \\"white,\\" a color which most people, if questioned, would arbitrarily assign the symbolism of \\"purity,\\" but when taken into the hands of Melville and woven into the tapestry of \\"Moby-Dick,\\" it becomes something altogether more mysterious, menacing, ancient, and spiritual. Melville's language gives the novel a grand stage, making the story (and I know thousands of others have said this before me) more than a simple fight between a man and nature; it is Melville's superlative language which gives his story many faces, making it broadly relevant. Indeed, it is this broad relevance which, among other things, gives the expertly written whaling-oriented \\"middle chapters\\" of the book their hidden meaning, and makes them necessary to understanding the rest of the novel. However, even without this extra aspect, the middle \\"whaling\\" chapters are so beautifully written that they are a treasure unto themselves.But there is so much more on so many more levels in this novel. Only in the setting of \\"Moby-Dick\\" can passages like Captain Ahab's perennial exhortation to \\"strike through the mask\\" in the great struggle of life reach their full realization and achievement. This is perhaps the greatest thing about this great novel; just when you believe you've found the hidden meaning, just when you think you have a particular passage sorted out, a new interpretation, a new facet of understanding, will occur to you, and force you to consider the novel under an entirely new light. This is the same reason why \\"Moby-Dick\\" both remains relevant and stays relevant; it is so multifaceted and so adaptable to the human condition that its near universal interest and usefulness are virtually endless; it can be applied to any subject and can be used to make any point. In effect, \\"Moby-Dick\\" itself is like a great ocean with an inscrutable whale swimming in it: its every aspect is filled to the brim with manifest meaning and important commentaries on life, which can be duly observed, noted, and utilized, but it will always carry an indecipherable air of mystery, transforming to deliver each of its messages with the same force, but also with the same strange combination of direct meaning and vagueness. It is such a great literary masterpiece, and such an important contribution to the Western canon that everyone should read it at least once. And, on top of all of that, it's an extremely engaging and dramatic adventure story. You will be guided through a literary journey of such brilliance, beauty, sublimity, and yes, action, that you will never look at life the same way again; you will not be disappointed by Melville's \\"Moby-Dick.\\" It is a work with a multifarious and profound meaning which also manages to be the all around perfect adventure story. Now that is the mark of a true and enduring classic.***I appreciate my Barnes & Noble Classics edition very much (although many feel the Norton Critical Edition to be the best; I can't opine on that, as I don't own it). The Barnes & Noble Edition is packed with interesting commentary, historical notes, a helpful dictionary of sea terms, the thoughts of contemporaries, and a great introduction, all of which helped me in my first reading of \\"Moby-Dick\\" and enhanced the novel's self evident beauty and importance.***"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It's great to have this classic in digital form.

It's no way to spark that love of reading in them, and it's a male-driven book, with rare mentions of women in 600 pages. I read this for my own good pleasure, on my own good time, and with that in mind . . . I loved \\"Moby Dick.\\" This was no torture, but a triumph!Based loosely on actual events from the early 1800s--the sinking of the Essex after being rammed by a whale, and the numerous whaling encounters with a monstrous whale nicknamed \\"Mocha Dick\\"--this classic novel is an epic tale of the sea, of the men who lived and died on ships, and of the leviathans that provided them sustenance and danger. Melville creates a cast of memorable characters, seen through the eyes of Ishmael. We meet a goodhearted cannibal named Queequeg, a driven and vengeful captain named Ahab, his shadow named Fedallah, and the voice of reason named Starbuck. These men and many others take sail on the Pequod, a sturdy whaleship, and roam from Nantucket across the world's vast oceans. The further they go, the more they realize they are at the whims of Captain Ahab, who wants not just any whale, but specifically Moby Dick, the huge white whale that cost him his leg in a previous misadventure.Melville does a great job of transporting us to the mid-1800s, into the lives of memorable and colorful men, and onto a ship with all its gory whaling work. His chapters on whales and the art of whaling are nearly encyclopedic, but if read leisurely, they can be very entertaining and educational. This world of whaling becomes fantastical, almost larger-than-life, and I was enthralled. Along the journey, the Pequod encounters other ships as well, and we feel that the noose is slowly tightening as the whalers hunt down their near-mythical prey. Yes, Ahab and his men go whale hunting in small boats quite a few times, giving some high-seas drama throughout, but it's the final confrontation with the great whale that provides the best suspense.This book is pretentious and overwrought at times, but it is filled with so much life, with bits of humor and comedic hyperbole, with amazing descriptions of the sea and sky, and with keen insights into human nature. As it spreads its sails in the gusting wind, it filled me with wonder and bracing sea-salt air. It wowed me with passages of allegorical depth. I savored it a long month, and when it was over, I felt gorged on one of the richest literary feasts I've ever experienced. This is truly an epic tale, and a great look back at some of our country's history."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Herman Melville dedicated \\"Moby Dick\\" his 1850 epic masterpiece to his good friend Nathaniel Hawthorne. Like that Salem sage, Sailor Melville was a man of dark brooding genius. Both of these men were opposed to the sanguine philsophy of transcendentalism whose chief exponents were Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. And as Joseph Conrad explored the dark side of the human heart in \\"The Heart of Darkness\\" so too does Melville takes us to the hell of a demented captain's monomaniacal pursuit of Moby Dick the great white whale.The long 600 page novel is narrated by Ishmael a sailor on the Pequodcaptained by Captain Ahab. As his biblical namesake was a wanderer in the wilderness being forsaken by his father Abraham so to does sailor Ishamael consider himself an orphan abandonded to the winds, storms and high seas of lonely life on a whaler. The Pequod whaling ship is named for a village of Pequod Indians who were massacred by white settlers. Thirty men are aboard the doomed vessel which is symbolic of the thirty states in antebellum America. The novel says Andrew Delbanco, in the introduction to the Penguin edition has many symbolic resonances with the then current political scene. A wigwam is built on deck symbolizing the corruption of Tammany Hall in New York politics. Pip the African-American cabin boy is used as a slave by Ahab reminding readers of the Compromise of 1850 which made the fugitive slave law a reality. Throughout the book we see Melville portraying how humankind wantonly kills animals, descretes nature and practices a survival of the fitness amorality.The Pequod is a microcosm of America and also the world. We see all types of humanity portrayed among its crew from the savage Queequeg to the humorous Stubbs and Flask to the rationalistic first mate Starbuck.Towering over the pages of this monumental work of genius is Captain Ahab. His leg was severed by Moby Dick and he may also be sexually impotent. He is driven to the killing of Moby Dick forsaking his young family and driving his crew in his relentless quest to wreak revenge on the great whale. Who is Ahab? Like the biblical king of that name he worships an idol which in his case is the dream of revenge against Moby Dick. Delblanco points out that he closely resembles Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina who was a staunch advocate of chattel slavery and an ardent opponent of Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. Ahab is a devlish fiend of a man whose quarter deck speech in which he enlists the crew to join him in hatred of Moby Dick reminds us of dictators skill at crowd manipulation and oratory from Hitler to Stalin to Saddam Hussein.Moby Dick has been interpreted in countless ways by literary critics. His whiteness may represent the nothingness of nature and the indifference to human suffering seen in a godless universe. Moby Dick stands for any idol we humans worship in our hearts and heads.The vision of life painted by Melville is harsh, bleak and pessimistic. Perhaps by clinging to the coffin of his Indian friend in the epilogue Ishmael is giving us some hope for resurrection. Pick your own interpretation.Moby Dick contains many chapters dealing with the life and anatomy of whales, life on a whaling boat, the tools used in the whaling industry and other materials which may bore the reader. I, however, found these chapters fascinating as Melville opens our eyes to this vanished way of life.It is hard to believe the book was published so long ago! In it you will find existentialistic despair, poetry, song, psychological plunging into the depths of the human soul as well as Melville's thoughts on various subjects and ways to view life.\\"Moby Dick\\" is a big shaggy dog novel which may well be the best novel ever written by an American. No one aspiring to be a literate reader should refrain from devoting the time and energy required to complete it. Herman Melville deserves our respect and appreciation for inviting us to voyage across the seas with him and mad Ahab!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This great American novel of the 19th Century, like some of the great novels of the 20th Century, is at times unreadable. Long riffs about whale biology and whale trivia made me put down this book when I tried to read it many years ago. I got through it this time, with the help of Frank Muller's classic reading on audiotape. Don't bother with anyone else's reading -- go to the library and check out Muller's version. He is one of the top readers and does justice to the poetry and great language of this novel.The book is not told in the way we would find conventional today -- a fast paced narration of the adventures of men at sea. Melville clearly wants to tell the tale in the epic style. He writes in very short chapters that resemble Biblical passages, both in the poetic use of language and in addressing the most elemental themes of good vs. evil, man vs. nature, and the human condition. In the end, even the whale trivia serves the epic purpose in driving home the extraordinary courage and heroism of these whalers.I don't buy the idea that Moby Dick, malevolent as he is, somehow represents evil. The sometimes destructive and overwhelming force of nature is more likely the right allegorical symbol. Evil for me is Ahab, given the truly heartless choices he makes in his obsession for the White Whale -- and given what happens to a man after 40 years at sea.The most attractive characters are Ishmael and Queequeg, Ishmael's cannibal friend. Each demonstrates the best quailities of human nature --companionship, courage, acceptance of their lot in life. Given the racial turmoil of the 1850s, Melville may have been making a political point by portraying the nobility of the dark-skinned. I don't buy the idea that the allegory was any more elaborate than that, though it's clear to me that the novel is a gold mine for all sorts of Ph.D. thesis topics.In the end, I do think that the great themes explored by Melville are more effectively explored less allegorically and more through character development and moral choices. For that reason, I'd say that Huckleberry Finn is the true Great American Novel of the 19th century and that the great Russian contemploraries of Melville wrote better books. But this certainly is a classic work worth the effort."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The strangeness is what makes Moby-Dick so exceptional and an indisputable classic. It was quite a difficult and long read, but upon completion, it was, without a doubt, completely and utterly worthwhile. The characters were some of the most unique in all of fiction and each of them is leaves their mark."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick, by Herman Melville, is a four star book.I gave Moby Dick a four star rating for its eciting and adventurous plot. Its a quest for revenge on the dreaded white whale, Moby Dick. The book gives details about what it is like on a whaling ship, like how they hose down the barrels of oil. The conditions and why certain things are done to keep the cargo safe are described perfectly. The way Herman describes how they hunt the whale down and how the whale is killed is grueling but true. When they make the oil come out of the whale's body is described some horrifying, disgusting way. With a few sudden twist in events, Moby Dick is a book anyone can read.Ishmael is a young school teacher who is seeking adventure out on the ocean. When he meets an cannibal indian at a local inn named Queequee, they become the best of friends. They now are going to sign up on a whaling ship in Nantucket called the Pequed, whose captain is the mysterious captain Ahab. Altough the crew knows many things about whaling, trouble still finds them. Through te sea they meet other ship who have fought the white whale. It all comes down to this, a duel between Ahab and Moby Dick. Who will win?

I would like to say, though, that we have lost something. To engage this book, you need to be able to still yourself, to get beyond this ever-growing need to be &quot;entertained&quot; constantly with immediate, easily consumable forms. Written in this day and age, I suspect Melville would be accused of gross self-indulgence at the expense of the reader; that is a sad commentary about what type of readers we have become.Melville writes a small chapter just on &quot;the whiteness of the whale,&quot; whereas even a string of adjectives in any modern literature is often seen as needless.But, the writing, in the end, is the opposite of self-indulgent. Melville gives, to anyone who can quiet themselves enough to recieve it, a huge gift. To be sure, the vision given is harrowing and dark, but for this reader at least, it also deepens the experience of life itself and what it means to be a self-conscious skin of bark floating on Being itself."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It took me a month to work my way through the Blackstone Audio Books unabridged version of Moby Dick, and I thoroughly enjoyed the voyage. The narrator did an outstanding job of using distinctive voices for a whole host of characters (though I did get confused between mates Stubb and Flask).The complaint most often lodged against &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is that the narrative wanders, with long digressions into philosophy, attempts to categorize whales, and the like. Here, the audio format shines--you can listen intently, or fall into a somewhat distracted brown study, much as Melville must have during his time on a whaler. When there is action, though, Melville is riveting enough to keep you listening, even with the week's groceries doing a meltdown in the back seat."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Well, it took me 3 tries and 32 years of livin' to finish off this Whale of a Tale (couldn't resist that)... really, if questions of Fate, God, Good &amp; Evil, etc. hold no interest for you, then you'd better be pretty darned interested in the 19th C. whaling trade. What's the hurry, put it aside, and try again in a decade or so, it'll be waiting.I read it on the subway! It's perfect for that, since the chapters are short, and the actual plot is thread-thin...As dense with stuff as the Bible, as filled with symbolism (which, if it doesn't clobber you over the head, then just keep goin', I probably missed half of it, and this sort of thing is purely subjective).Also may I suggest &quot;Narratives of the Wreck of the Whale-Ship Essex&quot;, where Melville copped the plot: nowhere near as profound, but a shocking collection of vintage memoirs of the ship that was actually &quot;Stove by a Whale&quot;, as they said in those days. Worth it for the last sentence alone, which is profound... (tease!), it enhanced my Moby experience considerably..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I would like to believe that Melville was years (maybe centuries) ahead of his time, but more than likely he was just plain nuts, apparently stalking Hawthorne and who knows what else. This shouldn't stop you from enjoying the fun though! In MD we basically have two ideas going on, with Ahab's whole monomaniac pursuit of the whale bookending hundreds of pages that essentially capture Ishmael's (sun)baked thoughts during his three years or so on board the Pequid. This middle section will either bore and repel the reader, or suck them in, resembling some post modern-ish films like Satyricon, or perhaps the writings of some lost beat author. This middle section is a detailed narrative of every thought that strikes Ishmael's mind as he is immersed in what must be a remarkably dull setting. So instead, his mind wanders, seeing analogies in every bit of rope and whale tissue to the relationship between man and God, man and nature, man in society, etc. The idea is so absurd and executed so bombastically that it works. Had the man he dedicated this book to (Nathaniel Hawthorne) wrote MD instead, it would have been awful, but Melville can write about Ahab's pipe with enthusiasm, and put that very same pipe into a mythic perspective! Of the outer story, what is there left to say? Only an American author could take the standard tragedy of man bested by the fates and turn it into man bested by the fates/decides to hunt down and kill God! An absolutely fantastic and unforgettable book, but I would have enjoyed more ramblings from Ishmael. I'm serious!!!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I think Amazon should require reviewers to give their age in the case of books like Moby Dick. Very few 16-year-olds forced to read this in high school English class are going to have good things to say about it. Why high-school English teachers persist in inflicting it on adolescents is a mystery. Moby Dick is a novel about the desperation and futility of the search for meaning in life (the whaling motif is secondary), which is not a theme that will ring true for readers who've barely begun their own such quests."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I won't try to repeat any of the millions of words that have been written about this book, but will restrict my short comment to an aspect of this novel that is not well-known: its relevance to the disease of depression.During my bout with severe clinical depression, I had occasion to read \\"Moby Dick\\" by Herman Melville. Because of my condition, while reading it I suddenly realized -- and I mean KNEW -- that Melville was afflicted with depression. I still remember the passage, Ahab, watching the sunset, thinking to himself:Chapter xxxvii - SUNSET (page 165) \\"Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne'er enjoy. Gifted with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise!\\"And that exactly described my condition. \\"Gifted with the high perception,\\" I perceived the total, utter pointlessness and meaninglessness of -- not only my life -- but of existence itself! And so I could no longer enjoy the things of the world that other, less \\"insightful\\" mortals could. I later researched the life of Herman Melville, and it turns out that he did indeed suffer from depression!I heartily recommend reading \\"Moby Dick.\\" And if you're \\"lucky\\" enough to read it while clinically depressed, you may find it has a lot to say to you that may prove valuable. And you'll learn things from it -- many things -- that someone who is not experiencing depression could not possibly understand."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The thing I always tell people about Moby Dick is that the beginning is lighthearted fun, the ending is amazing, and the middle is (to be blunt) quite dull. I think most people who make it to the end love the book, but getting there is a chore because Melville spends a great deal of time either talking about minutia of the whaling trade, or going off onto tangents almost in a stream of consciousness fashion that seem to have very little to do with the narrative (he devotes an entire chapter to telling why the color white is frightening, and another to listing characters from legend whom he identifies as whalers (Perseus I can see, but St. George?)). The language is gloriously poetic in places, but other times it rambles almost aimlessly and feels very convoluted and self-indulgent, even by 19th century standards. (Yes, I know these are qualities that the book's devotees hold dear, but they're also the reason that so many people never finish the thing. Might as well be honest about it.)At the end, it's extremely disturbing getting into Ahab's head and understanding what makes him tick-disturbing because it's present in all of us, an instrinsic part of the human condition: his rage at not being God. Ahab is pride incarnate, with all the hatred that comes with it. (The story of Jonah, sermonized in the beginning, is ultimately one of the need for humility before God, with the whale as God's agent. And it's important that Jonah's sin is not merely disobedience but a refusal to go on a mission of mercy.). I felt unsettled for a long time after I read this, because it demonstrates what a short jump it is between a classically Satanic villain (a being of total pride and hate waging an all-destructive and ultimately futile war on God, and luring all others to follow him to damnation) to the modern concept of the existentialist hero, fighting bravely against hopeless odds. Seen through his own eyes, Ahab is genuinely heroic--and then the reader has to step back and realize that on the contrary, hatred has all but consumed Ahab's soul, leaving the Rachel without help and leading his crew to death for his own pride's sake. If to understand is to approve, the reader who now understands Ahab is left asking, \\"Good God, what kind of person am I?\\" Today we tend to view pride as a virtue rather than a vice; what does that make any of us?Needless to say, there's a lot there. It wasn't until years after I'd read the book that I'd sorted it out enough in my mind to feel that I finally \\"got it,\\" and I'm still in the process of getting it. Everything in Moby Dick is a symbol, and I suppose that no two people completely agree on what the symbols represent (Melville surely wanted a degree of ambiguity, anyway). Here are my own opinions on what it all means: (spoiler warning)The whale represents God.The crew is mankind.Queequeg, Dagoo, and Tashtego are the pagan nations of the Earth, willing to literally worship Ahab.Starbuck is Christendom.Ishmael and the rest of the crew are godless men of no religion, whose anchorless wills are overwhelmed by Ahab's own.Elijah is a prophet.Ahab is the Antichrist.Fedallah is Satan, and his attendants are demons.Even though Queequeg is one of the pagans, it is through his seeming death and resurrection midway through the novel that Ishmael lives--because of the coffin. And Starbuck, innocent of any crime, goes down with the ship anyway (giving Ahab pause, just before his own death, to essentially stop and say in horror, \\"What have I done?\\")I'm not sure what Pip represents.If you're buying a paperback, I'd recommend the Tor edition, (ISBN 0812543076) just because I think it's got a very nice cover painting, something publishers often don't bother with when reprinting a \\"classic.\\""},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It is as if by mistake that I picked up this book. I thought it would be an adventure story, like The Count of Monte Cristo or something of its like. As my reading progressed, it became clear to me, however, that it was more of a philosophical rumination rather an ordinary suspense or thrill book. After I finished reading the book, I've had a feeling it was more than a masterpiece--Melville had just uttered my innermost feelings through a myth, with so much life, that I could never be able to.No, the book isn't a tragedy. In the surface, you may call it that way. But more than anything, it is a Triumph. It speaks of man's upholding of his dignity amid torture in the universe. Melville gave us, implanted in us, through the most poetical language, something that we can hold onto, something that will re-reveal to us, against Gods, that we are unconquerable."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Sitting in a small room overlooking Mount Graylock on his farm in Pittsfield, Mass, Herman Melville was a magician. There are no words to describe the ineffable, and Moby Dick is *the* novel for anyone who has ever been on a quest; anyone who has wanted to know something that loomed just out of sight.Sure, Ahab hunts the whale...but these chapters pale in comparison to Ishmael's own quest: knowing what the whale is. He is the greatest narrator in the history of fiction. The two chapters: \\"The Whiteness of the Whale\\" and \\"Moby-Dick\\" are matchless, as are \\"The Hynea\\" and the humorous \\"Bower in the Arsicades.\\" One can envision Ishmael covered in tatoos of the whale's dimensions.Is Moby-Dick tedious? Only if you're reading it as cetology. But as allegory, it is a tale of limitless drive--even self-consuming drives.Best book ever..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It must be admitted to, whether you enjoy his work or not, that Herman Melville is one of the most thorough writers in the English language. And it is this trait that we should be thankful for, especially as applied in Moby-Dick.A friend of mine, when asked if he read Moby-Dick, replied, &quot;I read about 2/3 of it.&quot; If you ask people the same question you will more than likely get the same response. The book is too thorough, too exact and too honest for readers who do not dedicate a significant part of their life to reading it.As for a review, I will not offer one, because of my deep appreciation for the novel (I do not want to bore you with my overused adjectives). I will, however, offer sound advice on how to enjoy the novel:1. Read the unabridged versionYou cannot remove one comma from the work as originally published without losing the beauty of the novel.2. Have a Bible handyPreferably a Bible with an index. There are many Biblical names and events mentioned, including Job, Elijah, Noah, the Great Flood and Rachel.3. Set aside plenty of timeThe novel took me over seven months to complete. Rarely was I able to read more than two pages in one sitting.

I feel for you, dear Ahab..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is one of the most elegantly written novels in American history. While it is the story of the Pequod's journey around the world in search of Moby Dick, it is also far more than that. The psychological studies of Captain Ahab and the other boatsmen that Melville has sent along on the voyage are captivating. At down times in the Pequod's search, Ishmael, the onboard narrator, gives many insights into the mind of the typical early nineteenth century whaler. He also gives brilliant, colorful analyses of whales and other marine wildlife encountered on their journey. Some of these chapters may seem tedious at first, but their fundamental nature in relation to the heart of the story and the motivation of its lively characters quickly becomes apparent. While this book might appear lengthy to the modern American reader, it is definitely worth the time spent in its consumption as it is one of the most beautiful of all American novels."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"We call classics those works of art which say something essential about the humankind and that also say different things to different people, no matter when or where they live. This book is one of those. It is a story of adventures in the sea; of the obsession of a man; of Fate and its inevitability; of the blind race that is life; of the undesirability of getting what we lust after. The plot is the simlpest, as it happens with many masterpieces: Ismael tells us the story of a mad captain whose only thought is to kill the whale who damaged him. The symbolism is not hard to find. What happens in between is great literature. Instead of writing a long and pretentious lecture, Melville decided to tell his message in a novel of adventures. We travel the world with Ahab, witnesses of his madness and his deep humanity (not understood as goodness, of course). In a sense, we all are Ahab: we lust for something we don't really know, and we spend our lives running after that undefinable object, until we die. Moby Dick has a quasi-biblical tone and ambience (and size), but every single page is worth the time."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I picked this up because it was Moby Dick and I wanted to read the book that so many of my friends and peers had so much scorn for (they said it was utterly boring).I began to read the book and was immediately captured by the grace of the relationship between Ishmael and Queequeg. Then, as the book became more cerebral and Melville went into his (extremely) detailed descriptions about every part of a whale and every type of whale, my interest began to wane. I kept pushing on, though, enduring for nothing more than the incredible passages that sprinkled this book. And then it hit me. This book hits a reader hard. For a few hundred pages, I was removed, looking at Ishmael and only mildly interested in the workings of the boat and the scrubbing of the deck.then it changedAfter a while, Melville's poetic prose drew me in and I was on the boat. I caught myself anticipating the arrival of whales and dreading Ahab's rise to the quarter deck. The book captures readers. Perseverance is rewarded, you will be missing out on so much if you put this book down.And this is just dealing with the story. Melville is undoubtedly one of the finest writers ever. He is so subtle; he challenges the readers to keep up with his elevated symbolism. There is so much meaning in each line of this book, it is impossible to realize it all. This book deals with so many things: the basic adventure story, God, nature, human ambition, etc.If you are unconvinced, pick up a copy and read the last page of &quot;The Whiteness of the Whale&quot; chapter. Good readers will be rewarded by this book. They will be given a literary opus for all people who enjoy books.

Like the ocean it contains a depth that would take a single person years, if not a lifetime, to fathom. But it's also a very intense experience to read this book from cover to cover. If it's a class assignment, it's bound to be torture. If you're reading it because you think it's important to read, you may have a bad experience. However, if you listen to Ishmael, listen to his fascination and catalog of the whale and the experience of whaling, you will have revealed to you a soaring treatise on existence on Earth as a human. God, death, transcendence, reek: it's all here: an amazing undertaking for Melville and for any reader. But prepare yourself with patience and awake attention before you undertake this rigorous journey."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I thought Moby Dick was a great novel, and I liked Herman Melville's style of writing. The overall plot is great. The book starts out with a very famous line,\\" Call me Ishmael\\" read by the main character of the book, Ishmael. He is the narrorator of the novel and I think he is a very interesting guy to read about. He is a sailor who has sailed a lot, but never on a whaling ship. Then he stays at a whaler's inn, and rooms with a harpooner from the south pacific named Queequeg. He was my favorite character in the book. He is covered in tattoos and has strange habits and rituals. When they first meet, Queequeg is very hostile, infact the first words he says to Ishmael are \\"Who-ee debil you?\\" \\"Speak-ee, or dam-me, I kill-ee!\\" when he doesn't know that Ishmael is sleeping in his hotel room. But through out the novel Ishmael gets to know him, and learns that Queequeg is a very nice guy and they become very close friends when they decide to look for work on the same whaling ship. There are many other character in the novel, especially when they go out to sea, on the Pequod ship. That is the whaling ship they join, led by captain Ahab. He is the ship captain; he lost his leg on his last journey to sea, in a situation with a sperm whale. His peg leg that he uses to stand on is made from the bone of a whales jaw. He explains with saying \\" Aye, it was that cursed White Whale who gave me this dead stump I stand on now. And I'll chase him round the Cape of Good Hope and round Cape Horn and round the flames of Hell before I give up. And this is what ye have shipped for, men, to chase that White Whale over all sides of the earth until he spouts black blood and rolls over! What say ye, men? Are ye brave enough to join hands in it now?\\" This speech gets everyone on the ship pumped up and ready to kill the whale. The rest of the book is great, they hunt the white whale with many turns and subplots. I enjoyed reading the book a lot and thought it was one of the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I thought that Moby Dick was an all around inspiring novel that everyone should read. All though I had to high of expectations for the book, which made me not enjoy it as well as I thought I would. All though the sensational job of Keir Dullen the narrorator made me feel that I was on the ship, and that I was actually along side Captain Ahabs hunting the white whale. Through out the whole book captain Ahab's and his crew is in search of Moby Dick the white whale. They travel half way around the ocean in search of him and hopefully can hunt and kill him. All though you don't actually read about Moby Dick being seen in the book till the end which emphasizes his presence a lot more and make's it more interesting to read, and also more exciting."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Aside from a lengthy digression on whale types, this is epic novel writing at its very best. The real theme here is that of obsession and how it can destroy people. The bitter Captain Ahab is a tragic Shakespearean character who instead of destroying the great whale, he self-destructs due to his blind obsessional pursuit. Despite being of prodigious length, the book is well-paced and moves along nicely except for the odd insertion mentioned above. More than 150 years since its first publication, this work is as alive and entertaining to readers now as it was then. Few works truly deserve the label 'classic', however this is one....Call me f____n' Ishmael!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Why review Moby Dick? Hasn't enough been said?If you've not read this novel yet, then obviously not. Don't miss it.The average reader today will be put off by what seems to be a laborious 19th Century style. Long words are assembled into long sentences, there's not always a lot of dialogue, and not a single glib pop culture reference. Surely a dated work.Here are a few secrets -- you won't find these heavily discussed -- to help you read this novel:1) It's the first modernist work. Yes, though it looks old-fashioned, \\"Moby Dick\\" is anything but. The whole novel is conscious of the fact that it's a novel -- Melville assembles bits of other works (real or imagined) and plays with form in a way we normally think of as the contribution of later writers.2) It's got rhythm. The book moves from action piece to digression back to action in a regular pattern. The tempo of the novel itself suggests the motion of a ship on the sea. So when you're reading one of the long digressive passages, remember that it's just there to rest you up.3) It's funny. Why doesn't anyone mention this? It's true the book concerns some serious themes -- it's not just a whaling novel -- but Melville has a sense of humor. The whole of the novel is over the top with solemnity and scholarliness. If you think he's entirely serious, you're being far too literal minded.So take your time, don't be put off. Melville has an odd style, but once you recognize that it's deliberate, you'll see he has a sense of playfulness. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"One thing that is rarely mentioned about this book is the capicity it has to make one laugh. The humor is just so profound, I think I must read it again to recapture an example. Also, some of the chapters are very short, and thus it makes excellent nightstand reading. It is the kind of book that will dominate one's thoughts during the moments of one's life that occur between the actions of the day.

This book is awesome, but I recomend that you get the abridged version if reading is just an extra end-of-the-day-right-before-I-pass-out-from-exhaustion activity. I gave it four stars because, while the style of the writing is unique and very interesting, and the storyline is the cooooolest, there were times when I felt my mind beginning to wander. There were a couple of times where I just had to put the book down and go do something else. I think it was because this book was written in the mid 1800s, and the way they spoke back then was just odd, with all the &quot;Ye land lubbers&quot; and &quot;Avast ye maties.&quot; If you despise the old English way of speaking that is used by the Nantucketers (there are thousands of them in this book, they're everywhere) then I suggest you read the Cliffs Notes and get the jist."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"When you read the book you'll find passages that are so perfectly written they easily rival shakespeare in their power. The book is like a poem in so many ways...it is very poetic...I did a critical review on Ahab, about what the main critics thought about him, and that gave me an even more greater respect for Melville. Ahab is an incrediable character---possibly the greatest and most complex in literature. He fights against fate and/or God.....he wants to assert himself--he wants to be in control...instead of being a thing or object, he wants to be in control...and so he trys to trump himself as a God....His fight to assert himself past his humanity--so he is more then just a man--is seen in everybody. He wishes he were something more then he is. But he keeps having to deal witht the fact that he is mortal...In the end, Ahab is seen really as a tragic hero...a good guy sorta...The reader starts to root for him. No movie can even come close to capturing the power of the book...it is too poetic and philosophical...Melville's ramblings in the middle of the book can seem tedious but add to the book greatly. They give the book so much depth in which to look at it...the world is seen as an ocean...on the ship are the earth's inhabitiants....they all try to figure out the purpose of existence, but with no shore (or landmarks) in sight, they all shoot from the hip, and each one's personnel view about life is as good as someone elses since there is no roadmap (very Hamlet like). Ahab's view of the whale as being the transcendese (sp--who cares) of evil is as good as Starbuck believing the whale is a dumb animal. The Doubloon in my eyes is one of the greatest chapters in the book....Side note: Melville himself said that he had written a &quot;wicked book&quot;---one that shows how life can be seen in so many different ways by different people and be correct, and Melville was a christian...hmmm...he also noted that the theme can be derived from the ship's cooks speech to the sharks.... In summery, one awesome book....SUPER deep and insightfull....reality is questioned thourougly...however, the book seems to indicate, if you stray to far from reality (whatever that is), then you'll fall of a crow's nest and die (you'll understand when you get to that chapter)....."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I despised this book from beginning to end, this is the most torture I have ever had, and I love to read!

The story is an exciting one, and the theme is complex. Symbolism abounds, which makes this an excellent book for anyone to study. However, my review does not end there.Had Moby Dick been just a story, I would have enjoyed it. It was not just a story. Instead, half of the book was devoted to educating the reader on whale anatomy and whaling. Frankly, I don't really need or want to know anything about either of these subjects. I could have gotten just as much out of the book if Melville would have briefly explained how the whalemen extracted the oil from the whale, instead of devoting entire chapters to discussing each part of the process.The last three chapters of the book were good, and scattered chapters in the middle were also good. Unfortunately, that is all I can say about what a &quot;great classic&quot; this is.

I'm on my fourth reading, but from my first I saw one thing: if you don't like the book page by page, you don't like the book. Reading it for the story is a doomed enterprise, even though the story is very good.The book is like a sermon, and there's a real live sermon in one of its earliest chapters. The preacher of that sermon has a style like Melville's, and his preaching shows the kind of thing Melville is trying to do.Melville's long descriptions of how, for example, a whale's body is beheaded while the whale hangs off the side of a whaling ship, are informative and make moral points all along the way. These may be, as many reviewers say, \\"the hardest parts to get through,\\" but every single page of them is funnier and deeper than any NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC article you ever saw. If you are reading these pages just to \\"get through,\\" you're missing how wonderful a stylist Melville is.Isaac Asimov wrote science-fact articles for twenty years before he turned back to science-fiction. Asimov fans like both his science-fact and his science-fiction books, because Asimov is always the same charming writer. It's the same with Melville. He writes whaling-fact and whaling-fiction, only he does both at the same time. His most factual chapters draw moral lessons, and when in one chapter the narrator and Queequeg assemble to work on the whale's body, that chapter is a story and a documentary all together.The book is about a voyage that is intended to take years, and does. Letters are delivered from one whaling ship to another so old and mildewy that it looks, says Melville, as if death itself had carried them. Is a book that makes a point like that supposed to be fast-moving?If you can't read good non-fiction, you can't read MOBY DICK. For that matter, if you can't read the Bible, which also has a lot of non-fiction in it (and some say equally out of date non-fiction) you can't read MOBY DICK.Take a deep breath. Slow down. Read a page at a time. When you're bored, quit and come back later. You probably know the story already anyway. Find out if you can get to know the book a page at a time."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"-- by that I mean, our 'book of books.' I first read this in college: assigned reading for a course. For once a chore turned into a joy from the first page to the last. I was already an avid reader of plays from Aeschylus to Pinter (and especially O'Neill), and I had read the four Thomas Wolfe novels in high school, so length was not an issue. But how strange and wonderful to plunge into a book that seemed to be novel, epic, tragic poem, divine comedy, and moral philosphy all in one.Melville was a century before his time. I am surprised that Hawthorne wasn't able to do more for him. I wonder if Linclon ever read it; I have not found any evidence that he had, since he was fond of quoting favorite passages of what he had read. I have read this great book three times over the past 40 years, and I still have and treasure the Modern Library Giant with the Grant Wood drawings that now seem so much a part of this greatest fishing story ever told.

It is more...To those who are willing to accept Melville's invitation into the world of Captain Ahab and the human struggle, the work operates as a masterpiece of masterpieces. Besides the story being a captivating tale of a madman and the now extinct world of whale hunting, the metaphors that lie deep beneath Melville's ocean and spout from the furious blowhole of Moby Dick himself are poetry to make all men weep and contemplate emotion and existence.

Captain Ahab is one of the most endearing of literary creations, the peg-legged skipper hell-bent on punishing the whale that cost him a limb.

This was the second most boring book I have ever read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"'Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harborless immensities.'Be warned land lubber! So too, shall you become lost when you make your first 'lowering' into Moby-Dick! Full of grandiose digressions and pages of speculation, finishing Moby-Dick can be like hunting down the White Whale itself! But take heart! Any attempt to penetrate the inscrutable imagination of Herman Melville and plunge into the pinnacle of nineteenth-century American Literature will be time well spent. Consider its American Renaissance context: written in the age of Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Poe, Moby-Dick has been read as Melville's critique of the Transcendentalist movement. In one fascinating passage, Ishmael describes the time spent by a 'young Platonist' whale-watching up in the mast-head: 'lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie... at last he loses his identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature... .' Sounds like Emerson's 'transparent eyeball.'All well and good, yet, as a harpooner notes, he hasn't raised [spotted] a single whale!Or consider the exquisite peculiarities of the Pequod and 'her' crew. There are no females on board. Are any feminine aspects then, more forcefully present for their absence? Yet, culturally, the ship contains a vast array of nationalities. Melville's own time spent on South sea islands surely plays into his inclusive view of foreign tribes. Ishmael and Queequeg's relationship demonstrates just such a view. Ishmael quips, 'I'd rather sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.' Later he states, 'to landsman in general, the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita, so that Colombus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial one.'Clearly, the cultural explorations allowed by this novel are vast.Lastly, consider that Moby-Dick is what many critics call an encyclopedic novel--meaning that it attempts, in its own obscure way, to contain everything, in some form or another, between its covers. Incredible ahead of its time, Moby-Dick points forward to behemoth works such as Ulysses and Gravity's Rainbow, to name only a couple. Of course, the encyclopedic novel, like Moby-Dick, is long and daunting. But do not depair! It takes many 'lowerings' to fully appreciate the brilliance of this novel. In the meantime, savor the Shakespearian prose as it drips off your tongue like honey! Revel in the breakneck speed of the final chase! See for yourself why it's so hard to believe that Moby-Dick is an almost forgotten text, rediscovered in the 1920's in an attic. Remember: 'in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety, and without imagination no man [or woman] can follow another into these halls.'"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I first read Moby Dick in high school.

The ship is commanded by Ahab who is determined to kill Moby Dick, the whale that took away one of his legs. This book picks up momentum as you getter farther into it, building up anticipation until it is almost too much to tolerate. This book is well written and is one that I would recommend."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Melville's sixth novel, \\"Moby-Dick\\" received mixed reviews when published in 1851 and was nearly forgotten after the author's death in 1891. In the early 1920's, the book was rediscovered and quickly achieved the stature of an American classic. The book is inexhaustible. I have recently returned to it. In his 2005 study, \\"Melville\\", Andrew Delbanco discusses some of the ways \\"Moby-Dick\\" has been read over the years. Delbanco writes:\\"Moby-Dick was not a book for a particular moment. It is a book for the ages. What gives it its psychological and moral power is that, freakish as he is, Ahab seems more part of us than apart from us. Like all great literary representations of evil, he is attractive as well as repulsive. And so Melville emerged in the twentieth century as the American Dostoevsky -- a writer who, with terrible clairvoyance, had been waiting for the world to catch up with him.\\"\\"Moby-Dick\\" is long, difficult, and digressive. It is not a straighforward narrative. Melville pauses many times for extended chapters to explore matters seemingly tangential to the intense story he has to tell. The book is written in a baroque, large, blustery and exhuberant prose that is worlds away from the tightness and concision favored by many 20th Century American writers. Melville also knows how to build tension. The work unfolds story and by indirection. A rather lengthy opening section of the book takes place on land in New York City, New Bedford, and Nantucket. Captain Ahab's monomaical character is revealed slowly through hints, offered by a shadowy character with the Biblical name of Elijah and by visions and foreshadowing. A sermon on the Book of Jonah by Father Mapple frames the book and it is quickly contrasted with Queequeg and his attitude towards his gods. When Ahab and many of the main characters appear, the book is already well underway.The book is narrated in the first person by Ishmael -- a Biblical outcast -- with his famous opening line, \\"Call me Ishmael\\". As the story proceeds, however, Melville seeminly disregards the limits of first-person narration as the story describes closely scenes and events well beyond Ishmael's ability to know.Ishmael denies that the story of Ahab and the great whale is an allegory, and his denial deserves to be thought about and taken seriously. Many readers have found meanings of all sorts in \\"Moby-Dick\\", ranging from the personal, through the religious, through the political. Melville was himself a seeker and largely an autodidact with the deepest doubts about religious faith combined with a need to believe. Understanding evil and suffering is at the heart of \\"Moby-Dick\\". Ahab fanatically and selfishly pursues the whale and destorys himself and his crew. Ishmael, in signing on to the Pequod and undertaking a voyage hazardous in the best of circumstances is also a seeker in the story. Through luck, prudence, and sense, Ishmael is a survivor.The story moves between Ahab's quest for the whale and a welter of factual material on the biology of whales, the history of whaling, the techniques of the whale fishery and immeasurably more. These long sections, which puzzle many readers, seem to me integral to the work. Mellville wants the reader to see the difference between a symbol and an icon, taken for good or ill, and the vast being of the natural world. Ahab expands the whale to something metaphysical in his ravings. Melville understands this, and he also understands that the whale is simply a magnificent animal. The various factual chapters move in different ways. Most of them develop a theme at some length before offering philosophical or spiritual questions about the matter under discussion. The broad themes of the book seldom are absent from view.During the course of the voyage, the Pequod encounters other whalers, some of which seek Ahab's help while others bring messages of the joys of life. Ahab dispenses with what are the overtures of common, shared life with his abrupt opening query to each of them: \\"Hast Seen the White Whale\\"? Readers can identify with Ahab to a greater or lesser degree as they try to understand the passions which tend to rule their own lives. There are many extraordinary scenes in this book, not the least of which is the climactic fight between Ahab and the whale at the end.Amazon's reader reviews allow for many different perspectives on Melville's book from readers with different degrees of familiarity with the text. \\"Moby-Dick\\" invites many different readings in searching for the sources of one's demons and for the common life. I have tried to offer some of my own reactions from my recent reading of \\"Moby-Dick.\\"Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I just finished reading this breathtaking masterpiece which somehow eluded me until now, though I think this is a book one enjoys more when you come to it with some life experience under your belt.I became fascinated with it while reading about Melville in Daniel Boorstins The Creators, and I have to say that I'm even more flabbergasted now that it was so lightly regarded when it came out and that Melville spent most of his life after writing it working as a clerk in NY city. But then, how often this is the fate of the great creative visionaries.It is truly a colossus that interweaves so many elements in a way that defies categorization. First off it's one of the greatest adventure stories and maybe the greatest sea adventure story ever written. There's great humor and parts where I laughed out loud (a rarity in itself) the philosophical elements are some of the best in literature and then of course there's the language. Beautiful prose that often rises to the level of poetry with so many fascinating allusions. Just an amazing creation that stands alone amongst the milestones of literature.And even though it is long and I found myself getting a tad impatient at times with the chapters describing whales and whaling, this is more the fault of the reader who's been a little too influenced by the age of instant gratification. As a matter of fact, some of the passages that I marked for their unsurpassed artistry and depth were in those very chapters.It seems our lives become more accelerated everyday, sadly it seems at the expense of our inner lives.And such a great reminder that one of the most moving and profound entertainment experiences one can have is also one of the most inexpensive and accesible to all. And such riches for the imagination and soul the literary masterpieces have to offer, and none more than this one."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Yes this is not for the faint of heart...tough sledding at times but the reward of allowing Melville's poetry to seep into your soul makes it well worth it. I read this in my 20's and didn't get it. Reading it again 20 years later I found the prose to be less dense and the story stands on it's own as one of the greatest. Forget the symbolism and enjoy the ride."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The Kindle edition linked to on this product page is not the Norton Critical Edition.All you get is a version with biographical information.This review is not about Moby Dick, just about the Kindle edition.Moby Dick rocks!

I started trying to read this edition, and by Chapter 20 I switched to the Oxford edition. I've found the best way to read the book is with a heavily annotated edition, because of the amounts of reference on the surface of and buried beneath the text. This Penguin edition is so lightly annotated that it's useless. If you are a casual reader, the notes won't begin to address all the questions you will have. If you are a more serious student of the work, the notes too lightly address things that any search of the Wiki can explain FAR better."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Like so many great works of art, Herman Melville's 1851 &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is a universe unto itself, the relentlessly rolling, salt-thrashed universe of the Pequod, a seabound whaler. I would advise any first-time reader of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; to give himself plenty of time to get through this book, cetology and all, say 4 to 6 weeks. It's also a good idea to have a passing knowledge of maritime terminology: to know the bow from the stern, what a bowsprit is, a capstan and a shroud. Because Melville was a sailor for so many years, he assumes his professional jargon will be understood. He was also a well-read man, and &quot;Moby Dick&quot; is filled with historical and mythological references. (Quick! Who was King Porus?) It's best to keep a one-volume encyclopedia handy. The story itself is populated with mysterious characters: Ishmael is the narrator who never fully reveals himself -- and who recounts scenes he couldn't very likely have seen. Then there's Bulkington, the mariner who is only seen from a distance, but who receives his own special apotheosis,then disappears. Captain Ahab's wife is described as &quot;a sweet, resigned girl&quot;, but the Biblical Ahab's wife Jezebel was a scheming pagan. Does Ahab have a dark family secret? The first time Ahab himself is mentioned, the Pequod's owner calls him &quot;a grand, ungodly, god-like man&quot;, and his long-awaited first appearance has all the drama of a Shakespearean entrance. (He's been compared to Lear and Prospero, not to mention Marlowe's Doctor Faustus.) And when the title creature appears, he's more than a whale, he's a world. Ahab against the world -- it's a theme that inspires one dazzling chapter after another: Chapter LXX, Ahab's Aristotelian contemplation of a severed whale's head. Chapter LXIV, the cook's strange sermon to voracious sharks. Chapter XCIV, with its mind-boggling homoeroticism. Chapter CXXXII, with its beautiful comparison of sky and sea. The language becomes quite rich. Here's Ahab at the height of his obsession: &quot; ... supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure.&quot; Readers have called &quot;Moby Dick&quot; difficult, bizarre, and boring. Is it difficult? Yes. Is it bizarre? Actually, it's probably one of the most bizarre books ever written. Is it boring? Only if you're not willing to accept the literary conventions of a hundred and fifty years ago, before there were telephones, radio, movies and television. The long descriptions and digressions are a part of the universe Melville created in &quot;Moby Dick&quot;. If you're bored with slasher thrillers and political potboilers, you'll be fascinated by this masterpiece of American fiction."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Melville's book is astounding, to be sure, but this version begins with the first chapter, not with the extensive front material that Melville included. In other words, it is NOT a complete text."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I give credit where it is due... Melville knew his subject. All of that knowledge, however, weighs down the story. There were times when I drifted away, forgetting about Captain Ahab and his fervor to find and kill the white whale and thought I was listening to a manual on how to be a whaler. I feel now I am trained well enough to go on such an expedition, that is what I carry away from the story. Which is sad, for this voyage that Ishmael has taken on by chance, his friend Queequeg and above all the maniacal bent of Ahab upon the Pequod seeking revenge is so diluted that much of its impact is lessened.No doubt, this book is a classic full of thought provoking themes. At times it's enjoyable. But the intent on reading it is not to become a whaler. Remove that third from the book and the ill-fated seafarers' voyage resonates as a deeply emotional metaphor.Volume and rate were good, reader was engaging."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"On the heels of thoroughly enjoying Nathaniel Philbrick's IN THE HEART OF THE SEA, there was little choice as to what next to read. Studying Philbrick's subject, one can only marvel: how inconceivable that in the early nineteenth century men from a tiny island off the coast of Massachusetts could build sturdy boats, sail them half-way around the planet on voyages lasting years, and harvest oil from the heads of the most terrifying creatures to inhabit our world. Fighting colossal leviathans with wooden sticks called harpoons that men would hurl from wave-tossed dinghies, thousands of miles from land. All to bring home the finest oil attainable for machinery and illumination. (Melville: \\"Sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils.\\") Improbable expeditions, almost unimaginable, but true. Man versus Sperm Whale.The 1820 voyage of the whaleship Essex, ended by a single ferocious and attacking sperm whale, provided an amazing real-life saga of adventure and ghoulish survival, brilliantly recounted by the contemporary historian, Philbrick in the year 2000. But back in 1851, a writer who himself had spent time in the whalegrounds of the South Pacific, Herman Melville, parlayed this very tale as he heard it from survivors and Nantucket relatives into an epic story. The Essex becomes Melville's whaleship Pequod. And it is this ship's executive, Captain Ahab, who through his obsessive and relentless pursuit of his finned nemesis, Moby Dick, becomes an American literary icon. In Melville, the tale becomes, Man versus Himself.MOBY DICK is rich with heavy themes, heavy writing and much metaphor. The 821 page novel famously begins with an introduction from everyman narrator: \\"Call me Ishmael.\\" Ishmael introduces us quickly to the upcoming journey, to life in the whaling port, as well as race relations and class politics of the time. All English majors know the book bogs down in the middle with painstaking descriptions of this fantastic industry. Melville belabors analysis of the hunters, their equipment, and their prey. Readers learn about tying knots, and boiling blubber and the precise dimensions of a full-grown sperm whale. Thankfully, Melville breaks up the reading into digestible chapters, and topical lessons. It's as if he brings us along on a lengthy time consuming day-by-day voyage, and we learn in painstaking detail everything about this peculiar industry. We become intimate insiders. We get inside the heads of the whalemen. We get an up close look at their possessed Captain Ahab. And we begin to sympathize, we begin to learn what drives Ahab.The language is archaic and a struggle at times, (we don't hear \\"There she blows!\\" until page 781,) but highly rewarding. More than once, I turned down corners of entertaining pages. We Americans can thoroughly enjoy Ahab's cheeky thoughts on monarchy: \\"Certain I am, however, that a king's head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here....\\"We enjoy the second mate Stubb's exhortations to row: \\"Why don't you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so, then:- softly, softly! That's it- that's it! long and strong. Give way there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can't ye? pull, won't ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don't ye pull?- pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!\\" He makes a first rate coxswain.And Ahab's remorseful line, surely echoed a quarter century later by William Ernest Henley, (who like the whaling captain had lost a leg,) in his famous poem INVICTUS: \\"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!\\"Melville hoped this book would be his masterpiece, but it was not recognized as such during his lifetime. Not until after the first World War, and oil found under the earth began the mothballing of the whale industry, did academics recognize the grand, arching narrative. But Melville was confident in his ambitions. Ishmael remarks as much: \\"Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.\\"[Final note: I highly recommend purchase of this version of the novel which is chock-a-block full of fantastic pen-and-ink line drawings by noted American artist Rockwell Kent. Kent's illustrations, completed in 1930, help pull readers through tedious portions of Melville's text with their sharp lines, ominous tones and dramatic composition. How appropriate - Kent spent much time aboard sailing vessels in arctic waters and saw the same whale pods as did Melville.]"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Writing Quality: 8/10.Melville is a great wordsmith, there is no doubt about that. And if I was a little bit more versed in the development of literary language, I might come to the opinion that Melville is better than an 8, perhaps even a 9 or a 10. But my taste has been shaped, for better or worse, by more recent syntax and articulation. I can see wonderful phrases frequently as I flip through the novel now, but by scoring Melville a little lower, it allows me to put Cormac McCarthy, who fits my syntactical taste a bit better, a little higher.Depth of Concept: 10/10.Holy Cow. Really, I should score this an 11. Anything you've ever thought about life, it's in this novel. Any interpretation you've ever had about good or evil, about power, about struggle, about beauty, about transcendence, it's in here. And whatever you think about those things, the opposite view is equally present. Maybe Ahab is a hero, an allegory for Christ. Maybe he is a villain, an allegory for Satan. The brilliance of this novel is that everything is possible, with enough material on hand for you to come up with almost any theory and follow it to some sort of conclusion from the beginning through to the end of the novel. But that's not because it's mushy or unfocused; it's because it's expansive, and nuanced, and impossible to pin down perfectly, just like life itself. Since I first read this novel for an English class, I can't say if all of my reactions would be the same if I had picked it up on my own. But with a competent instructor as a guide, reading this novel was like discovering God and then second-guessing myself. If you can't tell, I'm really into this novel, and it (along with Cormac McCarthy's The Road as a masterful piece that in some ways is on the opposite side of the spectrum) is probably my benchmark for what makes a truly incredible work of art.Rounded Characters: 10/10.For the same reasons that I describe above, the \\"roundness\\" of the characters in this novel is unsurpassed by any other novelized characters that I am aware of. You might roll your eyes at someone who says they learn something new every time they read a novel -- I usually take such statements a little skeptically myself. But if there's one novel to use that expression for, it's Moby Dick. Every character has about a thousand ways he interacts with the story, in ways both unexpected and profound. Anyone who reads Moby Dick as merely a revenge tale, or sees Ahab as merely a crazy man bent on revenge, hasn't had the courage to do more than wade on the shore of the ocean that is Moby Dick. As a starting question, you might ask yourself, is the novel Ahab's story or Ishmael's? Which you choose will determine a lot about the way you see the characters, and it might be a fun exercise to try switching one for the other.Well-Developed World: 10/10.The world of Moby Dick is the Universe, as far and as big as you can imagine it, and then a little beyond that. Clearly, I have a problem with hyperbole when it comes to this novel. But it won't take long into reading Moby Dick to get a sense of its encyclopedic nature; if there's a book to read about both the trivial details of whaling and the psychological inclinations of a whaler, this fulfills both to the maximum.Page Turner: 7/10.Moby Dick is daunting, there's no doubt about that. Even reading just a few pages can feel like a mental workout. But while some people may not connect with the material, I never found it \\"boring.\\" In fact, I found Moby Dick more readable than a variety of other novels I'm reviewing, including Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norell and Robert Jordan's The Eye of the World. It's certainly not fast-paced, but each of its many chapters is a jewel, and it feels satisfying to bite off each one of them and digest.Kept Me Thinking: 10/10.See above.__________________________________________________Overall Recommendation: 10/10.Moby Dick is the bomb. I'm sure there are those who don't care for it, and I hope they'll comment and explain why. If I had tried to read it outside of an English class, I sometimes wonder if I'd have gotten through it; it just has so many ideas. And if you're only reading it for the plot, you'll be frustrated, since the plot is only a place for the bigger ideas to stand and dance about, and generally taunt linear narratives. But if you want to have anything to say about American literature, even if you don't like this book, you've got to read it.See my profile web site for an expanded review."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I have read so many, many books, articles and reviews try to boil Moby-Dick down to the purest most refined elements. But, like Russian television and Nietzschean abysses, when you deconstruct Moby-Dick, Moby-Dick deconstructs you. Ultimately, every reviewer finds, somewhere in this oceanic work, their own gods and demons. This particular read I blogged more fully at my blog.Boil, boil, trouble and toil. Tell me of ships, whales and oil. Melville's words are a mashup of all that comes before. There is Shakespeare. There are sailor's ditties. There is Biblical poetry. There are songs from the kids in the street. There are myths. There are encyclopedia entries. It is a hip-hop book wrought of minnesang and hula and kathakali, ending in a glorious danse macabre. Most of all, there is humor, there is seriousness, and there is drama. Come, more wine! There is a roaring furnace before us and we've tales to tell!Melville does not so much challenge the novel's form as disregard it, crafting a tale that makes sense to him, pulling together his whaling canon from all the literary and philosophical flotsam gathered in a life of global wandering. He sprinkles acts of a drama among tableaus and stories and treatises, he throws in footnotes, he steps out of the book and comments upon it, and steps back in and takes on a new voice. Throughout, ever writerly, the story plods on, in those wonderful words and phrases and rhythms, slowly building, building, building into a drama like no other (however much it borrows from others - is this the fish that sank a thousand ships!). There is a typhonic crescendo at the end, and then the music tails off.Since this review must ultimately devolve into a deconstruction of myself reading, since the book is beyond knowing, I might as well tell of this particular reading of Moby-Dick, which has been quite different from prior readings. In this reading, I see a book of uncommon dramatic energy and careful construction that seems to pull all the diverse threads of our deepest myths and creation tales together, building out of them a misty, mystifying fabric, diaphanous as Cleo's gown, a sort of alternative mythology for a world in which science and technology are emerging and removing us more and more from nature itself, and putting us more in opposition to it. He offers us this mythology because he knows that this new, scientific world, this world of observations and answers, will ultimately provide no more answers than the ridiculously pious (piously ridiculous?) world that came before.But, whatever my reading, you must tell me yours, for the book lends itself to many."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I somehow managed to get through seven years of English higher education without once picking this book up. I wasn't deliberately avoiding it either, it just never came up. (Of course, I do have a bit of a prejudice against American literature, so that might have been part of the reason.) In any case, I'm kind of glad, because it allowed me to discover this book on my own.My first impression of this book was that, to my immense surprise, the first chapter is very funny. I admit, it's not clutching-my-chest, oh-God-I-can't-breathe funny. It's definitely not the moronic Family Guy/Will Farrell style of funny so many people are enamored of these days. But there is a powerful wry wit in Ishmael's voice, and although it's not the main focus of the book, it never entirely disappears.Before you start to doubt my honesty (or sanity) I will confirm most of the dreadful things you have heard about this book. There are entire chapters devoted to obscure aspects of nineteenth century whaling. Depending on your frame of mind, these can be mildly interesting or crushingly dull and obstructing the main story. The narrator occasionally wanders off on some theological/philosophical ramble which, again, can sometimes grow annoying.Despite all of this, I deem this book eminently worth reading. Yes, it is probably the definitive novel of man vs. nature; and yes, it shows the defiance and resilience of the American spirit; and yes, it's a powerful picture of the venomous strength of hubris. But frankly, forget all that, what captured my attention, and what I hope will interest you, is the characters.Melville births an amazing variety of characters in this novel, each of whom lives, breathes and struts across the stage of these pages. Stubb, the second mate, drolly jokes even while shouting orders to a boat crew chasing and stabbing a beast two hundred times their size. Fedallah, the Indian harpooneer of the captain's, gives grimly encouraging prophecies, something like the witches of Macbeth.Even the minor characters gleam with life: the ship's cook scolding the sharks shredding the whale chained to the boat, the carpenter complaining as the peg he crafted for Ahab snaps, the ship-keeper Pip, whose sanity snaps when he's left alone adrift for hours in the endless sea.And of course there's Ahab himself, maniacally pursuing this one creature literally around the entire globe in vengeance for the injuries done him. He is both grand, and, at heart, utterly mad. He shows the best of human resilience and industry and the worst of human hatred and obsession. He hides away in his cabin for much of the story, but when he is present, he utterly dominates the story through sheer force of personality.If you were forced to read this for class, I hope that did not ruin the book for you. If you haven't read it yet, go pick it up now. Yes, there are parts which are plodding drudgery, but the rest of the book more than redeems them.Go whale hunting today."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book has the momentum of a cracking whip. The struckture, almost post-modern in its rambling complexity, moves almost sideways as it speeds up and in the last twenty-five pages suddenly snaps in a bonanza of rich, delicious action.Nay-Sayers seem not to appreciate the substance all the slow, informative chapters give to the final actions of Ahab and his crew. I personally love this book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"hard book but all the more rewarding. the narration in itself is part of the melvilles point. moby dick reads as a organized history and methodology of the whaling industry and is often times drawn out and dull. but this narrations illustrates the point of mans obsession of understanding the universe. ishmael is by no means a definite resource on whaling as is shown by his constant interjections of myth and exaggeration. ishmaels narrations goes on to illustrate man's nature to intertwine emotion with reality, thus proving the futility of understanding the world.the obsessive pursuit of something larger than what men can understand in their finite knowledge is accumulated as the arrogance of ahab. ahab shows us that we are emotional beings who cast aside all rationality for ones personal gratification. it is an allegory of mans futile pursuit of understanding and commanding the world, ultimately, ahab shows us that man cannot escape his arrogance/ignorance.Moby-Dick or, The Whale (Penguin Classics)"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Simply put, this is a must read. Herman Melville's _Moby Dick_ received largely unfavorable reviews at the time of publication, and it never brought Melville literary acclaim during his lifetime. It was not until critics rediscovered the novel in the 1920s that it began to be viewed as a masterpiece and the apotheosis of the Great American Novel.My own reception of the book, back in my high school days, paralleled its treatment by the literary establishment. While I enjoyed portions of the text, I could not really get into it and actually ended up abandoning the story a few chapters shy of its conclusion. When I later picked it up again, though--out of curiosity rather than necessity--I was hooked. Whether my own maturity or the motive behind reading it were more influential I cannot say, but I suspect that many who find this novel difficult at first will eventually find it a rewarding and noteworthy read.New readers face three key challenges with this text: fears about its length and complexity, discomfort with Melville's loquacious writing style, and confusion over the juxtaposition of plot, factual discourse, and philosophical musings. These are easily overcome if one reads at a comfortable pace and allows oneself to become acquainted with Melville's language, which is at times reminiscent of the learned style employed by authors like Edgar Allen Poe. A wonderful way to understand the nuances of the text and truly \\"get into\\" the novel is to listen to the audiobook version, narrated masterfully by Frank Muller.Reserve this book for a time when you can read it without pressure and expectations. Allow yourself to become immersed in Ishmael's world. Re-read passages that confuse you, and don't be afraid to skip ponderous chapters like \\"Cetology\\" if they will prevent you from completing the novel. Whatever you do, though, be sure this is one story you allow yourself to complete -- you will be rewarded as you do so."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A magnificent book. It's about so much more than just a whale and a captain. It's an encyclopedia of whaling.

I've never seen so many semicolons."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Many of us have studied this book as a supplementary read. The book had been somewhat an adventure but also a serious learning at times. However, what is so good about learning Supplementary reading is using the Language as a tool of thought, the usage of grammar skills and answering tactics.Moby Dick has been one of the great novels in Literature. The story of the hunt for Moby Dick, a fierce white whale supposedly known to sailors. Captain Ahab, the captain of the whaling ship Pequod who lost a leg in an earlier battle with Moby Dick, and is determined to catch the whale. Born of 1st August, 1819,Herman Melville is the author of this brilliant novel that describes the dangerous and often violent life on a whaling ship and contains information the the whaling industry and nature of whales. Moby Dick is a deeply symbolic story. However, often ignored or misunderstood by critics and readers but later on, this American Author was finally recognized as a genius and his reputation spread throughout the world. Many of Herman Melville's works are literary creations of a high order - blending fact, fiction, adventure and subtle symbolism. Melville's wealth of personal experience in far away places was remarkable even in the footloose and exploring world of the 1800s. He brought vivid imagination, philosophy and American English touch.Pip the Sailor had ever been my fav and so, when it comes to seas and ships or the like - ever it's adventure and no wonder, Moby Dick is a good read.- ilaxi patelJaws (Widescreen Anniversary Collector's Edition)(A fav pick)"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Just a brief comment - Melville's book was based at least in part on an actual event. The incident occurred off the coast of South America in the South Atlantic. A sperm whale attacked a whaling ship out of New England and sunk it. The actual story was far more horrible than Melville's tale as cannibalism occurred among the survivors of the wreck."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is tough novel: big, confusing, it leaves you wanting to re-read it.If you wanted to know the difference in structure (as opposed to scale) between a short story and a novel, Moby-Dick (or, The Whale) is probably the as good an exemplar one would find of the novel form. Where a short story focuses on a single event, action, or mood, a novel tends to take the air a bit more -- perambulate, follow its own muse, wander. And wander Moby Dick does. It goes and goes and goes. Melville wrote that he had written a wicked novel. I wonder if that is perceptible to a 21st century sensibility. Melville knows that he's depicting characters who have abandoned critical parts of their pasts, their society, and their souls, parts that many of us today no longer recognize, let alone miss. He strolls through various modernisms: pantheism, Kantianism, indifferentism, relativism, pessimism, Romanticism. Ahab -- what to make of him: sacrilegious, demonic, monomaniac, striving. A shadow of Christian belief, of Calvinism, no longer sufficiently vital to bring salvation, but more than adequate to reinforce notions of depravity and condemnation, hangs over the novel.On a lighter note, Moby-Dick will give you a new appreciation for Star Trek. The episodic nature of the novel makes possible a bunch of self-contained mini-plots, each of which could be spun into its own little story. There's the encounter with a ship that has been taken over by a charismatic preacher and his converted followers. There's a ship in search of an abandoned crew, and one that is filled with bon vivants, appropriately named \\"The Bachelor.\\"There's undoubtedly a lot more than I can write about in a tiny review like this.

It was a cheap publisher's sell-off so I thought i'd give it a try, it being a classic and all...It's not easy. It changes pace and you have to be prepared to change the attitude with which you're reading it as you go. Some of it is adventure, some descriptive and some informative. It has many vignettes of the day-to-day whaling life. Interleaved through it is Ahab's single minded purpose of revenge, and the way it destroys his humanity, but makes him an icon to his crew, if not to his more rational and educated officers.It is so many things. A study of dictatorship. A study of the nobility of humanity educated and 'civilised' or not. A discussion of men supporting each other in a world where there's no other support to be had.And Melville did one more thing. He can lay claim to the best opening line of all time!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The writers of Maxwell Smart once had a gag saying that \\"nobody gets through War and Peace\\". The same may be said about Moby Dick.While I cannot recall an American novel that has been more influence on so many writers (even Star Trek II and Star Trek VIII, were loosly based on Moby Dick), and while I agree Melville is a wonderful writer rich with ideas and expression, there is also truth to be said that many of the peoples complaints about the book are justified.Melville smothers the reader with endless symbolism , Biblical references, commentary about life, and endless exposition, to the point where the basic story itself gets completely lost. This is a bit disheartening because Melville is an excellent writer who does make it look easy to do (it's not, trust me on this).The story itself is quite basic. Ismael, the wandering seaman who is the story teller, and not much else, is set to become a whaleman. He has the mind of a scholar, so if you were being logical about this, you would find it quite amusing that the character itself is not the head of a university!We witness him eating, sleeping and having running commentary on everything from man itself, to an almost endless lecture on whaling and whales. Don't look for plot or dramatic tension at this point. There is none.Thirty four chapters or so later, the story shifts to Captain Ahab, and Ismael becomes more of a columnist rather than a character at this point. This is of course the famous part of the book. Be warned! The real story of the destruction of the ship via the White Whale named Moby Dick, occurs in the last half of the book starting on chapter 120 or so. You heard me. The last half of the book. No I am not making this up!The reason why it takes so long, is that Melville still isn't done pontificating on the issues and ideas that are important to him. It's not that this material is bad, it isn't. Melville, is without question a talented writer, and this book is quite remarkable, but the pace and story arc are grueling in their length, and todays reader may be screaming at the pace of the novel. There were times I wondered why after the first twenty four chapters, the most engaging theme was the eating of soup. On top of that lots of the dialog is King James style which can be a bit hard to read through.Perhaps it is us with our impatience and demand for quick rewards that forever ruins a great book by Melville. Please understand thought that despite my complaints, it is a great read ,but I grew up on things like plot and chacter and conflict so without that, I have to fight to maintain interest.However, unlike Melville I will not take One hundred and thirty three chapters to ponder the signifigance of that idea nor will I wonder endlessly on the thoughts of the mind so carelessly, so tediously, that I shall again loose its purity of thought like man itself who has drifted endlessly in search of that greater meaning of ones life only to find the taste of brime to fill his soul.

Based on what I have read, except for Billy Bud, I cannot and do not consider Melville an author of classic literature. Granted, Typee and Omoo were apparantly at the time condisered travelogs. I hope so because there really isn't much story in either of them. 98% of what Melville writes in any of these stories is purely descriptive, describing how natives lived, what an island looked like, what parts of a ship are for, on and on and on. For example, if there is a legitimate need to mention a particular type of sail or mast on a ship, he will then take the next 10 pages describing what all the other sails and masts on the ship are for, even if they have nothing to do with the story. Boring, boring, boring!!! If Moby Dick had been written as a short story, as was Billy Budd, it could have been a masterpiece. As a novel, however, I was so irritated with all of the unnecessary, page-filling blabber that I considered it a total failure. In fact, I was so disgusted and wanted to be done with it that I almost missed the most important part, the climactic scene with the whale. I know that Melville has written many truly short stories and, in the interest of fairness, I will probalby some day give them a read. I can only hope that his true talents lie in writing short stories because, as a novelist, I cannot recommend him and do not consider Moby Dick or any of his novels mentioned above classic literature."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"If ever a book was made for skimming - or for Classics Illustrated, for that matter - Moby Dick is it. I had the misfortune of listening to it as a book on tape, and let me tell you, of the 27 hours of narration, I would estimate that only 4 deal directly with Character or Plot.The rest of it is a grab-bag of whaling industry history, exacting description of whaling technology, inexact biology and philosophical musings that wander far, far afield. After reading Mark Twain's hilarious dissection of \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\", I can only imagine what he would do with \\"Moby Dick\\".The London Literary Gazette, December 6 1851, review of the newly published Moby Dick sums up my feelings:\\"This is an odd book, professing to be a novel; wantonly eccentric; outrageously bombastic; in places charmingly and vividly descriptive. The author has read up laboriously to make a show of cetalogical learning.... Herman Melville is wise in this sort of wisdom. He uses it as stuffing to fill out his skeleton story. Bad stuffing it makes, serving only to try the patience of his readers, and to tempt them to wish both him and his whales at the bottom of an unfathomable sea....The story of this novel scarcely deserves the name.... Mr. Melville cannot do without savages so he makes half of his dramatis personae wild Indians, Malays, and other untamed humanities.... What the author's original intention in spinning his preposterous yarn was, it is impossible to guess; evidently, when we compare the first and third volumes, it was never carried out....Having said so much that may be interpreted as a censure, it is right that we should add a word of praise where deserved. There are sketches of scenes at sea, of whaling adventures, storms, and ship-life, equal to any we have ever met with....Mr. Herman Melville has earned a deservedly high reputation for his performances in descriptive fiction. He has gathered his own materials, and travelled along fresh and untrodden literary paths, exhibiting powers of no common order, and great originality. The more careful, therefore, should he be to maintain the fame he so rapidly acquired, and not waste his strength on such purposeless and unequal doings as these rambling volumes about spermaceti whales.\\"That was written before the book gained its 20th Century Reputation, one I sadly feel is undeserved."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is a classic....a book that you'd have to have lived in a cave on a remote island for your entire life to have not at least heard the name of.The book has sat on my bookshelf, as part of a series of classic novels I had been given, for some time now. I always knew that 'someday' I'd open it and read it...being one of those 'I really should read it at some point' books.Apparently I enjoyed this book a lot less than many others who have read it and reviewed it here....because I have to admit that it is one of the most dry, turgid, tedious experiences I have ever had to wade through this book, and it's under 500 pages long.Perhaps what deterred me from enjoying it was the endless chapters that provide detailed descriptions of the size of a whale's head....or the length of a whale's tail....or the distance from a whale's head to its tail.....chapter upon chapter upon chapter that did nothing to move the story along, did nothing to flesh out the characters any better..and did nothing to hold my interest.While the book is filled with interesting characters, the infamous Captain Ahab, the strange and curious Queequeg, the immortal 'Ishmael' who provides the narrative of the story, and who seemed, upon reading his story of life upon the Pequod, more like a clumsy, giddy little schoolgirl working on a fishing boat than an 'able bodied seaman'.The cast of characters alone could have been far more interesting, at least to me, to explore than the wrapt appraisal of a whale's jawbone....and left me feeling as though I was reading a non-fiction work entitled 'Everything you'll never need to know about whales'.'Call me Ishmael' may start off what for some is their favorite written work of all time.

Ishmael goes to a whale inn because he wants to go on a whaling trip. He gets stuck in the same bed as a strange, cannabalistic-tatooed man named Queequeg. When Ishmael wakes up this guy is hugging him.But after that it gets very boring. Unless your life goal is to go to Borneo college and study squid fishing, or you love to spend every weekend fishing so you can study the fishes every movement and physiognomy, then you'd love this book.It's got everything you'd ever want to know about whales. Their skin, face, blubber, signifigance in history, classification of whales (whole chapter dedicated to it), symbolism of their whiteness, etc. If you're not into that,you should read the book for the fun of looking up biblical references of which are many.There are a few good points to the book. (1)It makes you feel like you are really part of the whaling crew with it's through chapters on things whale related.(2)It feels very realistic (3) There's so much symbolism and analyzing. (4) it has atmosphere that humans are insignifigant to God, nature, and greater powers and make you feel like there's more out there.But if you want to appreciate this book, I suggest that you take your time reading it. To me it's one of those books that's completely over rated just because it's a classic. There's no real interest for people who don't like to analyze books and write term papers on the symbolism of it all.

I was expecting a novel of tremendous stature to justify its legendary reputation. However the story drags on and on. Worse, it seems that Melville is so in love with the whaling industry that he feels compelled to give the reader a lesson on whale anatomy, the different types of whales and the differing types of blubber they produce. Interesting? Not for me.Most surprisingly, I found the story to get boring once they went to sea. At the beginning, while at port, I found the characterisations and the discussion about the whaling communities to be interesting.Bottom line: I can't understand how anyone could like this novel. It was a PAINFUL read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Before reading \\"Moby Dick\\" I considered \\"War and Peace\\" the worst book I had ever read, but compared to \\"Moby Dick\\" \\"War and Peace\\" is a light, fun read where your eyes just fly across the page. It's almost impossible to acurately descibe how bad of a book \\"Moby Dick\\" is. First of all, classiflying it as fiction is a mistake. Probably a good 60% of the book is non-fiction - chapter after chapter dedicated to every imaginable detail of the biology of the whale and every imaginable nuance of whaling. These non-fiction chapters are made all the more unbearable by the style of writing, which is so pretentious, poetic and over the top that at times it actually made me laugh out loud. Almost every sentence is 100 words long with 10 commas. And the over the top writing is not confined to the book's non-fiction chapters, it's just the opposite - it gets even worse when Melville switches over to the fiction. Especially in the many and endless soliloquies. The ridiculous writing style completely crushes any chance the book might have had of actually telling a story. Finishing the entire book is something that I'm proud of myself for having done, which is never the mark of a good read. I would suggest that unless a person wants to torture themself, read something else. Although I do think there is some value in setting your mind to reading the worst book ever written from cover to cover, and acomplishing that goal. It's the ultimate test of patience and courage, and succeeding will make you a better person, which is maybe what Herman Melville had in mind when he wrote this piece of junk."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick or The Whale by Herman MelvilleI love this book! \\"Moby Dick, or the Whale\\" is a great American novel."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Every time I pick up this novel and, in sortes fashion, read a bit of it, I want to beat my head against a wall.

When I think of anyone being FORCED to read this novel (poor students, whereever you are) I want to fall on a harpoon. Ray Bradbury, who wrote the screenplay for this novel, (a la Gregory Peck) couldn't even finish the damn thing! He too just read bits of it, and gleaned the importance thereby. He recognized it's inner greatness, its actual grandeur absolutely mired in prose that makes you want to gnaw your foot off...or feed it to Queqaig (sp?).

Such was the case with me. I am quite the fan of stories which involve man eating sea creatures, such as Jaws. Moby Dick is nothing compared to such classics, I fear.In fact, it is boring with a capital B. What is the whales motivation? You dont know. There is no suspense, and I find the idea of people hunting whales offensive. Offensive with a capital O. Whales are lovely, peaceful creatures and that is why their slaughter has been outlawed.

Herman Melville was a whaler, and wrote a very long and boring book about whaling. Seriously, this book is not an adventure. It is 540somepages of boring whaling details. I don't think half the chapters (there are about 100 some chapters, most about 2-20 pages long) are necessary to the story of the book, but are just filler about whales and whaling because the story is lame. I suppose perhaps not much happens at sea from day to day.This book is over rated, and shouldn't be as well regarded as it is. Read something fun like Dostoevsky instead."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is an unquestionably classic. Indeed, you know a classic by how many times it has been ripped off, or alluded to in pop culture. In fact, the star Trek franchise's motto is when in doubt; either have a time travel episode, a Borg episode, or rip-off Moby-Dick. See episodes from the original series &quot;Obsession,&quot; and movies &quot;The Wrath of Khan,&quot; and &quot;First Contact&quot; and &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;Test: What's the opening line of Moby-Dick? &quot;Call me Ishmael.&quot;So why the four starts for a classic? Basically, because Melvin threw in too much exposition in explaining cetology and zoology, which is helpful in getting a feel for the book, but contributes nothing to the brooding Ahab's story. You get snippets here and there of Ahab's monomania, but it is only in the last several chapters that he blooms from being a poor addled man to a diabolic and satanic force of evil. Baptizing the spear in the name of the devil is what does it!But do we need to slog through 135 chapters, plus an appendix to get to the point. In reality this book is about the milieu of whaling and the whaling industry as a metaphor for life, not monomania as is popularly believed. He does a wonderful job of catching the salt and blood associated, and his poetic eye catches the glisten of meaning with these events, but he is doing several things at once, and the quest for the whale is only part of the story.But these cetology matters should have been relegated to an appendix, or the circular file. It was as if Melville was trying to write two books at once: a bouncy book on various whales and whaling in general, and a another being the tale of obsession and revenge. My advice would be to get an abridge version of the book, or skip to the next chapter when the book gets boring.So what is the appeal? First, Ahab is a strong character with a smoldering motive to get back at the whale that cost him his leg-i.e. Captain Hook. Does he ever get back at the wale? Are we ever Ahab-esque in that we get obsessed with revenge? Come on! Be honest! We feel Ahab burning in our veins at times.Ahab is crazy. Hannibal Lecter is crazy. But they are crazy for different reasons. You feel that Lecter is really in control of himself, and that he enjoys being evil whereas Ahab has surrendered his will to he appetite and passion for revenge. What wraps my attention is the question why.Second, the craft. Melville is a master storyteller. We see things through Ishmael's eyes, so we feel the distance between Ahab and us. We are detached from the goings on in the story as Ishmael comments on Ahab's journey downward. It must be read to be understood.Third, the milieu. Melville certainly did his homework in researching this novel. Indeed, chapter one seems like a brainstorm on all things whale, and he manages to sustain this encyclopedic knowledge throughout the story. Compare this to Jack London and The Sea-Wolf: London has as much technical knowledge, or more so than Melville, but the Sea-Wolf focuses on the characters Humphrey Van Weyden and Wolf Larsen and the idea of a Neitzchean Superman. Moby-Dick, however, is a study of the whaling milieu and the smudge pot Ahab. London skimps on the description of seal hunting &quot;culture,&quot; and the nuts and bolts of sailing while Melville revels in telling us everything about whaling. This exposition is what kills the book because the plot grinds to a standstill as Melville throws cetological tidbits and tales at us. It is fun to read, but the plot momentum stops dead. It is almost like seeing an infomercial in the middle of the book! Luckily we can skip ahead, unlike reality where we cannot fast-forward commercial.This book is part of a trio that deals with evil captains, the other books being Jack London's &quot;Sea-Wolf,&quot; and Jules Verne's &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea.&quot; Nemo is just as driven as Ahab, but is more mysterious. We understand Ahab's revenge, since we have all tried to chase down people who have hurt us, or wanted to get back at a barking dog, or barking spouse. That is the appeal-we relate to Ahab better than Nemo, who is cerebral, cold, distant and obscure.Wolf Larsen is another matter. He belongs in the Villain's Hall of Fame, or is it the Rogue's Gallery? Pure evil, a pure manifestation of &quot;intelligence . . . added to brute power and evil will&quot; (Inferno, 31) that was never matched or equaled until Thomas Harris created Hannibal Lecter. Ahab is obsessed and we understand why someone wants revenge, but Larsen is terrifying in that he enjoys being evil. I just wish that Larsen would get more exposure.So in a knot, I recommend this book, but advise people to feel free in skipping over the unnecessary chapter, or buying an abridged version. Read &quot;20,000 Leagues&quot; and &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; to nail down the image of an evil captain.FOR ANYONE WRITING A REPORT: This story is a tale of &quot;Man Versus Nature&quot; embodied by the whale. Read Genesis 16-17,21, 25, 28 and 1 Kings 16, 18, 20-22 for Ishmael and Ahab. Aren't I kind!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"My review is of the book, not this particular edition.There are only a few reasons to read this book:(1) You have to read it for school. If this is the case stop reading reviews and get to work.(2) You want to be cultured. There are many \\"cultural\\" books that are a lot more fun to read and more educational/enlightening than this book are. Come back to this book when you're more desperate(3) You are a whaler, or a member of some anti-whaling organization. It's really part of your field.This book fits Mark Twain's definition of a classic: \\"A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.\\" While I am sure there is a personality type out there who would like this sort of book, I think it's in the minority, and that most people wouldn't like this book, and it wouldn't be a classic unless college professors told us it was a classic. First off, the vast majority of the book is mind-numbingly boring. It seems that most authors of the 19th century thought that to write well, they had to write a lot, so Melville takes a story that could fit into a few chapters and bloats it with countless discussions on anything and everything even remotely related to whales. From the point of view of learning, these discussions are of limited value. A great deal of the information is out of date or of a limited perspective. If you want to learn about whales or even 19th century whaling, you'd probably learn a lot more and in a lot less time just by reading encyclopedia articles on the subject.That leaves two things to be gotten from this book: A moving story, and a lesson in good writing. Like I said, the story could really fit into a few chapters. The book is 135 chapters, and could easily have fit into thirty, even with Melville's ornate style.That brings us to a lesson in writing. It seems to me that there are two great schools of though on writing: The first values clarity, and the second values ornamentation. The first seeks to say something as clearly and succinctly as possible and when you read it, you say \\"ah, that is the perfect way of saying that.\\" The second seeks the most virtuosic way of saying something, and when you read it, you say \\"ah, that is the most impressive way of saying that.\\" I come from the first school, and I don't particularly like the virtuosic style: but Melville is such a pitch-perfect caricature of the most pompous wing of the baroque school of writing that I found slogging through his prose to be a miserable experience. If you like finding new ways of saying common things, I think you should give Melville a try, but if you value clear and direct writing, I suggest you heed this warning.I should end by saying it's not all bad. I was trying to decide between one and two stars for most of the book. But around chapter 119 I thought it really became good. The reading was actually enthralling and I even teared up at the part where Starbuck has a moment of insight into Ahab's soul and makes one final attempt to convince Ahab to give it up. I'd give from about chapter 119 to the end four or five stars, but that's not enough to save the book for me."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"\\"Moby Dick\\" has been hyped far beyond its worth because it was the first American novel with philosophic pretentions. You could read the first ninety pages, then skip to the last ten and miss nothing but a binful of symbols. It's gauche, jejune, primitive, a graphic novel without illustrations--one of the few American novels improved as a Classics comic book. Joseph Conrad covers the same material better, and Persig better than either of them. This is a wearying tome that no one would read if it weren't assigned reading. It will teach you . . . nothing."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"MOBY DICK was trashed by critics in its own time, and was a commercial flop. I think those folks had the right take on the book. I found it tedious going. And it was odd how the fictional story was interrupted here and there to become a text book for a college oceanography class: everything you ever wanted to know about whales. I truly think MOBY DICK has turned into a &quot;classic&quot; because university students and professors who needed a literary novel to write about found MOBY DICK so rich with symbolism (even though the actual novel itself wasn't worth much). English term papers (and articles professors have to write for academic journals) require you to show--not whether THE GREAT GATSBY is a good read or not--but what Gatsby represents (the failure of the American Dream!!). The optometrist's billboard that appears throughout GATSBY represents...THE OMNISCIENCE OF GOD, AND HOW YOU CAN NOT ESCAPE HIS FATE. Those are the two big symbolic/metaphorical things in THE GREAT GATSBY. And I could write an English paper explaining those symbols. But MOBY DICK...my God!!!!!!!!! There are more symbols and metaphors on a single page of MOBY DICK than there are in the whole of GATSBY, or most other literary &quot;classics.&quot; I could write a thousand English papers and professorial academic articles about the symbolism in MOBY DICK. I mean, the white whale...his whiteness is symbolic of...where do I start??? That Queequeg is all tattoed...what do those tattoos represent??? (That's a term paper right there). And Queequeg and Ishmael (two men) sleeping together at the beginning of the novel &quot;like husband and wife...&quot; (Another paper explaining that). Peter Coffin is the name on the sign outside the inn at the start of the novel. The last scene in the book has a coffin float to the surface after the Pequod (the name of an American Indian tribe!!!) sinks!!!! The inn is &quot;like Lazarus,&quot; the inn's windows like Lazarus's eyes. (Since when have you stayed in a hotel that reminded you of a g! uy raised from the dead?????? Ah...but it's symbolism!!!) Ahab's peg leg bitten off by Moby Dick?...well, of course, that peg leg is a phallic symbol! (Yet another academic paper written right there). And what of the biblical names...like &quot;Ishmael&quot; and &quot;Ahab&quot; (names not representative of American names of the time)...more term papers and articles for academic journals. Grad students and undergrad students and professors over the years have needed literary works rich with symbolism like this to write about. And when there is a book like MOBY DICK...that makes your work very easy. And all those students and professors writing papers about MOBY DICK over the years have had a snowball effect so that people actually now give the novel merit in and of itself, aside from its helpful wealth of academic goodies. I will say that the last three pages of MOBY DICK are good. It is a good action scene, that final battle against the whale. (And there is enough symbolism in those last few pages, besides, for ten term papers. But it's good stuff in and of itself. But three good pages at the end of such a long, grinding book ain't worth the journey). When I read Mark Twain's quote that &quot;a classic is a book everybody wants to HAVE read, but nobody wants to read,&quot; I thought immediately of MOBY DICK."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I quite enjoyed this version, but it felt like it missed some action.

For me it falls short on several levels. First, I thought it was a long-winded piece. It's over six hundred pages and very heavy on descriptions. The passages can be wordy and sometimes hard to digest, or tolerate. The vocabulary and sentence structure (reminiscent of Poe's works) could also be a chore rather than a joy to get through. Captains Courageous, on the other hand shines brightly with its much livelier cast, and more enjoyable narrative.There is also a potential for an interesting gender study on this work. When I first read it, I either didn't pay attention to or skimmed over the homoerotic interactions between Ishmael and Queequeg. These took place in several scenes early in the book and only led to more questions about the characters and their makeup rather than informing the reader or adding depth. I'll probably try this book again later on in life, but until then I'd recommend others."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"O.K. 80% of this novel is boring as hell, unless you're into the history of whaling. But the other 20%, wow! The metaphysics of the whale is astonishing, and mainly by virtue of how Melville describes the creature, and links it to Ahab.So what is the whale? Some see good or evil, others life or death, others decay or life, still others God. If you read to the end, you'll see which interpretation I favor -- but the whale seems to encompass all of these.Charles Olson has a great analysis in his little known book \\"Call Me Ishmael\\"Call Me Ishmaellikening the whale to America's concept of vast space (as in land), which America tries to harness through technology. It's a great read, insightful but not \\"scholarly\\".I believe Melville was \\"schizoid\\" in personality type, feeling the vast force of God, but not the personal connection to God, e.g. through Christ. Melville tried, but he was to honest with himself to make himself believe something he really didn't buy. Writing Moby Dick almost literally killed the guy. God is too powerful for man to face unmediated, but this is what Melville tried to do. It was the only chance he had to make contact. Melville and Ahab both had to try to wrestle the whale, to bring something incomprehensible home to themselves, and to man."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is one of those books that can be the only book you will ever need. The range of characters is quite wide and it has excellent descriptive matter. I only wish it had more of the saucy and less of the salty. Otherwise I just love this book!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This was one of the best sea stories ever written. It was different than I had expected. I thought it was going to be like the movie with Gregory Peck. The book is different in many ways. First you have to realize when the book was written to really understand it. It was written in the 1850s in the US.I found the book to an indictment of the times and a protest against slavery. You have to remember the characters. All the guys from Nantucket are from every race in the world, look at the three harpooners. There was an Indian, a black and wild South Pacific Island guy.This show about the way that people were treated at the time. What are they all going after but the great white whale in the South. What is the whale but a great beast beating down on all the others.Ahab is my favoriate character who against all odds goes after the great white whale to take from him what the whale has taken from so many others. It is this stuggle against this Madman who tried to get all his crew to work together to slay the beast, but as was the times the evil which was slavery still existed in the US so the whale prevailed.I also like all the details about whaling and how they used every piece of it for something. The funniest part was Keequay coming in from the rain with the poncho that was made from that part of a whale. Before this book I never knew that all these ships carried buoys with them in case of a cataclysm.I recommend this book to everyone and I was glad I was older when I read it because I understood it more."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Although the plot dragged all over the place, it was a basicly good book with a lot of emence detale"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Most people might consider me to be a bit idealistic to think that Moby Dick is the greatest novel of the 19th century, or even great to begin with. But undoubtedly this book contains so many subtleties and undertones that transcend most readers. The readers who get them, however, are brilliantly provoked. Moby Dick is the story of a vengeful captain Ahab embroiled in the fight of his life, the fight for the intangibly malignant great white whale. Herman Melville's messages on ambiguity, power, and masks are incredible. For example, his use of deconstruction and contradiction in describing man's discovery that there are things out there that are better left unknown, like with Moby Dick, are universally applicable. Moby Dick is not for everyone; it is a long book that can get monotonous and rambling. But just when people start to get agitated with its pace, Melville throws in some brilliant lines and ideas that are so powerful they can be hard to pick up. I encourage everyone, however, to give this book a shot. If you are really interested in reading the greatest novel of the 19th century, give yourself at least a month to do so. I promise you, you will not be disappointed. In time, you might start to agree what a remarkable book this is."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I took a class in college all about Mellville a few years ago. A lot of the time I took the easy way out with the books that I just couldn't imagine actually trudging through (sparknote it!). But I was determined to read this one. I had always heard, as just about everyone has, that this is the greatest novel of all time. I wanted to see if that was actually true, or a bunch of old professors spouting off about a boring book. It was a shocker that it is actually true. Greatest novel of all time. No question, no argument.It's hard to explain exactly why though. It has a lot of weird stuff in it about whaling terminology, definitions and surreal scenes that reminded me almost of a wacky broadway number on crack. It is so hard to catch a hold of the atmosphere. Though there is one to be sure. It's difficult to talk about the themes or the points of the book. But there are more there than I could ever come up with, certainly. I think it is the nature of the book, the uneasiness, the expanse, the...what's the word...uncertainty...that makes it great. It looms out a million miles ahead of you.The other really uncertain thing about it, I don't why this is so, but it has the greatest character ever written on the page. Quequeg. I talked with many of my classmates about this, and they all agreed. I can't tell why, but he just is. He doesn't say much...but he's just THERE. I was floored by him. It's like he's more present than anyone you've ever read about before. You just have to see for yourself on that one.I've only read it once, but I really want to read it again. Because as Nabikov said, you cannot read a book, you must reread it. Something along those lines. But I would recommend this to anyone who is a book lover, or who wants a sense of history or culture since the book has been a big part of all of it.You won't believe it once you're finished."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A classic? Yes. Long? That's an understatement.There's an entire chapter on why the color \`white' is scary. If you never read this in school, and you don't know what you're getting into, I suggest talking to a few people who have read it first to see if this is your flavor. Melville is a beautiful writer, but his epic tangents were too much for me. Some people like the Mona Lisa, some people don't."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I read this book a few years ago when I was really into whales and whale watching and wanted a little historical perspective. I did get that and more, and less, depending on how you look at it.The book is long and difficult to get through. There are many chapters and parts of chapters that don't have to be included. As an example, there is a chapter on the identification of various species of whale, what they look like and where they range etc... From my previous whale knowledge, I knew that in several descriptions, multiple species were crammed into one and sometimes one whale was split into more than once species. Interesting, but hardly important to the story.If I were going to edit the book, and keep only the pieces that are of masterpiece quality, I'd have somewhere around 50 pages (the book is about 500 pages). At its best, the book is lyrical, suspenceful, the characters are deeply developed and their actions are believable. The story is exciting, crazy, tragic and frustrating all at the same time.At its worst, the book is pedantic, wordy, much too complex and down right boring. Truly, this book is combination of the best and the worst, sometimes right beside each other.In the end though, I have to agree with the critics over time, and that the classic pieces are what I took with me in the end. The plight of Ahab, the fanaticism, the tragedy and idea of an unobtainable goal all stay with me.The material that remains part of popular culture is there for a reason. The whole idea of a &quot;white whale&quot; as the unobtained goal. &quot;Thar she blows!&quot;, Captain Ahab himself, &quot;Call me Ishmael&quot; and many more make the book worth everyone's effort to read at least once."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The right approach and the adequate level of intelligence is vital for that book's appreciation.Here are a few hints that might help.Did you notice that every time you dream the weirdest things there is nothing unfamiliar about them? Even when the enormous green elefant on gnat's legs attacks you with the eagle's beak you can tell your sleeping brain put the monster together using the oversized version of the animal you saw in a zoo, though in a different color, gigantic limbs of an isect and the bird's mouth. While communicating with itself your brain can not produce any images that do not correspond with your everyday experiences, it is capable of transforming them almost beyond recognition but the ingredients are real life.The same with the author. He neded to choose something to be able to communicate with you. Why it's the gigantic white whale?White is not a color but an absence of color - see the book's treatise on white and the eerie feeling it produces. The form of a whale is very elusive and hard to define. The animal lives in the most mysterious(it's still a few decades till the space age) but accessible element of that time - the ocean.So GWW is the most undefinable object Herman Melville could come up with. Even writing one of the most metaphysical books he could not have set the hunt for hk897]];\\\\'; or =-llk5gghh. The need to communicate - remember? But be assured that the GWW is no less abstract than these crazy codes.There is some semblance of plot with the characters and even the final battle. Many readers are misled to such a degree they put here these &quot;good plot and hystorical background but way to many details&quot; reviews. Once I even stumbled upon the video cassette with the kid's version of Moby Dick - chubby boy grinning atop a friendly whale.Guy's, you don't know what are you dealing with!The quotations from the enormous variety of sourses on a whale at the book's first pages are not Melville's erudite showing off but a testimony to the futility of all the efforts to categorize.What drives Ahab? Revenge? Bloodlust? Even the most understanding readers try to find a word or two - The Quest for Truth, The Search For The Meaning Of Life. Choose any version or none at all.Ever thought about death? Are you familiar with that sense if inevitability that makes you gasp for breath and clench the fists. The fit is passes in a few minutes. What do you feel? Rage, fear, anger, helplessness? You can find words but they are not helping.So the Captain sails into infinity to conquer the...whatever.Too many fishes are named and described during the voyage? Too many details? In Zen practise you repeat thousands of words, name lots of objects until it all becomes meaningless and something else emerges. These fishes are not something you eat - they are just an excuses to give names ad nauseam, to catch the little flecks of infinity and try to make the catalogue.Enough said. This book must be read, not explained. But it's a very special reading - like having a long string of beads pass before your eyes. Do not think too much, do not expect to be entertained - just enjoy the feeling."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I just spent a week reading this whale of a book and decided the book has more water or filler than all the oceans of the world combined. The book is much like the Earth -- it is 2/3 water or filler and the other 1/3 land or somewhat of a story. The story is really thin -- Ahab and the Pequod in quest of the White Whale. This goes on for 589 pages in my edition. Moby-Dick is first mentioned in the book on page 177 and then seen for the first time on page 559. That's right, right at the end of the novel. For most of the book, we are bored and disgusted at Melville relating everything he knows about whaling and whales. Much of it, I imagine, is obsolete information. The story involving Moby-Dick is only a few pages. I think my copy of 589 pages could have been boiled down to about 235 pages, and that would have been a classic, engrossing story of the hunt for a White Whale. Anyway, if you have to read it, beware of the boring, sleep-inducing whaling chapters. Even though I really felt a lot of the book was unnecessary, I can see how the book became a classic. It is an unrivaled look at whales, and must have influenced Peter Benchley in his writing of \\"Jaws.\\" Sharks are mentioned many times in the book. But a white Sperm Whale seemed to be the biggest monster in the ocean, and so Melville chose him. There was supposedly an actual whale named Mocha Dick being hunted during Melville's time. In the end, I can give Moby-Dick a slight recommendation. The story is solid, but if that's all you want, I recommend renting the movie with Richard Basehart and Gregory Peck. No, in the end, Moby-Dick really should have been called, \\"But I Digress.\\" Read it any way, I guess, it is considered a classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I could not finish listening to the terrible injustice Burt Reynolds did to this classic. It sounded as though he was reading it for the first time. The voice he chose to portray Ishmael was one of a drunken sea salt instead of a school teacher off on an adventure. All sense was lost of the meaning of the sentences with his arbitrary screeching and bellowing. I later found an unabridged version that I loved, the language and the cadence of the speech was respected in a way that Mr. Reynolds had not the wit, ability, or intelligence to understand let alone portray."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Melville is writing through Ishmael and Ishmael is Ahab. And it might help to stop thinking of the story as man/nature and dig deeper to the roots of what allegory it might have for Melville's life.The \\"slow\\" middle might seem less slow this way and you can apply the message to your own life.

When I was tired of reading, I hit the play button and let Audible read it to them.The vivid decriptions of the sailors life at sea made my children thankful for a warm and cozy home. As the main characters of the book speculated upon their place in this world, so did my children. My boys dreamed of going to sea to finish the job that Captain Ahab could not and my little girl dreamed of helping the sailors who were hurt by the great white whale.At first they viewed Moby Dick as a ruthless whale attacking innocent sailors. Later, they saw that the ruthlessness belonged to Captain Ahab and his yearning to kill the great while whale at whatever the cost including his own life and the life of his men.This opened the door to our talks regarding \\"good stewardship\\" as we discussed the gifts God has given to us and how we might use them in a way pleasing to Him. In the end, they had a view of Captain Ahab that was more in line with the character portrayed in the novel... he was a vicious man whose base human instincts were malignant and evil.A very good read but much explaining for a parent to do with his/her children."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"love this book!

What should be a few paragraphs goes on for pages."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"The radio made its grand appearance in 1895; the television coming along after that in 1929. Before these more modern forms of entertainment, books were king, being mass produced and widely distributed as early as 1454. And Herman Melville's Moby Dick: or, The White Whale is the king of books written for the king of whales (Whales as in sperm whale, not whales as in well -- the country Wales: a part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain.)\\"Oh, the rare old Whale, mid storm and galeIn his ocean home will beA giant in might, where might is right,And King of the boundless sea.\\" --WHALE SONG.Brief:Moby Dick is the tale of a man so consumed with vengeance, eaten up with hatred and driven by madness that he goes to whatever ends of the earth, exhausts all possible means, and sacrifices many on the alter of his passion in the pursuit of the infamous Moby Dick. Read aloud this book unlocks it's many secrets and subtle tones. To quote Jim Henson,\\" When people told themselves their past with stories, explained their present with stories, foretold the future with stories, the best place by the fire was kept for... The Storyteller.\\"(My husband enjoy hearing this book read voices and all by yours truly.) The tale is told by a man who bids us call him Ishmael, a newly ordained whaler off on his first voyage -- what a trip that turned out to be!Melville uses his nautical knowhow and grasp on whaling vernacular to paint some beautiful maritime images. In this book, Melville hopes to illuminate the many darkened corners of everyday life aboard a whaling ship, a feat not many have had the opportunity to experience. (I was surprised by some of the goings on. Who would blaze a forge aboard a wooden boat in the middle of the ocean? Doesn't seem wisdom to me.) His tale is a fish tale told by a witness, too big to be believed, but too thrilling not to pass along. Chock full of tantalizing foreshadowing, exquisite imagery, lofty questions that harken even to the foundations of the universe: it is no surprise that this is a classic and should remain so for some time to come.In Depth:Written in 1851, Moby Dick didn't come into notoriety until much later, the 1920's, in fact. However, I don't believe that a work of genius loses its luster simply by being looked over for a few dusty decades. Moby Dick was still the peculiarly good book then that it is now, even without the recognition.The reason for this neglect is summed up in a critic's review upon the novel's release:\\"This is an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact. The idea of a connected and collected story has obviously visited and abandoned its writer again and again in the course of composition. The style of his tale is in places disfigured by mad (rather than bad) English; and its catastrophe is hastily, weakly, and obscurely managed.\\"-Henry F. Chorley, in London Athenaeum, October 25 1851Ouch, that is a harsh but not entirely inaccurate review.Here's how:1.The book is a hodgepodge of the epically awesome thrilling narrative of a vindictive whaling revenge story gone awry, AND it's a not so accurate antiquated whaleology (Cetology is the technical term, but you know...) dissertation.And I know what you're thinking...\\"OH, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet.\\" And along with Rudyard Kipling you'd be right. Who would have thought of mixing science and fiction? (snicker, snicker... sorry) I am of course meaning literal science or at least the preconceived notions on whales from the time period . Moby Dick contains a wealth of knowledge and first hand whaling experience from Melville's life, but he doesn't just write it into Ishmael's tale. It is splattered haphazardly throughout the book educating the reader while disrupting the flow and pacing of the story.This is... well it's distracting, and well, it's infuriating! The story builds. As a reader, you are getting keyed in and keyed up. Then -- WHAM! Let's pause for this PSA on the differing types of twine used on whaling ships with an additional three pages on the species of whales this book is NOT about.More whaling, less waxing on whaling, please!From what I have gleaned about the book, it was not the current writing style of the times to marry fact with a tale of fiction -- however, woeful and whaleful it may be. But as much as it is a detriment to my attention span, this odd writing style also strokes my inner nerd and evokes my intellectual yearnings. I found myself continually questioning his information. Googling about whales -- heck, I even watched Blue Planet for some additional information.2. Now we come to the mad English bit. Melville uses either some extreme creative license or some heavily buried nautical colloquialisms to further embellish his maritime account. There are words in this book that only a sailor at sea cut off from civilization could conjure up. I remember looking at some words, and searching for them with my Kindle's dictionary. I cannot begin to relay the frustration that the phrase \\"No entries found\\" causes me now. It had me continually worried I wasn't understanding the story as it was meant to be understood.But beyond all this wordage and pacing, the story of Captain Ahab is intensely engaging. Long before you meet the whale (He doesn't make an appearance till the last 3 chapters out of 135...), you know things aren't going to go well for the captain or his crew. And it is these early portentous notions, that have you flat flying to the end of the book. You just have to know if Captain Ahab has his retribution or if the white whale exacts yet more torments on the already tortured commander.On the Stocking Scale, I give it a 4 for Darned Good. It is looooooong, and takes a commitment to read, but I don't believe you'll regret the decision in the end. And should you want to skip the whaling tutorial and get down to the gritty tale itself, well -- read the abridged version.I downloaded this book for free on my Kindle Fire.

Fortunately, I write in ignorance of the Moby Dick scholarship.But anyone can see that Ishmael shares with Philip Marlowe an erudition completely inappropriate to the character's role and whole station in life. (His wonderful use of language!) There must be a back-story to each misfit, and I gather that Ishmael's (Melville's) back-story has been identified.One of Melville's motives seems to be political, to project himself as pro-people and anti-dictator. Ahab is a dictator who knows full well that he is misleading the people (both sailors and the Pequod's owners). He is driven by fear and resentment, and uses his political abilities to gather and motivate a mob that will lash out at his enemies.Does this make Ahab one of Bob Altemeyer's RWA leaders?Specifically, does Ahab stand for the Scotch-Irish warlord, the Jackson-Houston-Polk type that figured so large in Melville's time? If so, then since W reincarnated Polk perhaps the vastness of nature idolized by today's environmentalists corresponds to Melville's white whale.The book is full of innocent blood, by the way."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I'm afraid to say that I actually couldn't even get past chapter three in this book.

It's structure is in the traditional sense less than perfect the plot wandering to a side character for pages and then we never hear of the character again. But that just adds to the charm.

Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world\\".

The first failed reading of this novel happened when I picked up a lovely Easton Press leather hardback. I sat and cracked open the book and by the third chapter I realized I would be needing a dictionary handy. I never got farther than that in my first attempt and this second attempt was only made successful for not having to stop to look up the hundreds of archaic words. There were still quite a few that my integrated dictionary couldn't fin, but taking the time to look these up was far less damaging to the reading experience than had I gone with the print version. A word of caution: the free version of the ebook I read (ASIN:B004TRXX7C) had errors whenever it dealt with lists of numbers i.e. list of money valuations, weights, etc. Frequently the text was egregiously wrong with the first number in the list.Using the Moby Dick Big Read Along website was also crucial to my finishing this novel. This website was suggested by author Joe Hill as he commenced his reading of this novel. The site is dedicated to a free podcast reading of the novel with each chapter being read by someone different. There were only a few chapters I could not listen to (because of their style of reading) but on the whole, reading the ebook along with this verbal reading made the experience magnitudes better. There are times in the novel when it was not clear to me that a dialog was taking place, but the vocal performances made it explicitly clear. Also, Melville abuses commas and semicolons like a champ and the vocal readings made it much easier to find the flow of sentence than deciphering it out on my own. Added bonus is that there are a few celebrity readers such as Tilda Swinton and Benedict Cumberbatch.My experienceThis is a hard read but a rewarding one. Yet, I would caution the reader that if you're looking for a thriller - fast paced and exciting - this is not the book for it. There is action but it is far outweighed by the academics of whaling. On the whole, my experience with this book is to, at a very high level, say it is the grandfather of tales such as the movie Jaws. There's a fellow that knows all the biology of the animal (Hooper/Ishmael), a fellow that wants to keep everyone safe and kill the beast but not at the expense of his own life (Brody/Starbuck) and the fellow that will stop at nothing to see this beast dead by his own hands (Quint/Ahab).However, most of the book is dedicated not to the backbone of the Jaws storyline but rather to the documentation of whaling. Much like the book 20,000 Leagues Under The Seas, there are entire chapters (several actually) that take painstaking care in documenting the biology and happenings of the time - the anatomy of a whale, the various species of whale, the history of whale depictions, the process of hunting for whale, the process of dismantling a whale, the worth of whale parts (oil, ambergris, bone, etc) and exacting detail of the components of a whaling ship. It feels more like a biology lesson rather than a novel and in this day in age, it really made me wonder why anyone would go through so much trouble to hunt a whale. However as tedious as these parts can be, I found it incredibly interesting... almost as if it were a tome to a dying art. These sailors were the Deadliest Catch fishermen of their day and age. They suffered weather, rations, tediousness, physical hardship, sharks, and seclusion in hopes of bringing home enough oil to sell and receive their share. Many did not come home (or like Ahab didn't come home whole) and that was just part of expectations of such a hazardous profession.But if you can slog through those parts, the pay off is incredible. All that I knew about this novel (and that most people will hear about this novel) only takes place in the last three chapters of this 135 chapter novel. But the characters are so rich and interesting. The harpooners, Queequeg, Tashtego and Daggoo are my favorite characters because they are so different from anyone else. Ishmael, our narrator, is an interesting fellow himself. He seems to have a bit of jading toward religion (\\"I'll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.\\" p. 46) but in all other things seems to be a fair narrator by conveying more of what he sees rather than commentary about what he sees. And of course there is steady Starbuck and our mad Captain Ahab. Ahab is more of a brooding figure that does not prominently play into the action until well into the second half of the novel. Ahab has a singular determination for revenge. Above the profit of the ship, the lives of his crew and even above his own life itself, Ahab's singular purpose for this voyage is to find and kill Moby Dick. He is so tortured by his first encounter with the White Whale, that revenge consumes him to the point that he no longer wishes to live if it means he must endure Moby Dick living as well. It is an all consuming hatred that drives Ahab and that in the end costs him everything. It is proof positive that frequently, hatred consumes the person rather than the object of the hate.Similar to Ahab, Moby Dick himself doesn't make an appearance in the novel until the antepenultimate chapter. Much like the movie Jaws, you'll have to wait quite some time to actually see the monster in all his glory. In Ahab's obsession over Moby Dick, I found it intriguing that Ahab truly believed that Moby Dick can hold a grudge and have a single mind for attacking rather than fleeing a capture. Whales apparently normally don't attack with viciousness, yet this is exactly what happens upon meeting the unique creature.The short of it - if you want to take a shortcut, read just the last three chapters and that will get you about 90% of everything you've ever heard about this book. If you want the full experience, I would strongly suggest taking your time reading it and augmenting a print version with an audio version. It helps immensely.Popular CultureThe thing I love most about reading classics is it becomes clear that all works of art are somehow connected or based on others. Slogging through and enduring the bulk of the archaic and There were several instances of this in Moby Dick.On two occasions, the movie Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan echoed lines from Moby Dick. The first was when addressing his first mate Starbuck and the listening crew, Ahab confirms that it was indeed Moby Dick that took his leg. Displaying all his enmity for the whale, Ahab shows to what lengths he is willing to go to hunt down and kill him when he declares,\\"I'll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition's flames before I give him up.\\"- CHAPTER 36 The Quarter-Deck (p. 150)The second came at the end of the book. Ahab again utters a familiar quote. Similar to Khan, in his last moments of life, Ahab says,\\"Towards thee I roll, thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee; from hell's heart I stab at thee; for hate's sake I spit my last breath at thee.\\"- CHAPTER 135 The Chase - Third Day (p.538)The last pop culture reference I found in Moby Dick was a short but lovely song that the harpooners and sailors were singing on the Pequod - and it's because I first heard it from Quint in the movie Jaws:\\"Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!\\"- CHAPTER 40 Midnight, Forecastle (p. 158)Finding these gems not only made Moby Dick more fun, but it also gave me an appreciation for the other works and characters who referenced the lines from the novel and in the case of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, the depth of what they were saying by using these references.In all, I wanted the feeling of accomplishment for reading a classic that is so frequently referenced and I can say definitively that I have that. It was an amazing month long journey through a book that I fear will pass into unreadability because of it's archaic nature and we would be all the poorer for it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Overall, I liked this book, which I got on my Kindle. But, it had parts that were pretty boring, like when it would get off of the story line about the whale and go into how the rope was made, etc. I wasn't so interested in rope and wanted to get back to the story. But, I stayed with it due to the book being a classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I never had the privilege of reading this book prior to this year, and i wish i would have read it years ago. The wit and exquisite use of words by Melville makes this an easy book to bury your nose in for hours. You will be completely immersed in the 19th century whale fishery in all aspects and follow detailed human struggle of revenge. This was such a good read that it has now put me on a classic kick searching for more novels that capture the imagination like this book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Should have a dictionary ready as their is a lot of words that needed to be looked up, a great tale about how revenge should not blind you of your goals, and how you should forgive and forget as well as live and let go"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book is one of the great masterpieces of our time. Melville's magnum opus, it's a digressive tale that soars in scope, and resonates with truth"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick: or, the White Whale is one of the few American classic novels that I actually enjoyed reading. When it comes to classics, I usually enjoy European novels the most. Herman Melville writes with a dry sense of humor that I enjoy."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It's an old book & a Great story! I started reading it when I was in school but put it aside, now I'm finishing it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"After reading this book in college many years ago, I was transformed by the prose of Herman Melville. Not only does he delve into the human soul and all of its variables, but he deals with nature at its most primeval. It will always be my favorite book due to the intricacies of the characters and the fabulous writing style. I have been an avid reader ever since, daring authors to match the brilliance of Moby Dick: or, the White Whale."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Call me Fishmael.I gave MOBY DICK four stars because 80% of the novel is a rip-roaring adventure on the high seas, while 20% consists of digressions or sidebars that stop the story in its tracks. Some sample digressions are the classification of whales, whiteness, clam chowder, illustrators of whales, and so on. All of these detours do support the story, some more than others (whiteness), but they still interrupt the narrative flow. If I were teaching this now to gifted high school students, I would propose something heretical. I would mark certain chapters as optional--it's easy to find them given the chapter headings--but I would include them in class discussion by assigning students to individual chapters. Their merits could then be debated. I would suggest to anyone re-reading MOBY DICK or approaching it for the first time to take a similar approach--skip the detours unless you find them interesting.As for the bulk of the novel, it's like a superabundant ocean overflowing with treasures. The passages describing the hunting, killing, and harvesting of whales are incomparable. Adding to this corpus delectable are vigorous characters, Shakespearean language and irony, classical and Biblical allusions, allegory and metaphor, laugh-out-loud humor, and an engaging narrator who disappears seamlessly in the latter sections of the tale.Many of these elements are present in one of my favorite scenes. The Pequod frequently encounters other ships on its journey (these meetings are called \\"gams\\"), and Ahab in his haste to board one of these vessels realizes that his artificial leg will not allow him to climb from his dinghy to the other boat's deck. A huge grappling hook is lowered, one that is used to secure the carcasses of whales to the boat, and Ahab sits in the curve of the hook while being raised to the passing ship's deck. All of the gams in MOBY DICK are amusing and enlightening because Ahab's sole concern is to ask the other captains if they've seen the white whale, while their intent lies elsewhere. The conversations are thus at cross purposes, providing humor, and serve to underline Ahab's obsession.Two scenes were remarkably reminiscent of HAMLET. Starbuck, the first mate, is convinced that Ahab is leading the crew to its doom. Late in the story, he eyes a musket outside of Ahab's cabin and considers murdering the sleeping captain. After a long soliloquy, during which Ahab cries out nightmarishly, Starbuck passes up the opportunity, much as Hamlet does when he encounters Claudius alone and praying. Anyone familiar with HAMLET cannot miss the unmistakable foreshadowing. In another scene, Ahab and the ship's carpenter are discussing Queequeg's coffin, which is actually a canoe of sorts. The carpenter has been given the task of converting the coffin into a life buoy, a humorous irony in itself. The ensuing conversation is not unlike Hamlet's hilarious exchange with the gravedigger.Ahab: Art thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy shop?Carpenter: I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?Ahab: Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?Carpenter: Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg. ; but they've set me now to turning it into something else.Ahab: Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling, monopolizing, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a jack-of-all-trades.The twists and turns of fate are out of Ahab's control, but Melville's mastery of MOBY DICK is complete."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I consider Moby Dick one of the best books I've been reading until now.

I am not an avid reader, but this is one of the books that I even loved to read as a child."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is written in a style that hasn't been in style for over a hundred years. So, you need to adjust the overly long paragraphs to the Kindle screen, unless you want to swipe the screen every five seconds and lose your place. Tiny type suits the work better than giant type simply because the work, by any modern standard is \\"wordy\\". This particular version of the Melville novel works well to adapt itself to your kindle. I do not believe that a lot of footnotes explaining context are needed for Moby Dick. It is written in a such a vernacular way that not knowing what some colloquialisms mean actually enhance the story. It's simply a good read of a classic book. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Great book,lost art of reading. Down loaded it to my kindle in seconds. Price was super, couldn't ask for a better book to read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is the Norton Critical Edition. I ordered it for my wife. Moby what???? I said. Anyhow, it came in pristine condition except for a sturdy piece of tape that said \\"USED.\\" My wife was thrilled. If she ever finishes reading it, I plan on reading it next. Call it Moby envy."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I read this edition of Moby-Dick a while ago. For a novel like Moby-Dick, a lot of terminology needs to be clarified, so the Norton Edition is helpful if you like footnotes/endnotes.Positives: Structurally, the novel is divided into over one hundred thirty chapters, which makes it very easy to read bit by bit if you don't have a lot of time. The first block of twenty or so chapters chronicles Ishmael and his companion at the harbor before sailing. This is where Melville's use of foreshadowing does a great job of establishing a foundation of strong characters (like the monomaniac Captain Ahab) and creating an infamous reputation of Moby-Dick. As the ship sails around the oceans, there are a few frightening episodes of peril, as well as meetings with other ships which discuss the legendary encounters with Moby-Dick. When the crew finally does encounter the whale, Melville concentrates the ferocious battle into just a few chapters. At first I was expecting the Moby-Dick encounter to disappoint me, but Melville certainly delivers when the story's climax arrives.Negatives: If you read any of Melville's Piazza Tales, you will know that Melville is sometimes inaccessible due to his particular linguistic flavor. Melville very often dives into very intricate details about topics a modern reader cannot grasp. The middle section (about chpts 21-125) of Moby-Dick contains many chapters which are essays on select topics of maritime navigation, differences among whale species, parts of the sail mast, whale-harpooning, etc. The pacing of the novel slows to a standstill as you learn about the specifics of these topics. Don't feel bad if you really feel the need to skim through these encyclopedic chapters (you can usually tell by the chapter title). Every few chapters Melville does allow the story to move forward.If you are patient and enjoy novels that prepare you for an exciting conclusion, check out Moby-Dick. It's widely considered a classic for a good reason."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is worth reading, despite being pretty abominable philosophically (and parts of it are seemingly interminable and hard to get through, but I think that's actually a deliberate aesthetic choice on Melville's part). There are parts that are very good. The opening chapters about the friendship that develops between Ishmael and Queequeg are actually quite entertaining, and Melville makes some insightful psychological points through the character of Ahab. There are a lot of sort of proto-postmodernist elements in terms of the novel's form, along with Melville's belief in man's impotence in both thought and action which they represent---but nowhere near to the extent that would come later, in, for example, Ulysses."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I can't recommend this edition enough ! You will thoroughly enjoy this great work ! From cover to cover you will be up reading till its finished finally putting it back on the shelf is like leaving an old friend.

I would recommend this to others without reservation."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is Herman Melville's magisterial work on whaling and obsession. One of the other reviews states that whales are only a very tiny part of the book, but Melville spends far more time on whales than on Ahab's obsession. It appears fairly early on, but it stays in the background until the last fifth of the book (which also provides most of the action).Melville takes frequent asides to wax poetic about the law, whale biology, and the art of whale hunting. Moby Dick, at its heart, as much a book about work as a book about Ahab's obsession with the white whale, and no one has ever written work finer than Melville (although Cormac McCarthy comes close). And no one has ever written about work finer.The prose is almost always difficult to digest, but it is also almost painfully beautiful at times. The first paragraph of chapter 132 is illustrative:\\"It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was transparently pure and soft, with a woman's look, and the robust and man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson's chest in his sleep.\\"I read the free Kindle version created by GutenMark software. I did not notice any errors, but I have not read another edition, so changes in content would likely escape me. It does not include a foreword. The quotations about whales have all been moved to the back (it is my understanding some editions put this first)."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Now admired as a masterpiece of American literature and considered one of the greatest novels of all time, Moby-Dick is a \\"must read\\" book.

The price is more than reasonable and Anthony Heald has a wonderful voice quality that keeps one's interest even through those dry passages.

We very much enjoyed listening to this Melville classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is adventure interspersed with reflection. Actually, switch that. This is reflection interspersed with action. So if you want an exciting adventure only, read the abridged version. But if you want some interesting reflections on human nature, life, drive, etc, read this version (the real).Thing is, they cost about the same. I got my Moby Dick for just over $3.

Having read several reviews on the text, I believed it was one of the greatest of American Literary works. When I began, the tale proved to be accepatable and I found its insights profound indeed. However, the story quickly became tedious and boring (it seemed that Melville could not come up with any new material, so expanded on the mental processes of Ishmael). I wondered how readers could rate a story which had little (if any) plot and moved extremely slowly, as a great novel. True, literature is seldom interesting, and authors like Dickens and George Eliot are hardly better than Melville, but nevertheless, I believe that a literary text should at least be able to engage the reader and make him/her interested enough in it to finish it, so that the message can be fully comprehended. I did not finish Moby Dick and perhaps never will. I do not recommend it to readers. However, to give Melville credit, Moby Dick is an accurate portrayl of the American spirit in that context and thus, in that sense, does hold that mirror up to nature, as literature often does."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Very funny to read the reviews of other people. In order to comprehend how it is possible for one to find this novel boring, I have devised a few possible stereotypes for the readers who are bored by Moby Dick. This bored reader is either (1) too intelligent for literature: it seems hardly possible that these readers could be beyond a rich retelling and comentary on the history of all of human understanding and existence as well as a puzzling epistemological inquiry; (2) this bored reader is indifferent to the questions of life: I suppose there may be those who are not interested in reading a novel that challenges the reader to examine truth, the meaning of life and the meaning of truth (It sure interests me); (3) The reader is too stupid to understand any of the philosophical subtext that is practically impossible to ignore: It also does not seem possible to me that there may be people who cannot see past the beatiful and poetic narrative of Ishmael's to the philosophical journey through the sea of truth. This book is an amazing metaphorical masterpiece. The symbolic world of the novel is masterfully woven into the rich and interesting storyline. The novel, through its varied voices and stories takes a meandering stroll through the major outposts of human thought, while keeping the reader entertained by a enthralling plot. The novel as a whole can be taken as a journey unto itself (its own outpost of thought) through the sea of understanding which sheds light onto the human condition and the quest for truth. In any case, I am confounded by the possiblity that one could find Moby Dick boring. Please write me angry e-mails explaining your case if you do find it boring."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I would recommend getting the abridged version.

I wouldn't recommend it as a book you 'must read before you die'."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I have read 25% of this book and still waiting to get to the story.

I look forward to the adventure."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"If you can't find/can't afford an original press with the Rockwell Kent illustrations, this is the next best thing. Same illustrations, but the cover isn't anything to write home about."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is, without question, the greatest American novel. Through the eyes of a young sailor named Ishmael, we witness the decent of a once great man, Captain Ahab. This is an adventure novel, but it is so much more than that. It is about pride and obsession and futility. After the loss of his leg, Ahab spends years chasing after the whale that dismasted him. But if you think about it, what the hell is he doing this for? Even if he kills the whale, what's the point? All he's done is waste his life, his very soul, hunting after something that is worth nothing. All the while his wife and son are waiting for him at home, wondering if they will ever see him again. This book makes us question our goals and our desires, and to appreciate what is truly important in life. If you have never read it, you are missing something spectacular."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book was in good shape and delivered in a timely manner.Great job thank you for your service."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is a fascinating and imaginative tale and it is my favorite American novel. I must admit that some of the descriptions of whales had me cursing maledictions, but in the end I was enthralled by Melville's philosophy and metaphysics. Also, I was thrilled with the amount of symbolism that Melville used because it forced me to continually look below the surface. Believe it or not, there was also a great deal of humor in this robust book, esp. in the beginning when Ishmael meets Queequeg for the first time. Ah, there is too much to say on this one, and I do not want to give anything away, so I recommend this book to anyone with any interest. Finally, if you are looking for a love story you will not find it in this novel. There are no women on the Pequod, which is the boat the crew goes whaling on."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book is fantastic at every turn. While Ahab's hunt for the white whale dominates the book's foreground, Melville weaves in so many other rich elements along the way. I admit that two-page descriptions of dorsal fins are less than inspiring (I read the unabridged version), but such verbose scenes are few and far between. This story leaves you with numerous lessons about revenge, pride, relationships and much more. On top of this, the plot is very exciting and fast-moving. While there are some dense sections, this book is one to be treasured. I recommend this book highly--those who want to avoid the sections of minute detail material should try the abridged version instead."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This story will make you forget your troubles and I don't think anyone can read it and not be affected in a personal way. I plan on reading it every decade I am alive."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Overall, Moby Dick was a wonderful piece of literature filled with all sorts of symbolism and artful imagery. It gave a very realistic take on things since the narrator was not really bias. Also, it is an anti-transcendentalist piece so it focuses more on reality and it examines the darker side of the human condition, so if you're looking for a story with a hero and a perfect ending then I suggest you find another book. It is difficult to describe how I really felt about Moby Dick because on one hand it was a boring read with a topic that less than interested me, but on the other hand it was fine, respectable literature that has a lot to analyze and that gives you a lot to think about. It is the kind of book that when you go back and read it again you find tons of little symbols and connections that you may have missed completely the first time around. That is what I like about the book; it gives you plenty of room to interpret these things as you will. I suggest this book if you do not get bored easily because it is sometimes hard not to when Melville starts getting off-topic and talking about things like the specific steps in whale-hunting, which he often does."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Herman Melville's \\"Moby Dick\\" easily wins my vote as among the greatest American novels of the 19th Century, joining such august company as Mark Twain's \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", and Henry James' \\"The Europeans\\", among others. It's surely one of the greatest American novels of all time. Part adventure story and part memoir of the whaling industry, \\"Moby Dick\\" remains as vividly exciting and relentless in its pacing as I remembered reading it years ago in Frank McCourt's Stuyvesant High School creative writing course. Perhaps it's no wonder that the novel is quoted by Captain Jean-Luc Picard in the film \\"Star Trek: First Contact\\", as a commentary on his anger towards the Borg, which seems quite akin to Captain Ahab's towards the whale Moby Dick. It was well worth waiting over twenty five years to read this splendid novel again."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"And totally worth the effort I put into it.

It's like reading someone's journal. There are many positive values that can be derived from the story. It's pretty hard to find the values. Their location, I could say implicit. You have to think about it and even maybe you have to learn them carefully.This book I recommend to everyone to read because I think this book is suitable for youngsters and also for adults. For those youngsters, you guys have to be patient during the reading because this book is somewhat heavy for us.

I had no sympathy for Ahab until the end chase. He is not really developed till almost the very end.

To fully appreciate it might require several readings."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book had a profound effect on me. The encyclopedia chapters about whales and whaling contained a lot of symbolism, and often ended with very sharp and interesting insights into the human condition. The story had many levels to it.

How dissapointed was I when I finished reading this book.First of all, Melville just loves to start discussing whales and sea and then somehow jump to an absolutely irrelevant subject, such as ponds and paintings. Secondly, if you are looking for adventure and suspense there may be some. However, what little there is of it, it is killed off by the very boring narration.I thought there were some good points. It had strong symbolism, quite a good description of the life at the time and the life of the sailors.

I would really rate it at 3.5 stars and in reading the other reviews posted, I also note that it is certainly not a book for every one. The book is heavily segmented in short, bursty chapters that shift from one subject to another like a worn out party drunk who can't finish a thought or make a continuous series of points. The story really doesn't flow as it is constantly interrupted by Melville's soliloquies on history, art, culture, and philosophy. However, there is a mosaic effect to the work that is only gained in retrospect, which is actually quite impressive. Overall, the book is definitely worth reading, but expect to either appreciate it after you've read it or not to like it at all."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Bill Bailey makes this audio cassette version come alive.

This is not one of those sorts of classics. This book is a classic because it is a classic, not because it is any good. Oh, I suppose if one could get past the fact that it was written by a man being paid by the inch, you would find a story/allegory buried somewhere inside. But you would have to be extremely patient, enjoy torturing yourself, or just want to be able to say that you've read it in order to get there. It pains me to think of all the good books which were probably written around the same time which have faded into obscurity, while this dreck has become a classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I am not a literary genius by any means. I don't have the great eye for art. But I'm smart enough to not be talked into believing something is great because someone tells me it is.Someone telling you an ugly old painting is great art because it &quot;flows&quot; or because the person who painted it was famous should not convince you to like it if you think its ugly.This applies to Moby Dick as well. I read the book, I understood the symbolism, I studied what people thought about it and how it was written and gave every attempt to like the work. I could not bring myself to like it because of one important thing. Moby Dick is boring. A great work of literature should share symbolism and teach us something and use great language, but it should also keep us entertained enough to finish it.

I suppose that it is to be lauded for having taken so much effort to build characters that could be believed. At the same time, Melville made everyone either black or white. Good or evil. Pretty simplistic. Even the driven Captain Ahab only sees the whale as being an evil creature that must be destroyed for the sake of his own vengeance.At first, I simply wrote it off as being a product of the times. However, now that I am rereading The Count of Monte Cristo, I am reminded that there were some really good novels written at the time that do not make you sorry to read them. Put into context with other great American works, I just can't see how this one made the list."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A friend told me that \\"Moby Dick\\" is really a two part book and I now know that to be true. Much of the book is a detailed explanation of whaling of the anatomy of whales.A segment of the book, mostly at the end, is the true novel. The novel portion of the book is in the nature of an adventure story, along the theme of man vs. nature. Ahab, the obsessed whaling captain chasing after Moby Dick to the exclusion of his commercial duties to the ship owner and the crew is matched against the powers of the great White Whale. I will not spoil it for you, but suffice it to say that, if you have an interest in whales or whaling or nature novels you will enjoy \\"Moby Dick\\".I started reading \\"Moby Dick\\" after reading Jacques Cousteau's \\"Whales\\" (see may Amazon review) in preparation for a vacation which included a whale watch. Cousteau's many quotes of Melville drove me to seek their source. For this I was satisfied. I do not consider \\"Moby Dick\\" to be a great novel. The character development, save that of Ahab's obsession, is shallow to non-existant. The action scenes do grip your attention. Toward its end this is a book that you will not want to put down. There are some interesting \\"time capsules\\" in its pages, such as the repeated references to whales as fish, a misnomer thoroughly dispelled at modern marine parks. A reminder that \\"Moby Dick\\" was written in 1851 is the warning to a Negro crewman: \\"I won't pick you up if you jump...We can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama\\"Overall I give \\"Moby Dick\\" a moderate recommendation."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I have not read this book, but I heard the first instalment on BBC Radio 4, and wow!.

Authors do not write in this fashion any more and our literary experiences are the worse for it. The narratives are colorful and richly descriptive. It is amazing to see some of the speech patterns and descriptions that were in use during the time period that I never would have thought would be used. One has a detailed narrative given in the story and the immagination is encouraged to build, if you will, the environment within the depths of the mind, picturing the quaint towns of seafaring folk; of a cannibal tattooed and speaking pidgen-english; of the salt-spray of the waters and pitching deck of a small (by today's standards) whaling boat; and the terror of the deep -- the great white whale.Moby Dick; the Great White Whale is well worth the time to read it. I encourage you to go a-whalin' with Melville today."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I did not enjoy reading Moby Dick. Actually, I enjoyed the beginning, right up until the introduction of Ahab. At this point it was an exciting adventure story with a very interesting sea captain, Ahab, who selfishly put his personal agenda ahead of his crew. I liked the torment and allegories that Ahab's character represented. He was both inspirational and obsessive. The white whale, Moby Dick, took his leg and now the godly sea creature needed to be punished and nothing was going to stop Ahab from carrying out his revenge - even if it was to the detriment of his crew. Then it changed from an intiguing story into a detailed lesson on whaling, on the anatomy of the whale and on any conceivable tribute to whaling that could possibly be imagined. It was here that I felt lost at sea and hoping to be consumed by the whale. The very detail explored was great, and written with a fanatical clarity and depth that can not be questioned. But it was not for me. I tried really hard to enjoy it, but it did not eventuate until the last page when i was glad it was over. If the history lessons were not so long and tedious and if they did not overshadow the heart of the story then my rating would have been higher."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"\\"Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul...\\" I read Moby Dick, and if you haven't yet, well I say give it a try."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"its Moby Dick....what more needs to be said, i am trying to read the classics i missed in my youth, this is an excellent way to do it, melville is not even close to a favorite, so i am glad i didnt pay for it and it was nice that Kindle has these for free."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"\\"From hell's heart, I stab at thee!\\" Maybe the best line in any book ever...This book is pretty fantastic in many ways. The characters are good, and the story is an interesting one. And I can hardly imagine more descriptive narrative regarding the whaling days of Nantucket. In fact, that is also the worst part - Melville can be a bit boring when goes to lengths about this set of sails or masts or whatever. But if you stick with it, you can pretty much picture a whaling vessel at work, which is quite an achievement. It's a piece of history preserved largely by this one man.So the story suffers a bit when he goes off on multiple chapters about the ship details, but it remains a good story. And Ahab is a fascinating character - he is surely crazy but in many ways also pretty inspiring. He is the quintessential man that won't give up..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It starts off as a story. Then you learn that the globe was charted by whaling ships, because there were more of them than explorers. There were some good moments when he looked at jonah and the whale, his method stirring up the crew into a frenzy about moby dick and the final battle with moby dick.The rest reads like an encyclopedia on the working and running of a whaling ship, its crew and dissection of the whale. A diagram would have been nice and some spacing between paragraphs.If this book was released today for the first time, it would not sell well at all."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Note this edition only contains Moby Dick, not Redburn or White-Jacket as might be implied by the product description (and are included along with Moby Dick in the LOA's hardback edition).This is a very nice printing of Moby Dick from the Library of America Classic Paperback series (July 2010). Hence my 5-star rating. However, my copy came with a damaged front cover."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I own a half dozen print versions of Moby Dick, but I've never read one. It always seemed just too deep. I even took this version out of the library more than once, and returned it un-listened-to. I am eternally grateful that I finally forced myself to listen to it. It is devestatingly great, and this version is spoken beautifully. I have to admit that while listening to it I was transported onto a whaling ship on the ocean... and I did not want to come back to the reality of the here and now. The language is verbosely flowery and chock-full of references and descriptions, and allusions, and detail. Melville is a writer's writer, and you will not find such language elsewhere. A few notes on the story that struck me: almost every chapter has a title that alludes to what is in it, and the chapters are many and short. So, if you want to read the part about the whale's skeleton, just look for it. If you want to read about the blubber, just look for it. This is cool and very satisfying. Also, almost every chapter ends with a cute or thoughtful quip or comment or joke; this is also cool and lightens the serious tone. New readers may be amazed to find that the famous white whale of the title does not actually show up until the last hour of a 21 hour read. Although this is disappointing, it tells us that the story is NOT about confronting the whale. The story is ABOUT men, and men thinking about stuff. The confrontation with the whale is brutish, nasty, and short ( similar to Hobbe's famous quote about life ). If you think about it from another perspective, from the whale's point-of-view, the confrontation with MAN is hardly a blip on his radar; not something to think on for 21 hours. I also notice some deviations from my memory of the famous Huston film. In the book, Moby Dick tries to separate Ahab from his men to kill him. The ship intervenes. Moby Dick tries again, and again the ship intervenes. So Moby Dick kills the ship, then kills Ahab, then swims away. Not much else is said at that point. As if the whale has to get rid of a flea, and does. The description of the confrontation is great, and different from any I remember seeing. Moby Dick swims upside-down through Ahab's whaleboat, splitting it in two with his mouth. Moby Dick then swims in a circle, trapping Ahab in the center of a whirlpool. The dreaded, special harpoon Ahab had made is worthless, and does not hinder the whale. The idea of all the ropes and harpoons being dragged by the whale slows him down is good. I remember from the Huston film that the end showed Ahab wrapped in ropes trapped on the body of the whale. This is not in the book. Another man is trapped in pieces on the whale's body. Ahab is standing in his boat when a loop of hemp catches him around the neck and he is pulled out of the boat. That's it. This book and audio reading affected me greatly and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is the third time reading Moby Dick, an important part of American literature.

I recently read The Art of Fielding, which features a Melville loving college professor who thinks this is the greatest book ever written, -so I was inspired to re-read it. Definitely not the best book ever written.The story itself is great, and the characters (Ishmael, Ahab...) are classics, but you've got to wade through hundreds of pages of minutia on the history of whaling and everything you always wanted to know about whales, but were afraid to ask, all of which is quite tiresome. I would definitely recommend the abridged edition if you decide to read this one again."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"No doubt this is a classic--and one I've tried several times before and just could not finish. I understand why Melville had to write about whales and whaling as he did; it was a different era, but it was tedious. HOWEVER, there were passages that made me gasp with delight. Sometimes I wondered how any mortal could use our language in such sublime fashion, and as I looked for these passages, I knew I would finish the book this time. One example that immediately comes to mind is his description of pitchpoling. Was it worth the effort? Absolutely. Now I'd like to edit it for the modern reader and preserve that in which I felt such incredible joy."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"While some of the passages are rather hard to get through as they go into excruciating detail about the ship on the sea, the men on the ship on the sea, the ropes on the ship on the sea with the men, the mooring-clips the ropes are attached to on the ship by the men in the sea...

Lee"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick...I finally finished it! (one grueling month later). But seriously it was totally worth it. This is a fantastic story about revenge, the follies of man, and the inevitable shadow of fate. The only downside to this novel is Melville's extreme use of confusing diction. Sometimes adding twenty adjectives to a simple sentence or over describing an unembellished setting makes it arduous to follow. But the incredible story makes up for this measly flaw.The story touches greatly on symbolism and imagery that enhances the novel's purpose. For example, Captain Ahab's ship, The Pequod, represents doom. The ship's name even comes from a Native American tribe that vanished off the face of the earth after being attacked by white settlers. The ship is also decorated with objects relating to death; which include whale bones and teeth. Not to mention the boat's painted with a dark black.As acknowledged before, the diction in this book is more than prevalent; which sets the foundation for excellent imagery. The description of Father Mable when Ishmael listens to his sermon in New Bedford to the final pages of the climatical battle of Moby Dick conjures a movie inside your head. Everything seems real and looks as if it's happening in front of your eyes. Herman Melville entices the reader with his exquisite form of imagery.This book offers something for everyone. Whether its the incredible story for those enjoyable raconteurs or the author's unique style for the literature fanatics. Moby Dick is a novel that will last for centuries to com and will never lose its literary merit."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Finishing this book is an accomplishment. It's more than the length. Reading it is a commitment and I feel a certain intellectual and snobbish satisfaction at making it to the end.I wasn't sure what to expect from Moby Dick. I didn't know much: its famous first line, that captain Ahab was obsessed in his quest to catch Moby Dick. I'd been warned that the whale only appears in the last few chapters. Otherwise, I was going in completely blind.Getting through this book feels like hunting the whale. There are peaks of action and long stretches of seeming calm in-between that focus on minutae about whales and whaling. I don't know if any of Melville's facts are true. I didn't bother to check, because ultimately, that wasn't the point.My experience. I'd started the book once and quit. Started it again and got further. But, after a few entertaining opening chapters, things started to look bad (= get boring) and I thought I would quit. I cursed this book on a daily basis. I was bored. I was confused. I had to look up way too many words related to parts of boats (gunwale) or antiquated English.But, somewhere after the chapters providing a lengthy descriptions of every type of known whale (I can't confirm if it presents precise information or not), I got into the experience of reading this book and hungered for it. I got excited when the Pequod encountered another ship. I pained for poor Pip who lost it after being left in the sea a little too long. Queequeg was a favorite. REally, everyone was. Even Ahab was fascinating.The book is experimental and innovative. It isn't a book to read for plot or character development. I think it's the sort of book you can find what you want to in its pages: metaphors for religion, the meaning of life, etc. It isn't an easy text. It requires work to slough through it. But, ultimately, it pays off. Even the seemingly boring bits (though I guess I didn't find them so boring as the more I read, the more interested I became) help make the drama of the final chapters that much more exciting.I won't reveal the ending, but it is abrupt. I was sad when I realized that I had reached the epilogue. But that is beside the point.At any rate, I wouldn't recommend Moby Dick to anyone. It's a particular book that will speak to a sophisticated reader who is looking for a book that looks at deeper questions in an indirect way. The reader must be willing to shift gears with Melville's changing approaches. Finally, it is best for someone who isn't put off by confusion and lack of clarity, who can be patient and wait for a payoff."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I was alway led to believe that this American classic was very boring, but I did not find it so. I thoroughly enjoy it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I am so grateful that &quot;Moby Dick&quot; was required reading in a college English class of mine. I'm not savvy enough to describe it like a book critic, so let's just say that it is AWESOME. I felt like I had read a work of art from a person inspired by God. However, and this is a big however, I would have to admit that if I had not read it in college then I don't know if I would have had the stamina to work through the book on my own. I've given up on a couple of Faulkner books. Present day life has too many distractions, and one must immerse oneself completely in &quot;Moby Dick.&quot; If you can do it, then believe me you will definitely see that it is worth it and you will have the satisfaction of knowing that you read one of the greatest novels ever."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Well, so I had to read (in English, a foreing language for me!) a book which lasted for more than eight hundred pages. Slightly scary, I may say, especially when the average number of books this year were 13. Well, indeed some parts of the novel are simply delightful. Any reference to the cultural clash with Queequeg, or any description of the landscape, the sea, the people, were delightful. And then, in the middle -yes, encyclopaedia entries. &quot;It's a bit misleading,Mr. Melville, what the h. do you want?&quot;. Until I had to revise it for an essay. The thing is, take all that &quot;flat passages&quot; again. Think of the Pequod's fate. Does it ring a bell? Ishmael, as a Cassandra, spents half the book prophetizing what will happen, and nobody seems to listen. When you read it twice, Moby Dick is simply one of the best metaphors of life. If only it weren't so tiresome..."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Probably anyone who picks up this book already knows the story of the whalers against the whale, driven by Captain Ahab's obsession with killing Moby Dick. But there's a lot more in this book besides: it's a treatise on whales and whaling, it's a novel about friendship, and it gives you all the excitement of an adventure story. In some ways Moby Dick is very much a nineteenth century novel along the lines of the work of Jules Verne--it is full of lengthy asides intended to instruct the reader. Although this tendency slows the pace, it makes Moby Dick a more substantial novel than it would otherwise be, and worthy of its status as a classic."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"First I have to say that Moby Dick is probably easier to get into if you occasionally like to read poetry. Otherwise it's a challenge for the average reader like myself, and a challenge that I personally found worthwhile. It's not the &quot;light read&quot; to take to the beach for summer vacation. There is a flow to the writing that is an essential part of drawing the reader into the story, similar to Shakespeare. The plot is exciting without it, but the writing is what raises this story to a classic. Captain Ahab (our hero?) is a man whose personality and fate have been twisted from a comfortable course as a successful whaler. When we meet him, he is well on his way to turning from an intelligent, logical captain and family man into a driven hunter. As we read, we notice the remains of what was a simple love story: A man of strong senses and the passions of an artist; in love, as he knows it, with whaling. Instead of a life of turbulence, which would seem more to fit his intense, sensitive nature, Ahab is a respected whaler with a deep and quiet love for the ever-changing sea living a lonely but content life providing for a rarely seen family. We watch his submersed passion turn from a sense of joy in pitting himself against the giants of the deep, to a slow, consuming hatred of one whale--Moby Dick. Moby Dick is the great white whale who took Ahab's leg and left him with eternal physical pain. Where this physical pain began, so through the story Ahab's emotions follow. Moby Dick changes Ahab's submerged passion from gentle love and appreciation to intense hate. Ahab has been betrayed. He has been hurt. In his contorted mind, his pain can only be removed by the death of Moby Dick. We came on a game, a hunt. Now the hunt is everything and death is the only end. In the telling of this tragic adventure, we are swept into the picture. We feel the vastness of the deep ocean, the power and beauty of nature, the awesome strength of the whale, the fury of the storm, the boredom of endless hours of waiting, and the exhilaration of the battle of man against nature. We become one with, now, the man, now, the whale. Words disappear behind feelings. And we feel it all. &quot;Moby Dick&quot; takes us on a splendid trip to a time and a place and a state of mind. This book can entertain the readers who like &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and enchant those who enjoy Phyllis Whitney. For those not into long sentences and rhythm, it may be more work than fun to get started, but I don't believe anyone could stick with the book to the end without growing as a reader and ultimately liking the book a great deal."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby-Dick is the best book ever written, only excepting All The King's Men by Robert Penn Warren. All of the allusions and metaphors and meanings in this awesome book could only be found by spending a lifetime on it. &quot;Moby-Dick and Taoism&quot;? Get a life! Melville was not &quot;warning&quot; us about anything except the danger of maniacal pride. The whole point of the book is that Ahab doesn't give a blankety-blank about Taoism or any other philosophy that would tell him to lay off the whale; he hates the whale and he has willingly, deliberately submerged and sacrificed his reason and his soul to kill the white whale, and at times he even meditates on the madness of pursuing a dumb animal for an injury it no doubt was not even conscious of -- and then rejects this argument because of the insult to his pride offered by Moby-Dick's very unconsciousness.The stylism in Moby-Dick has never been surpassed; the rainbowing, extravagant images -- of the blank, mind-banishing terror of the color white, of the seductiveness of the dreamy reflective nature of the ocean from the crows-nest, of tired old Ahab throwing his pipe into the ocean, rejecting all comfort forever -- are breathtakingly striking and unforgettable"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"While reading this book- you feel it is just itAltough not poetry- you sense that every wordis just right, and cannot be taken out.You are consumed by the book , and your soul gets embedded in the world created by it"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A suberb, atmospheric book of biblical proportions. It is a journey through Melvilles obsession, as well as Ahabs, and presents a robust and romantic metaphor on oligarchy and the power and influence that psychopaths in charge exert over their crew or army. Fury like Ahabs has an almost indominatable force. Men like this have lead many unwilling accomplices to their graves. If it was't a whale it would have been something else, a mountain, a country, possesion, endless wealth, the lust to usurp and dominate.I loved Melvilles rambling passages about whales."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"We should dispense with the Great American Novel business that usually clouds the real issue about the literary value of this book, along with others like Twain's &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;. Moby Dick is a difficult book: difficul because, like America, it tries to make sense of many things all at once. We're confronted by Ishmael, the philosopher struck by wanderlust; Queequeg,the highly-civilized savage; Ahab, the American Faustus; Starbuck, the moralist who is torn by a temptation to blow Ahab's brains out with a musket and the desire to turn him away from his revenge plot; and finally, the silent yet pervasive character after whom the book is named, the White Whale himself, who seems to be some sort of deity whose motivations are unfathomable, like the depths he inhabits. It is next to impossible to find a satisfactory treatment of all these characters at once. Keep in mind that these are just the main characters; we haven't even started talking about the others yet. Where should we start judging a book? By what standards? It would take a lifetime to figure out all the hidden real-life implications within the book.

It seems that Melville couldn't decide whether he wanted to write a dark, brooding novel of obsession and destruction, or rather a scientific treatise on whales and whaling. The digressions seemed interminable. I recommend future readers simply skip them; you won't miss much and some of what he says is quite wrong (e.g., whales are NOT fish). I suppose a modern editor would have cleaned that up for him and prevented the novel from suffering from its reputation of being boring (not at all deserved).

Yes, the print is small in this compact mass-market paperback but the story and themes are gigantic.This is perfect writing.

The book takes time and concentration to read but it is absorbing once you open up to it. Moby Dick may just be the greatest American novel of all time.It could be said that Herman Melville used the Pequod as an allegory for the United States. Whaling is the ultimate in capitalistic excess, as mentioned in one of this Bantam edition's appendices. Notice Melville mentions the differences between the whaling ships and the other cargo fleets on the water. Whaling ships were never hurting for oil to burn, and in fact burned it crassly. The crew was made up of diverse nationalities, all coming together in near perfect union for one common goal - whales yes, but more precisely wealth and adventure. Such a weak foundation for their brotherhood was an easy target for the demagogue Ahab, a madman whose dream is to seek vengeance and conquer pure evil. Moby Dick is scapegoated as such. The whale, content to thrive on his own does not seek the Pequod but rather, they seek it. Fedallah - that demon from within the ship (or within Ahab) - at first hidden from the crew but one who gains prominence as madness unfolds, enthralls the leader. Blind allegiance coupled with greed and bloodlust brings the Pequod to ruin despite the ominous signals to reverse course, to repent. In the end, they go down, new flag flown high.Melville takes the time to satirize and skewer the current (and recurrent) philosophies of his day, memorably the Transcendentalists (among others) in the \\"The Mast Head,\\" Chapter 35. Characters' roles ebb and flow unexpectedly. Tragic and unfortunately prophetic, perhaps needlessly so. Tragic also because books of this sort are not written in these times (if they are, I'd love to know!). The references Melville throws around will have you dashing to your dictionaries and encyclopedias and will leave you richer for having read it. Highly recommended for continuous reading and reflection."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I anticipated the arrival of the \\"Moby Dick\\" I had sent for. I had planned to use the book in a collage. We were instructed by our teacher to find a copy of a book that meant a lot to us. When \\"Moby Dick\\" arrived in the mail I looked it over, checking the pages, the cover, and the overall condition. I was so happy with the book I decided to keep it for my library instead of my original plan, which had been to take it apart and use it in the aforementioned collage. The book, which is a Modern Library publication, includes pen and ink drawings, the kind of illustrations I remember from books I had read in my youth. The type font is an easy size to read. If I were to give a copy to a young reader, I would look for one just like this one. The condition was practically perfect. The book had once been part of a small library, the name of which was printed inside the cover, lending history to the volumn.

The quality of the book is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"\\"The Whale! The Whale! Dash on, men. Dash on!\\"Moby Dick Or the Whale by Herman Melville is told through the eyes of Ishmael, a young man that becomes bored with his life and decides to go whaling. After befriending a harpooner and cannibal named Queequeg and traveling to Nantucket he finds himself on the Pequod, a whaling ship sailing around the world. Then Ishmael discovers the captain's complete obsession with killing the whale that devoured his leg. Things only get worse when the captain spots that whale and decides to risk everything to wreak his vengeance. Will Ahab's fixation with killing Moby Dick lead his crew to \\"a watery grave\\"?The book was very interesting, but the author spent much time describing topics that were unnecessary to the plot, such as whale classification. This made the reading pace very slow until the end, which had less filler. The genre was probably realistic fiction, even though some of the situations were hard to believe. The book is written in old English, so it is difficult to understand at times. I would recommend the book to kids in high school or older with a exceptional vocabulary and finds \\"classic\\" books interesting."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Most books I don't think i'd want to read twice but I'm definitely gonna read this book again because it was one of those books you gotta read twice to enjoy it thoroughly. I also could've sworn I sensed gayness in there at some point. it was a complete book, though, which i liked."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I really loved this book and I love Melville's style of writing. Ahab was the insane man bent on one thing in life - revenge. This made the story all the more intriguing as Ahab went closer and closer to the edge as he led the Pequod onward to Moby-Dick. Thar she blows! If you liked this book too, I recommend also Billy Budd, Sailor."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This was indeed the best book I've ever read. It gave interesting descriptions of savage native life and of life at sea during the time. Ahab was a perfect portrayal of a man blinded by revenge. He will go to any price to get it, and the price he pays...well, that would reveal the ending. Bildad was the religious old man most people think of when they think of the times. Peleg was the swearing contradiction of Bildad. I definitely think you should read this book. It was very interesting and fun to read."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book represents a microcosm of society, artfully done byMelville. He takes time to develop the characters, wonderful.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown Eyed Boy&quot;"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Several times during my life I picked up Moby Dick, anxious to see why it is held in such high regard. The first two or three times I was unable to finish the book. It didn't interest me enough at the time, due largely to my own ignorance it would seem. Some of you may have had a similar experience.Two years ago, as a middle aged adult, I read the entire book. My viewpoint was different; I had a greater appreciation of what I was reading. Now, I am almost through reading it again. I am not the most well read individual, but I have sampled a fair share of the classics. This book, in my opinion, is the greatest work ever written by an American. It will probably never be surpassed. It is one of only a handful of books that can stand toe to toe with anything written by Shakespeare.When I approached Moby Dick the first few times, I did so as I would any other novel. But Moby Dick isn't like any other novel; it's epic poetry - and much more. Melville uses a whaling voyage as the vehicle to explore almost every theme you can imagine. His insights and commentary on human nature are timeless, which is why he is a master. This is a book you can return to every other year. The more time you spend with Moby Dick the deeper truths it reveals.As an aside, I recommend the Modern Library version since it includes the wonderful illustrations by Rockwell Kent. Also, try reading a chapter or two a day. It may take 2-3 months to finish the entire book, but that is good. Think about what Melville is telling you."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Well, not really stupid but i just didn't have whatever it took to appreciate this novel. I tried to slog through it back then and I don't even recall if I actually made it; I certainly didn't remember any of it. But I just read it again for what felt like the first time and wow...This book has more passages worth quoting on a variety of subjects than anything I have ever read. It's a wonderful story about whaling and about human nature. It brings alive an extremely important part of American history and the spirit that made this country what it is. I used to be amused that it was considered a \\"great American Novel.\\" I thought a great novel was something like \\"Coma\\" or \\"Timeline.\\" : ButI suspect that for other than the really intelligent and perceptive (of which I certainly was not as a youngster) the scope and feeling of this book may not be apparent until one has quite a few years under his/her belt.An absolutely glorious work."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"What more can be said about this novel that defies any attempt to categorize or name the narrative? Melville's excruciating and almost treatise-like fixation with detail must be torture for the millions of high school students who are forced to read it, but for those who persist the beauty of the language and symbolism must surely create many lifelong fans of great literature. The reader discovers many many symbolic twists from the mystery of Queequeg's tattoos, which are discovered late in the novel that even he cannot decipher to the hieroglyph like wrinkles on the white whale's forehead. Ishmael is a bit player looking into the inscrutable maw of destiny, into the face of god. He is reborn from the whirlpool into which his shipmates disappeared, brought to the surface by a great bubble to survive by a coffin (qua lifebuoy) and this too is fate.All the men aboard the Pequod, save Starbuck, seem to accept Ahab's madness and their watery fate and thus madness becomes king and death the only out. Starbuck has the opportunity to murder Ahab and save the crew but like Hamlet cannot bring himself to do it. Is this religious-based morality then not the greater madness? Sustained by Melville's amazing prose (and a few devices clearly ripped off from Shakespeare), one travels with the Pequod herself and ponders such issues for 600 pages in which the world is turned upside down and evil seems destined to triumph. But then what is evil? There is no firm footing and we're left having to balance like Queequeg on the spinning carcass of a whale. Amazing work."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Among my friends and most of the people with whom I've spoken, this book has one of the worst reputations of any of the many classic novels. This book is well-known by virtually everyone; however, almost no one reads it, and many who have wish that they hadn't. This is the case for a number of reasons: the book is often marketed as an adventure novel, and it is often forced upon young readers who are much too young to understand the novel, much less remotely appreciate it. Despite the fact that it is seen as an adventure novel, it serves almost as an inverted adventure. The novel primarily consists of philosophical musings, with the whale serving as more of an abstraction than the subject of an adventure quest. The discrepancy between the expectations and the actual book leaves many readers to be unprepared for the experience of reading the book. The book is often taught to high school students and children in some cases. However, in most cases, it should only be read at college age or above.This all likely makes the book sound intimidating and unfun; however, there is much to be enjoyed about the book. The humor of the book is often very underrated: Ishmel (if that is his actual name) is a particularly witty narrator who often finds himself in many absurd situations. For one thing, he is a terrible whaler, as he is more given to philosophical musing than the physical components of whaling. The novel often comes across as a parody of the propensities of the American romantic literature that was popular at the time. The most incredible feature of the novel is the extent to which it is ahead of its time. Moby Dick is certainly a precursor to modernist novels. The novel is particularly protean in form, just as Ulysses would be later. The style often shifts from that of a typical first-person narrative to that of a Shakespearian play to that of an encyclopedia. Moby Dick was heavily derided at the time of its publication for this reason. This book is best compared with those of later writers like James Joyce and Joseph Conrad rather than the works of Melville's contemporaries. Moby Dick proves to be a very rewarding reading experience for those who stick with the novel at an age at which it can be appreciated."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Finally. I finished reading this book last night. It's not so daunting a task if one reads only several chapters a day, for no more than an hour at a time. The voice the author chooses to use throughout is quite different from anything else I've encountered. It's not Shakespearean; it's Melvillian. The story is majestic, sonorous, tragic, and well worth your time to read. You will not be disappointed. But do read it from a BOOK, not some electronic gadget or audio recording. The edition I read was the volume in the \\"Great Books of the Western World\\", published by Britannica."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is one of those books I have always known about, the more I read, the more the novel was referenced. It was one of those books on the list of *things to read before I die* but it wasn't until it was on the bargain-shelf of the local bookstore.The cashier asked me if I was a masochist as I checked out. This determined me if anything else.Melville does a fantastic job of creating a terrifying, awe inspiring, and sometimes oppressive atmosphere. I was afraid the book would come across as dated, instead it transports you into an immortal journey.The book is incredible, Melville makes even the mundane day-to-day dealings of the whaling ship poetry and foreshadowing as you follow Ahab's Madness along with the crew of the Pequod to the corners of the Earth, before finally being dragged to a watery grave.It is a long, metaphorical epic. Poetic and beautiful. It is going to take you some time to get through it, but it is worth it. I found myself underlining passages in the book - which is something I rarely do, but some of the prose almost demands it."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"After completing Moby-Dick for the first time I was surprised about its contents. For the most part it is an academic cetology text. The body of the novel prepared the reader for the final fight with the white whale, the white whale who did not appear until chapter 133, page 625 out of 701 pages; 87% of the book completed.The quest is the reader's as much as Ahab's, getting through the primer for the eventual confrontation. The major portion of the book only hinted at Ahab's presence beneath the deck, and Moby-Dicks' presence somewhere beneath the seven seas. By the time Ahab became present in the novel- having the blacksmith forge his special harpoon, affixing a sturdy ivory limb on his stump, and finally receiving notice that his prey was nigh-, the reader had digested the nature of the fighting boats, the characteristics of the sperm whale, and the dangers of the fight. Both were ready for the story to begin.Thus Moby-Dick was as much about the reader as the literature. The quest to master the lexicon of whaling boats, the quest to match Ahab's obsession with his own desire for completion, a persistence through the incidental sidebars in order to conquer a masterpiece of literature.After all is said and done Moby-Dick is about whaling, plain and simple.Ishmael, himself, warns not to allegorize the tale. It is what it is. Leave the Biblical references for those who wish to see the moral judgments of the Lord. Leave the Nineteenth Century language, and the changes in narrator and form to the students of literature. Leave the fires in the on-board oil ovens for those who need a hell in which to place Ahab' mania, and leave the (partially) white whale to those who need purity, virtue, or innocence.But let we readers enjoy the story of an intense whale-hunt written in unending captivating prose, poetic images, and a grandiose style that allows one to grasp what one needs to grasp within Moby-Dicks' detail and scope."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This is a book unlike any other i've ever encountered. To say its a classic is an understatement. It's a shame that it's forced on high-school kids and that they think it isn't any good. In reality, it's a brilliant piece of artwork. All of the characters, the settings, the conflict, it's all real and alive. The story is about a whaling boat named the Pequod that is set on a course of vengeance by a man named Captain Ahab. He desires to kill the white whale that bit off his leg a while earlier. It's this mad quest for revenge that serves as the story, but that isn't the only thing happening, not by a longshot. Melville uses his vast knowledge of whaling to explore all sorts of philosophy, morality, and pure poetry. His writing style is utterly beautiful. Some people complain about the middle portion being nothing but a textbook on whaling. It seems that way, but at the same time, Melville is showing the reader what must be done in order to capture a whale. And within that frame, he also explores themes such as man vs nature, man vs god, and many more. How this book came to him is beyond me. If you are willing, you must experience this novel because my words can't justly explain it. But if you are put off by the length or the middle or for any other reason, you will likely be disappointed. With respect to Huckleberry Finn, THE American novel is here and nowhere else."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Wow! Every aspiring writer should give this a read...or then again maybe they shouldn't since it may be too depressing to read something this good. Like Joseph Conrad's works, Lord Jim and Heart of Darkness, Moby-Dick is somewhat autobiographical, at least in the sense that Melville took to the high seas in a whaling boat in the middle of his life, prior to writing this. As a high schooler I found this book terribly boring, but now I mainly see it as amazingly well written. Kids probably shouldn't be forced to read classic literature because they generally don't appreciate it. In a sense, the whole novel is one long buildup to the final devastating scene, and perhaps there's some Freudian or other indirect psychological meaning to that layout of the story, but you'll have to find an expert for the correct interpretation. Apparently, Melville wasn't particularly commerically successful in his lifetime, partly because he was unconventional in style and wouldn't crank out mindless rubbish. Billy Budd is also certainly worth reading again. In summary, Moby-Dick should be required reading for every adult! Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick has had a reputation for being an American classic, and this notion has long received both ire and support from everyone from literary enthusiasts to the casual reader. While the novel is a \\"monster\\" to get through in certain regards, and while it has its imperfections, there are many instances and elements that make this a great work of literature. If for nothing but just the sheer depth of Melville's work, it should be highly merited. While not flawless by any means, Melville still captures the essence of revenge in one man, creating a microcosm of a world onboard the Pequod, and examines the conflict of man versus nature on a small and grand scale. There is also an air of ambiguity within many parts of the narration that seem to correlate with the book's mysterious tone, as Ishmael at times disappears and gives way to an unknown narrator.There are many subtleties scattered throughout, as well as paradoxes and parallels, which give credence to the book's depth. Consider the story of Jonah and the whale in the early part of the story--during Father Mapple's sermon--in which Jonah learns to repent from his mistake. He seemingly is the antithesis of an Ahab, who illustrates that while he does think on a complex level, is immovable. Ahab seems to be equated with the tragic hero who has lost his sense of reason, and is only narrow-minded in that his ultimate goal is the only means to an end.If there is a larger contrast from Ahab to another character in the book, it is in the form of one of the ship mates, Starbuck, who is the only voice to oppose Ahab's journey. When Starbuck suggests that killing a \\"simple brute\\" of a whale out of sheer malice and retribution would be foolish and against the laws of nature and God, Ahab retorts, \\"I will wreak that hate upon him. Do not talk to me of blasphemy, man; I'd strike the sun if it insulted me.\\" Although Starbuck confronts Ahab, and serves to be his character foil for the entire duration of the novel, he continues to fill his required duty for Ahab, and thus keeps the fated exodus in motion. At one point, the fate of the Pequod is set in stone during a ritualistic ceremony in which Ahab gets a \\"nervous\\" crew to drink from a flagon and cross lances as a means of affirming their goal.While many onboard may not have agreed with the plans of Ahab, there is almost a sense that all was \\"meant to be\\", that fate was unalterable when it came to boarding the Pequod: \\"Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge.\\" Perhaps the inevitability of fate is what garners the crew onboard to something bigger than they can comprehend or even agree with.Still, to say that the book exclusively is about Ahab's revenge would be to undermine the larger points that Melville seems to make about changing destiny's course and learning from others' mistakes or tragedies. Many times Ahab sees right in front of him that chance to turn back, to cease his journey. One sign comes in the form of the lost ship the Rachel, whose captain is looking for his lost son. The Rachel's captain implores Ahab to aid in the search, to help out another fellow human, but Ahab ultimately rejects humanity and seals his fate. Starbuck in the later parts of the book once again begs him to cease his maddening quest, but, alas, Ahab's vindictiveness on the whale outweighs all reason, and the chain of humanity is officially broken.Moby Dick earns its reputation as a classic because of the level in which it presents this moral about changing one's fate. It takes a very subtle form, however, and much of the book's second layers of meaning are subjective and ambiguous so we can arrive at the point ourselves. There is nothing \\"quick\\" about this novel, and perhaps for this reason, many people refuse to work at it. For what it's worth, it does have its flaws, but as one reviewer said, maybe it is a stronger book because of its apparent flaws. Make no mistake: this book takes much patience and work (the infamous \\"whaling\\" chapters come to mind). But, if you read it, I think you will have a greater appreciation for the classics."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book was a very good one.

Melville points out to us what at some repressed level we all know yet won't allow to occupy our psyche's: that our world is a dangerous and mysterious place where evil masquerades as good. Melville was so far ahead of his time on so many issues like racism, the environment and slavery that it's no wonder he died broke like other tormented visionaries like Van Gogh. Melville's style makes it a tough and challenging read, no doubt, but it all works to deliver one profound and critical message after another. A must read if there is one."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Time well spent is exactly how i would characterize a reading through of this classic work of American literature. It is inconceivable to think of any novelist today producing such a work, with its lengthy digressions on a wide range of subjects that do and do not have to do with whaling. It's equally as laughable to think that a publisher would accept it in this age. But Melville had the love of the sea and its most maginificent creatures, and the courage to write his novel to his standards, not anyone else's. And it's a cracking good sea story. The last 40 pages are thrilling and truly classic. Invest the time and mental energy to read Moby Dick; the novel will reward your efforts."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is one of my favorite works of literature. It is a book about madness and obsession and humanity, combined with a fascinating history of whaling. I do realize that many readers may not be as enthralled as I was by the long passages about whales and whaling methods that interrupt the plot - I hold a degree in marine science so I must admit that I'm a bit biased. But even if you are not so interested, I think that it's worth fighting through those chapters for the sake of the story."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Ironcially, Moby Dick is not the real star of this novel, but he (the whale) is merely used as a vehicle for Melville to describe whaling as an industry and as a way of life. The whale only manifests himself in the very end of the novel. However, Melville describes the characters and the events so expertly that one cannot help but to be intrigued by the ideas and situations outlined therein. You can almost smell the salt air. P.S. I have often heard that the one unanswered question in the book is this: Why does Captain Ahab hunt the whale, for revenge or to rid the world of a creature he believes is evil? Interesting question, a selfish act versus a selfless act. Well, as far as I could ascertain, it is clearly a story of a madman obsessed with vengeance.

Well for starters, the book is quite a task to read, but a task that should be completed by anyone who is interested in fine writing. Or even perhaps the human pysche. But of course the book is not without flaws. The main flaw being that of length. I found it extremely irritating at times the number of pages Melville would prattle on about the type of rope used by the whalers or the hardness of the steel used as the spikes for the harpoons. Another criticism I have to make is that collectivly the tale of the search for White Whale only constitutes about half of the novel. The other half taken up by seemingly trivial information on the tools of the Pequod. But if these aspects can be overlooked or perhaps even skipped, as alot of the chapters don't add to the story at all, then the final result is an extremely well written novel about the insane quest of Ahab for the White Whale in which he &quot;came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations.&quot;"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I am ejoying this book so much and am surprized that it is not more popular. I laugh out loud at least once per chapter. The chapters are short and the pace is quick.

Middlemarch doesn't come close; none of the mature Henry James novels come close; heck, not even Ulysses comes close (frankly, I'd like to see some scholar examine the influence of Moby-Dick on Ulysses--there has to be some). This book shouldn't be merely read, it must be consumed Eziekiel-style. I have never read any book that has had such a powerful influence on me. Whenever, I travel, I now carry a copy of Shakespeare, Milton, and Moby-Dick. If I were banished to an island and could take only one book with me, Moby-Dick would be my choice.

It is endlessly fascinating."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Patience is a virtue; and if patience is needed to truly appreciate Melville's Moby-Dick, then virtuous am I. I admit, there were many places in this novel where I &quot;just wanted to get through it&quot;. However, when the reader takes a step back to truly examine this work, it soon becomes an obvious masterpiece. For myself, the most interesting aspect of Melville's writing is his tendency to use Biblical characters: Ishmael, Ahab, and even the ship &quot;Rachel&quot; searching for her children. There are literally hundreds of links to their Biblical counterparts. This was most fascinating for me to discover. I challenge readers to see this novel as more than just a story, but rather, a work which calls for in-depth examination."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I was excited to order Moby Dick for a long camping trip west.My daughter had an assignment to read it over the summer, but shecan't read in the car without turning green.

Many - perhaps most - of its 135 chapters are entirely extraneous to the plot. There are long unnecessary discourses on obscure whaling practices. Minor characters are introduced at length...and then promptly forgotten. Even the main character - the narrator - fades into obscurity as the book shifts from a first-person narrative to a more omniscient perspective. Apparently, more than one contemporary reviewer of Melville thought that the author had literally gone insane while writing the book...and perhaps he did.But it's all really wonderful! Here's what I like about it: Often-brilliant prose with beautiful words, amazing extended metaphors, and vivid imagery. That's it in a nutshell. Even chapters that have nothing to do with the plot are fun to read when they're written well.We live in a modern society that is often depressingly impatient. I think it's too bad that modern readers want their books to get started, move quickly, get to the point, and be done with it already! It's weird, isn't it? We read books because we (hopefully) want to read them; they provide an interesting diversion. Why, then, are we impatient for them to be over? Why not enjoy each chapter of Moby Dick for its own sake? Weird, rambling, but brilliant, they are enjoyable, if you suspend the need for instant gratification. I think it helps that I have a two hour commute in the car every day, and listened to this as an audiobook.Oh, one other interesting side-note: The book has remarkable thoughts / insights / scientific questions about whales. One fascinating thing to think about is the visual system of whales. Whales have two eyes on either side of their enormous, massive heads. There's no way they can see directly in front of themselves... which means that means they almost definitely perceive two entirely-distinct visual fields. How are those disparate visual signals combined in the brain? How does a whale process spatial information? What a remarkable question Herman Melville posed in the 1850s!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Yes, friends, that's how it always went when my cousins and I played Moby Dick on the old farm. There were enough of us to make up a decent cast only on holidays, and there were always a couple of girl cousins who thought they should get to play with us, but since I was the oldest, we did it my way. Being the biggest also, it would have been natural for me to play the White Whale, but I was sensitive about my height and always stuck my humorless cousin Lennart with that voiceless role. And since I was the game narrator, it really WAS my job to be Ishmael, but my closest-in-age cousin Paul was jealous and likely to run to Mormor to complain that I was being bossy. So we rotated the role of Ishmael, on the condition that if anyone lost his place in the unfolding of the adventure, he'd be instantly demoted to playing Stubb or Flask, and I'd assume my destiny as the observed observer, the author of events.Ishmael is the main character in the novel, you know, the one who sets the pace and calls the tune. It's Ishmael who goes questing; Ahab's quest is just a bright projection of Ishmael's, a particularly fantastic shadow puppet on the wall of Ishmael's cave. It's mostly Ishmael to tells us what Ahab is all about, though betimes Melville lets Ahab rage in his own plenipotent Shakespearean dialect. It's Ishmael who leads us, in the reverse of Dante, to paradisal seas and proper Christian faith first, then to the purgatory of the butchery, and then the depths of hellish annihilation. If I ever had to teach a high school English class - an honor I don't aspire to - I'd tell the little blighters straight off that in any novel with a first-person narrator, that's the chap to watch. Finally, it's Ishmael who LEARNS. In his first encounter with Queequeg, he learns human relativity. Through all the pages and chapters detailing the nature of the whale and of whaling, he learns and learns, and shares his learning in his ever-bemused, ironic style. Of course, he learns eventually that HE is the sole survivor of his own quest. And don't be fooled for a moment that he hasn't learned the metaphysical truth that he set out to learn in the symbolic guise of the White Whale...Moby Dick is a book about the dread Melville felt at his increasing religious uncertainty, his fear of the infinite, and particularly of an infinite that might well be empty, that might be as void as the color white. He says as much in the key chapter 42, 'The Whiteness of the Whale': \\"...a dumb blankness, full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows -- a colorless, all-color of atheism from which we shrink...\\"But Moby Dick is also a rollickingly funny book, ripping anything it touches with its sarcasm and satire. If one chapter seems wordy, dear reader, keep your eyes open and you'll be rewarded by a side-splitter in a few pages. Melville perhaps still wrote under the illusion that he could sell profundity to the parlor readership of Victorian America; a good thing for us, since he gave us full measure of adventure, of humor, and of personal anguish all in one unforgettable book. What each reader notices as she/he reads Moby Dick will be as different as what each hiker sees while descending into the Grand Canyon. I've read it three times now, decades apart; this time, with my own metaphysical quests all logged, I found it more hilarious, more picturesque, more a grand display of virtuosic wordsmithing than I recalled. Anyone who finds Moby Dick boring isn't worth his/her hard tack biscuit."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Among the musty old Classics, this book is surprisingly entertaining. I found the sections on whaling to be fascinating. I don't understand why some consider it \\"grueling\\" or \\"hard work\\" to get through it. Don't approach it as a Classic; rather, enjoy an amazing story written by a terrific storyteller. Afterwards, ponder the profundity of what you have read.The Norton Critical Edition has the most useful footnotes for casual readers."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby-Dick is a sprawling, unwieldy yet very great novel about the obsessive pursuit of happiness and fulfillment. \\"Call me Ishmael...\\" the famous opening lines establishes the omniscient narrator for this whale of an epic. The novel is filled with remarkable characters; their composite comradery is a true achievement of writing. Melville's insistence on explicating precise technical minutia on the craft of whaling and oceanography turned off most readers when the book was initially published (these sections still turn off most who dare penetrate this tome), yet it is really these sections that allow the reader to become immersed in the world of Ahab, the deranged symbol of evil amidst the beauty and sublime grace of the sea. Melville was an undisputed master of literary style, and this masterpiece is difficult to place for the simple reason that its' incomprehensible scale defies categorization. This is a reader's book; it is a divine allegory, a conventional adventure, and a bewitching construction all at once. Not for the weak minded."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A critic of Melville likened him to a potter;but where as other writers shaped and formed their works into something aesthetically beautiful,Melville just tended to lump more and more clay on,turning out work that was so striking it lasts in the mind for an eternity.'Moby Dick' is the one story Shakespeare and the Bible missed out on;an extraordinary journey into the history of Whaling,and how obsession leads to distruction.It is indeed a book that lives with you forever and has shaped the modern novel.It also makes you feel contempt for such literary luminaries as William Golding,who attempted to capture Melvilles themes in 'The Spire' and came nowhere near!Even those I know who struggled to read this always list 'Moby Dick'in their top 5 book list. It really is a masterpiece in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I just wanted to put in my two cents here. If you are perusing these reviews under Moby Dick in an effort to see whether or not it is worth reading (which is why I personally scan these reviews) let me just say emphatically that it is. But... I would suggest that you not pick this book up lightly. It is a very stubborn work that in many ways is a precursor to the 20th century's flirtation with high literature. In many ways this book can be compared to the more stubborn works of Pynchon and Joyce in that you can read it over and over again and find an entirely new perspective in which to appreciate it every time.I picked Moby Dick up several times only to be frustrated with its seemingly antiquated cadence and structure. Luckily for myself I found a reading group a few years back that was delving into some classics and Moby Dick happened to be one of these works. It made all of the difference in the world to have a knowledgeable leader of a reading group opening up discussions after every few chapters to discuss what we had read. After undergoing this experience and finishing the book I was and still am in awe of the majesty Melville attained in these pages.Please, even if you are sure of yourself as a reader and scoff at my suggestion to use a reading group or class structure to enjoy this work, find a copy that will have a comprehensive \`readers guide' in order to cast light on some of the complex and arcane references. This will be helpful if only to note how uniquely Melville manipulates the focus of his story and the characters contained with in.Enjoy this book, and don't open its pages on a whim unless you have plenty of free time, patience, and a curiosity to uncover ideas or meanings that might not be so apparent at a first reading."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"&quot;Call me Ishmael.&quot; It's undoubtedly one of the most widely recognized opening lines of any classical novel. Unfortunately, it's also the best line in the book. This is a vast, slow-moving work in which all of the action takes place in the last twenty or so pages. Most of the rest is a more or less inaccurate description of the whaling industry and the anatomy of whales. The sea is perhaps one of the most colorful and compelling backdrops for a novel filled with tension and power, but Melville fails to communicate either of these except in rare moments. Coupled with this is his failure to fully develop what would have been some very interesting characters. One of those rare cases in which the movie was better than the book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is a great story but a poorly written novel. The story of Moby Dick is actually very interesting and contains great meaning and symbolism. The events occurring in the book have the perfect combination of truth and fiction to make the action gripping. Nearer to the end of the book you are overwhelmed with a sense of wonder and suspense as you try to guess how the book will end and are blown away by the events that occur.In Moby Dick, Herman Melville proves that he is the master of descriptive language. In some parts of the book the extremely descriptive writing is an extremely positive aspect of the book but in others it makes the book unbearable to read. During the action parts of the book this excessive description makes the book a delight to read as you can see in your mind exactly what is happening. While envisioning this some amazing images come into your mind. Like the sights in the real world that would make you stop and take another look, you feel compelled to read certain passages over and over again just to keep that image in your brain. The other up side to his description is the attachment you feel with the characters. With the simple mention of a main characters name you can picture them, hear their voice, and give an attitude to the words.The downside to all of this description is during the long down time in the book, when no action can be described in hundreds of pages. For example there is one chapter all about a man's pipe, a chapter describing a bowl of chowder and a particularly long chapter describing the masthead (top of one of the masts). These long rants about unimportant aspects of the story make up the first three quarters of the book, as Moby Dick is not even spotted until the last quarter of the book.I would not recommend reading this book unless you can find a condensed version that only contains the details important to the plot. To just pick up Moby Dick in its original version and start reading is a painful and can be an almost impossible task. Overall however the story and the theme of the story is very entertaining and meaningful."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"digital books are perfect and easy to use!

He tells sailors' stories and presents dull factual detail in a documentary way about different types of whale, ships, ropes, harpoons etc.This interrupts and overshadows the flow of the narrative such an extent that I became impatient and gave up two-thirds of the way through."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Very good book read it a million of times AMAZING!!!!!

I have read oly one third of the book, but am looking forward to read the rest."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Finishing &quot;Moby Dick&quot; goes up there with my greatest (and few) academic achievements. It was a gruelling read, but---in the end---completely worthwhile.I've been reading it for 6 months. I started over the summer, during an abroad program in Oxford, and I remember sitting outside reading when one of the professors came over, saw what I was reading, and said: &quot;It's a very strange book, isn't it?&quot;Looking back, that might be the best way to describe it. The blurb from D.H. Lawrence on the back cover agrees: Moby Dick &quot;commands a stillness in the soul, an awe...[it is] one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world.&quot;Now there are those who will say that the book's middle is unbearable---with its maddeningly detailed accounts of whaling. Part of me agrees. That was the hardest to get through. But, still, even the most dull subject offers Melville an opportunity to show off his writing chops. He's a fantastic writer---his text most resembles that of Shakespeare.And, like one Shakespeare's characters, Melville sees all the world as a stage. Consider this beautiful passage from the first chapter:&quot;Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnifient parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.&quot;The end of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; informs the rest of the book, and in doing so makes rereading it inevitable. It is telling that Moby Dick doesn't appear until page 494. It is telling, because, the majority of the book is spent in anticipation---in fact, the whole book is anticipation. It's not unlike sex, actually---delaying gratification to a point of almost sublime anguish. What comes at the book's end, then, is mental, physical, and spiritual release (as well as fufillment).The book leaves you with questions both large and small. I was actually most troubled with this question---What happened to Ishmael? No, we learn his fate at the book's end, but where was he throughout it? We all know how it starts---&quot;Call me Ishmael&quot;---and the book's first few chapters show him interacting with Queequeg and an innkeeper. But then we lose him onboard the Pequod---we never see him interact with anyone. No one ever addresses him. He seems to witness extremely private events---conferences in the Captain's quarters, conversations aboard multiple boats, and--what can only be his conjecture--the other characters' internal dialogue. Is he a phantom? What is he that he isn't? Somehow I think this question masks a much larger and more important one.Try &quot;Moby Dick.&quot; Actually, don't try it---read it. Work at it. Like lifting weights a bit heavier than you're used to, &quot;Moby Dick&quot; will strengthen your brain muscle. Don't believe those who hate it, they didn't read it. They didn't work at it. Be like Ishmael, who says: &quot;I try all things; I achieve what I can.&quot; Or, more daringly, be like Ahab, whose ambition is his curse, but whose curse propels and writes the book itself."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Last year I decided to expand my intellectual horizons by reading a series of American literary classics. Moby Dick was the first book on my list. It took me three months to finish this legendary story and, looking back on it now, I must say that it was worth every minute. To others who are considering this effort I say this: buttress your stamina and open your mind. This is not John Grisham or Tom Clancy. You will be reading high literature and you will be required to think. If you do so, Ishmael, Ahab and crew will open a window to some of mankind's most profound questions: Is it better to fight evil or promote virtue? Where is the line between honorable justice and blind vengeance? Do bad things happen because the universe is evil or just indifferent? The true pleasure to be derived from reading this book can be found by closing its pages every so often and reflecting on the questions that it will raise in your mind. A completely different experience than breezing through the latest best-seller, but much more rewarding.Be aware that Moby Dick is many types of books in one. It is part adventure story, part sermon, part history of whaling, part encyclopedia of whale anatomy, part metaphysical allegory. Expect it to change periodically as you move through it, be receptive to each part, and don't try to compartmentalize it as any one particular type of work."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Unless you are a naval historian or a Melville scholar, you probably won't have a rewarding (or even comprehensible) time with Moby-Dick at this remove unless the edition you're using comes with a good set of footnotes. Here's the skinny on the various editions currently on shelves:THESE HAVE FOOTNOTES ON THE PAGE ITSELF:* Charles Feidelson, Jr.'s annotated edition. Unquestionably the most all-around useful edition of Moby-Dick ever printed. Generous and highly useful footnotes right on the page, covering lexical, allusional, and cross-referential items. Two disadvantages: you may at times feel put upon by Feidelson's interlarded interpretations, and the thing is totally out of print. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1964. ISBN: 067260311X* The \\"Norton critical\\" edition, edited by Parker and Hayford. The edition most widely employed by scholars. Stingier with the footnotes than Feidelson, but still a good second choice. Many useful essays at the end. The layout of the text is a bit hard on the eye, though. Make sure you get the SECOND edition, from 2001. ISBN: 0393972836* The \\"Barnes and Noble Classics\\" edition. The footnotes for the most part are skimpy and confined to obscure vocabulary, not cultural and literary allusions.

This claims to be the \\"definitive text,\\" but any such claim is spurious -- cf. Hayford and Parker [v.s.] for a good discussion of why.

(This is the one included in the same volume with \\"Redburn\\" and \\"White Jacket.\\") About 9 pp. of notes at the end. Unfortunately, they're a bit skimpy. You see, they're of the \\"go get it yourself\\" kind. For example, when Melville writes, \\"send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger,\\" the footnotes -- the incidence of which is not marked in the running text -- merely says \\"Luke 16:24\\". In other words, you've got to look it up yourself. So I would characterize the footnotes as sparse and taciturn: they'll clue you in to the source, but as for the exact wording of something and its accumulated historical connotations, you've got to come up with those yourself.

Melville didn't write a typical novel in Moby Dick, even by his own standards. And reactions to the work are passionate and passionately divided, even to this day. Setting sail in this Melvillian squall is a difficult prospect, but despite my hesitations, I'm going to give it a go and say that, despite it's many technical flaws, Melville's book is the touchstone for American literature, much as Ives' music is the touchstone for American composition. Melville managed to find a voice that was distinctively \\"New World\\" and yet also universal enough to speak to the existential questions that have plagued humans since we first turned our heads to the sky to ask \\"Why\\".Some things are truly subjective....such as book reactions. The issue with Melville in general is that he is a flawed genius. Moby Dick is not a perfect book in the sense than a Henry James novel might be perfect. It's not even as tight as Dostoevsky...and he's no model of literary tightness. I think when people have trouble with Moby Dick it's because that for them, the flaws outweigh the virtues....The book is a stylistic hodgepodge, and this is probably exactly what makes it difficult for many readers. It starts out as a plain sailing yarn, much like Melville's earlier Typee or Redburn...or Richard Dana's Three Years Behind the Mast. But then it changes into a philosophical drama with many, many \\"informative\\" chapters that can at times read like a whaling primer rather than a novel. And the drama part is one part sea adventure and two parts Shakespeare....add to that a constantly changing philosophical view (God, as personified by Moby Dick and by other things, can be seen in the book as wholly good, Good but permitting evil, evil itself, good but locked in a battle with an equally powerful evil force, or finally completely indifferent to humans.)I think for people who have trouble with the book, if Melville had taken just one of these tacts the book would be much easier to read and less littered with flaws. However....for me at least....I recognize those flaws and find the power in the book despite them...and perhaps even because of them. In a sense to me, Melville was using the Pequod as a symbol for all of the human world, and his radical stylistic inclusiveness IS actually exactly to the point of the book. Everything in humanity is included in the book, as all of human endeavor is essentially an existential quest for meaning in the face of an unknowable God (at least unknowable in any normal human sense)...and we bring everything, warts and all.The character of Ahab can also be a stumbling block for readers. He is clearly monomaniacal, and for many, that singleminded desire for revenge obscures his greater humanity. The key to understanding Ahab though is to realize that he does indeed go through a change in the book. He begins as a man obsessed with revenge to the exclusion of human values....but he is also still capable of commanding love and respect from his crew. Even Starbuck, who most actively opposes Ahab, to some extent still loves the man and when given the opportunity to kill him and save the crew, Starbuck can't bring himself to do so. The tenderness in Ahab is shown in his relations to Pip, the addled cabin boy, but also peaks through briefly in the encounter with the Rachel, where Ahab almost gives into the pleas of the bereaved Captain who has lost his son to Moby Dick, and more fully in the marvelous \\"Symphony\\" chapter, where Ahab and Starbuck find a rare moment of communion in the beauty of nature and in their shared love of home and family. But despite all, Ahab can't let go of his quest to grapple with the bigger issue of good and evil that the whale has come to represent to him. It has become a compulsion with him and a fatal one.One suggestion for reading this book is to read the Shakespearean chapters aloud. Much of the nuance in the characters of Starbuck, Ahab and Stubb is lost unless you bring the language to life. Melville's language is grand and was meant to be heard out loud. Another strategy is to view the John Huston film. Though the movie is deeply flawed, hearing Gregory Peck declaim Melville's lines helps to bring the character to more vivid life.A final note on editions of this work. I have several and most of them are pretty equal in terms of the quality of the text. The Modern Library has the added benefit of Rockwell Kent's masterful woodcut illustrations. But to actually read the text I find the Bantam Mass Market edition is my favorite. The introductory note is excellent, and the book is stuffed with afterword material, including Melville's letters to Hawthorne while writing the book, contemporary press reviews of the work, and several excellent modern essays which help with understanding the greater issues behind this deeply moving and important work of American fiction."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I'm an old man. And the sea is something I know nothing about. So call me ignorant. Still, nearly 60, I just read this book for the first time and it is unquestionably the best novel I have ever read, equal to any poem or drama. I believe you have to have lived a little and maybe even tried your hand at expressing yourself artistically to really appreciate this book. I don't think it's for young people - definitely not for most teenagers, and probably not for most college-level students, unless you want to discourage them. It almost makes arthritis worth while.The latest volume of \\"Best American Poems\\" has a work by Thomas Lux, originally published in Five Points, called \\"Eyes Scooped Out and Replaced by Hot Coals\\". That is his proposed punishment for anyone who hasn't read Moby Dick by their mid-20's. While it's a clever and humerous way to make a point, this Pol Pot approach to literary education is viewed positively by many teachers and helps explain why so many people end up with a negative attitude towards a book of this stature.Just consider the sea-nario: You are weary of the everyday world, and decide to sign-on with a whaling ship to get a little therapy. The ship's captain is a madman. That right there is enough. And consider the historical significance. Moby Dick was written right around the same time that science really began to explode, and we were entering the modern period of capitalism and capitalists (our new Ahabs). For the first time in human history, there were thousands of regular working people - some of them artists - who had literally traveled the entire globe on whalers and knew many parts of it well. These same conditions, of course, soon led to the demise - or rather the replacement - of whale oil for its traditional uses. So there was really only a brief moment in time when such a book could have been written. And it was, thank god. It is no coincidence that Moby Dick, published in 1851, was probably being written by Melville at the same time Marx and Engels were writing the Communist Manifesto. Both represent a similar landmark in human history.What more can I say? I literally enjoyed every single page. I had readied myself to be bored by the cetology chapters, but wasn't in the least. And some critics note the variations in perspective and writing styles, but that didn't bother me at all - I scarcely noticed. For me, one of the personal highlights was when Melville describes the setting for the skeleton of a great sperm whale found on an island in Chapter 102, A BOWER IN THE ARSACIDES:\\"Through the lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver! --pause! --one word! -- whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver! --stay thy hand! -- but one single word with thee! Nay --the shuttle flies --the figures float from forth the loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened; and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it\\"By the way, this review is based on an old, worn copy of the book that I purchased at a sale. It's not based on any particular edition or publisher, and my review is focused exclusively on Melville's writing, not how the material is presented in print.Please give it a chance."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I own the Penguin published version of this book as well as the Kindle \\"Penguin\\" version. While MOST of Melville's \\"Leviathanic\\" work is here, there are some serious omissions and problems with the Kindle version of this publication.

There is no table of contents (This is VERY annoying in a book that begs frequent reference to various chapters, especially one already divided into 100+ chapters)4.

No, Moby Dick is a book for people who have experienced something of life, felt the painful disappointment of easy answers, smelled the fear of their own mortality and searched frantically for a solution to the puzzle of being alive. The fact that this book is often assigned to adolescents to read is a crime. It's like assigning Einstein's theory of relativity to a class of basketweavers. A little more respect, please. A person ought to be fairly well convinced they're going to die some day before reading Moby Dick - which is not to say he or she ought to be glum or fatalistic. Moby Dick is neither. It's surprisingly witty and ironic, sometimes even charming, but underneath runs a somber current that carries along with it formidable questions about what it means to be human, how we all suffer, even when we do the right things, and how a providential God can be easily confused with uncaring fate.Melville is a master of ambiguity and nuance. His characters, who seem caricatures at first, gradually reveal a depth of complexity that has had scholars hard at work for years. From Queequeeg, the agreeable savage, to Starbuck (yes, folks, the coffee shop is named after someone), whose stalwart Protestantism is put to the test, and on to Ahab, the mad, raving, conflicted Captain, and Ishmael, the clever, pliable narrator, each character reveals a depth of personality that makes you feel you know them and wins your empathy, even as their ship, the Pequod, plunges on in pursuit its unlikely objective, the destruction of a singularly vindictive whale, Moby Dick.Is Moby Dick some mad brute, an animal driven to distraction by the harassment of its predators? Or is it, as Ahab believes, an agent of the living God, bent on punishing the sinful pride of man, or worse - a mere mask behind which hides indifferent nature, spawned by the earth to reek mayhem and destruction to no apparent end? Ahab aims to find out and hijacks the loyalties of his crew in pursuit of his answer, distracting them from the official reason for their voyage, the acquisition of whale oil, an important commodity in the 1840's, setting them on a course that is sacrilege on more than one level.Melville spends a lot of time examining the ins-and-outs of the whaling business, from the outfitting of a ship, to the process of capturing whales, to the intricacies of extracting whale oil and trying it, and much more; which can be rather off-putting to the causal reader. But be forewarned: Moby Dick is not for the casual reader. This is no Huckleberry Finn or Catcher in the Rye which will reward you with an amusing story even if you're not willing to dig deeper. If you intend to skim over Moby Dick, forget it. You will find it dull and unrewarding. But if you are willing to surrender some uninterrupted hours to the reading and some time, during the process for reflection, you will have one of the richest literary experiences of your life.You will come away with a foundation of knowledge about something you probably never considered, much less cared about, how a whaling voyage in the 1840's played out, a fascinating glimpse into the trials and tribulations facing brave men bent on bringing home a vital energy source that lit homes and businesses in the years before crude oil was discovered and processed. And during the process you will be treated to Melville's philosophical musings, provoked by the processes themselves and relevant to the unfolding events, serving to underpin the thematic union of the book. And on top of it all you will get a rousing good sea story with some jaw dropping descriptive passages and a richly embroidered narrative, a ship world, peopled by an interesting cast of characters, and some food for thought that ought to stick in your teeth for some time.Yet Moby Dick is not for the half-hearted, be they adolescents who are trying to skate by with the least effort, or simply those who look to literature as a distraction from life rather a mirror of it. But for those who are willing to set sail in more challenging waters, Melville's classic will not disappoint. It will take you into a coursing jet stream, exhilerating to navigate, both spiritually and intellectually."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I first read Moby Dick; or The Whale over thirty years ago and I didn't understand it. I thought I was reading a sea adventure, like Westward Ho! or Poe's Arthur Gordon Pym. In fact, it did start out like an adventure story but after twenty chapters or so, things began to get strange. I knew I was in deep water. It was rough, it seemed disjointed, there were lengthy passages that seemed like interruptions to the story, the language was odd and difficult, and often it was just downright bizarre. I plodded through it, some of it I liked, but I believe I was glad when it ended. I knew I was missing something and I understood that it was in me! It wasn't the book; it was manifestly a great book, but I hadn't the knowledge of literature or experience to understand it.I read it again a few years later. I don't remember what I thought of it. The third time I read it, it was hilarious; parts of it made me laugh out loud! I was amazed at all the puns Melville used, and the crazy characters, and quirky dialog. The fourth or fifth reading, it was finally that adventure story I wanted in the first place. I've read Moby Dick more times than I've counted, more often than any other book. At some point I began to get the symbolism. Somewhere along the line I could see the structure. It's been funny, awesome, exciting, weird, religious, overwhelming and inspiring. It's made my hair stand on end...Now, when I get near the end I slow down. I go back and reread the chapters about killing the whale, and cutting him up, and boiling him down. Or about the right whale's head versus the sperm whale's. I want to get to The Chase but I want to put it off. I draw Queequeg with his tattoos in the oval of a dollar bill. I take a flask with Starbuck and a Decanter with Flask. Listen to The Symphony and smell The Try-Works. Stubb's Supper on The Cabin Table is a noble dish, but what is a Gam? Heads or Tails, it's a Leg and Arm. I get my Bible and read about Rachel and Jonah. Ahab would Delight in that; he's a wonderful old man. For a Doubloon he'd play King Lear! What if Shakespeare wrote The Tragedy of The Whale? Would Fedallah blind Ishmael with a harpoon, or would The Pequod weave flowers in The Virgin's hair?Now I know. To say you understand Moby Dick is a lie. It is not a plain thing, but one of the knottiest of all. No one understands it. The best you can hope to do is come to terms with it. Grapple with it. Read it and read it and study the literature around it. Melville didn't understand it. He set out to write another didactic adventure/travelogue with some satire thrown in. He needed another success like Typee or Omoo. He needed some money. He wrote for five or six months and had it nearly finished. And then things began to get strange. A fire deep inside fret his mind like some cosmic boil and came to a head bursting words on the page like splashes of burning metal. He worked with the point of red-hot harpoon and spent a year forging his curious adventure into a bloody ride to hell and back. \\"...what in the world is equal to it?\\"Moby Dick is a masterpiece of literature, the great American novel. Nothing else Melville wrote is even in the water with it, but Steinbeck can't touch it, and no giant's shoulders would let Faulkner wade near it. Melville, The pale Usher, warned the timid: \\"...don't you read it, ...it is by no means the sort of book for you. ...It is... of the horrible texture of a fabric that should be woven of ships' cables and hausers. A Polar wind blows through it, & birds of prey hover over it. Warn all gentle fastidious people from so much as peeping into the book...\\" But I say if you've never read it, read it now. If you've read it before, read it again. Think Dostoevsky, Shakespeare, Goethe, and The Bible. If you understand it, think again."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"My comments pertain to the Norton Critical Edition of Moby Dick, second edition (published 2001) ISBN 0393972836. If this review is appended to a web-page showing some budget paperback edition, please know that I am reviewing a specific edition of the novel, not just the novel itself. The ISBN above will take you to the only edition of Moby Dick you should need, the edition that (if you're going to read the book, and not just go through the pages in order) you'd do well to get ahold of.In fact, I'm not reviewing the novel at all, really. I believe Melville's book is America's greatest novel, and the closest thing to King Lear or Job that our nation has produced. Despite our ideals, our country has yet to embrace the full measure of Moby Dick's numinous democratic vision. At any rate, I want to remark that a reader really requires help to truly wrestle with all of this book's artistry and implications. I sure did, as did a class of 11th graders who tackled the book with me several years ago. The vast range of literary, historical, and artistic sources that Melville draws from, and the manner in which he works them deeply into the structure and meanings of his book, are staggering, and in the 2nd Norton Critical Edition, Moby Dick and its readers finally get the volume they always deserved.Before the publication of this edition in 2001, the best choice was Harold Beaver's over-annotated (and very agenda-driven) old Penguin edition. That's the one my class and I used years ago. The previous Norton edition (which I used to supplement Beaver) was solid in its reprinting of Melville's sources and of through-the-years scholars and critics, but it was carelessly and lightly annotated. This 2001 volume, however, is fully and richly footnoted, as most of our civilization's great works require (Paradise Lost, The Divine Comedy, Shakespeare, Homer), and all of the useful illustrations and glossaries from the older Norton edition have been retained. The text of the novel itself is the painstakingly reconstructed Northwestern-Newberry text, and the editors (Hayford and Parker) are justly renowned, even groundbreaking Melville scholars. Don't be daunted by all this: due to their hard work, this great edition allows greater pleasure and ease with Melville's tremendous book.The critical articles include almost every review from the book's initial publication, plus more recent explorations of Melville's composition of the book and also of many interpretive angles. There is also a nice selection of Melville's seafaring sources, another good article listing all the books which he drew on (including both familiar classics and obscure resources), Melville's letters from the period, numerous voices from the 19th century pre-Moby-Dick debate about Melville's stance on Christianity, and a recent discovery--a self-portrait by a South Pacific islander, a portrait that may have been Melville's source for Queequeg. That image graces this exemplary edition's cover.I rank this among the top titles of the Norton Critical Edition series, up there with their volumes on Heart of Darkness, Paradise Lost, The Jungle, Shelley, Great Expectations, Oroonoko, and the new Macbeth and Othello volumes. In short, this new edition allows us a nearly complete experience with Moby Dick, which is the best service a scholarly edition of this novel can provide, and it is the only way to really read the book. Spring for a few more bucks and get the right copy of Moby Dick."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"It's always dangerous to label a book as a &quot;masterpiece&quot;: that word seems to scare away most readers and distances everyone from the substance of the book itself. Still, I'm going to say that this is the Greatest American Novel because I really think that it is--after having read it myself.Honestly, Moby Dick IS long and looping, shooting off in random digressions as Ishmael waxes philosophical or explains a whale's anatomy or gives the ingredients for Nantucket clam chowder--and that's exactly what I love about it. This is not a neat novel: Melville refused to conform to anyone else's conventions. There is so much in Moby Dick that you can enjoy it on so many completely different levels: you can read it as a Biblical-Shakespearean-level epic tragedy, as a canonical part of 19th Century philosophy, as a gothic whaling adventure story, or almost anything else. Look at all the lowbrow humor. And I'm sorry, but Ishmael is simply one of the most likable and engaging narrators of all time.A lot of academics love Moby Dick because academics tend to have good taste in literature. But the book itself takes you about as far from academia as any book written--as Ishmael himself says, &quot;A whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.&quot; Take that advice and forget what others say about it, and just experience Moby Dick for yourself."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I have a degree in English Education, and my son in law is an English major. I thought this book dragged on and on, was loaded with tedious detail, and was a waste of time. If it had been condensed into three short chapters, it would have been much better. I finished reading it only because I am retired and it was on my \\"classics to read\\" list. When I told my son in law that I was reading it, he told me that he could not finish it, that it was awful.If you want to read a good novel, this isn't it. I would give it 0 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is not a fun book to read. The prose is old-fashioned, and that is partly what vitiates the pleasure (cf. Ivanhoe). Primarily, however, it is boring, plain and simple. There are endless digressions, and asides, and plot-sabbaticals. Very easy to put down. Undoubtedly an amazing intellectual feat to pull off (hence my five stars), but still...I'd estimate that 1% of high-schoolers assigned this book end up actually reading it. Can't blame them, either. To be fair, the last twenty pages, when Ahab and Starbuck have their final tete-a-tete, and Ahab famously snarls to his finned nemesis \\"From Hell's heart, I stab at thee!\\" do cause a frisson. And I don't regret reading the book...it's a great laurel to rest on, but I will never pick it up again. Eh, give 'er a go...if you finish it, you'll know that you're a man, not a boy."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is one of the rare novels where I think that you should go and see the movie first before reading it. The Plot of the book becomes very hard to follow with there being over 200 hundred chapters in the book(1-10 pages long)so you should go and see the movie so you can know the plot and know what is happening so when you read it you won't get lost. Herman Melvile provides incridible details almost as if it really happen. This can make some people think the book is boring but Melvile seperates the 500 page book into over 200 small easy to read chapters so when you get bored with what Melvile talks about in one chapter you can just skip the whole chapter and not miss anything big in the book. Melvile kind of makes the book long with his details but towards the end it gets really exciting and the ending is the best you will ever read. I promise."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Embellished and imbued with light yet piercing thought, and rolling in the opiate waves where all things man wants most swim fated never to be caught, you catch sight of MOBY DICK just before it disappears--a wondrous marvel, a collection of prose poems pounding out with brilliant sparks some chain of eerily, obscurely, indisputably connected (with much a symbol and a never-prior-scented smell from lands close and unexpected that will never bear a human foot) themes and necklaced on a plot that through a whirlwind to a WHIRLPOOL runs through words that flex like honey, pound like GUNS, challenging as bravely as words have ever dared the WHITENESS that all words abhor and where, no matter what a quantity of brilliance mad captain MELVILLE spends, all words and (hark, you critics!), words about words meet their END!AND it'll turn your conversations with your friends into THIS for a long time after you read it:\\"Arr! Come over here, mate. Hast seen The Whale?\\"\\"What?\\"\\"Lo--listen close, now, 'What?' is all he says! Now hear this, sailor, art thou the dust that settles in the shadow of an ape? What ears hast thou been lent by long and crude progressions of a wretched birth? Has ever man spoken more clearly than in the plain and English syllables I have cast thy way? To the pleasant and monotonous heavens I declare again: Hast seen The Whale?\\"He he he."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"An American classic? Yeah, maybe, but not a very good read; more soporific than reading Nausea or studying for the CPA exam. Too much whale talk. It is interesting to learn of the differences between baleen and right and sperm whales, but to devote a whole lengthy chapter to it? I dunno, seems a little excessive, especially when Mr. Melville integrates a lot of the scientific blabber (not blubber) about whales in the rest of the chapters as well. Was he just trying to impress us with his cetology knowledge or bore us to death with his words stiffly lined together like a harpoon slowly inserted through the brain? Maybe I missed the boat, I don't know. Supposedly the style was revolutionary at the time, more fluid and natural than some of the old dogs writing then, like Hawthorne, but it sure doesn't seem that way now. Maybe fifty years from now Kerouac will seem slow-footed. Who knows? That still doesn't change the fact that Moby Dick ranks up there as one of the most overrated novels in American literature, right up there with The Sun Also Rises in fact. Now Bartleby the Scrivener was a helluva story--concise and tight, and he didn't waste bombarding you with superfluous legal background info. My advice to you, the American reader: Read the first two and last two chapters, skip the rest. Then get Bartleby the Scrivener and enjoy. Oh yeah, when you do read the last two chapters of Moby Dick, let me know how they are, 'cause I never got to them."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"Moby Dick is the most BORING book I have ever read!

But if you have other options, turn to those. We were given a list of books in English class, and I chose to read this. After a week, I was just in page 103.

When it was my turn to select a book for us to read I chose Moby Dick simply for its status as a classic. There really is a very good tale here, but it is often buried in unneccessary and uninteresting digressions. More than anything else, this book needed some judicious editing. It would be a much better book at half the length. Melville's prose and vocabulary is challenging and filled with nautical jargon that is almost incomprehensible to anyone not familiar with sailing. Don't get me wrong, I don't object to unfamiliar words. Quite the contrary, I enjoy adding osbcure words to my vocabulary and sprinkling them in my conversation. However, when one has to look up several words per page, it does tend to interrupt the flow of the narrative.I would say the best way to experience this tale is to watch one of the film adaptations or perhaps to read the Classics Illustrated comic book adaptation, which has the distinct advantage of telling the tale in only 64 pages."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I don't know how such a book can be a classic!

Had Melville cut this book down to about 25 pages, that would be bearable. Unfortunatly, he never stopped writing, and if he were alive today, he would probably still be adding onto Moby Dick.

It was consider being one of his best books he ever wrote. Moby Dick is a book about revenge. Better yet, it is a book that shows that revenge can and most of the time will come back to haunt you. This theme of the book kind of goes back to a quote from animal farm, \\"Absolute power corrupts absolutely\\" This quote can be tide with the theme of revenge in Moby Dick. Revenge and Absolute power is an idea that never comes true. Absolute power and revenge never come true, because as soon as you think you reach them or the point that is best; it all comes crashing down. Like in animal farm, Napoleon tried to reach the point of having absolute power, but every time he thought he had it, he had to do something, or something had to happen which would keep him from reaching it. An example would be that he had to keep wrecking the windmill to keep that animals busy, so they would not question him. Another example is that even though Napoleon had the dogs, someone, or in this case an animal, had seen, heard or thought something that they did not like or were curious about, dealing with Napoleon.

I finished it more of a sense of not wanting to leave anything undone.One of the first reviews (by Henry F. Chorley) of the book puts it very succinctly:\\"This is an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact. The idea of a connected and collected story has obviously visited and abandoned its writer again and again in the course of composition. The style of his tale is in places disfigured by mad (rather than bad) English; and its catastrophe is hastily, weakly, and obscurely managed....\\"I couldn't hope to do any better than that but I can try to extrapolate. There is no cohesive narrative. What little there is is broken up by chapters on the particulars of whaling. Or on the philosophy of whaling, in particular or of life in general.I'm not saying a good job couldn't be done with any or all of this but I just don't see it here. It's too disjointed and Melville's style of prose is awkward and protracted. Someone famous once said \\"brevity is the soul of whit.\\" Melville either never heard it or ignored it.There isn't all that much character interaction either. Ishmael, the narrator, for instance, starts out as a palpable presence in the book, a real character. Once he sets sail on the Pequod, however, he disappears into the background; he becomes a \\"mouthpiece,\\" as another review put it. He interacts with no one, such that you might have to remind yourself that he, not Melville himself, is the actual narrator. Other characters get chapters devoted to them, but the results are uneven and again, it's all broken up by all the passages on technical details or philosophical musings.Even some of the particulars are dubious. Melville refers to whales as fish throughout the book, which might be expected considering the period, but Melville makes it a point to reject the idea that whales are anything other than fish. He even mentions Swedish biologist Linnaeus' declaration that \\"whales are separate from the fish\\" and the various reasons given as to why. Melville doesn't attempt to counter any of these arguments, but merely declares Linnaeus' declaration to be \\"humbug.\\" Wikipedia argues that this use of the word 'fish' is an \\"ad hoc\\" definition meant to describe an animal that dwells in the ocean. If so, would this then mean that Linnaeus was under the impression that whales don't live in the sea? Somehow, I doubt it. Also, would this \\"ad hoc\\" definition not also include the squid, octopus and sea turtle, to name some examples?Anyway, to summarize, Moby-Dick wasn't an enjoyable experience for me. Obviously, mileage varies. There seems to be a very sizable and fiercely loyal following for this novel and I almost wish I could see what they see. But I just don't have it in me to make the effort again. Life is too short as it is."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"This book is a must if you wanna lull yourself to sleep. The opening was great, but then all these horrendous allusions kept popping up. I mean: pages devoted to the act of just plain sleeping, and then more pages devoted to eating?

Then the book would have been better."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"I read this book in high school and have been smitten with \\"Moby Dick\\" ever since. With this undeniable classic, Herman Melville set the bar ferociously high. It's a monster of a read, but so worth it. I can't even imagine how someone could even craft a book on this level. It's mind-boggling really. Oh, to only be inside of Melville's head to take this journey with him as he wrote. He took his mind on an incredible trip. It's a master work of literary art.

Ishmael is a very interesting character who is very deep thinking and observant. Queequeg is another colorful character who is a pagan, cannibal, harpooneer, and Ishmael's best friend.After they sign on with the Pequod, who's captain is Ahab, they soon become swept up in his monmania. His leg had been bitten off by Moby Dick a year before their voyage begins, and his real purpose for their voyage is for Ahab to take revenge.I started this book in March and finished it in May, which is very unusual for me, usually I finish books quicker than that. Whenever there is a whale hunt, this book is thrilling and intense, but after the whale is dead, the book goes on and on about stripping the blubber and the anatomy of the whale.

It took me two attempts to do it, but I did it! I now can understand why it is often cited as the greatest American novel ever written. However, if I was to read it again (and I may) I would do so with a good amount of judicious skipping. Bear in mind that Melville wrote this at a time when not much was known about whales and whaling. Therefore, while the actual PLOT of Moby Dick is a fairly straightforward read, Melville will digress for pages and pages about whales, and the history of whaling. This may not prove that interesting for everyone and, since the chapters are all neatly labeled, one can easily skip over them. That having been said, DO NOT skip over every chapter you feel has no bearing on the plot. On The Whiteness of the Whale is one of the most important parts of the book - it perhaps answers why we find clowns so creepy.The important thing to remember is that Moby Dick is both low art and high art. It is a rollicking adventure tale, in which we find a lot of great prose and ruminations on the meaning of existence.

Indeed, you know a classic by how many times it has been ripped off, or alluded to in pop culture. In fact, the star Trek franchise's motto is when in doubt; either have a time travel episode, a Borg episode, or rip-off Moby-Dick. See episodes from the original series &quot;Obsession,&quot; and movies &quot;The Wrath of Khan,&quot; and &quot;First Contact&quot; and &quot;The Voyage Home&quot;Test: What's the opening line of Moby-Dick? &quot;Call me Ishmael.&quot;So why the four starts for a classic? Basically, because Melvin threw in too much exposition in explaining cetology and zoology, which is helpful in getting a feel for the book, but contributes nothing to the brooding Ahab's story. You get snippets here and there of Ahab's monomania, but it is only in the last several chapters that he blooms from being a poor addled man to a diabolic and satanic force of evil. Baptizing the spear in the name of the devil is what does it!But do we need to slog through 135 chapters, plus an appendix to get to the point. In reality this book is about the milieu of whaling and the whaling industry as a metaphor for life, not monomania as is popularly believed. He does a wonderful job of catching the salt and blood associated, and his poetic eye catches the glisten of meaning with these events, but he is doing several things at once, and the quest for the whale is only part of the story.But these cetology matters should have been relegated to an appendix, or the circular file. It was as if Melville was trying to write two books at once: a bouncy book on various whales and whaling in general, and a another being the tale of obsession and revenge. My advice would be to get an abridge version of the book, or skip to the next chapter when the book gets boring.So what is the appeal? First, Ahab is a strong character with a smoldering motive to get back at the whale that cost him his leg-i.e. Captain Hook. Does he ever get back at the wale? Are we ever Ahab-esque in that we get obsessed with revenge? Come on! Be honest! We feel Ahab burning in our veins at times.Ahab is crazy. Hannibal Lecter is crazy. But they are crazy for different reasons. You feel that Lecter is really in control of himself, and that he enjoys being evil whereas Ahab has surrendered his will to he appetite and passion for revenge. What wraps my attention is the question why.Second, the craft. Melville is a master storyteller. We see things through Ishmael's eyes, so we feel the distance between Ahab and us. We are detached from the goings on in the story as Ishmael comments on Ahab's journey downward. It must be read to be understood.Third, the milieu. Melville certainly did his homework in researching this novel. Indeed, chapter one seems like a brainstorm on all things whale, and he manages to sustain this encyclopedic knowledge throughout the story. Compare this to Jack London and The Sea-Wolf: London has as much technical knowledge, or more so than Melville, but the Sea-Wolf focuses on the characters Humphrey Van Weyden and Wolf Larsen and the idea of a Neitzchean Superman. Moby-Dick, however, is a study of the whaling milieu and the smudge pot Ahab. London skimps on the description of seal hunting &quot;culture,&quot; and the nuts and bolts of sailing while Melville revels in telling us everything about whaling. This exposition is what kills the book because the plot grinds to a standstill as Melville throws cetological tidbits and tales at us. It is fun to read, but the plot momentum stops dead. It is almost like seeing an infomercial in the middle of the book! Luckily we can skip ahead, unlike reality where we cannot fast-forward commercial.This book is part of a trio that deals with evil captains, the other books being Jack London's &quot;Sea-Wolf,&quot; and Jules Verne's &quot;20,000 Leagues under the Sea.&quot; Nemo is just as driven as Ahab, but is more mysterious. We understand Ahab's revenge, since we have all tried to chase down people who have hurt us, or wanted to get back at a barking dog, or barking spouse. That is the appeal-we relate to Ahab better than Nemo, who is cerebral, cold, distant and obscure.Wolf Larsen is another matter. He belongs in the Villain's Hall of Fame, or is it the Rogue's Gallery? Pure evil, a pure manifestation of &quot;intelligence . . . added to brute power and evil will&quot; (Inferno, 31) that was never matched or equaled until Thomas Harris created Hannibal Lecter. Ahab is obsessed and we understand why someone wants revenge, but Larsen is terrifying in that he enjoys being evil. I just wish that Larsen would get more exposure.So in a knot, I recommend this book, but advise people to feel free in skipping over the unnecessary chapter, or buying an abridged version. Read &quot;20,000 Leagues&quot; and &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; to nail down the image of an evil captain.FOR ANYONE WRITING A REPORT: This story is a tale of &quot;Man Versus Nature&quot; embodied by the whale. Read Genesis 16-17,21, 25, 28 and 1 Kings 16, 18, 20-22 for Ishmael and Ahab. Aren't I kind!"},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE FULL UNABRIDGED EDITION:If I could get by with giving this zero stars, I would. OMG, this is tedious and torture to read. I don't care how many times people say this is a \\"classic\\" and a \\"must read\\", that doesn't make it so. The book was based on two real accounts, both of which are much more interesting and easier to read than Melville's overly verbose tome. I slogged through this and forced myself to finish it and even the last three chapters, which is the only part of the 135 chapters (yes, I said 135) that even concerns itself with actual encounter with Moby Dick, are not that great. I actually could not stay awake through most of it and it took me a lot longer to read it because of that. If you want the true story, read the account of Mocha Dick and/or the Shipwreck of the Essex. Those are what Melville based his book on. I have read plenty of classics, including Robinson Crusoe, most of Dickens, Dracula, etc. These are all written either earlier or about the same time as Moby Dick, but they were interesting and readable. Not so with this book."},{"Title":"Moby Dick, or, The Whale","review":"A few less words would go a long way. Who cars that much about whale anatomy?
