Well, only because his sister asks, he will make sure that the man who was found standing over the dead body of Ms. Wagner with the murder weapon in his hand and her jewelry in his pockets, gets proper tratment in the lockup as he deals with his drug addiction. But that's all.As he looks into the matter he discovers his good friend, Police Lt. Abe Glitsky taking unusually questionable contitutional liberties with Mr. Burgess's interrogation and incarceration. Then the San Francisco District Attorney, Sharon Pratt, who's administration has been known for it's inability to get convictions (all the good prosecutors resigned) and it's &quot;humane&quot; treatment of criminals it considers to be victims of society decides to ask for the death penalty. Of course, it is an election year and Ms. Pratt's re-election chances are tenuous at best.We learn early on that the murder victim is in fact, Abe Glitsky's daughter (her mother married another man while pregant by Glitsky). The helps explain his uncharacteristic behavior.After viewing a &quot;confession&quot; that the police sweat out of Cole, Glitsky starts to wonder if they have the real killer and from that concern, the story unwinds toward &quot;The Hearing&quot;. Hardy signs on for the duration and picks up considerable help along the way. Lescroart is at his best during the trial scenes and the reader somewhat impatiently waits for the story to unravel, which it surely does in a most satisfying way when court is in session. Lecroart has never failed to please his readers."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Fast-paced, with interesting and well-developed characters, The Hearing works on every level. The pace and flow of the buildup is deftly handled - we're along for a measured and suspenseful ride. A little thing which I liked a lot was Lescroart's choices of his character's names. By choosing uncommon, slightly quirky names or names with unusual spellings - Sharron Pratt, Dismas Hardy, Abe Glitsky, Dash Logan are examples - we're able to more easily keep track of the rich cast of characters. The Hearing is worth a look."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Love it when a plot keeps me going until the end. Good characters. Good pace. My first read with this author. Am definitely going to check out his other titles."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"I like the author; he writes an interesting and compelling story with all the right ingredients to keep one coming back for more."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"I just finished The Hearing and it is clearly the best of the three Dismas Hardy legal thrillers I've read. It is an exciting and complex tale for the more cerebral of crime novel aficionados. As a lawyer and former law enforcement officer in the Bay Area I really appreciated how the author really got the courtroom and police procedure right. The local color in good old Left Coast San Francisco rings totally true, too. It's all the more impressive since Lescroart has never been either a lawyer or in law enforcement. He must have very good advisors. The characters are colorful, distinctly limned, and like any good novel, slightly too extreme to be entirely believable, but they sure are fun to watch. Hardy eventually assembles a disparate and eclectic group of allies to bring about a suspenseful and imaginative ending."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"A young black woman, a rising star in San Francisco's legal arena is found dead at midnight. I white male junkie, brother-in-law of a newspaper writer, is found nearby with the woman's jewelry and the gun that shot her. But two shots were fired and the woman was only shot once.Bi-racial homicide lieutenant Abe Glitsky is called to the scene and what nobody else there knows is, the dead young woman is his daughter via youthful affair with a deceased African American congresswoman from California. Enraged, he roughs up the junkie, and demands his underlings get a confession, whch they do. Later he begins to believe the junkie didn't commit the murder, but they've got a confession he is responsible for.The city's embattled DA, who has a history of going easy on criminals, is low in the polls and an election is coming up. She decides to go for the death penalty in this case. Defense attorney Dismas Hardy isn't even sure his clinet is innocent, still he crusades to find the truth and finds a shady lawyer might be involved in this murder, as well as a corrupt retired cop. What he ultimately finds is even more devious than that.The book has some very well written family scenes. Abe Glitsy with his college age sons and his religious Jewish father after he suffers a heart attack which makes him slow in his investigation, allowing the bad guys to have the edge until the end. There are touching scenes of married affection in the city's night spots on the Hardy's weekly \\"date night.\\" There is an almost horrifying scene where Dismas Hardy comes home to find his emotionally sensistive preteen daughter strewn across the bed sobbing hysterically and his wife distraught. The daughter had never even thought about suicide until the public school held an indebth student assembly on the subject, it's causes and prevention"},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Lescroart's character-driven legal thriller, \\"The Hearing,\\" again features San Francisco's moody African-American/Jewish homicide detective Abe Glitsky and his good friend, defense attorney Dismas Hardy. The story opens with a midnight call to Glitsky reporting the murder of a young assistant DA, Elaine Wager, the victim of an apparent mugging. A suspect, a homeless heroin-addict, was caught in the act of robbing the body, gun in hand. But for Gltizky it's no ordinary case.Wager was his daughter, though he only discovered the fact a couple years before and hadn't acknowledged himself to Elaine, for vague, unsatisfactory reasons which haunt him throughout the novel.Glitzky takes out his anger and grief on Cole Burgess, the pathetic murder suspect, extracting a confession, and the DA, New-Age liberal Sharon Pratt, decides to make Burgess the cornerstone of her re-election bid, going for the death penalty. Pratt trumpets her case to the press: Burgess, a homeless white man, kills a prominent, African-American community figure in the course of a robbery.But Glitzky is having second thoughts. And his friend Hardy has accepted the defense, albeit reluctantly.The story pits political maneuvering, within the police department and the DA's office, against the demands of justice as Glitzky is suspended for giving the interrogation tape to Hardy and Pratt strives to try the case in the newspapers before going to court.Lescroart spins a complex web of ambition, greed, posturing and venality around the suspense of investigation, courtroom drama, and conspiracy, while also involving the reader in large human emotions and issues of character.Pratt is a bit shrill and annoying but Glitzky's dogged honesty and his struggle to understand himself and his grief more than compensate. Lescroart has another well-written winner."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"This is my first Lescroart book. An enjoyable read, the characters are developed well and I didn't have any problem learning the background of the main characters, despite not having read anything else in the series. But, speaking of character, for a while, it seemed like a new one was introduced every 5 pages for the first 200 pages. At times, I had to pause to recall who someone was. Not in and of itself bad, just tedious at times.Like another reviewer, I flinched at some factual things. &quot;Dress out&quot;? Another that caught my eye was when Cole recalls his friend, Steve, from his early years and Cole flashes back to when he last saw Steve - at a frat party at Notre Dame. Now I went to Notre Dame. There are no frats there, no greek system at all. Then Cole brought cocaine with him to the party and some girl indulged. At Notre Dame? Catholic Disneyland? Please! You get dirty looks if you smoke a cigarette there. A small nitpick but it clearly showed the author only paid attention to certain facts, not others.It's a decent read but Lord, it's longer than it needs to be. I could hardly believe it when Lescroart desribed the preliminary hearing in such detail. If the ordinary way to tell a story is to say, &quot;I called Shelly,&quot; Lescroart will tell it like this, &quot;I picked up the telephone. I pressed out the number on the keypad with the tip of my index finger, on my right hand. I had the receiver to my ear. I heard the phone ring. It rang again. Then again. Finally, Shelly answered.&quot; Sometimes, it is borderline painful.The problem is that Lescroart does a good enough job with characters that you still want to know what happened and so you brave the tedium. I don't think it's a &quot;page turner&quot; per se. It's interesting and decently written. I think most readers would enjoy it, I just had some nit picks."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"In the legal thriller/police procedural, Lescroart weaves an intriguing story with likable, believable, well-drawn characters. This is one of the Dismas Hardy series (I will go back and read the others) featuring Hardy as a low rent but hard working attorney and Abe Glitsky as a police homocide lieutenant with a very personal interest in the murder of up-and-coming attorney Elaine Wager. When the sister of a drug addict, charged with Wager's murder, asks for help, Hardy reluctantly assists. But when the DA asks for the death penalty in an apparent alcohol/drug induced murder, Hardy smells a rat. Actually there are lots of rats in the operation of the San Francisco police department/DA's office, making Hardy's job quite a bit harder to sort through.What is not hard though, is to really like these characters. Hardy and Glitzky are best friends, a truly odd couple. When Glitzky has a heart attack and is suffering with regret for not having contacted his daughter, Hardy is there for him. Also engaging is Elaine's paralegal who turns up helpful clues as well as the villains in the case--I wont spoil it for you by telling who they are.If you like the early Grisham legal thrillers and police procedurals this book is for you. A word of warning: it gets off to a slow start and at 560 pages is best saved for the beach, weekend away or a very long flight."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Bear with me here, for I find myself eternally frustrated by Lescroart's efforts. He always gets it almost right. Almost. And yet I keep reading him.I think that the main reason I keep coming back, book after book, is the characters. Dismas Hardy, for example, is a good man, flawed like the rest of us but good in his intent. There's also his friendship with SFPD lieutenant Abe Glitsky, of course, as well as his marriage to Franny, the widowed sister of his business partner (and Vietnam buddy) at The Shamrock (a bar whose prototype -- no longer there, by the way -- I remember well). These central characters, and their ongoing developments, keep me coming back, despite the often cardboard situations Lescroart plunges them into.And, yet again, there's too much cardboard at the central premise of \\"The Hearing.\\" A young female attorney is found brutally murdered. She's the unacknowledged daughter of Abe Glitsky (the result of a college liaison), and there's a suspect apprehended at the scene who, at first blush -- but first blush only -- appears to be a \\"slam dunk\\" for the crime.So far, so good. But here's where Lescroart begins to go astray.It's by no means unheard of (let alone unrealistic) for a homicide investigator to have a personal interest in a crime; but -- and here's a big one -- in such situations, an experienced investigator invariably makes damn sure he \\"goes by the book,\\" that he \\"dots all the i's, crosses all the t's,\\" that he gets it completely right, in other words. Yet Glitsky, despite his avowed experience, gets it completely wrong from the very first. The book is thrown out the window, and the railroad steams ahead full-force.Wrong!Add to this mix a politically-motivated D.A. (not in itself an anomaly) who somehow inexplicably -- despite her interests in the outcome -- fails to do her homework, and you have the recipe for a totally fabricated scenario.Lescroart additionally betrays his own ignorance of procedure, most obviously here, when he notes that Hardy's client is \\"allowed\\" to \\"dress out\\" (i.e., wear a suit and tie as opposed to his jail clothing) for his court appearance at the preliminary hearing; in actuality, this is not a question of 'allowance'; even the pottiest defense attorney (whether publicly appointed or otherwise) would make sure his client wore something to court other than his/her \\"jumpsuit,\\" particularly in a capital case.So the plot's cardboard, and the motivations and procedures diverge from allowable reality; what makes this book (and Lescroart's others) worth reading?Once again, it's the central characters and the way they develop. By this time, of course, Abe is a widower and still struggling with that. Things are about to happen to him. Good things, things he deserves. Will they work out? What's going on with Dismas and Franny, and how are the kids turning out? And what about the business at the saloon (long -- undeservedly -- gone, but still here in the Hardy series of books)?Lescroart excels at keeping us caring about his people. Now if he could only get the rest of it reasonably right!"},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Abe Glitsky, the homocide detective who is a close friend with Dismas Hardy, discovers that the victim of what appears to be a senseless murder is his daughter. Abe has kept his paternity a secret and has watched Elaine Wager develop into a talented attorney. Heroin addict Cole Burgess is charged with the crime and what at first seems to be a simple case of robbery/murder develops into a complex maze of power and corruption. Hardy is hired to defend Burgess and Glitsky fights his own battles in this overly long but entertaining story. There are several characters to keep track of and by remembering each character's personality and behavior, the story has more depth than the typical legal fiction. Lescroart's skill is apparant as you read how each character struggles with the personal conflicts that define them. He interweaves all the subplots and clues into a coherant whole that brings reader satisfaction by the last page."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Lescroart has manged to keep his regular characters fresh and consistently interesting.

Abe Glisky of homicide wants the suspect sweated and made to confess because the victim is his illegitimate daughter, although he hadn't know this for many years. His best friend, defense lawyer Dismas Hardy, didn't want to take the case because of Glisky, so you knew that he would eventually take the case. The story proceeds in a very interesting way, bringing in the DA, Sharon Pratt and her assistant and lover, Gabriel Torrey, neither of which are particularly likable characters. There are some side stories, such as the development of the relationship of the widower Glisky and the victim's paralegal Treya Ghent, which is very sweet. The book moves along quickly as the story unfolds and you discover exactly who did what and why.It is well written, keeps your interest and brings everything together in the end. I would say that aside from a bit of overdramatic courtroom drama at the end that looked like it was written for an episode of Law and Order, it is an excellent read. This is my first Lescroart book and I am motivated to read more from him."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"The Hearing, by John Lescroart, is the 7th entry in the excellent series featuring defense attorney Dismas Hardy and his longtime friend San Francisco Police Department Homicide Investigation Lieutenant Abe Glitsky. When a woman is discovered murdered on the mean streets of San Francisco, the case looks pretty straightforward when the junkie suspect is observed leaning over the dead woman's body. Turns out the victim has a special connection to Glitsky, and the sparks fly when he meets the victim's coworker and friend Treya. The focus and spotlight in this great novel is on Glitsky and his family. Series fans will not be disappointed with this tremendous mystery/thriller.This is great reading, and well worth a Five star rating. Enjoy.For those new to this outstanding series, the order of books is as follows:Dead IrishThe VigHard EvidenceThe 13th JurorThe Mercy RuleNothing but the truthThe HearingThe OathThe First LawThe Second ChairThe MotiveBetrayal& A Plague of Secrets [scheduled for release in July 2009]I personally recommend reading them in order for the best experience.

But in the three weeks (and several other completed books) since I finished it, I completely forgot the entire story. Reading the summary brought it back, but not enthusiastically. Being my first Lescroart book, I thought I might pick up another for the setting in SF rather than my attachment to his characters."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"This is the first novel by this author I have read. The story was okay, the presentation was a little lame. I like a little more action and excitment in my stories. It's not that the plot was weak or the story was poorly told, it just lacked life. When I get to the end of a chapter I like the author to compel me to continue reading the next chapter. I found that lacking in this book. When i finished one chapter, I was neither curious nor excited to see what the next chapter would bring.This book is basically about a man accused of murder, the people trying to prove his guilt and those trying to prove his innocence. The end of the book gets better and has a much quicker pace.All in all, this is not a bad or competely boring book, it just doesn't grab you and keep you riveted. Don't expect your pulse to quicken or to suffer from sleep deprivation. I would, however be willing to give another of his novels a try."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"I want to personally thank the author for he Dismas Harding series. I love nothing more than repeat characters in a good novel. And, with Lescroart's Dismas novels each character grows in strength, sincerity and family unity and develops self-identity. The reader enjoys the relationship of family and friends. Lescroart takes us into the homes and everyday lives of his characters and creates an atmosphere of warmth, love, unity, commitment and spirituality (Abe, his father, and children) while endowing his characters with a sense of humor. The relationship between Dismas and Abe (two tough guys) is really tender and caring.The crux of a Lescroart Dismas Harding Series is, of course The Law; the way it should be but always isn't; but in the end, justice does prevail. He brings realism to a trial portrayal so lacking in other novels. He emphasis Dismas' frustration as a lawyer who is limited by courtroom procedure and yet gives Dismas the legal (and sometimes not so legal) tools to present his compelling evidence.It also appears from reading this series that Mr. Lescroart has a respect for not only lawyers, but for the working staff in a law office such as the paralegals, clerks, etc. I like that in his novels.Am I a fan of Lescroart? Of course and I can't wait to read The Oath.Thank you Mr. Lescroart for a great series - don't ever stop giving me the pleasure of reading about my favorite characters."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"This story, featuring a crotchety detective, Abe Glitsky, and other variously interesting characters, has a fairly good story:the death of a rising star, in the D.A.'s office, plus a drug deal, but also a surprising ending. (I'm not tellin'.) Not a bad book. I think I'll check into a few more of Mr. Lescroart's books. Reader Robert Lawrence did a fine job with various voices and to keep the story fairly interesting. (Got a bit \\"sensitive\\" at the end, i.e., with the guy proposing to marry, but not too \\"sappy\\".) A good listen for a nightime."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"I had never read any of Lescroart's works before \\"The Hearing\\". I picked it up in an Airport book store, and read it on a cross-country flight. I couldn't put it down. I've read the less positive Amazon reviews, and, yes, there's some merit to criticism that some of the readers have meted out. All the same, \\"The Hearing\\" is an page-turner. I give it 5 stars for its shear entertainment value.BTW: After reading \\"The Hearing\\", I went back and read the \\"The Oath\\" and the \\"The 13th Juror\\". I'm afraid I found those clumsily written. Did Lescroart get a new editor with the \\"The Hearing\\"?"},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"As a rule, I usually enjoy kicking back and reading a Lescroart book. they are often interesting, and keep you wondering what will happen next. In addition, it is always good to see what Glitsky is up to next and what is happening with him. He is a good character, almost a kind of anti-hero that is rare in this genre of literature.With that said, in this case, I was happy to see more of Glitsky, not to mention Hardy, the enigmatic Freeman and the rest of the gang, but found the plot to be a bit too convoluted and contrived to really be believable. In the end, we aren't really shocked by who the killer is, and has happened in Lescroart's other mysteries. Sure, we wonder about the details, but I don't want to read over 400 pages just for that.I would say to read most of Lescroart's other books to get a taste of what he can do rather than read this one. He can do much better."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Tghis one was very rare for Mr. Lescroart. I enjoyed it but it weas a little slow at times. The characters were always the same.

Other reviewers will give you a synopsis of the characters and plot; I like to let the author spin it to you his way. The characters are largely those of his other books, which is a treat in itself. I'd just like to say that the plot is inventive, suspenseful, and ingenious. The payoff and wind-up very satisfying. My only complaint is that there is too much time between Lescroart's novels. A great read!"},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"I thought this book was mediocre at best. The characters were presented well and made for an interesting cast; however, the central mystery of the book is not quite resolved. Lingering questions remain at the end of the book.Additionally, the book takes several detours to explore the family life of some of the characters. Several of the detours work to enhance the novel's plot, but others seem rather pointless. If I'm reading a legal thriller, I'd prefer to read a legal thriller, not an exploration of family life. If I wanted to read an exploration of child-rearing and family life, I'd be reading that, not a legal thriller."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"I have just today finished \\"The Hearing\\".

He informs his staff that he expects them to \\"sweat\\" a confession from Cole Burgess, a two-bit junkie.They succeed and book Cole for first-degree murder. Cole's sister hires Dismas Hardy to at least obtain drug treatment so he does not linger in a cell going cold turkey. He agrees to handle that, but nothing more until the ambitious DA decides to use Cole to further her political ambitions by seeking the death penalty. Dismas takes on the role of defense attorney because he begins to have doubts that Cole is the killer.THE HEARING is one of the year's best legal thrillers as it entertains and shocks in a believable manner. John Lescroart masterly creates characters that are hard on the outside, but contain a soft spot inside their gut. The well-designed story line uses the motivations of the cast to propel the action forward, especially the humorous duels between Dismas and Glitsky. A great storyteller tells quite a story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"In this latest of the Dismas Hardy novels, John Lescroart shows that he is more than up to the challenge of continuing series.He brings back Hardy and Glitsky and a wealth of other characters. In past books he has tended to focus on Hardy or Glitsky as the main charater, but in this outing he gives them equal billing which provides for a nice balance. All of the secondary characters are eqully well developed and Lescroart keeps enough twists and turns going in the plot to keep this book from becoming predictable.Lescroart is by far my favorite author of this genre and with this book out does himself. While many authors would turn to formula and coast through a story this far into a series, Lescroart never lets down. We find out more about Hardy and Glitsk's kids and once again David Freeman is back with a solid contribution.On top of the characterizations there is a very well developed legal story here. Once again Lescroart goes outside the norm and has the bulk of the legal story take place during the preliminary hearing, another neat trick.An excellant extension of the Hardy saga and well recommended."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Dismas Hardy is back with his ideals intact, his marriage strong, his defense practice going well, and he is a thoroughly likable main character in a series of good legal thrillers. Also back is Abe Glitsky, the tough cop who is Dismas' best friend. In &quot;The Hearing&quot; Abe has a problem and Dismas has to help solve the case as he defends a drug addict with few redeaming qualties who has supposedly killed Elaine Wager. Elaine was perceived to have been a leading member of the black legal community with a good reputation. One of her secrets was that Abe Glitsky was her father. Abe had learned the truth before Elaine's murder, but had not confronted her with it, and after she was killed, he went after the first suspect with a vengence. He refused to allow the suspect medical attention as he was going through herion withdrawl and gave the go ahead for a strenuous interrogation resulting in a &quot;confession.&quot; The suspect, Cole Burgess, looks like a promising candidate especially since he was found near the body and had her money and jewelry on his person. Cole's mother is the only one who really cares any longer about what happens to him.Dismas Hardy is the reluctant defense attorney brought in by Cole's mother. As the story continues, a web of political corruption unfolds within the DA's office and the police department. Elaine Wager's own life was not what it had seemed to be, but as she began to investigate some of the corruption she found, she was trying to made amends when she was murdered.Elaine's personal assistant, Treya Ghent, is an interesting new character in this series who adds another dimension to the life of Abe Glitsky. This author has successfully brought his characters through his books as they have become old friends and acquaintances to those of us who read everything Lescroart writes."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Searching for a new book, the readers recommendations strongly liked this author---so I gave it a shot. Overall I found the book a very good read; good character development, personal interaction between the parties, a compelling &quot;who done it&quot; and I agree with one writer who states that the courtroom scenes were the best. I am definitely going to purchase another of his books for a comparison read."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"I've read every one of John Lescroart's novels and he has never disppointed me. His characters are vivid and real and he is a master plotter. Why he is not an automatic best-seller author is beyond me, he is so much better than some of the authors who are always on the list. &quot;The Hearing&quot; is complex, satisfyingly long and very well plotted, typically Lescroart. Dismas Hardy, Abe Glitzky and all the usual characters are finely drawn and you feel you would recognize them if you met them on the street. This author is one of my very favorites, and I always look forward to a new book by Lescroart."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"&quot;The Hearing&quot; brings back police lieutenant Abe Glitsky and defense attorney Dismas Hardy as they attempt to find out who killed Elaine Wagner - a prominent lawyer whose secret was that she was Abe's daughter from a relationship ended long ago. As more facts about the case are uncovered, both Abe and Dismas begin to doubt that Hardy's client, a junkie arrested at the scene of the crime, was the killer. Glitsky and Hardy are both flawed but good men who maintain a friendship despite their divergent work and personal lives, and they were appealing companions during the couple of days it took to read this generally fast-paced book.This is the first of Lescroart's Dismas Hardy books I have read. Although it is part of a long-running series, &quot;The Hearing&quot; stands fairly well on its own - though some scenes seem to be included just to allow recurring characters a chance to make an appearance. If this book is typical of Lescroart, then it is clearly the characters, and not the storylines, that keep readers coming back. I found it hard to believe that Hardy's legal strategy really would have worked, and the central villain's actions didn't quite add up. I also found it strange that Elaine's tendency to have problematic relationships with older men is at least partially attributed to the secrecy about her paternity, yet Abe's blossoming relationship with a woman his daughter's age is presented as an unambiguously positive development. Maybe this will play out further in the next book? Lescroart has me interested enough to want to read it and find out."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Remember the novel \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\"? The lawyer defends a man accused of murder who is acquitted, yet we find out at the end that the defendant was guilty of the crime. Hope springs eternal that I will find another shocker of this sort. The norm, however, is that we know the defendant our lawyer hero defends will turn out to be innocent. My mathematical law in this regard is that the innocence of the accused is directly proportional to the amount of evidence against him/her. Will this book fall into this category? I'm not giving away anything by saying that while most of the community wants a hanging, lawyer Dismas Hardy has an increasing belief in his client's innocence. Did the homeless heroin addict kill the beautiful, prominent attorney Elaine Wager? Dismas and his police lieutenant friend Abe Glitsky pursue the case, and find a possible tie in involving child molestation.Everything is going fine here. It's an entertaining, engrossing tale that we trial fans know will end up in some sizzling courtroom scenes. Good guys turn out to be not so good guys. People disappear, people have heart attacks. Good fun. Now comes the bad part. We ultimately find ourselves in a true Perry Mason setting. The problem with such settings is that they make it difficult for me to suspend disbelief. They are situations that just don't seem to happen. I was disappointed with the way the story progressed, and thus have given it fewer stars. Perry Mason fans, however, should buy the book without delay."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"In \\"The Hearing\\", Lescroart weaves a tale that is engrossing and entertaining, if not wholly believable. As another of the Dismas Hardy series, Lescroart brings back some familiar characters - Abe Glitsky among them - in a well crafted story that keeps the pages turning. Unlike James Patterson's \\"1st to Die\\", in which the San Francisco setting is superficial and cardboard, Lescroart's San Francisco is an accurate portrayal of the city's liberal political machine and lively culture. The \\"villains\\" are despicable enough - enough to want to see them go down, but not so much as to detract from the their credibility. The courtroom drama was as suspenseful and exciting as anything I can remember since the early works of Scott Turow. (I still consider \\"Presumed Innocent\\" the best of the genre).Why only three stars? A few too many distractions that cluttered an otherwise tightly wound plot and puzzling mystery. The relationship between Abe and Treya, for example, was predictable and unneccessary, and the family connection with Cole Burgess, the suspected killer, was just a bit too much \\"mush\\". The end, while climactic, was just a bit of a letdown, detracting ever-so-slightly from the superb tale that led up to it. And finally, while Lescroart did a credible job of tagging and tracking a large cast of characters, there were simply too many floating around the pages.But all things considered, this is a good read, great entertainment, and well worth the time."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"Another good Invstigative Courtroom Drama by Lescroart. I found it a bit unbelievable in places (Why try the case at initial hearing?) but Dismas and Glitsky delivered the goods again. For people who are new to Lescroart's characters you might want to start with The 13th Juror or A certain Justice."},{"Title":"The Hearing","review":"I started the series with the last couple of books that Lescroart wrote. They were pretty bad. I should have known that starting with the more recent books might have been a mistake due to the track record of just about every other series ever produced. Authors tend to build up a series by piling one title on top of another and growing an audience. The first books are always the better in my opinion, wether it be Lawrence Block, James Patterson, or Patricia Cornwell. The characters are developed in the first couple of books and after a while the stories start to become mockaries of previous titles.So I thought that I would give Lescroart another try with one of the earlier books and came across 'Motive.' The story here is very similar to other Lescroart novels in the Dismis Hardy series, but for some almost intangible reason, it is crisper, fresher, and contains a more dire sense of urgency. I think that Lescroart might have been a little less comfortable, still searching for a groove that makes this book struggle and in turn takes the reader on a ride that will leave one guessing til the end how this will all come out.I think that in the later books, Hardy and Abe become superhuman and a little hard to swallow. Sort of like Harlan Coben's Myron Bolitar books where the characters become cartoon impersonations of people. It is a little apparent that in 'Motive,' the characters are heading to this la la land that makes the author treat his characters with kid gloves, but they are not quite there yet. Lescroart has put himself into a bit of a bind. He has produced a series of books that have garnered an audience clamoring for encores. Because the characters are so dear to the author and have already achieved a superhero status of mythic proportions, Lescroart is unwilling to damage this fantasy land and the comic book protagonists are fully realized and do not grow beyond this point. It would be nice to see Lescroart set this series aside and write some stand alone books ala Lehane and really explore the nuances of a character or two. But in the meantime, I would totally recommend this genre book."},{"Title":"Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons","review":"A pregnant pause between word three and four of one of these sonnets changed my life. Hacker writes an accessible, witty, beautiful, tender, sexy masterpiece (a novel, really) which has become, since its pub date, a folk rite-of-passage for many readers (even non-poetry lovers), a pole-raising standard for other poets, and the source for many phrases worth remembering: from &quot;age is not the muddle of the matter&quot; to the rhyming of &quot;fit of pique&quot; with &quot;geste heroique.&quot; This is a page-turning classic -- erudite, lyrical, and peopled by women one would want to know. A smart person's tour de force!"},{"Title":"Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons","review":"Marilyn Hacker through her poetry describes her life with her lover, both in New York and Paris. She, being older, talks about insecurities and the torture of being away from the one you love. From the first meeting to the phone call goodbye, Marilyn describes the appropriate lust over another person. This poetry is amazing."},{"Title":"Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons","review":"Sophistocated and exact, Marilyn Hacker is a poet's poet. She is a formalist who still believs in the power of sonnets, a writer of astounding intellect and superb taste who, like Wallace Stevens, gives you the feeling she's intensely alive even in contemplation. This book, with the poems all set in New York, is a tour de force of modern poetry: a novel in sonnets, each sonnet connecting to the one before it and to the one that follows. It recounts the stormy love affair between the poet and her wayward muse, a much younger woman. The language is gorgeous. The story is romantic, gritty and quotidian, all in the right places. The details fix you in place and time: upscale New York life, late 20th century. These poems take you through the full range of emotion, but mostly they're very, very sexy. The subject may be lesbian love but no lover can fail to identify with the joy and ache and longing--and yes, even with the sex. A perfect Valentine's Day gift. A total masterpiece."},{"Title":"Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons","review":"Marilyn Hacker's sonnets are, in Marianne Moore's useful phrase, \\"not for prudish persons.\\" The sporadically frank descriptions of lesbian eroticism might not be for every reader. However, I must give this book the highest recommendation for the sheer technical mastery of the work. Hacker writes sonnets with the casual ease of someone turning over in bed. And she does know how to paint a picture and to tell a story as few other poets do. Her rhymes are sometimes wryly Byronic (\\"you're a\\" with \\"bravura\\"), always inventive, never tired or hackneyed (polysyllabic, rhyming single words with double words, rhymes in the middle of words). And the occasional French phrase need not disconcert. (I was quietly proud of remembering that \\"gueule de bois\\" meant \\"hangover\\"!)Hacker has renovated many forms that have fallen out of disfavor -- the corona, or crown of sonnets, wherein the last line of one sonnet becomes the first line of the next. She has a kind of villanelle that goes on for twenty-eight lines, three tercets beyond the ordinary length. But quite apart from formal considerations, these poems make a fascinating diary of a life lived between New York and Paris, in search of poetry and human love.Perhaps the highest praise I can give to this most satisfying book is that it makes one eager to read more of Hacker's work -- which one has often encountered before, but into which one has never delved with the proper attention and depth. LOVE, DEATH, AND THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS is electric with life."},{"Title":"Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons","review":"One of my favorite books of poetry ever. No matter the gender of my lover, this is the book I read when things are going great...and when they fall apart. Sexy, deep, and gorgeous language. I'm always grateful she's around."},{"Title":"Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons","review":"Marilyn Hacker's volume, Love, Death, and the Changing of the Seasons, is a sumptuous sonnet cycle that some have called a verse-novel. Rather than a novel, though, the volume is more a memoir. The collection does tell a story - an intense, emotional story of a year-long lesbian love affair. The title of the work is a fitting pun: while Hacker's relationship cycles the seasons, it is, nevertheless, a May-December romance. Some seventeen years separate the lovers. From the beginning, Hacker and her lover, Rachel, sizzle, and Hacker writes bluntly, and explicitly, of the thrill of attraction, the fervor of love at first blush, the passion, and possibility, of fantasy. And, the satisfaction of satisfaction. Lust soon turns to love, and Hacker finds herself in an unaccustomed position - that of needing someone. While in the heat of the relationship, the age disparity does not seem an issue; in the end, though, it becomes clear that maturity matters and that Hacker has much more invested in the relationship than does Rachel.Like a voyeur, Hacker's reader peeks, not only into Hacker's bedroom, but also into Hacker's life. It is the quotidian (one of Hacker's favorite words) moments that are most poignant. Here, Hacker writes of home, of her daughter - Iva, of her travels. Undergirding all, however, is her relationship with Rachel. When the two are separated, and this happens often with Hacker frequently in Italy or France, the verse resonates with longing for Rachel. The distance between the two is palpable in these lines, and Hacker achieves this by peppering her verse with allusions to foreign locales and by writing phrases in Italian or French. The reader, like Hacker, eagerly awaits the reunion of the two.Then, the poetry comes to a heartrending, staggering end. It is over, just like the love affair. And the reader undoubtedly feels the same punch to the gut that Hacker does, especially when she helplessly wonders, \\"will one year bracket us from start to finish?\\"All of this - the plain yet elegant language, the interconnected sonnets, the various villanelles, the heartbreaking symmetry - creates a compelling love story."},{"Title":"The Bible And Contemporary Theology: The Quest for Truth And Relevance","review":"This book is an excellent resource for anyone interested in a modern approach to biblical interpretation using academic methods developed over the last and current centuries.

I doubt that many people really are eager to demonstrate they can remeber a whole deck of cards, but the book spends a lengthy chapter on that subject. And the Kindle edition is terrible.

As was often the case back in those days, I ignored my dad's advice.Within the past couple of months, the same book was recommended to me while I was reading the works of renowned neuro-scientist, Dr. Richard Restak, M.D.. So, I finally purchased and read \\"How to Develop a Super Power Memory\\". As a 73-year-old retiree, I have been embarrassed by those embarrassing \\"senior moments\\" or lapses of memory. Dr. Restak says that Harry Lorayne's book is the best of its kind, as it states -- there is no such thing as a poor memory, only an untrained one. Lorayne teaches techniques that anyone, at any age, can learn to produce a super-power memory.Dr. Restak, a nigh-level neuroscientist says that such training can help an individual to ward-off the dangers of dementia and alzheimers.Restak and Lorayne offer very positive direction in improving total brain performance.

It is an interesting book that i had been very fond when i got it first. It can be used as a guide to memory"},{"Title":"How to Develop A Super Power Memory","review":"I'll try to be brief. Ok,Mr.Lorayne uses the Link and Peg system throughout the book. For instance if you had a list of things you would use the link system. You make up a picture of each item on the list than use an ilogical visual story to connect each item. Your visual story must be ilogical as he stresses throughout the book. The problem is you have to be good at making illogical stories and be able to memorize those stories. Of course he doesn't teach you how to do that. The peg system works on the fact that you only remember something unless it's associated to something else. He uses a phonetic alphabet system by which each sound stands for a number. This way you can memorize words by numbers and vice versa. If you memorize the alphabet you will recall the numbers or words. Now you have a group of words that have no relationship to each other. Therefore he uses the link system to memorize the words. Again your back to the problem with the link system where you have to be good at creating and memorizing stories. Honestly this is just Mnemonics. If you like to create stories of fish sitting on couches to memorize, than buy the book. For the rest of you, use the tried and true repitition way. I know it's slow and frustrating but what else is there. If anyone has a better way than Mnemonics, email me at dreamycastle21@aol.com"},{"Title":"How to Develop A Super Power Memory","review":"I'm currently using Lorayne's methods, and find them good for mental exercises. I won't deny that they do require quite a good deal of right-brain power. His system seems to work using creative principles rather than the dry discipline of rote-memorization.Unfortunately, I've found that being a product of public schooling, my creativity is rather stunted. Creating mental \\"pictures\\" for \\"silly\\" stories can be taxing, but it does work. Recently, I found I was able to maintain a list of a hundred items in a mental array, although it took some effort to put them there. But, now I can traverse this array of valuable items sequentially, backwards, or randomly with little effort.Some people aren't comfortable in exerting too much mental energy all at once, and would rather take it slower. I don't mind admitting that I'm one of those people. But, after memorizing a list of 100 items (and other feats I won't expand on here), I soon realized that I would have a hard time forgetting them. This intrigued me. I think that, after the initial effort, things were actually getting easier. I suppose that there's truth in the idea that the brain can be considered a muscle (not literally, I know), and that exercising it regularly strengthens it resulting in easier mental exertion. I would say that Lorayne has proven to me that the brain is more like a set of muscles. Some parts work fine, but others are atrophied soon after pre-school by underemphasizing creativity (right-brain?).To continue in the this train of thought, it seems to me that there is a mental cost to either rote-memorization or Lorayne's unique synergy of known memorization methods. Rote requires the expenditure of medium amounts of mental energy/effort across several sessions. This must be done with a certain frequency, depending on the difficulty-level of the material to be memorized. Lorayne requires the immediate expenditure of a larger amount of mental energy at the beginning of learning a subject, no matter how difficult the material, then tiny amounts in follow-up reinforcement sessions. The major cost of rote is time; the major cost of Lorayne's method is mental energy (initial effort). Mental energy renews itself and is easier to expend with use; time is non-renewable and can only be spent.There's something else I learned, and which may help those who have difficulty \\"imagining\\" stories as one reviewer complained of. If you can understand a moving image seen on TV, you can duplicate it in your mind (just recall what you've just immediately seen happen). If you can duplicate it in your mind, you can duplicate it with some minor alteration (change a color for instance, or size of the objects/persons in the image). If you can duplicate it with a minor alteration, you can duplicate it with major alterations (now, it's just a matter of extremes - smaller, bigger, brighter, nude). Finally, if you can duplicate it with major alterations, you can make a new moving mental image not related with the original in anyway (this is derivation or at the extreme end, creation).Luckily, several generations have grown up watching television, which is a rich source of moving images/stories one can practice with. The problem with it is that we watch it too often in a passive frame of mind. This isn't normally conducive to memorization. If we watch passively, we may not remember the whole show. However, if a scene was funny or scary, they are often clear enough in our minds the next day to repeat to friends by the water cooler. To the point, this is Lorayne's contribution to memorization. He added this little bit of essential glue to tie together all the other known memorization techniques into something finally useful. Make it silly, make it memorable. Memorable - in this context, I now understand what that word actually means.Now, if you make the story violent, or comical, or erotic (sexy is too tame), or frightening, or disgusting, you'll be using a portion of your brain most people don't normally associate with learning. However, the image will be irrepressible, and you're not likely to forget it; particularly, if you imagine mixing other sensations with the images such as the smell of a rose, the prick of a thorn, the clashing of cymbals, or the bitterness of day-old coffee. Read Lorayne's book on how to do it properly and you'll be able to apply it to practical situations like I did.For exercise, read many books in an active manner by questioning and imagining different situations or possibilities from what you've just immediately read (fantasize!). Watch television (particularly the news) actively as well (imagine the newscasters as nude for starters, then give them Mohawks -ha!) and do it whenever you can. I've started using Lorayne's techniques as a hobby, or a mental game, and I'm discovering it's quite fun. Get his other books to learn of more examples on how to use the techniques.A final piece of advice for those unwilling to try this very creative method of learning, and would prefer something closer to rote. There's a very efficient method called SuperMemo. Do a search on the web, and find the \\"pencil and paper\\" method. As I've said, it's very efficient, but it will take a couple hours of practice to get it right.Incidentally, I gave Lorayne's book 5 stars although I initially found stories hard to create (that's not his fault, that's our society). I gave it that rating because it works and is delightful to master."},{"Title":"How to Develop A Super Power Memory","review":"A great number of years ago I bought this book at the airport in Eugene, Oregon. On the flight to Los Angeles I read the book while a salesman sitting beside me wanted to talk. When I finished the book he said, \\" Do you really think that book will help you?\\". I said that I didn't know, but that we should put me through a test. I took out the in-flight magaizine in front on me and scanned the first 20 pages. I then gave him the magazine and asked that he give me a page number and I would tell him what advertisers were on that page. He went through all 20 pages and I could recall at least one advertiser on each page. Then I had him give me an advertiser and I would tell him what page it was on. The last time I saw that salesman was in the Los Angeles airport as he was rushing off to a bookstore looking for the book. Over the years I have give demostrations that leave people's mouths open. I can walk into a social setting, meet 20-30 people and be able to recall everyone's name immediately afterwards. People think I have a great memory. Over the years I think the memory muscle has truly developed itself. I got my start from this book and would recommend it to anyone and everyone.

My short-term and long-term memory began declining years ago due to depression and heavy medication. My test and exam results haven't been so good because of these memory problems. I didn't think I could do this 100 peg word stunt.But don't worry, and try it. Lorayne first teaches you to associate consonant sounds for each digit from 1 to 9, and 0. For example, the sound for #1 is T or D (the letter T has one downstroke). The sound for #2 is N (typewritten n has two downstrokes).This way, when you later have to memorise the peg word for #12, you know the word starts with a 't' sound and ends with a 'n' or 'd' sound. For example, 'tin'. For #21, the word would start with a 'n' sound and end with a 't' or 'd' sound. For example, 'net'.So 100 words may be difficult to remember, but the ones Lorayne suggest will not so difficult with this \\"sound guide\\". And these 100 words are very important because they play a big part in the later chapters in helping you remember dates, appointments, telephone numbers, addresses etc.Besides these, Super Power Memory also teaches you how to remember your grocery/to-do list, train your observation, remember speeches, foreign language vocabulary, names and faces, facts about people, how to not be absent-minded, how to amaze your friends with a 400 digit memory feat and how to memorise the Morse Code in 30 minutes.I've put some of Lorayne's methods to the test and have been successful in keeping names, appointments and grocery lists in my head. I'm very pleased I read this book and forced myself to memorise those 100 peg words."},{"Title":"How to Develop A Super Power Memory","review":"If you have any imagination at all, Harry Lorayne's memory techniques will work for you. His techniques can help you memorize long lists of unrelated items, memorize numbered lists, and come up with systems that will help you memorize nearly anything (speeches, lines for a play, daily schedules, etc.). They work wonders.A reviewer below said that his systems involve coming up with and memorizing a story. That's not really true. Creating a simple image or short scene in your mind (takes seconds) is more than enough to help you memorize each item in a list. You simply have to link each item to the items before and after it, you don't have to have a long, continuous story. If you have much imagination at all, it's really simple and fast. If you're not a visual person, it may be more difficult.However, there are two downsides to Lorayne's systems. The first is that most of his books, including this one, are very gimmicky. They have huge promises on the cover (many of which are true) that make them seem too good to be true, and he spends most of his time showing you parlor tricks to impress your friends, so for a serious study of memory techniques or for use in school or an academic setting, you may be better off picking up one of his other books.The other downside is that his techniques mainly help with short- and mid-term memory. You will have to go over a list or a set of associations in your head many times, often over a period of a few days, before it will become long term memory. However, using his techniques still makes this faster and easier than repetition - repeating something to yourself a couple times a day for a few days until you're sure you have it memorized is much easier than going over it 100+ times."},{"Title":"How to Develop A Super Power Memory","review":"This book is my Bible.

I've put fear into people by using the techniques in this book, not because I wanted to. Our society seems to deem memory as a...well, sin, something of a taboo. People, as mentioned in this book, are used to the idea of &quot;sporting&quot; a bad memory. People seem to be encouraged to forget things.

I'm also bewildered at the myriad of &quot;sceptics&quot; who seem to deem the techniques as &quot;unworthy&quot; of their time. If it works, use it. Never mind the simplicity that's involved.

Thesystem was first introduced by Stanislaus Mink von Wennssheincirca 1648. In the year 1730, the entire system was modifiedby Dr.Richard Grey, of England, who called the idea, letter ornumber equivalents.

As with learning a new system, IT WILL TAKE SOME EFFORT IN THE BEGINNING. But only a little, not a whole lot actually. It just requires practice. After a few days of practicing the system, it will become easier, and after a few weeks, it will become second nature like speaking. Some people may argue that \\"old fashioned mnemonics, or repetition is better.\\" It is a matter of opinion, mnemonics are good, but if you can't remember the word, what then? Repetition may work, but for some people, as soon as they read something, no matter how many times they repeat it, it never kicks in their memory!It's hard to describe it all in one short review, but the bottom line is - the book presents a system, before you give it a positive or negative review, give it a REAL try and see if the system works as it promises. And you are by no means constricted to using his system, you can combine it with your own, or select only a few principles that appeal to you. Each principle however, builds on top of one another, and is EASY to understand and presented in PLAIN language.This book has helped me stop forgetting things ONCE and for all.Read the introduction of this book, and you will see that the first few pages have wild, outlandish claims - BUT THEY ARE NOT!ANYONE, and I mean ANYONE, WILL be able to use this system and PERFORM all those amazing feats of memory."},{"Title":".hack//Legend of the Twilight, Vol. 2","review":"Volume two of the manga series picks up two themes that appear in other .hacl media, with a twist, of course.

She turns out to have some surprising powers.The presence of Zefie and Shugo's bracelet cause a stir back in the management of The World. Sure enough, a new version of the Crimson Knights, now the Cobalt Knights appear on the scene, led by Kamui Shibayama. They are corporate, not volunteer, and carry out a policy of &quot;if you can't control it - delete it.&quot; In no time at all they are at odds with Shugo and Reina.Of all the .hack genre, I find the manga the most disappointing so far. The story is pitched at a much younger audience than the 13+ that it is marked. It is a replay of several of the original .hack themes set several years after the other storys are completed. So while this series is a pleasant read, it doesn't live up to the almost introspective approach that even the game uses. Nor does it reflect any more light on the series as a whole..hack fans will want the manga series on general principles, but for the casually interested, the anime series is a better introductions. That or the game itself."},{"Title":".hack//Legend of the Twilight, Vol. 2","review":"I read the first one the same day that I bought it and couldn't even put it down until I was finished. I then bought the second one and can't wait until the next one is released in Canada. I started playing the PS2 games and was instantly hooked as well. This lead to me buying the .hack//sign series and there I was instanly entranced, the anime is simply beautiful and amazing.

As far as the story thus far goes, if you haven't read Volume 1, why are you reading Volume 2? Anyway, this manga contains Logins 7-12. And below is a brief summary of each of the Logins without ruining the whole story (hopefully).Login 7: A Passing Shower: Shugo and the gang are out catching rays on the beach when Ouka arrives with information about a secret event in a haunted mansion. As the gang works to clear the mansion, they travel back to Mac Anu for the fireworks show, when a familiar looking face turns up in the middle of the celebration.Login 8: A New Resolve: With the appearance of Zefie, Aura's \\"daughter\\" so appears a group called the Cobalt Knight Brigade, a band of warriors dedicated to keeping peace in The World no matter the cost. Shugo is now determined to see Zefie back to Aura although the Knight's have other plans for her.Login 9: On/Off Coin: A new root town appears and the gang takes this opportunity to travel there and question other players about the possible whereabouts of Aura. They also learn about a strange event that occured 4 years ago that has been hidden by the CC Corporation.Login 10: The Players are Thinking: As the quest to find Aura rages on, Rena grows ever more jealous of Zefie. Shugo is also being watched by someone up the ladder of CC Corporation.Login 11: 4 Years Ago: The gang starts to learn about the events of 4 years ago and the connection to Aura and Zefie. Balmung receives punishment for disobeying orders as the Cobalt Knight Brigade tracks Shugo, a now branded cheater in The World.Login 12: Cheating: Shugo and his friends are arrested for cheating in The World and are thrown in prison. Now with the possibility that all of their characters will be deleted, will they be found innocent...will they break out of jail...what's gonna happen? Well, just read and find out for yourself.I love this manga, it's as well drawn as the first one which is exceptionally well. And the opening pin-up drawings are very nice as well.

It's a reference book which assumes you already know HTML reasonably well, and consists mainly of formal syntax listings of HTML tags with their arguments and a few examples. It has over 700 pages because the argument definitions are reprinted for EACH tag, some literally hundreds of times, a huge waste of paper. It would be much more useful to spend a few more pages on the index and print larger than its 6-point type, since you have to refer to it constantly due to the book's rather arbitrary organization scheme."},{"Title":"Html in Plain English","review":"This book has all the HTML information I need and costs less than most other HTML/basic website design.

It describes you all the recent HTML (including 4.0) tags in plain english, with a brief explanation of when, where, why and how to use them. HTML tags are grouped in catagories (e.g, Frames or Tables etc.). If an attribute is only supported by Netscape or MSIE browser, it's description is preceded with as icon. The note section tells you the origin and history of the tag (HTML 2.0 or HTML 4.0 etc.). If you are planning to code HTML by hand, or you simply save source for an HTML to understand how it works, this is an excellent source. It is also for people who simply want the tags they need, when they need them. It is a one-stop HTML reference for headers to meta to java script to cascading style sheets and everything in between and beyond.

It also has sections on the Microsoft and Nescape extensions, plus cascading style sheets.Since I got the book, other developers are coming to my desk and asking to use it.

It is an excellent reference to HTML v.4.x. Organization is the only complaint: Instead of truely encyclopdic it is broken into seven categories like: General-Purpose Elements, Special Characters, Table Elements, Form Elements, etc. I don't even bother with this I go directly to the index and find what I need. Saves time (but I agree you really shouldn't have to do this).However, the examples are very good and the coverage is excellent. Well worth picking up a copy.

It gives you all the recent HTML (3.2) tags in plain english, with a brief explanation of how to use them, when, where and why. It's perfect for those who like coding their own pages, but don't want to learn off every HTML tag in existence. It's for people who simply want the tags they need, when they need them (with a small explanation to refresh the memory). This book is definitely a must for anyone coding a web page.

I thought the web was about graphics."},{"Title":"Html in Plain English","review":"This book was obviously thrown together quickly. It lacks even the basic amenities of a professionally produced book, like headers and footers that would let you find your way through the many alphabetical topics.

Rather than the check-everything-off-the-list credo of Lonely Planet travelling, this book is more of a starter point, showing the best tricks and methods to travel around Japan. His recommended tours are interesting and well thought out.I have a few complaints about the book, though. Others may disagree, but I found hitchhiking annoying when done too often, and would vary it with taking the train, which wasn't always expensive. I think Ferguson too rarely brings up the importance of speaking Japanese: while hitchhiking is possible (if not as fun) for friends of mine who can barely speak it, some of his recommended activities would be very difficult for non-Japanese speakers. Also, the book gives exact directions how to hitchhike an exact route. While merely a format for the book, hitchhiking (and touring) is a lot sloppier than that...plus it runs counter to the do-it-yourself philosophy of the book. All forgivable problems, but worth watching out for when using the book.I thought touring around Japan was great fun, very easy, very safe, and only occasionally too expensive. There isn't the overtouristing so common elsewhere. I strongly recommend people to &quot;bum around&quot; Japan, and this book is the best guide to doing it."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Japan","review":"I just finished this book today. My wife bought it prior to a 16 day trip to Japan, and is still reading it. Although the book chronicles his hitchiking from south to north in Japan, supposedly tied in with the sakura front (the blossoming of cherry blossoms as they move north) it is the best book I have ever read to gain insight into the Japanese mentality and attitudes. I've been there many times, but this book was like a refresher course on relationships with Japanese. This is a companion book to Lonely Planet's Japan Guide, at least to my way of thinking."},{"Title":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Japan","review":"If you like traveling cheap, and meeting great people as you do it, this book is for you. The small cultural details included are invaluable as you will constantly run into them. The travels plans laid out are specific and don't leave much room for guesswork.

The author mentioned above is of Jewish heritage, who would NEVER write about the racist Jewish supremacism (aka Zionism) that exists today in American, European, and Israeli society. I am sick and tired of seeing and reading racist anti-white comments by people who (including their ancestors) are guilty of that which they accuse white people and white culture of being. This is just more of the politically-correct, liberal, racist, anti-white actions that are allowed in this country. I think an Anti Defamation League for non-Jewish White people needs to be established to prevent this racist anti-white literature. For over 40 years, I have experienced and seen racist anti-white behavior and comments from \\"minorities\\", from the media, and in the public schools.

Below are the short biography of the author and the synopsis. Thank you.Shirley Cheng (1983), was diagnosed with Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis at 11 months old and completely lost her eyesight at age 17. She started schooling at age 11 without any prior education. She is a straight A student and hopes to earn science doctorates from Harvard University after a successful eye surgery. She is also the author of two other books, which will be published.The prodigious stone castle overlooked a prominent countryside of the kingdom known as Noxellia, where days were filled with the bliss of sunshine kissing the gentle rolling hills yonder, while impish winds playfully teased women's hair as trees whistled tunes of joy. It was certainly a scene of exquisite tranquility--or so it seemed.Thousands of people of all ranks and ages flooded into King Fulacian's castle for the charming Princess Sophia's seventeenth birthday. Dancing, music, and feasting of all sorts and varieties of dishes were the main menu of the day. At last, the special highlight of the event was brought forth--a reading of fortune by Dawn, a special friend of the royal family. Turning to the princess, the oracle uttered these startling words: &quot;Terror and adventure you shall face on your wedding day.&quot; Where upon, two gifts were bestowed upon Princess Sophia: a white dove and a multi-colored ring of rhinestones. How could a dove and a ring possibly help her? Little did she know that these presents would be of so much help as daring quests were conquered, and that the importance of life was taught and cherished more so in each tale."},{"Title":"Thorns of Two Roses","review":"This is a riveting account of one woman's battle with an abusive spouse, and what she had to do to make her life right again.

In between we are introduced to such legends as Merck, Moser, De Vlaeminck, Coppi, the P&eacute;lissier brothers, and both Riks, Van Steenbergen and Van Looy. Each edition of the race is given equal and detailed coverage. Possibly the best feature of the book is the period L'Auto and L'Equipe newspaper coverage, as well as archive advertisements, both for the race itself and the various riders sponsors. Also included is an assortment of cartoons of the race, usually depicting the devil pouncing up from beneath the cobblestones to torment the riders. The text has that translated feel to it but is very readable. A must for the spring classics fan. Now, if they would only do a similar book in English about the Tour of Flanders..."},{"Title":"Readings for a History of Anthropological Theory","review":"Erickson and Murphy's book has become the new standard text in theoretical readings in anthropology. It surpasses the others in its treatment of more current theories, and its length (it includes many more articles).

However, if you want the best collection currently available, you should get it."},{"Title":"Readings for a History of Anthropological Theory","review":"I was assigned 'Readings' for a graduate class in cultural theory. Created as a companion to 'A History of Anthropological Theory,' which examines the context and historical characters involved in the creation of anthropological theory, this book has a good selection of key excerpts and theoretical articles from across a range of time and theories.My main critique is not of the book itself, but of the binding and layout. As I read my first article, the binding cracked and several pages began to peel up from the binding - an unhappy surprise! In addition, the pages have very small, close text, making it difficult to read and leaving little room for notes. Many of these texts are available in other books or academic databases, so you might consider the older edition or an alternate text - not because the texts are inadequate, but because the binding and layout of this edition may not stand up to serious study."},{"Title":"Belarus at the Crossroad (Carnegie Endowment Series)","review":"The United States vilification of President Alexander Lukashenko and Belarus has nothing to do with \\"democracy\\" and \\"human rights.\\" Lukashenko's refusal to surrender Belarus to U.S./E.U. capitalist domination via privatization and criticism of U.S. policies have infuriated Washington. Even more irksome to the White House, IMF, and World Bank is that Lukashenko's economic model is actually working!!!For accurate and objective information on President Lukashenko and pre and post Soviet Belarus I highly recommend Stewart Parker's new book, \\"The Last Soviet Republic - Alexander Lukashenko's Belarus.\\" The reader will receive a huge amount of well researched, objective material that contradicts and debunks the stereotypical drivel and propaganda written by Washington's hacks."},{"Title":"Pearl Harbor Fact and Reference Book","review":"The correct full title of this book is: &quot;Pearl Harbor Fact and Reference Book: Everything to know about December 7, 1941&quot;. It provides a strict &quot;Question &amp; Answer&quot; format. Little snippets of interesting trivia; but many of the answers are too short -- it provides the &quot;fact&quot; but misses in analyzing the importance of the &quot;fact.&quot; It reviews how various U.S. military leaders dismissed the &quot;crazy&quot; idea that the Japanese were capable of attacking the U.S. fleet based at Pearl Harbor; all too many officers thought that the Japanese simply couldn't plan and carry out such of a hair-brain idea. It reveals that the U.S. defenders thought they were far-better prepared in repulsing any surprise Japanese attack than what they actually were. It notes how U.S. destroyers discovered midget Japanese submarines before the attack, how the Army's radar tracked the in-coming Japanese aircraft, and it reveals how there seemed to be no real serious coordination as to how these incidents were to be analyzed and reported to higher commanders for their alerting our defenses in a timely manner. It presents a list of the U.S. warships based at Pearl, and lists the names of the attacking Japanese warships. (Because of its strait &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; format, it is not as fun nor as interesting to read as is the much-needed companion paperback &quot;Pearl Harbor Amazing Facts&quot; by T. Benford.)"},{"Title":"The history of magic,: Including a clear and precise exposition of its procedure, its rites and its mysteries,","review":"Eliphas Levi's &quot;History of Magic&quot; is probably the most singularly beautiful, profoundly romantic and Personal rendering of the history of Magic ever penned. It is as much a sourcebook for the Symbolist/Decadent fin-de-siecle generation as is Baudelaire's Flowers of Evil &amp; Paris Spleen, and ironically, Levi collaborated with Baudelaire on the work entitled:&quot;Les Mysteres Galants&quot;.(webb. Occult Underground,266) It is essential to grasp when involved in such a historical treatise as this, that in Occultism, as in religious thought: EXPERIENCE TAKES PRECEDENCE OVER DOCTRINE. If one is seeking verifiable facts given in chronological order that is simple to digest and retain, look elsewhere. For Levi is speaking of history in relation to his own private researches, to which he had dedicated his life since entering the priesthood in the Roman Catholic Church at the age of twelve. His is also a history of magic with literary antecedents; to the likes of Aurthur Rimbaud for instance, this work of Levi/Constant's was a veritable bible, whose symbolism permeates works such as &quot;A Season In Hell&quot; to a deliriant degree. There is perhaps not one writer or Artist regardless of medium between the years 1860-1930 who was not at least familiar with Levi/Constant; this fact extends from his own friends, such as Balzac, de Nerval, Victor Hugo, Dumas- to Breton, Crowley, Bataille, Meyrink, Henry Miller and innumerable others! The names cover from Western to Eastern Europe, as well as North America; and it is Levi who established what we define, in its cultural sense, as &quot;Occultism&quot; today. It is also largely because of his pioneering Occult works that the &quot;19th century Occult Revival&quot; merged with the Arts of the day, giving birth to the idea of &quot;Art as Religion, &amp; the Artist as Priest/magician&quot;. It was in the Occult that the Artist(spelled for the 1st time with a capital)found a definition of his own position, and most granted the highest respect and admiration to the Rabelaisian personage of Alphonse Louis Constant, which is Levi's real name. Aleister Crowley's lifework was centered around Eliphas's dream of a reconciliation between the arts of science &amp; religion, for which he laboured and set down all that was required in his Occult as well as religious and revolutionary tomes, comprising together at least 20 works. The essential question in Levi's History Of Magic is NOT the accuracy of his scholarly objectivity, but his system's origins, structure, goals, and the benefits it bestows and light shined upon the Occultist's understanding of Magic in relation to the history of magic; that Levi's historical system differs from other interpretations is due to the fact that he was not so much interested in the historical facts as much as how the history and the knowledge it produced could benefit the modern-day Occultist operating in the world today. In this respect the text is given over to interpretation of all variety of magical personages, events, accomplishments, inventions, and works. Also essential to know is that it is thanks to the genius of the Philosopher/mathmetician Hoene Wronski and his CaBalistic insights that Levi gleaned much in his Philosophical approach. One may benefit also by disregarding any facts pseudo-scholar Waite provides on Constant's background as he had at the time of writing his prefaces' not one single work in regards to the life of Levi; his critical insights however are as valid as any, and for all his seeming hostility he in reality is truly, next to Crowley, perhaps Levi's biggest fan! waite is also to be commended for providing the bibliographical sources for those seeking &quot;established facts&quot;( which merely means some few people agree upon what they themselves only know from yet another source of questionable reliability) It is quite evident from a philosophical standpoint that the Occultist's rewards reaped from their experience outweighs in practical value what is the scholar's bane regardless of any amount of scholarly exactitude. In this sense, as much as in the exquisitely-toned bardic prose of Levi, he has created a historical work that will outlast innumerable others, standing as it does on the merits of great literature as well as being universally regarded as a pioneering classic of Occultism."},{"Title":"The history of magic,: Including a clear and precise exposition of its procedure, its rites and its mysteries,","review":"This is the single greatest book on the history of the Spiritual Art and Science of Magick. My only two complaints about the book are that it's written in a rather biased view, from a purely Christian perspective (not that any other religion's perspective would be any better!) and the translator/editor, Arthur Edward Waite, once again sees fit to make some useless and innacurate remarks here and there. But still read his footnotes! He makes some legitimate points in this book!"},{"Title":"The history of magic,: Including a clear and precise exposition of its procedure, its rites and its mysteries,","review":"I have read everything in the history of occultism, from the The Book of Splendors to the Picatrix, from Hermes Trimegustus to Madam Blavatsky, Agrippa to Albert Pike. This is the only book on occultism you will ever need. Levi knows more about the history of the magi than any writer anywhere. Those who believe he is inaccurate have only an outer knowledge of the inner tradition.

First and foremost, Levi is not a profesional historian, he is an occultist, and one of the greatest who ever lifted the veil. To dismiss this beautifully written and informative book as ignorant, obsolete and lacking in citations, would be an extreme case of 'throwing the baby out with the bath water'. Whatever complaints may be made about it's historical accuracies seem trite and petty considering the wealth of immensely inspired material Levi provides.

For the most part, The History of Magic is a pleasure-read. However, the book has several shortcomings in the form of factual errors and biased observations. Especially, with his discussion on the tradition of magic in eastern countries, Levi shows his incompetence as a historian and a good narrator. His vicious and prejudiced depiction of Indians as the descendants of Cain, and his contemptuous description of Indian system of yoga and mantras further proclaims that Levi has no place among great authors."},{"Title":"The history of magic,: Including a clear and precise exposition of its procedure, its rites and its mysteries,","review":"A.E. Waite could have spend his time better than translating this &quot;French masterpiece&quot;. As always Eliphas Levi is ill-informed and doesn't care much about facts. The book is full of factual errors and Alphonse Louis Constant shapes history as it suits him. This doubtful &quot;History of Magic&quot; is therefore only interesting for uncritical followers of the master, reseachers who specialize in the history of occultism in the nineteenth century or for experts on the history of magic in general who can make distinctions between facts and non-sense.

Far from the claim (in a review below) of his \\"empiricism,\\" Levi does not seem to have been in the least informed by the sciences of his day. The real mystery is why the great esotericsit A.E. Waite bothered to translate it from the French at all. Need an example? India is described as \\"the Mother of all heresies\\" [laughable, were it not so pathetic an example of judeochristian resentiment]. And he seriously believes that the the books of the Old Testament describe the literal anthropology & history of the peoples of the Mideast, Ishmael=Islam and all the rest [fundamentalism so naive it would make a Trent Lott blush!]. The book's organization reflects the author's romance with Quaballah, but the chapters themselves are random collections of \\"ideas\\" on topics unrelated to the chapter titles [a stream-of-consciousness style the anticipated the great Joyce by half a century, albeit to no effect, aesthetic or otherwise]. The single high point of the book is Levi's description of spiritual love: \\"The true man elevates himself not by trying to possess the object of his desire but by raising himself to Her through devotion\\" [its a pity he didn't know anything about Sufism or the key difference between magic and devotion]. Try Israel Regardie instead, who is at least steeped in Renaissance memory training, neo-Platonism and other worthies.

This is one of my favorites of all the books I own and recommend it as a must read !!!"},{"Title":"Cosmic Connection","review":"I think it is very sad that few Americans interested in UFO's, and related subjects, are familiar with the books written by Michael Hesemann. Both this book and \\"Beyond Roswell\\" are among the best books I have ever read. This author is not only a great researcher, but he is not afraid to \\"theorize\\" about what is going on, based on his research, and that of others. Even though he is a German, he has spent as much time in the US (especially the SW) as most American UFO researchers. He has also devoted more time listening to Native Americans about the UFO subject than most American researchers I am familiar with.This book on crop circles gives you MANY different sides of the phenomenon to think about, especially the historic side. He even makes comparisons with Native American art (petroglyphs), Australian aboriginal art, Celtic art, etc., in an attempt to decipher the meaning of the crop circles. He has left virtually no stone unturned!In addition, the quality of the book itself (and of the book \\"Beyond Roswell\\") is superior to anything you can purchase in this country. There are innumerable illustrations, both in color and black-and-white, the layout and organization are terrific, the paper is very thick and sturdy, and there are few typos (I only noticed two, in the Foreward to \\"Beyond Roswell\\").So, don't miss the opportunity to buy these books!! It is sad that many bookstores are selling them as \\"remainders,\\" when it is difficult to find anything matching the quality and content of these books in the US."},{"Title":"Riding the (Silver Screen) Range","review":"Ann Snuggs has written an entertaining book that ranges from the early days of western movies and television to the modern day version of the same. I picked up the book because I like trivia and I like to read. I had no real knowledge of the western genre. I enjoyed the gentle introduction and the humor that seeps through in the questions and answers. Ann's genuine love of Westerns comes through the written pages and makes you want to like the shows too. I reccommend this book not only for the people in your life that love Westerns, but also for people who live with people who love Westerns. It would be a terrific gift for the holidays."},{"Title":"Riding the (Silver Screen) Range","review":"Empire Publishing presents \\"RIDING THE SILVER SCREEN RANGE\\", an informative record, inclusive page after page is the \\"Ultimate Western Movie\\" trivia book --- as author Ann Snuggs goes deeper than a surface enjoyment of watching them on the screen --- Her interest and fascination has led her to produce this book of trivia questions (with answers) about the West as it has been pictured by Hollywood through the years --- if you can answer most of the questions, consider yourself a Western film authority --- If not, the questions with answers will supply a reference source of interesting Western film information --- This book is well researched and should provide Western movie fans with hours of entertainment and vicariously fulfill one's child hood fantasy.Tables of Contents with page numbers:A Note from the Publisher - 9Foreword by Dick Jones - 10Introduction - 13I.

Boring, silly, unoriginal and so on. I was really quite surprised to find that there really was something special in the pages. Inside there were clever original &quot;word plays&quot; and poems. Most poetry books for me are either veiled in vague analogies that are just silly once you realize them or just so blatant in their intent that you are frustrated with it. This book does something totally different. One or two readings per poem is unacceptable. The reader has to check out the same poem more then twice, maybe even more then five or six times. You need to read these works over and over to fully appreciate the complexity of them. I am not a book reader but this is a piece of work that I appreciate. It really reminds me a lot of an artist trying to put together a collage. There are pieces all put together in an artistic work and I feel like it is my job to figure out the reason they were put together."},{"Title":"10-2 and Other Poems","review":"I would have to rank this book in my top ten of all time.

All in all this is a must have for any collection."},{"Title":"Picturing the City: Urban Vision and the Ashcan School","review":"This outstanding history and evaluation of the Ashcan School is deeply informed by current urban studies and rooted in the critique of everyday life.

There is a brief history of the use of rare earth elements, notably in the lamps of the late 19th century. The basic properties of these elements are reviewed. The reader is informed how the REEs are extracted from ores, including monazite. Pointedly, there is a good deal of detail on how the elements are separated from each other. Owing to the chemical similarity of the lanthanides to each other, this had presented a major challenge to chemists. Finally, there is discussion of the uses of these elements, uses which, of course, are dwarfed by their counterparts today.

And this book was recommended to me as a useful reference. I can't see what all the fuss is about. I honestly think this book is overrated as well as overpriced.It is clear a lot of work went into the book which deserves some credit. Also the theme is a great one.The first part of the book is actually a great reference about hypnosis. But the actual \\"scripts\\" are of limited value: the therapist can glean some ideas there, but they are not scripts you can directly use for your own clients/patients. You'd be better off buying a book of actual usable hypnotic scripts."},{"Title":"Handbook of Hypnotic Suggestions and Metaphors","review":"It isn't necessary to be a clinician to benefit from this book. Some of the suggestions are written for self-hypnosis and the rest seem to adapt trivially for use for self-hypnosis. Taping selected suggestions will help but if you study the long suggestions and got the gist of them, you can probably memorize enough to be useful. Reading thru these suggestions seems to provide a great sense of what effective hypnosis is really about.Self-hypnosis isn't taught in this book, but there are many inexpensive books that do teach it. I learned from Chapter 4 from Leslie LeCron's \\"Self-Hypnotism: The Technique and Its Use In Daily Living\\". Some people say hypnosis is a hoax and I don't have any experience to say whether advanced practices can work like using hypnotism to prepare for surgery. But if you consider inducing self-hypnosis to just be going into a quiet, \\"inwardly-focused\\" state and doing suggestions as just a form of self-talk, then it's certainly doable. The question remains whether it helps. I've found that my self-improvement efforts usually take a long time (months or years) to establish better habits, during which I review lists of goals often and also use suggestions during self-hypnosis (e.g. quiet self-talk). I very slowly see some improvement and I enjoy the self-hypnosis, so I've kept at it without being sure it's the self-hypnosis that is leading to the changes. But thinking of it just as talking to myself over and over until I gradually change, it does seem as if that self-talk has some impact.A subset of this book half or less its size (and half or less of its price) would have been adequate for me as a layperson. Sections like \\"Preparation for Surgery\\" or \\"Hypnosis for Obstetrics\\" I could do without. But so far I do feel this book is a good value for me. Just for the ego-strengthening material, it will probably take me more than a year to get reasonably acquainted with the appropriate suggestions."},{"Title":"Handbook of Hypnotic Suggestions and Metaphors","review":"The Handbook of Hypnotic Suggestions and Metaphors seems to be on the shelves of many aspiring and accomplished hypnotherapists. I have read almost all of it, utilized some of the methods, and have spoken with many hypnotherapists who have read and used it. The general consensus is that the book provides some good ideas, some very good ideas, some mediocre ideas and a few worthless ones. I have certainly expanded my methods from using it. For people who already know hypnosis, this book is useful as an adjunct. I provides many approaches and scripts, but I have found that all need to be adapted based on the client, the hypnotherapist and the context. This means you need to know how to adapt them, and this \\"how\\" is beyond the scope of the Handbook. However, the Handbook does not promise to teach people how to modify scripts and methods, so that is not a shortcoming of the book. If someone wants to know more about the art of hypnosis and how to adapt various materials, you need to read a book or take a class which is specifically about that.The biggest strength of the Handbook is that it provides a large amount of material and covers many types of application. The biggest weakness is that several of the scripts include language that violates some of the rules of suggestion. For example, there are several suggestions that are given in the negative, such as \\"do not think of orange...\\" This kind of mistake is only a problem for people who have limited training in hypnosis. People with proper training read these mistakes, note them and correct the script. People with limited hypnosis training do not recognize many of the mistakes and will use scripts with mistakes. I suspect that such mistakes occur because many of the chapters were written a long time ago and/or because the authors trained differently. While the Handbook has some shortcomings, they probably do not cause many problems because many people will still benefit from scripts which are imperfect. Hypnosis is a powerful approach and most of the time it takes more than a few \\"nots\\" to mess a session up.The Handbook is a good secondary resource for approaches to and scripts for hypnosis. Most people I know refer to the Handbook when they working with a new type of problem (e.g. bed wetting) in order to get some general ideas about how to work with the problem. So, as a secondary reference, it gets FOUR STARS. I give only THREE STARS over all because I think too many people rely on it as a primary source of information, rather than as an ancillary reference."},{"Title":"Handbook of Hypnotic Suggestions and Metaphors","review":"I'm an avid collector of hypnosis books because I am a professional hypnotist always on the lookout for more techniques.

Brown makes a compelling argument, he sure doesn't describe the church that I went to Sunday School at. Can the things he incorporates into his story really be true? His 'facts' 'feel' correct to me. But before I went out spouting his facts as the 'gospel truth' I thought I should read some commentaries on Brown's book. There's a lot of them. The theme of The Da Vinci Code is so sensitive that readers come down hard on either side, love it..hate it, and that's the way most of the commentaries are. I found several that were written by theologians clearly writing to protect their turf. The same with the alternative history writers. Both were so deeply into their beliefs, they couldn't tell you background facts with out soaking them in politics. But dear sensitive reader...look no further! Simon Cox is your Joe Friday(\\"Just the facts,mamam\\").Cox's book is composed of short essays of the obscure names, places, things that a regular reader might be unfimilar with. So if you want to know if there really is disembodied hand holding a knife in 'The last Supper' or if Opus Dei is a real thing you can read a page or two about it,have your curiousity slackened and not have to wade thru religio/politicio b.s.

This book has been faulted for Cox's unabashed support of The Da Vinci Code, but clearly that is what inspired him to put this volume together."},{"Title":"Cracking the Da Vinci Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Facts Behind the Fiction","review":"oh and the book looks good too. it was a gift for my sisters birthday but she's bussy and will most likely never get a chance to read it. but it's cool if your a reader and have the time."},{"Title":"Cracking the Da Vinci Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Facts Behind the Fiction","review":"I confess to having read two of Dan Brown's books , and even saw the Ron Howard's and Tom Hanks movie. I claim to be a Christian and yet Brown's writing and ideas are just so contrary to a faith based world view. This little book is quite useful for someone like me. With an alphabetical marching of topics in page after page, Cox reveals the sources for the facts and the fiction (mostly fiction) behind Brown's fictions. Since I first found out that Geoffrey Moore did not invent the the idea of \\"eartly adopters\\" , I have been a believer that ideas get recycled from story teller to story teller. Cox does us a favor by laying out just where many of the ideas came from and often from whom. If you have read the \\"book\\" then this book is quite helpful to you. I was interested in the links between DaVinci, Isaac Newton and others Cox found."},{"Title":"Cracking the Da Vinci Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Facts Behind the Fiction","review":"Dan Brown's bestselling novel, The Da Vinci Code, has become a global phenomenon; and introduced readers to a mysterious world where Leonardo Da Vinci encoded hidden meanings into his paintings, strange symbols are engraved in a remote Scottish chapel; and the Catholic Church and an ancient secret society are locked in a centuries-old battle to gain control of the ultimate prize: the Holy Grail.But how much of the novel is actually true and what is fictional distortion? Cracking the Da Vinci code is the first book to cut through the confusion and disclose the amazing facts that underpin the plot. In a simple A-Z format it reveals the historical basis of the secrets contained in the book, including background information on all the key figures, reproductions of the symbols encoded in the paintings, and insider knowledge such as the riddles hidden in the characters' names.Cracking the Da Vinci Code is an invaluable resource for the many enthusiasts of the novel and all those who want to learn more about the remarkable truth behind the legend of the Holy Grail.--- from the book's dustjacket"},{"Title":"Cracking the Da Vinci Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Facts Behind the Fiction","review":"I just now started reading Mr. Cox's book and therefore cannot offer a full review. However, There is a passage right at the beginning of the book that demands to be addressed. On page 10, Mr. Cox writes,\\"However, what they [the books' detractors] haven't addressed with their reading of the Scriptures and Gospels is one of the central themes of this hypothesis: namely, that this information was deemed so damaging and disruptive to the early Church that it was actually suppressed by the original redactors and editors of the New Testament - being in effect written out of the original texts, to be replaced with a sanitized version that was much more appealing to the early Church Fathers\\"This statement is blatantly false, as anyone who has read the other books which critique Brown's book will know. Having read nearly all of these books myself (except for those yet to be published), this statement of Cox's really surprised me. He is either dishonest or ignorant. All of these books, without exception, devote pages (some more than others) to addressing this very issue.Interestingly, as to Cox's (common) charge that the hypothesis presented in Brown's book was suppressed by the 'original redactors and editors of the New Testament\\", he betrays an ignorance, not only of how the Bible came to be as it is today [there were never any 'original redactors and editors', as such], but also of the Church Fathers. This hypothesis was far from suppressed. The Fathers dealt with it (and countless other heresies) in volumes of writings (Irenaeus' 'Against Heresies', for example). Indeed, until the discovery of the [Gnostic] Nag Hadmaddi writings in 1945, the near-totality of our knowledge of 'this hypothesis' came from such church literature. Refuted and denounced, yes; suppressed, hardly.If this is at all characteristic of Mr. Cox's book, then I will leave my rating as it stands. If not, then I will re-review the book and rate it accordingly.(Yes, I am a Christian, but my problem is not with Mr. Cox's theology, whatever it may be. My problem is with his false statement).-----------------------------------------------------------------------After finishing this book, I wish I could revise my review down to zero stars. 80%-90% of he content of this book is only slightly related to The Da Vinci Code. More than once, the author prefaces a section with a comment like, \\"Though this issue isn't found in The Da Vinci Code, it's still important to consider...\\" Interestingly, though he provides alot of historical minutia, his research could not uncover one of the biggest weaknesses of Brown's book; the issue of the Priory of Sion. Nearly all of the other Da Vinci Critiques delas with this issue. The fact is that Pierre Plantard, who founded the Priory was shown to be a criminal and a forger in a French Court in 1992. He admitted forging the document that alleges that Da Vinci, Victor Hugo, Isaac Newton, et al were past grand masters of the organization. This is the lynch-pin in Brown's theory (which he claims to sincerly believe). It is false, so the rest falls."},{"Title":"Cracking the Da Vinci Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Facts Behind the Fiction","review":"Do you know that some members of the Knights Templar, after the suppression of their order in 1307, moved to Scotland and helped Robert Bruce in his successful battle to force out the English? Well, this books says they did. It doesn't give a source, and the suggested reading at the back is heavily filled with questionable new age works. And you might wonder why an order whose main function before 1307 was international banking would care about a dynastic squabble on the periphery of Europe. But of course, such suggestions appeals to the romantic for whom tales of Clerical treachery, secret organizations and romanticized national myths all uncritically merge together.As a book this book has little to offer, and hardly provides the facts behind &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot; It contains padded discussions of the Cathars and the myths of Isis and Osiris, although these elements do not really play much a role in the book. About the dramatic claims Dan Brown makes, such as that Mary Magdalene was the wife of Jesus, or that she appears in Da Vinci's &quot;The Last Supper,&quot; or whether there is a secret Priory of Sion with earthshattering secrets that has been led in the past by Da Vinci, Newton, Hugo, Debussy and Cocteau, the book is somewhat wishy washy. Cox doesn't exactly endorse these claims, but he certainly doesn't look at the evidence that would refute these claims. There is a certain sort of disingenousness, which gives Brown more seriousness than he deserves. At one point, for instance, Cox notes, correctly, that thousands of women were killed in the witch-hunts. This differs from Brown's claim that &quot;millions&quot; were killed, but Cox does not point this out. Cox also claims that these witch-hunts were done to stop a revival of Goddess worship. In fact as recent witchcraft scholarship as pointed out by Ronald Hutton has made quite clear, there is no evidence that any of the condemned witches belonged to a satantic or pre-Christian religion.And Cox continues with other examples of shallowness and misinformation. The New Testament was not &quot;supposedly&quot; confirmed at the Council of Nicea. Constantine was not baptized in 326, but in 337 on his deathbed (oddly enough, this is one fact Dan Brown gets right). The Nag Hammadi material are not &quot;undoubtedly&quot; a product of the Coptic church. If they were, they would have been preserved by them. Arianism denies the equality of Jesus the Son with the Father; it does not deny his divinity altogether. The Christian idea of forgiveness after repentance does not come from Isis; it clearly has its roots in Jewish doctrine. At the beginning of his book Cox says that The Da Vinci Code will no doubt make a great movie, since it will supposedly star Russell Crowe and be directed by Ron Howard. I've both read the book and seen &quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; and this strikes me as the perfect example of naivetee to start off this questionable book."},{"Title":"Cracking the Da Vinci Code: The Unauthorized Guide to the Facts Behind the Fiction","review":"If you loved DaVinci Code or if you hated it, you must admit it did get a reaction from you....which in itself is one definition of a successful novel. Many readers have found themselves more interested in the information detailed in Dan Brown's books, and if so, this book is a good choice to begin to learn about the amazing history of the Christian Church.Especially Gnosticism and the early Christian Church, and especially the creation of the New Testament Bible. For a different review....here is my review of books that build on these interests, especially the \\"lost\\" books of the New Testament Bible and the concepts of Gnosticism.Nearly all knowledgeable Biblical scholars realize there have been a wide range of writings attributed to Jesus and his Apostles..... and that some of these were selected for compilation into the book that became known as the Bible.....and that some books have been removed from some versions of the Bible and others have been re-discovered in modern times.The attention focused on Gnosticism by Dan Brown's DaVinci Code may be debatable, but the fact is that increased attention on academics tends to be predominately positive, so I welcome those with first-time or renewed interest. At least first-timers to Gnosticism are not pursuing the oh-so-popular legends of the Holy Grail, Bloodline of Christ, and Mary Magdalene.This is great......I seldom quote other reviewers, but there is one reviewer of Pagels' books who confided that he had been a Jesuit candidate and had been required to study a wide range of texts but was never was told about the Nag Hamadi texts. He said:\\"Now I know why. The Gospel of Thomas lays waste to the notion that Jesus was \`the only begotten Son of God' and obviates the need for a formalized church when he says, \`When your leaders tell you that God is in heaven, say rather, God is within you, and without you.' No wonder they suppressed this stuff! The Roman Catholic Church hasn't maintained itself as the oldest institution in the world by allowing individuals to have a clear channel to see the divinity within all of us: they need to put God in a bottle, label the bottle, put that bottle on an altar, build a church around that altar, put a sign over the door, and create rubricks and rituals to keep out the dis-believing riff-raff. Real \`Us' versus \`them' stuff, the polar opposite from \`God is within You.' \`My God is bigger than your God' the church(s)seem to say. And you can only get there through \\"my\\" door/denomination. But Jesus according to Thomas had it right: just keep it simple, and discover the indwelling Divinity \`within you and without you.'\\"Here are quickie reviews of what is being bought these days on the Gnostic Gospels and the lost books of the Bible in general:The Lost Books of the Bible (0517277956) includes 26 apocryphal books from the first 400 years that were not included in the New Testament.Marvin Meyers' The Secret Teachings of Jesus : Four Gnostic Gospels (0394744330 ) is a new translation without commentary of The Secret Book of James, The Gospel of Thomas, The Book of Thomas, and The Secret Book of John.James M. Robinson's The Nag Hammadi Library in English : Revised Edition (0060669357) has been around 25 years now and is in 2nd edition. It has introductions to each of the 13 Nag Hammadi Codices and the Papyrus Berioinensis 8502.The Complete Dead Sea Scrolls in English (0140278079) by Geza Vermes has selected works....a complete work is more difficult to achieve than the publisher's marketing concept indicates. His commentary generates strong reactions.Elaine Pagels has 2 books (The Gnostic Gospels 0679724532 and Beyond Belief : The Secret Gospel of Thomas 0375501568) that have received considerable attention lately. For many, her work is controversial in that it is written for popular consumption and there is a strong modern interpretation. She does attempt to reinterpret ancient gender relationships in the light of modern feminist thinking. While this is a useful (and entertaining) aspect of college women's studies programs, it is not as unethical as some critics claim. As hard as they may try, all historians interpret the past in the context of the present. Obviously there is value in our attempts to re-interpret the past in the light of our own time.If you want the full scholarly work it is W. Schneemelcher's 2 volume New Testament Apocrypha.Also, to understand the Cathars......try Barbara Tuckman's Distant Mirror for an incredible historical commentary on how the Christian Church has handled other points of view"},{"Title":"Isabel of Spain: The Catholic Queen","review":"I want to counter the reviewer of this book who was so angered by it. I found this book to be in agreement with other historians who look at Isabel in the light of her times without modern prejudices and preconceptions. She was an exceptionally great historical figure; this book tells you why. It will help you to understand Isabel's world and how she took a corrupt and chaotic state and ushered it into a golden age.Another great biography of Isabel is William Thomas Walsh's \\"The Last Crusader, Isabella of Spain\\" published in 1930. I recommend reading both biographies."},{"Title":"Isabel of Spain: The Catholic Queen","review":"This is the most thoroughly researched biography of Queen Isabel found in English. Written by an American historian, it's surprisingly readable."},{"Title":"Isabel of Spain: The Catholic Queen","review":"Dr. Carroll has again done a magnificent job of making history interesting. His portrayal of Isabel is gripping, his scholarly foundation is excellent, and his style is highly readable. I especially appreciated his comments on the Spanish Inqisition - a viewpoint you won't hear from most historians! Isabel is one of the most admirable women figures in the history of the world, and an excellent model for all women concerned with true feminism. Her humanity, intelligence, compassion, wisdom and courage are inspiring. Thank you, Dr. Carroll, for your service to the truth in bringing her so vividly to life."},{"Title":"Isabel of Spain: The Catholic Queen","review":"In the most glowing terms, the author enamored of this Queen, makes excuses for her bad behavior. Using the &quot;times&quot; as a rationale, he mentions that she expelled the Jews, pursued the Moors, executed people who said they had converted to the Catholic religion. The inquisitions began under her reign. What, for heaven's sake is there to be proud of? However, this slavish tome does just that. She did have to fight for her rights as a monarch in a time when women were relegated to royal cows. That much I'll say, but this book mostly angered me. Now, if she had been forward thinking, I'd say that was something to read about."},{"Title":"Mantissa","review":"Mantissa is a short, light romp through the writer's mind. There's no heavy subtext to mull over. There's no ponderous character development to follow. There's just Miles Green in his hospital room, which becomes other things, and Erato, the woman who is his muse. A few other characters lurk in orbit around the room, but the whole story takes place literally in the brain of Miles.Most of the book is dialogue between Miles and Erato as he alternately romances and berates his muse, the essence of his creativity, and is repaid in kind. It's an animated metaphor for the process of writing, and many times the characters seem to know they are merely characters in a book. It begins in a hospital where Miles has just recovered, having lost his memory through some accident, but that scenario quickly ends as Erato takes on numerous personalities and attitudes in her interaction with Miles.This is probably best for those familiar with John Fowles's other works. Mantissa is clever, it's funny, it's self-aware, and it's not going to shake the literary world. It's just a quick afternoon read that gives you a peek into the mind of a writer."},{"Title":"Mantissa","review":"John Fowles minus his usual novelistic costuming relaxes, writes brilliantly, reveals craft secrets, pokes gentle, if firm, fun at both himself &amp; the business of literature, adores/insults his muse &amp; is properly inspired/kicked for his trouble. MANTISSA is sweetly funny, roughly true, a deft tale of the endless left/right (or male/female or rational/intuitive) mind combat which is the natural environment of creation, the brainswamp from which much of our best writing emerges. Complete with a terribly nice pun on the names of a writer &amp; a shrink, adequate eros (every bit of it strictly imaginary), &amp; some charming intermusine backbiting, in the end. Astounding! Hilarious! The Nubile Prize for Metafiction!"},{"Title":"Mantissa","review":"Fun from beginning to end, John Fowles explores the never-smooth relationship between the author and his muse. Miles Green verbally and physically jousts for 200+ pages with his muse, Erato, as well as Dr. A. Delfie and the voluptuous Nurse Cory. If this doesn't excite you, I don't know what will. Extra fillips of pleasure for those who detest various sorts of modern criticism. It's a wonder John Fowles' Twaynes English Author Series Volume hasn't been recalled. He does not spare the rod. A warm, funny, smart book."},{"Title":"Mantissa","review":"John Fowles is undoubtably one of the great writers of the 20th century. No-one with any love for literature should fail to read &quot;The French Lieutenant's Woman&quot;, &quot;The Collector&quot; and especially &quot;The Magus&quot;. Unfortunately he ran out of inspiration after &quot;Daniel Martin&quot; and this effort is simply unreadable. I made several attempts at reading it, but I couldn't get past page 60. Other Fowles enthusiasts I know share this view."},{"Title":"Mantissa","review":"\\"Mantissa\\", is a meta-fictional curiosity that makes for an interesting read. I enjoyed the symbolic room which brought the reader into the fictional writer's brain. There he conversed, warred and made love with his fictional female character in ping pong fashion. One minute he had the upper hand, the next moment she did; back and forth it proceeded until, in the end, they both fell helplessly into each other's arms. Her character changed repeatedly, from a Goth boi to a demur, sensitive young girl. In the end, it could be said that the fictional male writer was at war with his inner male and female self. For the most part it was a fun, if not neurotic read. However, the author, John Fowles, carried his concept to an extreme; he pushed it a few chapters too far with excruciating redundancy. Thus, by the last chapter, I had lost all interest and had no desire to finish the book. A few chapters less, rounded out, in Fowles own fashion, would have made for wonderful novel, beginning to end."},{"Title":"Mantissa","review":"John Fowles can be spectacular, but Mantissa is like being trapped in a streets that follow like a tedious argument of insidious intent. As the author dashes his brains on the subject of inspiration and proves that he is aware of Calvino and other challenges to his own metafictional control, he shows that he has not yet managed to digest, to control, to settle, the matter. Unfortunately, in the process, he betrays, over and again, the disequilibrium of conceiving of sex as other or self, of projecting onto the beloved the desires of the master. We go around, but we never move. We debate, but we do not learn. I are vexed, but we do not get exercise, I fear. I have loved Fowles's novels, but this is a crashing disappointment and a bit embarrassing."},{"Title":"Mantissa","review":"Many books have been labelled \\"verbal masturbation\\", but this is the real thing. John Fowles indulges his sexual and literary fantasies, entering them from every angle he can manage until he expends himself. What results is not \\"one man's interaction with his muse\\" as one review called it, but unreadable and pretentious and not remotely sexy subporn... that wouldn't have been publicised - or noticed - if they hadn't come from someone as well known as Fowles.Some of the parts, such as his encounter with a black nurse, and a guitar wielding dominatrix muse read like something out of a bored private schoolboy's diary.It's a pity, because John Fowles was once a great writer... but this book and \\"Daniel Martin\\" do him a great disservice.Mercifully short, and that's it's one bonus."},{"Title":"Ouch! Life Can Hurt, but Healing Is Your Choice","review":"Since before its release this book has been helping individuals who are faced with issues that effect our everyday lives, I happen to be one of those individuals. I am a student at Champlin Park, where Mrs. Germanson is Spanish teacher. I have not had the pleasure of having her as a teacher, but I have been lucky enough to know her on a more personal level. I have had a very difficult life, to say the least, and Mrs. Germanson heard my story through another teacher and she has been most understanding and she offered me a book, trying to do anything she could to help. When I began reading the book I was basically overwhelmed with the knowledge this woman holds. I found myself hooked-unable to put it down. She is so smart and she has been through so much-she is an incredibly strong woman, who has survived and is using her pain to help others. I found this book very helpful in overcoming my problems and moving on. This book is 140 pages of great advice and compassionate insight. It comes from a woman who has been to &quot;heck&quot; and back and is still here to talk about it, not only is she talking about it she is trying to put her live's trials and tribulations into words to help others. With sections on surviving a crisis, healing in all aspects of your life, moving forward and abuse and abandonment this book can help anyone. It is full of thoughts and words of encouragement for everyone. Her writing is incredible and she finds ways to avoid her own personal problems, but we still get a sense of what she has gone through. She puts all the problems into perspective and uses her own experiences to help us. But she doesn't focus on her problems because she knows that we're dealing with enough. She also includes illustrations and charts showing how we can heal in a healthy way and still keep our sanity. This book puts into contrast all the small and BIG problems that we all experience. The best part about this book is that she gives up space to write our own thoughts, sort of a journal entry, to put down our thoughts and feelings and things we can do to make our lives better. These sections for our thoughts are at the end of every section, and they really help you understand your situation. Well, with the format that she uses you can hear about how others have overcome their problems and get some great ideas for how to deal with your own situation. This book is basically all about dealing with your own issues. She talks about setting boundries and not enabling people to hurt you, she gives us ways to be strong and stand up for ourselves. She talks about believing that you can make it and shows us ways to do so. She talks about how you can avoid self-sabotage and fix your problems in a positive way. I think this book is great and I definitely recommend it to anyone who feels like they could use a little help simpy surviving, I've been there and this book really put my life into perspective for me. This book is wonderful for people who need to know that they are not alone, and that others have gone through similar problems. She talks about so many different things and I could go on forever, but I won't.

Dawn and Mary Ann are stepsisters, they weren't in the last book I read; Stacey is in Stoneybrook, she was in New York the last I knew... It doesn't impact the book, as each one does stand alone, but I'd read them in order if I were to start again! That said, the Mystery books aren't numbered the same way as the others, so my only complaint is that I wouldn't have any idea where they fit into the series!Kristy is the coach of a softball team named the Krushers. Bart coaches the Bashers. They form an all-star team from both of their teams and dub them the Krashers. Traveling home from Redfield after a game Kristy, Bart, Charlie and eight kids find themselves stranded by a storm. The only house in sight is a mansion where they had seen lights, so they head to it, hoping that they can call home to let their parents know they're okay. A smaller house on the property is occupied by an old man, who tells him he's the caretaker and lets them stay the night in the big house.While they're there, the kids find a diary and other clues to a mystery.

I like that the BSC books always reference other books (and sometimes, movies) - in this case, Beezus and Ramona, Little Women, The Wizard of Oz, The Little Mermaid, Frog and Toad and Ghostbusters. I did find a few things odd. For one, Kristy says \\"I'm always reading these articles about people being struck by lightning and having their zippers welded shut and stuff, and the idea just scares the daylights out of me.\\" Her greatest fear, if struck by lightning, is that she won't be able to open her zipper? That's stupid, and the BSC books aren't usually stupid. Also, having read a bunch of these books and never having come across the mention of a group hug before, it was a surprise to read \\"... a group hug. That's a BSC tradition...\\" On the positive side, I liked the reference to Resurrection Mary's story, even if she was never named, and even if her story gets told all over the country with a different name!

If nobody's heard of him, it's because we live in a culture that is fundamentally ignorant and under-educated. CROWDS AND POWER should be required reading in every school in this nation. Canetti's cycle of memoirs collectively comprises some of the best intellectual history of the twentieth century. PARTY IN THE BLITZ is the great man's last piss-blast in the face of a world he saw as hostile, stupid, and bent on destruction. The price of this book is justified alone by what Canetti says about T.S. Elliot. Elliot was one of the biggest anti-semites of all time, a cold prude who hated Jews, wrote bad pretentious poetry so arcane it needed footnotes (which he himself supplied), and desperately wanted to be an Englishman when in fact he was from St. Louis, Missouri. Canetti recognized what a sham Elliot was, and doesn't hesitate to let us know what Elliot was really like, through the eyes of an objective observer and not some fawning Catholic biographer.It's true that Canetti rips just about everyone to shreds in this book, but he has some amazingly kind things to say, too. He remembers, for instance, a mere street sweeper, who he talked to just in passing for many years, and whom he considered one of the most intelligent men he ever met. Canetti was a man who refused to suffer fools; he despised airs and pretentiousness. He was probably one of the most intelligent men of his age, which was almost certainly his great curse. He saw through the masks people wear, the illusions they use to disguise their flaws and insecurities, with ease. It was this great lucidity of his, this ability to perceive and understand things as they really are, that made him impatient, and ultimately, incredibly bitter."},{"Title":"Party in the Blitz: The English Years","review":"I would wager that this is a Nobel Prize winning author most Americans (including me, prior to reading this book) have not heard of, let alone read. And from this memoir of that part of his life while living in England-- mostly during World War II--, it will probably stay that way.Elias Canetti comes off as an arrogant, dour, and self-centered intellectual with brutal views of some women and fellow authors and no discernable concern that-- apparently-- he made no meaningful contribution to the war effort of that good country which hosted and protected him during a time of extreme trials.He seems to me an example of the type of high intellectual who thinks nothing of being utterly cruel toward individuals in print, then wonders why countries so stupidly go to war.From this patched together book, one can appreciate the essence of Mr.Canetti's fine writing skills without being brought to liking this now deceased author.The useful afterword by Jeremy Adler is very good in that it puts both the book and the author into some context for the non-expert reader."},{"Title":"The Tunnel of Destiny","review":"Kim Hyung-cha lived through some tumultuous times, recounted in this revealing book. Born in north Korea, he was studying at Waseda University in Japan when he was drafted into the Japanese army toward the end of World War II. Returning to his home town of Hamhung after the war, he anticipated the coming Christian persecutions in the Communist north, and he escaped south and pursued a quiet life as a shoemaker.In 1950, South Korea needed every man with military experience, and he was conscripted (\\"press-ganged\\") into the ROK Army and became one of the first KATUSA (Korean Augmentation to the U.S. Army) officers. He was among American and ROK troops that advanced north with the X Corps and walked on the frozen Yalu in late 1950. China's entry into the war forced a retreat through his own home town, and he succeeded in getting family members aboard a vessel to Pusan and safety.Kim shaped this memoir as Christian testimony (the final chapter is a long essay on God's providential role in his and his family's survival) and as a tribute to his twin brother executed by north Korea. But it's more. It provides an inside, personal look at how many Koreans felt and met the shocks of two wars. It brings textbook accounts of the Korean War to life through the experiences of one man and his family.-30-"},{"Title":"Conducting a mini needs assessment (Info-line)","review":"I was highly disappointed in this item.

Using the tapes in the car and in a walkman, and working with the book for a few hours each week, I was able in say, 5 months to learn a surprising amount of dutch. More importantly, this book got me excited about learning dutch, and made me feel like I could.I have since investigated and used pretty much every book/system/program on the market for beginners and more advanced students and am still most partial to 'Dutch In Three Months'. It's also quite reasonably priced compared to some other systems. I still get the book out every so often and revise some of the exercises to practice the basics.I agree with the other reviewers that &quot;dutch in 3 months&quot; is a silly, inaccurate title -- to really learn will take longer, so don't get frustrated. I also recommend &quot;Taking Dutch Further&quot; by the same author for more advanced study. Anyway, it must have worked because I married that Dutchman!"},{"Title":"Dutch in 3 Months (Three Months Course)","review":"This is an excellent book. I must warn buyers that they would need to spend at least 3 hours per day studying to really keep up with learning a chapter per week if they want to learn quickly. I would really suggest that you skip the cassette and find someone who is a native Dutch speaker to assist you. Hugo really does a great job with these books. I used his &quot;Russian in three months&quot; and was able to live in a Russian speaking country quite easily after studying his book. Anyway, if a person is serious about learning Dutch, this is a good book. Another word of advice, writing and re-writing the vocabulary and exercises plus actually using the language will keep the vast amount of information retained easier."},{"Title":"Dutch in 3 Months (Three Months Course)","review":"You can't really learn Dutch in 3 months but this is the best book on the market to get started with. It gives all the fundemental stuff you need to know to write and speak in dutch. You must have other learning tools for understanding spoken dutch by a native speaker. Such as audio cassettes or a professor of some sort to practice with. It is tough to learn written dutch as it is but it is even tougher to understand it at conversation speed. This book is a first step and vital tool for this process."},{"Title":"Dutch in 3 Months (Three Months Course)","review":"Being an American who has recently moved to Holland, I have searched &amp; searched for the best self-study Dutch language course. I have yet to find it, even here in Holland. I purchased the Dutch in Three Months before I left America and so far, it seems to be the best program. It gives a good vocabulary base (although some words just are not used here, &amp; they can be a bit outdated), it gives a very basic knowledge of the very difficult grammer, and exercises with some translation that are very helpful. Overall, this program is good, except that it could have been more in-depth. It could have offered more Grammer exercises along with the translations. If you are wanting a basic knowledge of Dutch, this is a good 'getting started' program to have. Although it is a MUST to have the audio tapes that go with it. Dutch pronounciation is very different than English."},{"Title":"Dutch in 3 Months (Three Months Course)","review":"While this is the best Dutch course currently available, it could easily be topped. The Pimsleur method is far superior, but currently is unavailable in Dutch. The Foreign Service Institute produces much better tapes and books than Hugo, but again, they are more expensive and not available in Dutch anyway.So, what the student of Dutch is left with is a choice between three or four books and tape courses. The Hugo system worked fine for me, or I should say, I worked hard to master it. This then is the real key to learning: effort. Spend several hours, maybe two, per day, on this couse. Immerse yourself in the language by thinking and talking to yourself in Dutch. Dedicate youself to it, and you will overcome any shortcomings in the book."},{"Title":"Dutch in 3 Months (Three Months Course)","review":"The title is a misnomer. It took me about a year to get through it, but it was worth it. It is a well-paced, well-designed course. You should also get the cassette version, which is quite good."},{"Title":"Dutch in 3 Months (Three Months Course)","review":"As a beginner I was looking for a course which would help me start speaking the language. I think I found it. The dialogs and exercises are very well chosen to give the student a good understanding of the structures most commonly used in Dutch. The tapes are of a very good quality. So, what else does one need to start learning the language?"},{"Title":"Dutch in 3 Months (Three Months Course)","review":"It is more grammatical. It can help as a reference and it is simple, but if you want to learn the language to live in a country who's language is Nederlands (Dutch), then don't buy this as your priority book... only as a simple reference book it is ok."},{"Title":"Dutch in 3 Months (Three Months Course)","review":"As I near the completion of this book/tape course, I feel that I can write a decent review on the product. I was very impressed with the first several sections of the book. Each chapter offered several clear explainations of grammar and structure, and a nice amount of translating exercises were featured at the end of the unit, so that one is able to review the techniques and vocabulary which he or she learned throughout the chapter. There is also a short vocabulary list at the end of each chapter. I feel that I have easily gained a nice knowledge of Dutch vocabulary by working my way through the various chapters. The book also has a short reading/listening \\"conversation\\" at the end of each unit. This exercise is supposed to provide the user with some colloqialisms, although I found them to be rather limited. However, the stories are very amusing, and they kept me entertained while working through the book. Three other good points about the book are as follows: The book has a list of grammatical terms and definitions in the back of the book, the book is accompanied by tapes, and a few short readings are also used to conclude the book. The readings are a nice way to show the user that he or she actually learned a lot of Dutch in a short amount of time, and the tapes easily help one improve his or her pronunciation and listening comprehension. The grammer terms are also nice, if someone needs to brush up on his or her English grammar while learning a concept in Dutch.Although I feel this is a solid product (especially for the price), I find it has a few minor flaws. If it was possible, I would have rated this product 3 1/2 stars as opposed to 4. First of all, I found some of the vocabulary translations to be a bit strange. Maybe it is because this book was printed in London, but for an American, translations such as \\"settee\\" and \\"down at heel\\" left me surprised and guessing. I also found some of the words to be strange choices for an introductory course in Dutch (i.e. telephonist, wig, etc), words which I will not use for a long time in Dutch. The two things which bother me most about this package, however, become more apparent as I progressed closer to the back of the book. I felt that some of the chapters could have been organized better (why not include all grammatical structures relating to adjectives in one section as opposed to having one chapter focus mainly on adjectives, while another chapter contains one or two small grammatical notes about adjectives while focusing on an entirely different subject?). I also felt that some of the grammatical explainations were weak towards the end of the book. There were a few topics which seem to have been glossed over, which I will be reading about in a different book, since Hugo's course dropped the ball.As a student of German for three years, who decided to pick up Dutch through self study, I was able to work through most of the book in two or three weeks, without any trouble. As the book is titled \\"Dutch in Three Months,\\" I believe this sort of goal is reasonable and obtainable for someone who is starting without any sort of leg up, but at the same time, the book will not have one conducting political conversations in Dutch either. However, one would have a knowledge of the basic Dutch grammar structure, as well as a limited but nice amount of vocabulary, so that he or she could hold basic conversations about every day situations. Overall, this package is a good value for the money."},{"Title":"Dutch in 3 Months (Three Months Course)","review":"A sound grammatically based introduction to Dutch which I have found invaluable, since I have studied three other European languages using a grammatically based approach. Each chapter introduces the \\"next step\\" grammatically, and also throws in manageable amounts of everyday Dutch. If you have a knowledge of German, you'll find Dutch has huge similarities, apart from the devilish pronunciation of course. Probably the hardest language to pronounce that I've ever encountered. But Jan Fenoulhet does an excellent job. ( And for those who never mastered grammar at school, don't be deterred. You can make up a lot of ground from using this book. )The book is accompanied by CDs which are audio versions of the exercises, drills, and conversations of every chapter in the book. I've ripped these from the CD to my computer, and split them up individually, then burned them onto a CD for the car. This is brilliant, since you can set a car stereo CD to \\"repeat track\\", and really get the language imprinted in you mind.The MP3 originals I've copied to my MP3 player for use in other circumstances."},{"Title":"Dutch in 3 Months (Three Months Course)","review":"This book has even spelling mistakes and translating mistakes in it!

Truly compelling in it's intricate details of a young woman trying to find herself. Literally. She goes on the 'universal' self journey and discovers that she was lost and finally finds her identity and sensuality in the man she loves. D.H.

How she was brought up in a wealthy and rich household, only to try out different occupations against her father's wishes, then ends up as a lower classed female in life. Very tragic."},{"Title":"The lost girl","review":"This book was given to me on the last day of High School in 1972 by a girl friend. I've kept this book ever since and it ranks up there with my all time favorite books even though I agree with one other reviewer that this is not the best example of Lawrence's work. However, with that said, this book also has a heart and tenderness that really meant something to me. I'm amazed no one has ever written a screenplay of this work since it's worth it. It was the only book Lawrence ever won a prize for, which says something about it. Take a chance and read it."},{"Title":"The lost girl","review":"I really loved reading this book (on my Nook) with Norah Jones playing in the background. It's a really tragic and romantic love story without being too...gushy. I admit that the ending was abrupt, a bit jarring. But, by the end of the story you will (probably) be happy anyway.My only complaint was that Alvina sometimes behaves sporadically, and Cicchio is unpredictable. I found that Simone de Beauvoir explained D.H. Lawrence's style well in \\"The Second Sex.\\" It would be helpful to read that first to understand Lawrence and why his characters (particularly Alvina) behaves the way she does."},{"Title":"The lost girl","review":"After plowing through a couple of his novels, I think it's fair to say that I am not a fan of D.H. Lawrence. In some sense, I see his appeal. Certainly, it is easy to see how his frankness about things sexual--not just in physical descriptions but in the emotional and intellectual impact of sexual relations--made him controversial during his time. And, in fact, his mourning over the things lost to industrial advancement and the Great War still resonates. On the other hand, his characters too often do not do justice to his themes. Lady Chatterley and Mellors are brilliant characters when they speak like humans and not mouthpieces for Lawrence's philosophy.On the other hand, Alvina Houghton, the title character of this novel, is too much of a cipher for her to be useful as a protagonist. Alvina is \\"lost\\" throughout the novel. First, as the forgotten daughter of a foolish father. Second, as a young woman headed to \\"old maid-hood\\" through her twenties and into her thirties. Finally, as a new, pregnant wife in her thirties left in a small Italian town as her Italian husband goes off to fight in the war.The problem is, the motivations for her choices are next to impossible to understand. She fears being an old maid but rejects suitors for reasons that are not clear. After the death of her father, she runs away with a traveling theatre troupe because she's attracted to the Italian actor. She gives herself to him but then runs away to a safe job as a nurse where she becomes engaged to a doctor who worships her in his way. Then, she runs away again with the Italian. It is all plot and no character substance.This is one of Lawrence's early novels and in some ways is more readable than his masterpiece, Lady Chatterley's Lover. The story charges along easily without the thematic depth of Chatterley. It's easy enough to get through. On the other hand, this is a classic example of a novel that would be out-of-print if the author were not famous for other things."},{"Title":"The lost girl","review":"I found that the first half of the book enjoyable, but the second half not so. From the moment that she meets with the 'Red Indian' troupe the story descends into the unbelievable."},{"Title":"The lost girl","review":"In a very famous context, D. H. Lawrence is himself famous for using a word beginning with \`f', a word that is infamous rather than famous. Mentioning this word and then repeating it got the author into some serious trouble that was not resolved until decades after his death. In this book, The Lost Girl, Lawrence is clearly preoccupied with the word and the novel is very much focused on it and its associated act. Its anticipation, achievement, consequences and perceived implications seem to be the very stuff of the heroine's life, but in this book the word never actually appears. So, like Lawrence, let's use a euphemism, but let's also be more direct than the writer. Let's use \`fabrication', an activity that is central to the work of any author.The Lost Girl is Alvina Houghton. The surname is pronounced with an \`f' sound in the middle, not an \`o', so its first syllable rhymes with \`fluff', not \`now'. She is the daughter of James, a shopkeeper in a small Derbyshire town called Woodhouse, in the north English midlands. James has a shop selling Manchester goods, the mass produced textiles of the late nineteenth century. He is not the best businessman, however, and his activities shrink over time. His daughter, Alvina - that's with a \`y' sound in the middle, not an \`e' - is rather plain-looking and apparently not too interesting either. She thinks quite a lot about fabrication from quite an early age, but she is a determined spectator when it comes to relationships. Her counsel, especially after her mother dies, is from older women, some of them determined spinsters.After some prevarication, Alvina eventually trains as a midwife. The skill offers her a chance of independence, but she chooses to revert to her preferred state of familial dependence. After all, Alvina will probably inherit her father's business. Thus she continues her arm's length relation with life.There is a short affair with a local man, a rather goofy figure who goes on to Oxford University and probably lives long enough to make a packet. But clearly the safe option is not for Alvina, who equally seems utterly afraid of risk in any form. She clearly cannot bring herself to the fabrication she privately craves and so the affair, surely destined for marriage in the eyes of the locals, comes to nought.Women close to The Lost Girl die. Others remain like perched birds watching over events. And, when James decides to leave the shop and sell off the little coal mine he also owns there is much consternation. There is even more to chirp about when he announces he is going into the entertainment business by opening up a little music hall, especially when Alvina declares that she will play the piano. Until this point, she had not mentioned being a musician. It is worthwhile remembering that we are in age when playing the instrument was almost part of any single woman's trousseau.And so the music hall presents its act, a motley crew of Red Indian impersonators, including a German called Max and an Italian called Cicio. Initially, the show packs them in, but the passing of time sees interest start to dwindle. But suddenly new opportunities arise for Alvina to think of fabrication, and fabrication with foreigners involved to boot!And so the story of Lawrence's The Lost Girl eventually fabricates its way from Derbyshire, and we leave Alvina in what looks like a new - though very old fashioned - life in changed circumstances. She seems now completely enslaved in her chosen womanly role, but we are at the start of the First World War and surely the role of women in society is about to change for ever.The Lost Girl deals with many of Lawrence's recurring themes, but its fabrication is often rather clumsy and its style often less than comfortable. It is, however, worth seeing through, if only to realise just how much both Lawrence and his fabricated characters - especially the women - are still locked in a soon to be changed mind-set about gender roles and social class."},{"Title":"The lost girl","review":"I enjoyed this novel by David Henry Lawrence but when you consider where it ends and the characters it ends up focussing on, you realise that you have been taken on a huge journey. It seems a little too extreme as one of the weakest characters ends up being the final one we follow."},{"Title":"The lost girl","review":"Having read \\"Women in Love\\" as my first DH Lawrence novel, I was unsure if I liked his writings. \\"Women in Love\\" to me had a lot of intellectual ramblings, unlikeable characters and a bad ending. \\"The Lost Girl\\" is an easier read with more accessible characters.The first few chapters were very slow, story telling and character development. Then a traveling stage production with a cavalry trained Italian horseman, and romance to follow. Definitely worthy of a Merchant Ivory or BBC Period drama production. I'm surprised this novel hasn't had any adaptation of film or TV movie production. Ciccio, the quiet Italian suitor is far more appealing and interesting than the male characters in \\"Women in Love\\".And the ending wasn't as bleak as \\"Women in Love\\"."},{"Title":"The lost girl","review":"I had read D.

Alvina will tell you."},{"Title":"England made me (Heron books)","review":"'England Made Me' is a relatively early novel in the illustrious writing career of Graham Greene, who was considered repeatedly for the Nobel Prize in Literature but ended up on a list of rejected greats that includes Joyce, Proust, Lawrence, and Maugham. Written during the outbreak of industrial globalization and trends that scattered British citizens throughout the world in pursuit of a good salary, 'Made Me' must have struck a nerve with readers in 1935 and has something of a prophetic voice today.Just over 200 pages, Greene's novel follows the lives of Anthony Farrant and his twin sister, Kate, who share a deep affection for one another but have drifted geographically apart. Anthony has connived through one job, one country, one apartment, and one girlfriend after another; Kate, meanwhile, has enjoyed 'success' as the personal secretary and mistress of Erik Krogh, an industrial magnate based in Stockholm. Ever willing to help, Kate talks her lover into hiring Anthony as his bodyguard and 'watches over' the erratic sibling.While emphasizing the petty ways of Anthony, Greene draws a bleak industrial landscape between the First and Second World Wars, with human decency and feelings of self-worth quickly eroding. In Greene's universe, all three main characters are cold and lonesome. Kate is certainly the more successful Farrant, but she has climbed her way to the executive offices through lust and a fair share of ruthlessness. Krogh is comparable in ways to Howard Hughes, a man who has everything, yet is constantly shadowed by the threat of failure and clueless on how to interact with others.'England Made Me' is not only a social document that portraits a loss of national identity and individualism, but also a bizarre love story involving Kate, Krogh, and Anthony. Throughout the novel, Kate is torn between her love for Krogh and her 'sisterly' love for Tony, which grows in desperation and often borders on the incestuous. The Farrants' relationship is certainly one of the most unorthodox in world literature and leads to a shattering climax.Well-made secondary characters bring energy to the novel, especially Minty, a fellow down-and-out Englishman who is a member of the Stockholm press, and Lucia Davidge, a vacationing girl whom Anthony falls for. Greene effectively gives us a tour of the Swedish capital, leaving us at several landmarks where the action takes place. 'England Made Me' has Greene's familiar style of journalistic narration, simple yet wonderfully alive. A Catholic viewpoint is again used in his storytelling, although not with the enrobing quality of his later work.'England Made Me' is not one of Greene's better novels, as a good portion of the writing is cliched and certain points in the storyline appear forced in order for things to move along. But the inferior Greene will beat the superior work of other writers nine times out of ten and should be enjoyable to fans of 20th century British authors."},{"Title":"England made me (Heron books)","review":"A novel about the black sheep of a British family, England Made Me is an indictment of the &quot;solid morals&quot; that English society held fast to in the early twentieth century, and an incisive look at what &quot;doing the right thing&quot; actually leads to."},{"Title":"England made me (Heron books)","review":"Not one of Greene's classics, but worth reading for the atmosphere of exiled Englisness that the author creates, specifically in the character of Minty."},{"Title":"England made me (Heron books)","review":"I have read a lot of GG and consider myself an admirer, but this one was a real chore to get through. It honestly gave me a headache several times. The sister and brother Farrant are fairly compelling characters but the Swedish industrialist Krogh is a complete cipher-- also murky beyond comprehension are whatever financial shenanigans he is up to. The book has moments of clarity but large swatches (page after page really) were for me nearly incomprehensible. The story appears to be narrated from several points of view which adds to the confusion. Stick with his better known works unless you are determined to read everything he ever wrote."},{"Title":"England made me (Heron books)","review":"Graham Greene is my favorite author, and I've read most of his novels, but for me, this was a real slog to get through. In fact, the only reason I finished reading it was to learn from his usual excellent use of similes and metaphors. To me the conflict was meager, the plot boring, and the characters not all that interesting. I kept waiting for a brilliant twist in the plot, or some thrill, but alas, I finished reading the book wishing I'd read something else instead."},{"Title":"Activated Sludge: Treatment of Industrial Wastewater","review":"sluge is a main factor in waste water treatment"},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"For me, this book is a \\"Gone With The Wind\\" with young adults in mind, but great for all ages. Like the \\"Little House ...\\" books, it describes the rural life of a family and village before industrialization changed everything. The quality of life these people had, despite the workload, is something to be admired.The book is a wonderful sequal to \\"The Good Master,\\" another wonderful tale. While the first book is more of a typical chidren's book, this one is much more of an epic as the family deals with the ravages of war. The themes of tolerance and family values are well expressed without ever getting preachy.Kate and Jancsi are fantastic characters for children to identify with, and the adults make fine examples for them to look up to. The illustrations are wonderful. This book will make you laugh, cry and everything in between. It's one of the books I re-read every now and again, and it's stood the test of 30+ years worth of reading. I treasure it."},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"I bought this &amp; The Good Master for my daughter many years ago. These books have always had a special place in my heart because of their &quot;readability&quot;. The stories are about growing up and being loved and all that after much disruption in a young life. There is a message of hope and love that is good and kind and there is also a clear and warm picture of what life could have been like in pre-World War 1 Hungary. The illustrations are as outstanding as the story. I love reading it to children, gives me an excuse for re-reading it myself. The second book is more serious as the children grow up and war intrudes but life is like that, isn't it."},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"While this sequel to _The Good Master_ provides a welcome return visit with the original characters and setting, it is considerably more serious in tone, as it deals with the impact of World War I on a peace-loving family and small community.The farm of the &quot;good master&quot; has become a refuge for a widely- varied assortment of people ranging from small German orphans to Russian military POWs - and the &quot;good master&quot; himself is missing in action. The young adolescent Kate, her slightly older cousin Jancsi, and their friend Lily must grow up in a hurry. But the strength of their earlier upbringing,leavened with consistant parental examples of kindness, common sense and good humor, is sufficient to see them through this time of trial.This book makes very strong statements about the brotherhood of mankind and the cruel impact of war on the young and innocent - and those statements cannot be repeated often enough. The poignant episode which lends this book its title crystalizes the author's message of peace, tolerance, freedom, and community - a message reminiscent of Anne Frank's oft-quoted, &quot;In spite of everything, I still believe that people are really good at heart&quot;. Those who read _The Singing Tree_ will agree. Highly recommended for independent readers 11 and up, and for reading and discussing in families and classrooms."},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"I love Kate Seredy. My father built the home I grew up in . It was constructed in part from lumber salvaged from Ms. Seredy's barn. We have a full collection of her stories some autographed. My mother read them to me and now I am reading them to my children. The language is simple, yet the word pictures are splendid. Her illustrations are wonderful, sensitive, and clearly convey the feeling of the text. Well worth the read for anyone who has children or has been a child."},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"This is one of the most powerful books on human cost of war ever written. As a child, I loved this sequel to Seredy's _The Good Master_ because I loved the characters and found the story exciting. As an adult, I cannot even think about the book without finding tears in my eyes. The little details are what does it I think: the child who goes to sleep saying goodnight to his soldier father, unaware that his father is permantly asleep under a blanket of snow; the singing tree of the title, the retelling of the spontaneous cease-fire on Christmas when the troops on both sides of the line sang Silent Night, the moment when Janci realizes the pain his mother is hiding, the corporal who sadly observes that in war it's a man's duty to kill and a crime to comfort his wife .... Read it!"},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"This book, along with its prequel, The Good Master, is based on Seredy's childhood in Hungary. The Singing Tree opens with a traditional Hungarian wedding ceremony. Riding home from the wagon, Kate overhears the news that Francis Ferdinand has been shot. Hungary is soon plunged into the war. Kate's father and uncle become soldiers, along with the new groom and three of the village shopkeeper's sons. The Nagy farm is soon full of &quot;refugees:&quot; the new bride, six Russian prisoners to do field work, six German children escaping ravaged Berlin, Kate's grandparents, and a daughter of a judge who starts off as spoiled as Kate once was and is quickly reformed by firm Nagy love.The Singing Tree contains a message of peace and hope, but it does deal, however gently, with racism and prejudice and the death and injury and madness that war causes. Children who have read The Good Master should probably wait a year before reading The Singing Tree."},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"This book was read to me as a child and I read it to my four boys too. They adore this book, and also the first in the series, The Good Master. If you are looking for a book for ALL ages of children, and that tells a great story with great values without hitting you on the head with them, this book is a great one! Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"Great book about how a family was able to endure the trials of WWI and open their home to \\"the enemy\\".

It was such a treat to check in with the adult Kate and Janci. They complemented one another perfectly. Kate, the delightfully irrepressible moppet who brought many smiles to many faces in &quot;The Good Master&quot; does not fail to deliver in this book as well. Janci has grown into a thoughtful gentleman and the Hungarian backdrop is a very effective way of describing Eastern European culture. This is an excellent book and I certainly hope you will read it. It's great."},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"The pair of books by Kate Seredy have always been my favorite childhood books. As my oldest grand-daughter is turning 8, I remembered these books suddenly for the magical story in the first book, \\"The Good Master\\" and the sequel, \\"The Singing Tree\\". As I am an artist, the quality of the author's illustrations add much to the stories. I have to believe that reading these two books and savoring the illustrations contributed greatly to my love of reading and of art. While the rural life in Europe long ago may seem hard to imagine for a young child in today's world, the beautiful, exciting and compelling stories in the books will make a faraway place and time come alive. Some children enjoy fantasy novels and this one is more like historical fiction of the best rank, although they may view it as fantasy. These books are told through the experience of \\"real children\\", no different than young children these days in their wonder, little dramas, struggle to grow and their feelings. I would recommend this book and the first one particularly for any girl aged 8 or older to read by herself. I'd recommend it as a great read-aloud book you share for any girls 5 or older. It is a joy to re-read myself, about 50 years after I first discovered them."},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"The toll that war takes on families during WWI is seen in The Singing Tree.

I immediately read The Singing Tree and thought it was pretty good too. I realize now that I was too young for that, and wish I had waited. But I read it again in fifth grade, and then again in sixth grade, and twice in seventh grade... you get the picture. Each time I still cry at parts. It is such a powerful book about what World War One did to families who wanted nothing to do with it. Yes, you could read it in third grade and love it, but reading it later on or re-reading it makes the story much more powerful. Although it is a children's book, I'd say that even high-schoolers could enjoy it. It's very though-provoking and sad, although at times it is very childish, which is why elementary students can enjoy it. In fact, older students may dislike how childish the beginning of it is. However, I believe that everybody should read it at some point."},{"Title":"the singing tree","review":"I bought this as a Christmas present for a young cousin, because it was one of my favorite books when I was young.

I think it may depend on your skill to some degree. If you are a proficient piano player with already some skill on piano, you probably won't learn much from this book. For me, being an early intermediate player, I did get some info from this book which I can directly apply to my playing. A couple of bad points about this book is that there are no fingerings!! I mean really, a piano book without piano fingerings? That is just a pet peeve of mine, so that is minus 1 star right off the bat. Also keep in mind that there are only 17 pages to this book. So there isn't a whole heck of a lot of info in it. You really have to look at every measure and decide what you like and what you don't like and try to incorporate those into your playing. All in all this book could have been a lot better. For one, incorporate fingerings and two, possibly he could have combined book one and two together to form one book. It does come with a CD though which is a good feature. If you can find this book for really cheap it may be worth picking up.

I thought this book was the perfect read for anyone who was about to have twins in their family. It was not a heavy research book, like Nancy Segal's Entwined Lives (which was excellent, by the way). It was more of a charming compilation of quotes and stories by twins about being twins. There were so many questions that you wouldn't actually have the nerve to ask twins, about romance or how their parents treated them, that were answered. I think anyone who considers buying this book should have their expectations set. It is not full of pure scientific research, it's all qualitative research., meaning face-to-face interviews. The stories are true. You hear about twins having similar pain or coincidental life experiences. This book has a lot of examples of each. You hear things about \\"good twin,bad twin.\\" In this book, parents really do label their kids like that. I think one of the most important messages in this book is that we all should recognize twins as individauls and not as one person. I think we should all be aware also of how a twin must feel when the other twin dies. This, too, is covered in the book from their viewpoints. It is a fun-to-read book that also opens eyes. It would make the pertfect baby shower gift. I enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"Twin Stories: Their Mysterious and Unique Bond","review":"As a twin, I really hate some of the questions that singletons ask, but Susan Kohl seemed to really understand some of the issues that twins face, like being separated for the first time in school and then as an adult trying to separate to find your own identity.

Unfortunately, this book sheds absolutely no light on anything about twins and is very frustrating and very boring to read. Kohl jumps around continuously with no more than one paragraph devoted to discussion of each incident she reports. Her work is shallow and has absolutely no scientific basis or research behind it -- neither hers nor anyone elses whom she might have chosen to reference but does not. Her explanations have no more depth than a conversation with a stranger on a bus. She is at best a reporter of snipets of conversation that she gathered at a twins convention.

I was greatly disappointed."},{"Title":"Twin Stories: Their Mysterious and Unique Bond","review":"I really, really liked this book for a number of reasons. First, I have never seen a book like this about twins. These are personal stories from real people. Second, it's fun.

The book glazes over the topics in a twins life that truly make them unique and repeats the same things throughout. There are many other aspects of the twin bond that are not even approached by this author. Though I must admit, I was very impressed by the fact that the mother of 6 year old twins was brave enough to venture into the area of the twinless twins, a subject that many twins dare not think about out of fear of being the remaining twin. Approaching this topic and allowing the reader the opportunity to broach a subject that will be life altering for half of the worlds twins in itself is a good reason to read this book. Probably the only good reason.

None are identified by the year of their birth).\\"Portfolio\\" eliminates all doubt, with the progressive years of the cartoons stated at the top left or right of the page, in small type within brackets. This, of all the New Yorker magazine-related reprint books I've seen so far, including non-cartoon editions, is an unusual development - & since the themes of almost all of both the \\"Cab\\" & \\"Portfolio\\" cartoons relate to political & social issues, it is indispensible.Dunn's strength was his knowledge that the punchlines illustrating the inspirations must be written quite carefully. Just one extra word in any caption - \\"What's the name of that tranquilizer we took - Xanax?\\" - & the effect is ruined (the cartoon is no longer about the EFFECT the proscribed tranquilizer has had on two formerly frazzled suburbanites. It's now about WHAT they had taken. Thud. Who cares?).Doesn't happen once within the covers of this creation. (The editors of \\"The Art in Cartooning, Seventy Five Years of American Magazine Cartoons\\" - Charles Scribner's Sons 1975 - explain all this far better than can I. Go there for the completion of this thought.)If you want proof that the New Yorker cartoonists & their editor since about 1990 have been on the skids, buy this book or read it in a library. Compare Dunn's work to the crap that's been published since that time by the Newhouse boobs, who - once each Christmas season - wander over to Park Avenue at lunchtime to celebrate the annual attainment of their progressively smaller editorial standards."},{"Title":"A star to steer by;","review":"Hugh Mulzac became the first Black man to earn a Captains license in the US in 1918.

I think Mulzac was the ideal of a steadfast sailor in the precarious environment of racism, more dangerous than any storm at sea."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"So far as I can tell, this is the prolific Little's worst-reviewed novel. I thought it was fascinating, though the gonzo, cuckoobanana stuff that I like probably turned a lot of people off. There haven't been a lot of supernatural beings in the history of literature who spend a fair amount of time turning people into porcelain-statue versions of themselves, or a lot of horror novels in which people get attacked by animated Anasazi mortar-and-pestles, fetishes, shards of pottery and assorted knicknacks.Actually, none that I can think of. This is the only mainstream horror novel I've ever read which could realistically be described in a cover blurb as \\"Stephen King meets The Flaming Carrot.\\"Western writer Zane Grey (yes, the real Zane Grey) shows up early to be terrified by some crazy something-or-other in Arizona back in the early 20th century. Then we jump to the present. Various Southwest-Native-American artifacts are starting to come to life across the Southwest. A mysterious monster kills a Boy Scout counselor. Dogs and cats are living together. Scary, non-human skeletons with still-growing orange afros have been excavated or found in various places. Denver is burning. Boulder is burning. Entire towns vanish from the map, never to return.What eliminated the Aztecs, Mayans, Toltecs, Anasazi, Olmecs and every other civilization ever, including perhaps the Hittites and Saxons? A race of superbeings with orange afros? And they are back with a vengeance!Crazy stuff happens. A plucky group of plucky people assemble to save humanity from these civilization-destroying creatures. Things get so rushed at the end that I'm going to assume editorial interference occurred. I'm not sure really how good this novel is, but it kept me reading quickly, and it was never boring."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I like how Bentley does not give you all of the answers and leaves alot to the imagination so you can let your mind wander into unknown territory.Why were people disappearing? What is this unspoken evil?Fast paced although a little disappointing ending.Still a must for fans."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"This book is just not very good, in my opinion. The story was totally unbelievable, in a way that even most horror stories cannot approach. I forced myself to finish it, to see if it ever became interesting, but it never did. Disconnected, implausible storylines fail to mesh throughout the book. Stephen King is not my favorite author, but his horror fiction is certainly always much better than this. If you are interested in Southwestern mystery-type stories, read any of the excellent works by Tony Hillerman. I can't recommend this one, and won't read any others by Bentley Little."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I liked the start of the book and some parts in the middle but the characters I didn't like and there were too many of them. Glen and the others just weren't drawn up enough to be believable people. I also couldn't stand the nonstop references to the Aztec towns and stuff. Everytime a good part would happen and there was exitment the author would end the chapter and start another one. The ending was terrible too. In spite of all that it wasn't a totally bad read and I never had to force myself to keep reading."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"When the urban legend of the Mogollon Monster becomes a possible reality only a few people take notice, but when Indian artifacts begin moving by themselves and townsfolk begin finding shards of ancient pottery with their own likeness and homes on it, it comes to the attention of archeologists and Arizona, New Mexico residents that something beyond strange is happening.The basis of Bentley Little's The Return is chilling in its entirety and starts out a page turning thriller from the onset.The theory of what happened to the Anasazi is a refreshing gem and the angle that we as a race are only one step from predatory beasts is believable. I enjoyed the book immensely although towards the end it became a bit redundant and the big build up to the finale left me waiting for a big ending that fell somewhat flat in its conclusion."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Bentley Little's work evokes strong reactions in people. Other horror writers I like receive reviews that are all over the map, with most falling in the three-sat to four-star range. But readers either love Bentley's work or hate it. He gets either five stars or one star. I'm in the camp that thinks he's one of the best writers out there, and in my book this strong polarization of opinion is the sign of a true artist.Here, in THE RETURN, as in his earlier novel, THE WALKING, Bentley posits a wild Lovecraftian west, a history of America that is not written about in books and involves cosmic supernatural beings. Rather than Lovecraft's cartoonish behemoths, however, these evil forces show up in smaller, scarier, more intimate ways in Bentley's work. Toss in some unique observations about the effect of the past on the present (even if it's not our own past), and what we have here is a truly unique and satisfying scarefest. The most frightening book I've read all year."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I'd never read a Bentley Little book before, but after looking through the all too small horror section at Borders; I thought this one sounded remotely interesting. It actually has a decent premise, or, well, the back of the book makes you think it does, anyway. What ensues is not only one of the worst horror novels I've ever read, but one of the worst books I've ever read PERIOD. An afro headed monster. A man who BBQ's a dead kid. A climatic final battle with a glorified vaccum cleaner. This is what you're in for if you make the horrible mistake of paying .01 for this book used here, or even worse, full price at the book store.The fact that this book made it into print at all is a fine testimony to the fact that an established writer can get something published, solely because of his name, regardless of the quality. How else would garbage like this make it to the shelf? I am seriously amazed that this book was even published. I read this book from cover to cover, just to see how terrible it truly was, and sure enough, it got progressively worse.I am not really familiar with Bentley Little, nor have I read any of his other titles. I thought this might be a solid introduction to someone who was supposed to be a giant in the field. I'm not going to judge the writer himself based off this one book; but if his other work is anything like this, you'd do yourself a favor by avoiding him entirely.If you want to read some good horror, go to the L's and look one shelf down. Pick up HP Lovecraft instead."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Flat, lifeless imagery. Characters without a trace of personality. Pathetic plot development. And the absolute worst ending I have ever read. If it were within my power, I would not only demand my money back but also insist that Little compensate me for the time wasted reading this tripe. If you want to read something from a writer with actual talent, try Simon Clark."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"The idea behind this book is really creepy, but that's where it ends. The characters are totally undeveloped and cliche. By the end, I really didn't care whether they lived or died. The climax of the book is totally unbelievable, and not in a good way - it seemed like Little just got them into so much trouble and just couldn't come up with a credible way to get them out of it.I love Little's short stories, but this was the first novel of his that I've read and it totally put me off."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"He leaves his job in California on Friday fully expecting to return on Monday. However when Glen Ridgeway travels to Kingman, Arizona to sell some land his parents left him he decides he wants to do a little traveling and take a vacation from his life. In Springerville Arizona, he sees some Indian ruins and accepts a job as an intern on an archeological dig in nearby Bower.The dig is unusual even before Glen arrives. The site has yielded up a pouch of Greek money, a Saxon children's toy and a figurine with a mummified children's hand attached to it. The day Glen starts working, a woman finds a shard of pottery with her face on it. Glen finds the head of a being that is neither human nor animal but something evil. All across the southwest, strange events are occurring at Anasazi ruins, and museums and digs housing their artifacts. Glen and others are coming to believe the thing that wiped out the Anasazi is coming back and they must find a way to deal with it or become eradicated too.Bentley Little is a master of horror on a par with Koontz and King (perhaps if he changed his name to Kittle he would obtain the sales and praise he deserves). The RETURN is one man's theory of why the Anasazi civilization was wiped out and his imagination is so powerful that readers will believe it too. After reading this novel, the audience will keep the lights on day and night.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Return","review":"\\"The Return\\" is the newest novel from horror author Bentley Little. Little, who also occasionally cranks out a social satire novel attacking such American institutions as chain stores or homeowner's associations, delivers a full-frontal assault on the horror genre with this book. \\"The Return\\" closely resembles \\"The Walking\\" and \\"The House,\\" in that the gore and scares come fast and furious. This may be Little's eeriest book to date, quite an accomplishment for a man whose imagination explores the darkest depths of human fear and depravity.Once again, Little sets his story in the American Southwest, specifically Arizona. We are introduced to Glen, a techie visiting Arizona to clear up the affairs of his recently deceased mother. Glen decides he needs to change his life, and he begins to do so by volunteering to work on an archeological expedition for the summer. It is there that he meets Melanie, a teacher who likes to spend her summers digging up Indian artifacts. Regrettably for Glen and Melanie, they soon find themselves in the center of an ancient evil that is reawakening after years of dark slumber. This evil involves the Anasazi people, a race that disappeared along with the Mayans nearly 1000 years ago. With the reappearance of this force in modern times, cities start to disappear, people turn to murder and cannibalism, Indian artifacts become animated, and apocalyptic signs start to occur. The consequences of these activities are both horrific and gory.While Little creates a story that is scary, and consistently scary at that, he tends to bite off more than he can chew as the story progresses. Too many events are occurring, and too many people are wandering around in the story. Little has a tough time weaving all of these threads into a neat conclusion.Little sets a dark tone early on as he builds towards what should be a thrilling climax. But like other Little books, the conclusion tends to be somewhat of a letdown. The showdown between Glen and the creatures is so brief that one wonders what the fuss is all about. Since this is a phenomenon that occurs in other Bentley Little books, it seems that Little enjoys writing the body of the story more than he likes ending his books. Ultimately, there is nothing wrong with this, because Little always creates an awesome build up in his books. This build up often leads to chills and wariness about strolling about in a dark house. If achieving those effects requires the sacrifice of a brilliant ending, so be it.For Bentley Little fans, \\"The Return\\" is, well, a welcome return for Bentley Little. For those yet to experience this dark genius, \\"The Return\\" is a good place to start before you devour the rest of his catalog (although be sure to check out \\"The Store,\\" one of Little's best books)."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"This is the scariest novel I have read in ages. Bentley Little takes a hoary old cliche like the haunted indian burial grounds and breathes new life into it by turning the concept on its head and throwing in a host of imaginative horrors. Quite a few people seem to have had trouble understanding the nature of the evil in this novel, but I don't understand why. Mr. Little certainly doesn't spoonfeed his readers, but everything's there if one takes the time to read carefully. This is one great book."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"This is the first novel I have read by Bentley Little, and it was a disaster. First, the author must have had a morphine drip in his arm while constructing such a long list of uni-dimensional characters who find themselves caught in a struggle with a \\"monster\\" unleashed after they unearthed some Native American artifacts. There are dancing pottery shards featuring technicolor images of characters that view them, and, of course, there's that green-haired \\"Mongollon Monster\\" who is just thrown into the mix like cayenne pepper into a ham and cheese omelet. PLEASE!!!!!!! If you like monsters prowling around old ruins, then try Owl Goingback's \\"Crota.\\""},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Bentley Little's \\"The Return\\" starts out with a lot of promise, and up until about the halfway point, it's pretty intense. A good amount of evil doings and supernatural terror invades the lives of Bentley's (as usual) unbelievable, one-dimensional characters, but the story flows along well and fast.Unfortunately, one you pass the halfway mark, the whole thing starts falling apart and Bentley can't seem to put it back together again. Too many characters, too many loose ends, too much of an unstoppable evil that, at it's anti-climatic end, gets disposed of entirely too easily and too conveniently.The tension vanishes, your concern for the main characters vanishes and you'll find yourself rushing through the last 100+ pages in the sole effort to get the book done and start on something more fulfilling.A few key words and phrases always pop up when you're talking about Bentley Little:1. Extremely graphic sex and gore;2. Social commentary with a supernatural twist;3. Predictability;4. One dimensional characters;5. Anti-climatic endings;6. Bad story pacing;7. Plotlines falling apart halfway through the read.8. Occasionally VERY interesting ideas and storylines.\\"The Return\\" will offer you all of them."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"After reading this great book and being thoroughly terrified by some of the most disturbingly original imagery I've come across this year, I was shocked to see the low scores this book got from readers. Maybe you have to be from the southwest to appreciate the achievement here. Compared to Dean Koontz's BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON, which seems to have taken its Four Corners info from a map, Little knows this country and creates an epic novel of horror from this epic landscape. Scary, intense and original. By the way, I liked the ending and thought it DID tie up all loose ends."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"The book is built around a great idea, the Mollongonville Monster, but the novel itself isn't very satisfying. The writing is weak and stilted. (Much like this review, actually.) The creatures don't make any sense--what they are, what they are doing, and how they are defeated the way they are are details never really explained. In fact, pretty much anything interesting is not explained. I gets old after a while. It's like a book written by a young person, where details aren't provided. Things Just Are. Then there is an embarassingly bad sex scene.As for being scary...some scenes were effective, others were not. The creatures being described deadpan as having \\"afros\\" pretty much moved them out of the realm of being scary into being laughable.My favorite line from the book (which I have memorized): \\"The man in the hip hop shorts was still alive, but he was screaming.\\"Oh, and I was particularly annoyed with the dig at Bigfoot researcher Grover Krantz. I mean, honestly."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I've read many of Stephen King's books, but none of those ever scared me. They didn't even come close, actually. Dean Koontz was okay--still not that scary to me though. But Bentley Little....HE knows how to write good horror! I get chills every time I read The Return, and I don't know how many times I've read it over the years. The opening chapter is quite horrifying on its own--the book just gets better from there. The use of Anasazi objects as possessed horror items was just brilliant. The ending is a little lame, but the rest of the story makes up for that. I really connected to the kid and I am glad he had such a big part in the tale. The two main adult characters were okay, if a little too normal/boring. Writing-wise, it was brilliant. I felt as though I was right there, and I could see every part of every scene playing out in my head with clarity. An awesome book I wholeheartedly recommend."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"The Return started out as a seemingly very promising horror story. Once I got further into the story I realized that it was turning into a very weak offering from Bentley Little. A mummy with a red afro?? Come On!! Very unrealistic even for a horror novel!Too many questions were left unanswered. Such as what happened to the town that dissappeared? What happened to the people that dissappeared? What exactly was the Mongolon Monster??? The answers to these questions were very vague in the story.Also the end of The Return seemed to be rushed. The build up to the supposed climax was satisfying enough, however, the climax of the story itself was anything but!Skip this one. Bentley Little has written some excellent horror novels. Try The Store, The Revelation and The Walking."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I read THE RETURN on the recommendation of a friend, and I'm so glad I did. This is a great book. Intelligently written and intricately plotted, it stands head and shoulders above most of today's horror fiction. There are ambitious, truly scary set pieces such as the descent of a small town into hell, a boy's horrific surreal loss of his parents, a delinquent's encounter with an ancient god in an Indian cave and an abusive father's comeuppance by the ghosts of his family that will haunt me for a long time to come. Bentley Little is as good as King, Koontz and Barker in their prime. While I can understand the frustration of some with the ending of the novel, climaxes in horror fiction have always been problematic (The ending of King's classic THE SHINING? The boiler blows up and destroys the hotel. the end.)The conclusion of THE RETURN is at least consistent with Little's Lovecraftian premise that evil is inherently unknowable. I can't wait to read the rest of this talented author's books."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Unlike some of the other reviewers here, I AM an avowed Bentley Little fan. The Ignored is among my alltime favorite books._But I'm a realistic one, too. I know that they can't all be winners. And this isn't one.Yes, some of the incidents are ridiculous. Pestles (or is that mortars?) that walk aren't known to strike fear into the hearts of readers. And they don't this time.And what was with the mummies? Either they were supposed to be alive and evil, or they weren't? I couldn't really tell what was up with them. They mostly just laid there.And the ending? Among the worst I've ever read. This is a drawback in many, many horror novels, and Little has had trouble finishing his novels in the past. But this one was SO anticlimatic. It just fizzled out when it should have been apocalyptic. The demon, or whatever it was, just stood there and took it's medicine.It definitely ended not with a bang, but with a whimper."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Bentley Little's The Return is not a good horror story. It's not really even a good book. But I still highly recommend that everyone read it just to see all of the wackiness.One gets the impression that parts of Mr. Little's mind were sloughing off as he wrote and landing on the keyboard (or typewriter or cave wall or whatever he originally wrote this on), completely unnoticed.Things start so promising and, at this point at least, the author still seems to retain some kind of sanity. The protagonist is interesting in a Hulk (TV show, not movie) sort of way and there's an effective setup involving a face-off with a camp counselor.But then things... change. Suddenly we've got floating artifacts, monsters with orange afros and humans turned into carrots made of dust.Dust carrots.None of these things seem to be played for laughs. The book's tone stays fairly serious and the reader is left to wonder if they really just read what they thought they did. Has the world gone mad? Did critics really say those positive things that are quoted on the back of the book? Am I on TV right now?It's just a glorious, fantastic train wreck. Only, instead of a real train wreck, you don't have to feel guilty for gawking.Besides, most trains aren't full of mummies with orange afros and until that starts happening (write your Congressman. I have) this is probably the best we're gonna get."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I've read 3 novels by this author \\"The Summoning\\", \\"Dominion\\", \\"The Return\\" I think his writing style is very simplistic and a little opportunistic but he is a guilty pleasure nonetheless!. The first book above was fun, scary, gory and original but seriously flawed. The second book was flawed but was so gory that it kept my interest till the end. \\"The Return\\" is a confusing mess, it's absolutely awful, and I wish it would return to the wretched cess pool from which it was spawned. I'm not giving up on him yet though. Don't always believe those blurbs you see on the front and back covers of books, Stephen King raves about this guy saying \\"He is the best writer working now\\" This is not true..."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Having read every Bentley Little book, including Death Instinct, I can honestly and regretfully say that this is his worst book. After the first hundred or so pages, I could tell that Bentley had lost his inspiration .... Ridiculous scenes involving dancing pottery killed any horror or suspense that could have built from this complete mess of a story that dragged on and on. I love this author, don't get me wrong, but this is one to skip. I recommend The Ignored, The Mailman, and The Association."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Since picking up a copy of The House several years ago, I've been a Bentley Little fan. Despite the fact that I had several of his earlier novels sitting unread on my bookshelves, I was excited to see The Return hit shelves. I immediately picked it up and started reading. I'll admit to being mildly interested in the beginning however The Return quickly became tedious - at best.I don't expect realism in a horror novel - let me get that out of the way upfront. Little, however, has consistently written novels in which normal, everyday people and places have become gradually sinister - haunted houses (The House), homeowners associations (The Association), discount store chains (The Store). Because of this subtlety, I was surprised when The Return featured such blatantly outrageous action. For example, while reading The Association, it was conceivable to me, in the manner in which it was presented, that residents of a community could be terrorized by an evil homeowners association and find themselves with little recourse. Its more difficult for me to believe that, as was the case in The Return, entire towns could be wiped out across the Southwest with little more reaction from the country than a little bit of news coverage.The Return is the least enjoyable of the Little novels I've read so far. In a shorter format, The Return would have been at home in his recently published collection of short stories, The Collection. Its too bad - many of the short stories collected there would have been far more successful as novels than The Return."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"This is my first (and last) experience with Bentley Little's work and to say I was disappointed would be far too kind. The plot, such as it is, deals with a race of creatures that return from the past and start reverting people to a more primitive state. Why is not entirely clear and I just didn't care enough to figure it out. The characters are so interchangeable that you can't tell one from another and the big finish happens so quickly that there is no attempt to build suspense. Not frightening, very predictable and lacking in the basic elements of a good horror novel, THE RETURN definitely does not make me want to check out the rest of this author's work."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I don't know how he does it, but for the past decade, Bentley Little has been turning out the best and most underrated horror fiction on the planet. Hot on the heels of THE COLLECTION, his sublime book of short stories, comes THE RETURN, and epic tale of vanished civilizations, the rape of the West and one of the most original horror creations I've ever read. If the monster is dispatched a tad too quickly (a Little trademark, unfortunately), the rest of the book makes up for it with compelling characters and some truly creepy setpieces. Besides, as wiser men than me have said, it's the journey that's important not the destination. More superficial readers may be put off by the abruptness of the ending, but it's nowhere near as bad as King's IT, where, after a thousand pages, the reunited heroes gangrape a girl and kill a giant spider to save the world. THE RETURN is another in Little's increasingly impressive ouevre."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I picked this novel for my first read by Bentley Little, an author highly recommended to me as a fan of Stephen King. However, there were way too many characters to keep track of, some of which were not even introduced until halfway through the book! Every time he changed point of view, I had to struggle to remember who this person was. The ending was also highly anticlimatic after making the evil in this book seem like the possible bringer of Armageddon. I give it 3 stars only because for some reason I did not give up on it, and that is saying something, though I'm not sure what! I will not be picking up another Bentley Little book, there are too many other authors out there to choose from!"},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I have read all of Bentley Little's books except for &quot;The Association&quot; and &quot;The Policy,&quot; which probably explains why I stuck with this book until the end. I seriously considered stopping around page 150 because the book was just a random series of events happening to characters that I really didn't care about. &quot;But,&quot; I thought, &quot;Little's done it before,&quot; so I kept going, hoping that either a plot would show up or that things would be explained.Well, no plot ever showed up, and things were sort of explained, but it came late and you REALLY had to suspend disbelief to accept it. And at the end, I still didn't care about any of the characters, but by the time I was really set to give up, I only had about 75 pages to go, so I just finished it.If you haven't read Little, read &quot;The Store&quot; instead of this."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"This book was soooo boring. It took me a week to finish this book and I usually read a book in 1 or 2 days. It seemed to be a long nasty movie of the week with gross paragraphs randomly tossed in in the attempt to make it more interesting. It built to a very unsatisfying conclusion that was totally ridiculous in how the \\"monsters\\" were vanquished. It also never told what they were or why these things happend to my satisfaction. Just don't waste your time. This the first and last book I will read by this author."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Although the book has a few creepy moments, much of it is just plain silly. The story revolves around some Indian burial grounds, where the artifacts recovered seem to have a life of their own. Moreover, strange orange haired mummies seem to spring to life of their own volition. Why is this happening? Trust me, not even the author seems to know.Bentley Little is really a gifted, edgy horror story writer, capable of taking the mundane and making it horrific. Here, he has lost his edge, delivering a mediocre horror story from which only his most stalwart fans will derive a modicum of enjoyment. I myself kept reading to the bitter end, hoping that the book would evolve. Unfortunately, with its one dimensional characters and silly plot that seemed to go nowhere, I was left with only the hope that his new novel will be more inspired than this book was."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"This book is stupid. We all know that when it comes to horror and scifi one must have a suspension of disbelief but this is one ridiculous book!-A \\"monster\\" of the \\"boogie man\\" class.-Dancing pottery.-Artifacts that attack people.-Blood and gore, sadism and perversity more comical than shocking.-Main characters for which you develop not the slightest interest or liking because they are narcissistic and juvenile."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Geez.I've read a couple of Little's books, and was mildly entertained with them. I picked this one up, full price, due to a lack of anything else to read at my local mall bookstore and, by the time I finished it (and it took a *really* long time to wade through the last half), was really annoyed that I'd blown the price of a first-run movie ticket on it.It started out pretty well, and had what looked to be an interesting premise, but by the time Little described the first &quot;walking&quot; mortar and pestle, I knew it was going to be a grind. Walking medicine bowls are ridiculous enough, but throw in fast and loose science, amazing events that would've brought the media (among others) en-masse to their neck of the woods, and numerous, nay, infinite plot gaps, holes, and blunders and you have the makings of a throwaway paperback (tossing a paperback in the garbage is darn near sacrilege). Wrap all that up in a neat little package with cool cover art and top it off with an atrocious, laughable ending and too many plot threads that never got off of ground-zero and you've got terrible fiction that I wouldn't dare donate to the public library.With apologies to Little fans, do yourself a favor and read Laymon instead."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I cannot believe this book was even able to get published. Although this was the first book I read by Little, I am sorry I did.The book starts out with a man who leaves his life to find a new one. He does by stumbling across a group of college students digging up the remains on some Anasazi Indian culture. First off all, the author used a lot of Native American Indian terms, and if you don't have a clue into the history of Native Americans, you will be at a lost. The author really needed to explain what some things were in the novel, such as certain artifacts, but instead he decides to draw out a scene where a couple searches for a lost mummy. ... It was like enough already!Also, I know this is a horror book, and horror books are usually far fetched, but this novel I found ridiculous. The way characters reacted to certain scenes was not typical. [It] made me feel like I was reading a 10 year old cartoon. ...The author wanted to make it seem like the rest of the U.S. could care less about the west, which was also far fetched. ... Thank you."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I don't know why so many readers are dissing \\"The Return.\\" I thought it was wonderful. Bentley Little is an original and supremely talented writer. I'm a 22-year old African-American woman from Detroit, but he made me sympathize and care about a middle-aged white man from California who is going through a mid-life crisis and is lost literally and figuratively in the wastelands of Arizona. Unlike some other readers, I found the sentient Native-American artifacts VERY scary. And I will never forget a chilling surreal scene where a young boy searches for a way out of his suddenly deserted neighborhood and ends up in his own house with his mother's tooth. This is the best book I've read in a long time, and I'm eager to read the rest of Bentley Little's books."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"the book had a nice plot and story line. ive always enjoyed books with history entangled in it. but this book was all over the place, you had to keep reading just to find out what character was talking, which can get very annoying. i &lt;u>Hated&lt;/u> the ending it was terriable it was just so dissapointing no though at all. its a ok book if your bored and have nothing else to read, love the author but this book was a stinker."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't absorb myself in this book like I have been able with most of the other books Little has written. By desciption alone, the plot isn't bad, but it's not terribly interesting to read about. There was just no magic here. I read the events, didnt care about them, didnt care about the characters, and didnt really care about the outcome. This was one of those novels I read for awhile, and kept coming back to after reading another book to finish. I was just bored...I can't put my finger on why exactly, but it's a truth. The pace would speed up, then slow down again, repeating it's vicious cycle.My advice? If you're wanting to sample Little, try one of his other books instead, like the House of the Revelation."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"This was the first book I've read by Bentley Little. I purchased it because it sounded interesting. I had to force myself to actually finish it...sorry. This book did not make me want to rush out and purchase another of his works. The story was just ridiculous to me and at times I was disgusted by things put in this book. This is just my opinion however, others may enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"The characters weren't really likable. It didn't tie together all the plots. They just electrocuted the bad monster and that was it? Could've ended a little better."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I picked up this book for five bucks from a half-price bookstore and I'm upset I even spent that much. There is no resolution to this completely ridiculous, convoluted, mess of a story. The author has plot twists that lead to absolutely nowhere, and seems to forget about characters only to write them in later as an after thought with some ridiculous story once he remembers . The author bases the storyline around some mysterious monsters for which he offers no description or explanation other than being dark with an orange afro, while in contrast spending an inordinate amount of time describing every pit stop the main characters take on their journey, no matter how little relevance it bore to the central storyline. The author then culminated the book with a lackluster \\"climax\\" and resolution that left me wishing Id never read the book at all. Terrible book"},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Bentley Little lives up to his last name with THE RETURN, which provides little in the way of character development, plot line, plausibility or even horror. The collection of other one-star reviews reflect my sentiments, but I wanted to provide another review to vent against a trend among well-known authors who now think it's enough to create some interesting creatures with an intriguing premise and then ignore presentation of a mythology to explain it all. He's making up the creatures and the protagonists, isn't he? Why not invent a mythology to explain their existence?If Little is trying to live on his reputation, a book like this could destroy it. This is the kind of novel that drives me back to nonfiction. The alleged monster sounds more like a clown with an orange Afro as his distinguishing feature. I couldn't visualize this thing without laughing aloud and wondering if it also carried a seltzer bottle with a honk box just like Clarabell on the oldThe Howdy Doody Show- 40 Episode CollectionTV Show. Let me repeat for emphasis: The unnamed and unexplained monster in THE RETURN is distinguished by his orange Afro.Usually I would have just quit reading this book after first mention of the orange Afro. But I wanted to see what Little would do with his Anasazi extermination story line. More than 350 pages later I learned Little had decided to do less than little with that part of his book. If you want a story about the disappearance of the Anasazi, try Louis La'Mour'sThe Haunted Mesainstead."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I hardly ever review books, but after reading a few of Mr. Bentley's books I felt the need to say this.......I am a HUGE fan of writers that are not afraid to think and write outside the box. I happen to love books where the bump in the night actually is a monster, and not your typical bad guy. But, there is one thing that keeps Mr. Bentley from being on my \\"keeper\\" shelf with Dean Koontz, James Rollins, Matt Reilly, etc. AND that is his obsession with having depraved sexual scenes and acts in every book he writes. To me this does not enhance the story, it just seems nasty. I am not a prude and love to read a good sex scene as well as the next reader, but to me he gets just a little too explicit. If I remember correctly there were 3 women in this book that were raped with foreign objects. His books are great reads and I will not quit reading them, but I think his talent is in his storytelling, not his shock paragraphs. If you read this Mr. Bentley, please don't believe I think myself capable of judging your writing technique, I just don't understand the need for it."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Mr. Little, if this book is anything to go by, you are one of the laziest writers around. You didn't even make the effort to tie up any of the loose ends. And the ending!!! I think the image of the popped balloon zooming around the room was more appropriate to what happend to your brain. If you can't think of anything good to write, don't write!"},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I'm sorry but this story is not one worth finishing. It fails on every level.Characters. Plot. Monsters. All cliche and boring.I found myself reading the first sentences of each paragraph only to keep the story moving. I don't think I missed anything worth reading."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I a major Bentley Little fan but must say this was a major disappointment to me. Cant jump on little too harshly however cause every writer is entitled to a howler once in awhile. A prime example of that is Koontzs &quot;Tick Tock&quot; and unfortunately &quot;The Return&quot; seems to be Littles blunder so far, lets hope his next one will be a major improvement from this. I really enjoy Littles down to earth style of plotting and story advancement, wherein hes always been more interested in furthering a highly entertaining story with thrills and suspense moreso than trying to be poetic or flowery in his prose like certain other horror writer seem to be these days. Cmon folks, this is horror fiction, not poetry or great american literature, lets keep it to the fun, escapism kinda genre its meant to be. NOrmally LIttle does just so, but this time, he rather dumbs it down a bit too much. its just hard to believe or be thrilled by walking and attacking pottery shards or really believe anyone could be so terrified of walking artifacts as some of the characters were in this novel. LIttle stretches it a bit too much this go around, and turns ina surprisingly tough book to try to keep involved with. Needless to say, ill definitely be looking forward to his upcoming novels, still a fan here, but not gonna include &quot;The REturn&quot; in my Bentley Little collection. If you want to become a fan, stick with &quot;The STore&quot; or &quot;The Association&quot; instead."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Bentley Little is one of my favorite horror authors. I have purchased every one of his books. My favorites being University and The Mailman. I even liked his collection of short stories ('The Collection'). This book, in my opinion, just wasn't that good or interesting to me. Sorry."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"This starts as a great book but fall flat after couple of pages. There are too many loose threads and very confusing book. Now a days writing confusing horror book is a fashion or what? I will tell you, if you HAVE to read this book, keep store receipt handy to return this book. Most of the matirial in this book is laughable! LOL. If someone says 'boo' to you in day light, in front of 1000 people,telling you that he is going to tell you 'boo' and if you get scared after that,then you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Let's face it: Bentley Little is a guilty pleasure we all enjoy. He writes horror with no restrictions whatsoever. If you want to learn something while you read, if you want a theme in your story, read King or Laymon--hell, you're probably like me and read them anyway! But if you just want to be scared...Then pick up a Bentley Little novel.And why not start with &quot;The Return.&quot; Yes, it's complex, and pretty much meaningless. The plot itself is un-realistic as heck, and you characters are shallow, despite attempts to bring their past into the mix. But this novel is scary; it's very scary.A little recap of the plot, although if you're a Little fan, you know you don't need one: Glen is going through midlife crisis. He drops everything and just leaves. In Arizona, while on a tour of an Anasazi ruin, he gets offered a job at an archeological dig. For reasons unknown to himself, he takes up that offer...and finds himself in Hell on Earth!Sure, there's Melanie, whom he's quickly falling in love with. And the dig's director, Al, is friendly. So're some of the other diggers. But he doesn't like it. Especially not after he digs up that skull; because that's when the townfolk start taking a disliking to him and the diggers; that's when the Indian artifacts start moving on their own; when people start disappearing right out of thin air; and when a legend--The Mogollon Monster--seems more than just a myth.If I have to be honest--and I do--I will say that this novel reflects a more mature Bentley Little--not that we want one. The gore is kept, for the large part, until the second half of the book. But when it comes, it comes in full-force. And when you aren't being grossed out, you're checking to make sure nobody's sneaking up behind you.A brief warning, here at the end: Do not read &quot;The Return&quot; at night, unless you're prepared to lose sleep. This novel, like all of Little's, is packed full of frights. A must for Little fans, and a good introductory course for new recruits."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"This is clearly an earlier piece of work for Bentley LIttle, however it shows how his writing style has originated and been developed through his latest novels. In The Return, he tells the story of a rat tag team that randomly meet up and know each other through an archeological dig that is studying Native American history. The group comes across some odd shaped sculls and authentic pottery depicting present-day events, generally with the finder in them.The local townspeople being acting strangely, and start changing personalities, it seems everyone is being affected by the pottery shards, except for the group that originally finds these things. When the professor heading the dig disappears along with the rest of their team. The rag tag group, decide its up to them to find out what is happening and why people are disappearing.Along the way, you find moving pieces of pottery, that make people act crazy and do insane things... oh say like eating other people.... Strange hairy creatures are spotted, among other things..Overall the story, though well written, is not well developed, it is choppy, and generally, doesn't attempt to make any sense at all. I love Bentley Little and one thing I've found to be the norm with him is that he doesn't like endings. There is always a huge build up, then a sudden end. The closure is very stunted...Though I tend to enjoy the journey more then the destination anyway... so if you're like me, you might enjoy the book..Personally I'd love to see him write about a lost tribe or something.. like James Rollins but with horror, and the signature Little style"},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Delving into the mysterious disappearance of the once-flourishing Anasazi civilization in the southwestern United States, \\"The Return\\" comes up with one of the darker and more disturbing scenarios put forth in novels on this popular topic, as a team of archaeologists uncover previously buried ruins out in the desert. The excavation is the catalyst for a deluge of new discoveries, as old relics and pieces of artifacts shortly thereafter begin to be unearthed all over the Southwest - primarily in places they should not be: tilled up in gardens that have been worked and reworked over the years, and thus should have yielded up any treasures long ago; or barely covered in driveways and backyards, for example. In addition, the return of a creature called the Mogollan Monster - a beast that, as the prologue shows, has made occasional appearances in the area over the decades but never to the extent that it suddenly is - begins to awaken un unease about the cyclical disappearance of healthy civilizations in the Americas over the centuries, including long before the arrival of Europeans. Much of what is coming to light rings ominous, ranging from that which can explained away - the unusual physical appearance of preserved mummies, for instance - to the more unconventional, with truly strange phenomena (and very original phenomena, in some cases) associated with some of the relics, the nature of which I don't want to spoil here.\\"The Return\\" is primarily told from the viewpoint of a man named Glen who's recently lost his mother and, upon examination of the current state of his life, finds it not very satisfying or rewarding; and heads out on the road in search of some vague hope of a more involving purpose. He winds up becoming interested in some of the local lore and history, and ultimately working on the summer dig where the initial finds are being made. With Glen being new to all this, it gives the book a chance to introduce the reader at the same pace to the history of the Anasazi and the particulars of archaeology. Glen isn't the only 'viewpoint' character, which is good - I generally prefer a book to come in from the perspective of various characters instead of just one, although it's okay if one gets more play than any other. A young schoolteacher named Melanie who spends each summer doing projects along the line of the dig, and a little boy named Cameron who's present at the summer camp where the Mogollan Monster makes one of its first present-day appearances, are among the characters who get the most 'lead time' after Glen, but there are a number of interesting additional players.One of the things that really worked in \\"The Return\\" for me is how some of the phenomena occurring are so way-out-in-left-field unusual, and not necessarily in the way you'd expect. For example, after the disappearance of a couple of characters, there are cretain items left in their place. These aren't everyday items, but they're not the kind of things some stalker or monster would normally leave to try and intimidate someone. In an everyday context, they'd be so completely non-scary, but their prescence at the time and place they appear is so bizarre and alien that it adds greatly to the whole mysterious/frighteningly unexplainable atmosphere. There are things like this cropping up at different times in the book, not only in the unearthly elements but in various turns of the story. The writing style starts out feeling a bit too plain, but it grew on me as it went along, and it comes off creating a vivid image, visually and otherwise, of the various scenes without a lot of actual description. A lot of things in the book grow to feel very real, authentic, and even detailed, based more on what reads between the lines and reads into what is being said, rather than long descriptions. Not something that would work well everywhere, but Bentley Little made it very effective here. And when more detailed passages are needed, those are delivered very well. I'm probably making the writing style sound clumsy and vague, but in truth it came off really well and really helps you get right in the book where you can see and feel it. The only real shortcoming is near the end of the book, when one challenge is met too easily and in a way that sort of speedbumps the flow. It's nothing at all, though, like some novels that are going great and then just fall apart in the last three or four chapters; it's a noticeable little chink in the armor of the book but nothing more, certainly nothing that should steer anyone away from getting this."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"This is my 4th Bentley Little book I have read. The others were The Association, The Walking and The Store. I was excited to see The Return was now available. His stories can take a little getting use to, but he does a great job of using peoples daily qurkes and turn them into serious and scary issues. The Return at first struck me as similar to The Walking. This is not suprising, as his stories generally carry a familar feel. However, The Return quickly lost track and became distorted, confused and finally a huge disappointment.First of all, he did a very poor job of explaining details. We have the Anazzi Indian story, a story about a guy going through a mid-life chrisis, a story about a monster, towns and people disappear, strange things happen for no rhyme or reason and people apparently start doing things to which we have no clue as to why. I almost got the feeling Mr. Little knew enough about the Anazzi Indians to get the story started, but failed in his research to tie up lose ends or half explain what the heck is going on. I kept asking myself, what the...? Where did that come from? How is this part of the story? Okay its gross and graphic, but this relates how?The ending was the worse part of all. Your being lead up to Little's typical fantastic finish, but in The Return the evil, horrible, thousands of years old monster is simply knocked off with so much ease you sit wondering what the heck was the big deal in the first place. I swear Mr. Little had no idea how to end this story or a deadline was approching and so he simply ended it with absolutly no thrill what-so-ever.Like I said the ending was pathetic and this book in general was very poorly done. He needs to go back to his roots and write stories about people and their strange ways. The Association was absolutly awsome. The store was decent (expect for the hint of incest which has no bearing on the story) and even the Walking (whose ending was kinda lame) were much better books.In the end, this story was horrible. If your looking to start reading Bentley Little's works, I would highly suggest something else. If your not a huge fan and you still want to read his stuff, read something else. This book was a major put-off. I will await the next one and hope he does a better job, his 3 other books I've read at least gives him a 2nd chance!"},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I bought this novel because I was so impressed with THE COLLECTION, Mr. Little's book of short stories. I am blown away by this man's talent. Not only does THE RETURN contain some of the creepiest imagery in recent memory (I don't think I'll ever forget the shaking creature hiding beneath the butcher paper), but it has a lot to say about the colonization of America and the British-centric lense through which our history is perceived. Scary yet serious, this is one damn good book."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I have read most of Mr. Little's books, and found most of them to be entertaining, although some (Like \\"The House\\") have been mundane at the least. \\"The Return\\" is perhaps the most ridiculously plotted horror novel I've read in years. People are introduced (Like Bonnie and Richard) and we never hear from them again. The leading characters are as cardboard as they can get. Glen Ridgeway is such a superficial, self-centered loser. Melanie is almost as bad. The professors are dumber than most students, and to top it off, we get a barbecued child (?); people going crazy and doing really dumb things, towns disappearing, volcanoes arising out of nowhere, and so much padding, it felt like a Depends. The only scene that was original and quite funny is when the mayor of a town that is preparing to battle another town, walks into his office, finds his secretary [making love]on the floor, and tells her to stop it and come take minutes. That is funny.Unfortunately, Little tries to equal the expanse and depth of Stephen King's \\"The Stand\\" and \\"It\\", and Little just can't match the master. This book was ponderous and I had a hard time finishing it, and then kaboom, it's over---...BR>NOT RECOMMENDED. UNLESS YOU NEED A SLEEP INDUCER OR ONE GOOD LAUGH."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"The Return is a great horror novel in the classic vein. Yet, when it is touched with Bentley's wonderful wit and imagination, what could become mundane is transformed into something special. When Glen's mother dies, he is at a loss for what to do with his life. So he quits his job, takes off and ends up working at a archaeological site where they are excavating Indian burial ruins. From here, there are interlocking stories leading to the conclusion which pits a small band of immune people against a timeless evil. There is a little romance, lots of horror and a great plot that never disappoints.From Arizona to Colorado, there are walking artifacts, towns go insane and become tribal and horrifying mummies take on a life of their own. There are burial grounds, predestination and a battle with eternal evil. All of those things are what makes a classic horror novel work. And this is great from beginning to end. My only wish is that it might have lasted longer and there might have been more history on the Mogollan monster. Still, it was A+ and pure Bentley."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Bentley Little is one of the few current practitioners of epic horror: horror fiction that takes place over a broad geographic area and weaves together disparate events into one large tapestry. In THE RETURN, he tackles the disappearance of the Anasazi Indians in the Southwest and marries it to a series of contemporary events that are occurring throughout the U.S. Archeologists are uncovering strange and creepy objects at their digs, artifacts are becoming sentient in museums and everything seems to be connected to a series of spooky mummies with orange afros who are suddenly appearing. It's a complex plot with some of the scariest scenes I've read in years. One spooky book."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Where to even start?This book turned up in my house a couple of years ago. No one in the family knows where it came from. I thought surely there must be a logical explanation for how it got here, but I knew there wasn't. I didn't know how I knew, I just knew.Finally I decided to read it.On a whim. Or was it? I hated the thought that my reading this book was preordained...Now, imagine a whole book written exactly like that. The same sentences, the same cliches, themes, repeated over and over again. Every character has at least one moment where they don't know how they know something, they just know it. Glen dwells on fate throughout the whole story (only at the end to freak out trying to follow prophecy exactly).Nothing is explained, at all.It doesn't work in that scary, \\"I'm not sure what this is, I'll probably never know, but it's scaring the hell out of me\\" sort of way.It just makes you wonder exactly what you read when you finish the book.There are so many loose ends floating around that it's not even funny. It follows on-the-spot characters for a couple of pages and then just drops their story line completely, never to mention them again, and they weren't even that interesting in the first place.There's a lengthy plot line developed through the first half of the book regarding Ron (a photographer) and his legal troubles. Then you hear nothing else from him, though you assume he's going to serve some purpose considering a portion of the book involved Glen getting Ron out of jail. But no, Ron just disappears for basically the rest of the book, only to reappear toward the climax for a couple of pages just to disappear again.The whole story is like this. The first half had me interested. I overlooked weak writing because it seemed interesting. I liked how the author gave you the feeling that something just wasn't right. I wanted to know why, it pulled me in.Then after a while I realized that the story was just two middle aged love birds riding around the South West chasing monsters with orange afros, never catching up with them until the big finale which turned out to be not big at all but quite shockingly uneventful.I felt ripped off.Disappointed.Where was the horror? Where was the graphic sex? Where was the gore? Why did it not have me freaking out and cringing as I read along? The only sex I remember was not remotely explicit, the author summing it up by saying \\"they made love.\\" The only gore was flaccid at best, a face hanging from a tree branch or an arrow through the heart.Only one part in the whole book made me cringe. It involved a little boy in an Elmo shirt.I'm going to end this review because I could go on and on and on about how boring this book turned out to be.If you read this, then you were entertained more than this book could ever entertain you. I could not make something less entertaining than this book. I could not make something drag by as slowly and without direction as this book.Don't waste any more of your precious time by reading The Return, by Bentley Little."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Once you figure out what the plot is and that none of the bizarre going-ons is going to lead up to anything interesting, this is a book that almost turns you off the author. It's definitely this author's worste book. AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I WASTED MY TIME ON IT.What a shame. The premise is interesting. Bizarre killings, archeological artificats that seem to be possessed, a society that just disappeared. BUT OK ALIENS FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION! AND THEY AREN'T EVEN EXPLAINED!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! BUY DOMINION!"},{"Title":"The Return","review":"The Orange Hair MonsterThe Return by Bentley Little is a fast paced horror book. I really liked it! It kept you on the edge of your seat and then when a scary part happens it makes you fling back into the back of your chair. This book is probably too complicated for young kids, but if you understand the book you'd like it to! The book is real long though, so you have to like to read if you're going to read this book.The book is about a guy named Glen, I don't think that's it, I forgot. He takes his car and drives far away to a city. He joins a group that digs up ancient artifacts. But once they start finding stuff, people start disappearing. Ancient skeletons and a monster that all have orange hair start roaming around killing people.My stepmother has read this book hundreds of times. She likes this book as much as I do. I enjoyed reading this book. I hope you will to."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I was really expecting to be completely scared. Mr. Little has a great reputation for writing great horror stories, but this was not a great horror story. Way too many characters I could care less about, way too many random events taking place that I could care less about, and a &quot;monster&quot; that wouldn't scare my daughter if she saw it. There were so many bizarre, unexplained occurences that I kept expecting to be resolved and never did. And the ending!?!?!?!?!?!? What is up with that? It was as if Mr. Little ran out of ideas and just gave up. The best part of reading this novel is that I learned what not to do when writing my own tale of hororr/supernatural. Thanks!"},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I bought this book on impulse. I like a good horror novel and have grown tired of everyone's teeth falling out as they do in most Stephen King novels. What's up with that anyway?The Return starts out well with a mid30's man who leaves his job in search of something \\"new.\\" He finds it in Arizona. Strange things are happening with Indian relics that are being uncovered all over Arizona. This was pretty good until people started disappearing in a \\"vortex\\" and relics start \\"walking.\\"...I am still finishing this book and hope it improves. The best I can give this book is a 2. Maybe it will improve. I just bought The University because I am willing to give Bentley another chance."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"Did not like this book. I was waiting and waiting for some kind of explanation for all the strange occurrences that happen throughout the story. He never draws the story together. I read it to the end thinking that his conclusion would enlighten me as to how everything fit together, but he didn't.What a dissapointing read, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I found this story to be engaging, unique and well-written. Definitely one of Little's best!"},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I find it hard to believe that anyone could honestly give this book a rating of five. It's pretty bad. The book drags, doesn't make a whole lot of sense, and the ending is definitely a letdown. I wouldn't have guessed it was written by a professional. It almost seems a good template for how not to write a novel.There are some interesting scenes and details, the book isn't completely without merit, but overall the story is just a wet, sticky mess. Fewer ideas better executed would have made for a better read. There are so many little scenes and ideas and characters in this book and it never really comes together into anything cohesive."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I read the blurb on the back cover, and thought this book sounded interesting. How wrong I was. The overall plot was pretty confusing, and there were some things that were more ridiculous than scary. I know it is a horror fantasy, but the book doesn't even stay true to it's internal logic. It reads like a first draft rather than a final product. I can't understand the people who are giving this thing 4 and five stars. Heed this warning and skip this book."},{"Title":"The Return","review":"I've read several of Mr. Little's books and overall am satisfied. His writing isn't as compelling as King, Masterton, Koontz, or Straub but something about the stories he writes I usually like. Not this one. I do have to say that the first 100 pages were most terrifying building up what I thought would be a fantastic read but from there it took a serious descent downhill. The last thrity pages or so were almost too hard to finish it got so boring."},{"Title":"Understanding the Cultural War in America","review":"This is definitely a good book, but be ready to put on your thinking cap if you get it. It's not the easiest book to read, you have to stop and think in some places as you go along. I also thought it started out a little slow, but it quickly picks up steam. This book discusses the culture war and the battle between religious forces in our society. The views it advocates are similar in some ways to those found in other popular books by conservative and religious writers, but it goes much deeper, has much stronger arguments, and I believe is more on target. The culture war is portrayed here as more of a religious battle than a political one, and after reading the book, I agree. The arguments presented throughout the book are hard to argue against. Although the book is really about the culture war, the part I like best is the convincing argument it makes for Christianity, which is probably the best I have read. Some things in this book will probably make a lot of people mad, but whether you agree with it or not, this book definitely makes you think. If you really want to understand the culture war and what is happening to our society, I would definitely recommend this book before any other I have read."},{"Title":"Understanding the Cultural War in America","review":"A quote from the book: \\"While the humanists are busy killing off their own offspring, they are really helping us. I am not saying we should approve of abortion for that reason. It is clearly a wicked act, one which, from God's perspective, is worthy of death. But we must not overlook the fact that those who commit this horrible act are nevertheless doing us a favor. By destroying their own offspring, they are killing off a source of future voters, the majority of whom would probably grow up to be just like their parents. Thus,abortion ultimately works to our advantage. It helps cleanse our society of future humanists.\\""},{"Title":"Understanding the Cultural War in America","review":"This book hits the nail right on the head. While many books have been written on this subject lately, none of them go to the heart of the problem America faces like this one does. The author is right- while getting the right people elected and the right judges on the Supreme Court are important, the real problem goes much deeper than this. This book may not be as fun to read as Ann Coulter or Rush Limbaugh, but you will come away with a clearer understanding of the problem we face. I also believe his solution is correct, if only enough people will follow it."},{"Title":"Intelligent Learning Infrastructure for Knowledge Intensive Organizations: A Semantic Web Perspective","review":"I liked so much the Knowledge and Learning management holistic approach of the book. In other words i havent seen before any textbooks dealing in an integragted way with knowledge and learning management. Most of them discuss e-learning which in fact is a stupid term!!! What means e-learning? Learning Mgmt is very nice term.Furthermore the Semantic web perspective helped me to see what is really happening. Many books on Semantic Web but most of them loose the real business value since they go to deep technical details that are out of my perception.An emerging new era of applications and frameworks. I run a business and really liked the relation of the topics to my daily routine as well as to my strategic considerations for the exploitation of knowledge and learning."},{"Title":"Intelligent Learning Infrastructure for Knowledge Intensive Organizations: A Semantic Web Perspective","review":"When I saw this title, I was triggered by the combination of many HOT keywords on title: Knowledge, Intelligent, Learning, Semantic Web.I found it VERY GOOD.

Nothing here that you wouldn't find by just looking at the proceedings of some average conference in knowledge management and semantic web."},{"Title":"Figured Out: Typology and Providence in Christian Scripture","review":"This spirited, fascinating, and occasionally sermonic book is noteworthy not exclusively for its subject matter, some of which falls outside of the author's principal field of Old Testament criticism. Rather, its interest lies in the incursion of a main exponent of B. Childs-style 'canonical criticism' into ethical, pastoral, and ecclesial arenas which frequently remain beyond the horizon of biblical scholars.A brief 'Part One' introduces the problem which Seitz intends to confront: 'historical criticism ... failed to do constructive theological work involving the identity of God in the most basic sense.' Here the first notes of 'canonical criticism' are sounded. What differentiates 'historicism' and 'historical criticism' from sounder Christian interpretative antecedents is 'its appeal to the human dimension of scripture to such a degree that the actual form and structure of the literary witness is eclipsed ...' (emphasis added). Seitz' appreciative references to Hans Frei's The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative signal a principal source of this criticism's vocabulary. Over against historicism's need to 'point beyond itself to a vast, complex, developmental, ever-changing continuum in time and space', Seitz urges that Christian readers let 'the first witness (testament) sound forth its notes in an appropriate manner' as an authoritative deposit which Jesus and the earlier Christians engaged as Scripture rather than as a vein to be mined for hints at the development of Israelite or Jewish religion on its way (or not) to a more mature Christian product.Parts Two ('Christian Scripture, Figured Out') and Three ('Two Testaments, One Scripture, One God') are a collection of essays in which Seitz comments upon current Anglican and wider Christian issues from the perspective of a biblical scholar and canonical critic who is concerned as well with wider issues. 'Scripture Becomes Religion(s): The Theological Crisis of Serious Biblical Interpretation in the Twentieth Century' (pp. 13-33) uses the gap between Pusey's and Gore's readings of Daniel as a test case for a hermeneutical shift whose consequences neither one would successfully manage. Eichrodt's attempt at an 'independent biblical theology', von Rad's tradition-historical method allowing no room for stabilisation of a textual 'final form' nor of any 'separate theological integrity', and - more bluntly - Brueggemann's de-ontologized 'unruly God' are brought in for criticism. This is delivered on the way to a description of what has been lost and then partially found (by Childs): 'figural interpretation' which assumes a 'surplus of intended meaning in every divine revelation' which God by his Spirit sovereignly and providentially effects through 'a word delivered once upon a time'.In 'Two Testaments and the Failure of One Tradition-History' (pp. 35-47), H. Gese and P. Stuhlmacher-von Rad's tradition-historical heirs-are cited for failing to appreciate that 'the final literary form of biblical books, the internal canonical arrangements and ordering of diverse traditions into a final literary statement' are not meaningless, but just the opposite. Both Gese and Stuhlmacher prioritise 'the process over the original credenda as static and authoritative, because self-understanding is always in flux', with damaging results. For Seitz, 'something stops' at a moment of canonical stabilisation, a critical pause which sets in motion a history of effects which relate back to that canonical res. Christian teaching and emerging Judaism respond to a canonical fixture in different ways, but both of them do respond to it as authoritative. The problem faced by the earliest Christians was not 'what to do with the Old Testament, but its opposite: '... in the light of a scripture whose authority and privileged status was everywhere acknowledged, what was one to make of a crucified messiah and a parting of the ways?''Scripture and a Three-Legged Stool' (pp. 49-68), 'Scripture and Trinity' (69-79), and 'Bait and Switch' (81-88) will be of interest primarily to Anglicans and their observers. Each of these essays has noticeably grown up out of Seitz' work as a student of Isaiah and other Old Testament literature. 'Booked Up: Ending John and Ending Jesus' (pp. 91-101) seeks 'clues to canonical shaping' in the endings of Ecclesiastes, GJohn, and Revelation.'Of Mortal Appearance: Earthly Jesus and Isaiah as a Type of Christian Scripture' (pp. 103-116) finds in the book of Isaiah a manner of responding to the New Thing in the light of an old word which 'in its temporal, literary, and theological organization ... is a type of Christian Scripture, Old and New Testaments.' That is, both the Book of Isaiah and the Christian canon speak of a 'distinction between two eras: one past and gone, which contained the seeds of promise and plan, and one coordinated with it, but only after a period of judgement had passed, by divinely given insight.'In 'Dispirited: Scripture as Rule of Faith and Recent Misuse of the Council of Jerusalem: Text, Spirit, and Word to Culture' (pp. 117-129), Seitz critiques the unusual and unsatisfactory 'biblicism' of attempts by Luke Johnson et al. to find in the event of Acts 15 a precedent for new truth regarding contemporary same-sex relationships. By contrast, Seitz describes the Jerusalem deliberations as taking place in the context of diverse gentile participation in Israel (not as the beginning of a 'gentile mission) and its results as programmed by theological reflection upon the scriptural directives for sojourners in the midst of Israel (Leviticus 17-18).'Handing Over the Name: Christian Reflection on the Divine Name YHWH' (pp. 131-144) engages the irony that Christians possess an Old Testament in which 'the Name of God' is central to its highest theological claims, and yet there is no certain route to the convention by which that name ought to be invoked. (Various alternatives exist: YHWH, the LORD, Yahweh, more recently Sophia et al.)'The Old Testament, Mission, and Christian Scripture' (pp. 145-157) defines 'mission' as 'God's address to humanity's forfeit', an address in which God speaks the dialect of blessing. Genesis 11-12 and Isaiah 40-66 are awarded pride of place in the discussion, which seeks to understand Israel's election in the light of God's more ecumenical project.In 'Prayer in the Old Testament or Hebrew Bible' (159-175), Seitz surveys prayer within and without the covenant with Israel. Prayer in the Old Testament is neither religious nor self-conscious. It is rather the stubbornly relational matter of naming the name of Israel's God as a human response to divine self-disclosure.A final chapter discusses 'The exegetical-theological significance of Article One of the Nice-Constantinopolitan Creed'. A conclusion draws the essays together. An appendix is the report of the Inter-Anglican Theological and Doctrinal Commission.Seitz' writing is fuelled by exegesis of the Old Testament and increasingly turned in provocatively theological directions. These essays appear to be held together as much by the author's own professional and theological pilgrimage as by any factor internal to the chapters. Here and there they betray the oral style of speeches delivered. The prose is frequently dense but nearly always repays attentive reading.This collection is a rich mine of occasionally unpolished nuggets for scholars eager to hear Seitz out on the failings of biblical criticism which he alleges, sometimes by speaking of the movement in the past tense. It will also be welcomed by those whose interest runs in more strictly biblical-theological directions."},{"Title":"Displeasures of the Table (Green Integer)","review":"A wonderful little prose work by a respected L.A. poet. Maybe it's \\"quirky memoir.\\" Maybe it's prose poetry. Maybe it's food writing. All I know is that it's a collection of short-form memoirs (most a page or less) centered around food but written by someone who sort of hates food, or at least sitting at the table. I heard her speak about this book once. She said that when she was first asked to write a food column for a lit. mag., she protested: \\"But I hate food.\\" Their response? \\"That's why you'd be perfect.\\" My kind of food writing. I keep telling people about this book and so far no one has heard of it--the same thing used to happen when I brought up her L.A. cohort, D.J.

All this material (again, including the translations) is readily available online for free. The introductions are very slim, not very informative and do not justify the extremely high cost.

She gives some background on her dysfunctional family dynamics, being accused of over-sensitivity, her difficulties with professional jealousy, and relationship problems and interpolates her essays with other women's writings on anger, forgiveness, and other related emotions. Talks about her substance abuse and social pressure to stifle her negative feelings. Although the reader's anger may have different sources, she'll find much she can relate to in this great little book. The book has funny as well as belligerent parts; and she doesn't preach or turn into a counselor.A great quote quoted by Gillespie, (I'm paraphrasing): \\"A dysfunctional family is any family with more than one person.\\""},{"Title":"Pissed Off: On Women and Anger","review":"If you grew up with an angry parent, this book will sound familiar. You may see yourself between the lines if you've run away from a discordant home. Anger is not only our power, but also our teacher, and the author has been on intimate terms with her subject for a very long time.Pissed Off is the third book of Spike Gillespie, whose rage-aholic father set her up for a fiery life with All the Wrong Men (her first book). Although Pissed Off is the author's memoir, short essays are interspersed throughout it from other women writers who diversify the author's powerlessness and fear by their own stories. The book is divided into three sections--Part I, where anger begins, Part II, where anger festers, and Part III, where anger yields to forgiveness. Spike leads us through road rage, spiteful colleagues, manipulative bosses, cruel in-laws, and an addicted spouse on her way to meeting forgiveness. With clarity and directness, we travel from New Jersey to Texas where the author realizes that her father's anger is still running her life, even as he is slipping into Alzheimer's. \\"I don't know what made [my father] so angry so long ago, but I'm done letting his anger rule my life--and I feel bad for him whatever it was that took him down...\\" The author, who is known for her bumper stickers, might print \\"mellow with age instead of rage\\" as this book's adage. We would do well to read it and heed it."},{"Title":"Heat Lightning","review":"Oh my, what a keeper! I have a shelf with nothing but Anne Stuart novels. Small wonder since each and every book she gives a haunting powerful read, that slams into you like a tidal wave. The force of her prose awes you. She leaves you breathless. She's an addiction. Stuart does more with 100 pages than most writers could do with 300. She's a brilliant writer that dances with the devil in the fire, and demands her readers follow along on the dangerous waltz. Heat Lightning is Stuart at her very very best. If you are a Stuart fan and missed this one, snap up any copy you can. Quick! If you've never read Stuart - you poor thing - you can do no better than starting with this one.In the sticky, humid tradition of the Long Hot Summer - Jassy Turner is a Southern Belle in the old tradition. Used to loud mouthed, pushy men who pat their women on the head and expect them to say fiddlie-dee, Jassy has long ago learnt to get her way by flanking maneuvers. She is a pampered rich girl, whose whole life has been tea parties, gentle manners and observing the proprieties. Oh, she faces the harsher realities of running a shelter for abused women, but that sort of ugliness has never personally touched her life. Until he came striding across the lawn. Six foot of hunk, a come-hither gleam in his pale eyes that had all the ladies of Turner's Landing ready to swoon, Jassy knew he was going to be trouble, but she had no idea just how much.Caleb Spenser came across the Turner lawn - a wolf amongst pigeons - and he was heading straight at Jassy. At the last second, he confronts her brother. Caleb has bought the old bordello, the property next to the Turner's Belle Reve and claims he is going to fix it up. Only, Jassy sees there's bad blood between her brother and this stranger. Determined to find out what, and head off any problems, she finds herself in Caleb's company, desperate for answers, which neither man seems willing to give. And she does not like the ones she is getting. Caleb's come for vengeance, his plans including taking Jassy, but neither of them is prepared for the flames they create together.Stuart paints a claustrophobic sense of the old South, that slow, stifling, itchy Falkneresque sense of people on the edge, waiting for the rain to break the drought, waiting for someone to make the wrong move setting everyone on a course of destruction. Caleb is another of Stuart's dangerous bad boys with the devil's soul and a black heart. Once again, Caleb and Jassy will draw you with their complex characters, their flaws, leave breathless by the range of emotions and passion. It just does not get any better than this. I once had someone tell me if he could just once sing a song like Gary Puckett of the Union Gap or play Classical Gas on a guitar like Mason Williams he would feel he had been touched with greatness. Me - I would just like to write a book as good as Anne Stuart."},{"Title":"Heat Lightning","review":"When I first received this book in the mail, I was disappointed because it was a Harlequin Romance, but Anne Stuart proved once again that you can't tell a book by it's publisher. Excellent reading! Caleb Spencer has the perfect amount of bad boy in him to make him interesting. I only wish I knew when the tv movie was playing on Romance Classics so I could tune in."},{"Title":"Heat Lightning","review":"This is the book that started me on a path of Anne Stuart addiction. Once I read it in 1992 when it was first released, I went in search of all Anne's titles. When reading this book, I feel the sultry heat of the bayou, see Caleb's bad-boy face and become Jassy. What a wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Heat Lightning","review":"In Heat Lightning, Anne Stuart continues to prove why she is the resident genius of romance novels! Her books amaze me with their complex characters and unique plots.Caleb Spencer was imprisoned for a crime that he did not commit. He has come to seek vengeance on the man responsible for this injustice. The one thing that he does not count on is his enemy's sister. Jassy Turner comes into Caleb's life and turns it upside down. Whereas Caleb emits \\"badness\\", Jassy is able to see right through his facade. She believes in him, trusts him, and eventually falls in love with him. Caleb has had very little love in his life and needs it desperately.The problem is this....what happens when your need for REVENGE and your need for LOVE conflict with one another. What happens when these two competing values are waging war within? What wins out? Can there be a happy ending? These are all questions that Stuart makes you think about early and then slowly and skillfully leads you to the answer. Pure Brilliance."},{"Title":"Heat Lightning","review":"Tortured bad boy heroes are Anne Stuart's specialty--she does them so well. The bad boy in Heat Lightning is Caleb Spenser, the mysterious man who showed up in Turner's Landing, bought the old bordello, charmed all the ladies, and frightened and angered Jassy Turner's brother. Rumor is he's been in prison for murder.Jassy, daughter of the town's founding family, and the one everyone turns to for help, the one who fixes things, is attracted and intrigued, but he's upset her brother, and she's going to find out why, and fix it.I'm pretty sure I've read this one before, but it must have been before we moved, because it's not on my shelf. That's fine, though, because it's definitely worth a re-read.The atmosphere is lush and steamy and sets a sort of film noir mood. Caleb and Jassy are on opposite sides of a life-and-death confict, and their emotions and actions are real and intense.It's a lot of book packed into a few pages, and I find myself really wishing I'd read this back in 1992 when it first came out instead of at least a decade later--no doubt I'd have all of Anne Stuart's books on my shelves by now if I had, instead of still having a bunch to look for."},{"Title":"TVR The Complete Story","review":"&quot;What a Read&quot;...

It's the business I'm in and it is dear to me on a personal level. There are many excellent portions and handy information pieces scattered about the book and that's the good news.I will refrain from personalizing my complaints and stick to the issues as I see them. To write this book as the author, you should know Ohm's Law. Harley does not. This is made evident in several examples. Amperes, voltage and wattage are all part of a greater equation that appears to mystify the author. The basic laws of physics and simple electrical concepts need be firmly grasped prior to making an endeavor such as this. There are many elements of \\"Dark Science\\" in the high-end audio realm and a mystique that is largely relevant. This book does a strong job of handling that delicate balance between science and myth, that is so important to this industry. Along the way however it forgets to \\"check the science\\"That's too bad, but not a total loss...A serious explanation of negative feedback as used in power amplifiers would have been pretty easy to put down for the record. Most power amp manufactures have fascinating solutions to the problems associated with negative feedback. A breakdown of a few of the key developments in this area would have been excellent. An opportunity missed. Instead he uses an example of a negative feedback amplifier and calls it just the opposite! At that point in the book I admit I was a bit frustrated.The good parts are many!It's an enjoyable read when the author sticks to what he actually knows, acoustics and auditioning gear. I learned much and felt the key points were illustrated clearly and in the contexts of meaningful application. I am not saying \\"don't buy\\"I guess I'm saying this book missed a huge opportunity simply by not getting some important parts right. That's all."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"This is one of the very few books I have ever returned to the bookstore (and I have bought thousands of books.)Why don't I like this book?1) It contains many, many, factual errors. These errors would be easily spotted by any freshman physics student, and should have been spotted by the publisher. For example, the author Robert Harley apparently doesn't understand the difference between electrical current and voltage.2) It doesn't actually explain things. To me, an explanation shows how something works in terms of basic principles. Mr. Harley simpley states &quot;facts&quot;, e.g., an outboard D/A converter will improve your sound, without explaining how or why.3) Many photos and diagrams have mistaken or even irrelevant captions, leading me to conclude that Mr. Harley doesn't understand his own diagrams. For example, a diagram of an amplifier that uses feedback is used to &quot;illustrate&quot; a point about amplifiers that don't use feedback.This last is the most serious point to me, because it makes me suspect that much of the technical-looking stuff in the book is included to impress the reader, not to actually explain things. In other words, it creates the impression of dishonesty.To the people who defend the book as not intended for technical readers, I say this: even a non-technical book should be written by someone who understand the technical issues, so he or she can explain things clearly and truthfully. If it turns out that the author doesn't know the technical stuff, why should we read the book?I might add that Robert Harley has a very poor reputation among respected audio engineers and other commentators in the field. Some audio manufacturers (but not all) pander to him apparently because he edits a high-end audio magazine, and his reviews can make or break a product."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"[Just for reference, I have a background in electronics, old-school hi-fi sales, professional sound system installation, and operating both a PA system business and a mobile DJ business... and my hearing as measured by audiologists still reaches most of the spectrum from 50-18khz and follows normal response (aka loudness) curves.]>> If you want to understand the electrical and electronic \\"rules\\" and theories, there are several books you can borrow from a local library (or buy at an electronics supply store). Understanding voltage, amperage, power (v*a), capacitance, inductance, phasing, etc. is all basic to correctly installing any level of \\"advanced\\" audio equipment./* if you dont understand these terms or the acronyms in my review - you need to get some electronic and audio engineering texts...*/There are some old-school \\"hi fi\\" books that cover the basics of speakers, acoustics, and room design, (most are less than $25).If you seriously want to understand high-end audio Systems, I suggest investing in Audio Engineering books (most are $50 to $100+). These cover acoustics more comprehensively, how to \\"aim\\" speakers, apply acoustic treatment, what wire guage is needed for long speaker runs, how to design (or choose) a passive crossover, how to operate an active crossover, etc.**These all get you to the basic level of knowledge needed to weed out the useful info from the \\"fluff\\" in high-end audio magazines and 'text books'. A basic example is that there is a significant difference in power loss (heard as loss in dynamic range) between 20AWG speaker wire and 14AWG cable. But most professional audio engineers/installers question the value of $1,000 per meter(yard) oxygen-free-copper wire as compared to using a doubled pair of 16awg or 14awg (a pair each for negative and positive for each speaker), for &lt; $50/meter. A pair of thick extension cords turned into speaker wires may not be as cool looking as a multi-colored cable labeled \\"Mega-Cable\\" and having some funny looking noice-cancelation inductors and proprietary gold flashed connectors - but there are very few people on this earth who can *honestly* tell the difference in a \\"double blind test\\", unbiased by knowing what cable costs $8,000 and what costs $200 and came from a hardware store.Likewise, many people with trained ears can hear the difference between tube and solid-state audio, and can SEE it on an oscilloscope as the rounded edges of a clipped waveform as compared to the square edge produced by a SS amp.Again, proper speaker placement (height and room position) and acoustic treatment of the listening room has noticeable affects on sound quality.And - large power amps (>200wpc RMS) have a more noticeable dynamic range before distortion occurs due to clipping, allowing more comfortable listening at higher SPLs (even if they are dangerous). but...a tube amp with only 20-30wpc can sound better than a SS amp with the correct speakers and correct musical source (i.e. not rap or metal). [ps. I love metal, some rap, and lots of other types of music!]**All these effects are not only something you can Hear but they can be Measured and are based on Scientific principles developed over at least 100 years (some are old, some are circa 1940s-today).BUT - claiming to hear a power conditioner providing more \\"soundstage\\", or claiming a $1,000 RCA interconnect has certain audible traits in the low frequency range is very questionable. Beware when an audio review reads like a WINE or CIGAR tasting. It is not referenceable to Anything! MORE IMPORTANTLY, unless the same audible characteristic is heard by more than one person, it is a Subjective evaluation based on personal taste and several psychological factors unique to that person and time.Honestly, I like TAS, but many of the reviews make me laugh. For example an interconnect is claimed to \\"..have an expansive soundstage in which orchestral images always seem rooted and stable...\\" Come on!!-what the hell does that really mean!?!? A wire is not a dynamic component like a tonearm or speaker motor and unless it is being chewed on by the cat should not be affecting the audible \\"soundstage\\" perceived by the listener.Will a $1,000 tonearm \\"sound\\" better than a $250 one? ...possibly slightly noticable, but will a $15,000 tonearm sound better than the $1,000 model....?CONCLUSION: Use this book as a guide, but temper it with factual knowledge from Audio/Sound Engineering books (go to the local college if you dont want to buy them).CAVEAT - if you have ruined your hearing with excessively loud music - of any genre, or by loud engines or industrial noise, you can't hear much beyond 100-12khz if you are lucky, and the frequency response of your ears is probably very ragged,(so save some money and stick to an iPOD or a $500 packaged system....)ALSO - if you can afford high-end gear and like the prestige and sex appeal it has - Go for It and dont waste time on a book. Open the checkbook and buy what looks sexy and fits your budget. Most people with the money to buy this gear dont *really* have the ears that a professional musician, engineer, or producer has - they buy the stuff on snob appear and on \\"horsepower races\\" (mines better than yours).True audiophiles with gifted ears value an old AR turntable and Dynaco-70 amp as much as a set of MBL speakers driven by a Conrad Johnson amp and Mark Levinson preamp...

Everything in the book is predicated on the notion that what we try to achieve through our devotion to high-end audio is musical purity, a representation that brings us as close to the real thing (and as far away from the equipment) as possible. Harley gives no impression that he favors any particular brand or format, nor that he has any other ax to grind apart from the pleasure imparted by good sound.That said, for the budding and experienced gearheads alike, there is copious, well-crafted exposition of the technical minutae governing each aspect of sound reproduction, from the nature of digital and analog signals to their final output from the loudspeakers. After reading the first few chapters on the basics of listening to and buying high-end equipment, many readers may find it most useful to skip around the book and read the chapters or sections that are most appropriate to their present needs or questions. Fortunately, Harley has organized and indexed the book to make its use as a reference guide easy and exceedingly useful.I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"Fist a disclaimer...I'm not an audio engineer or circuit designer. I'm also a relative newcomer to high-end audio--but am a long time music lover. This review is based on the 1995 edition of this book (I understand new ed is forthcoming). I felt the author did an exceptionally good job in structuring the book and writing to an appropriate level of reader. He describes what each component does, how it works, what to listen for when testing, etc...The initial chapters which are &quot;stage setting&quot; chapters, teminology, etc. are also very valuable. Lots of technical details are included, but they are in appendices so that someone who is interested, can go get the info there, while those less interested in that don't get bogged down in the detail. So, bottom line: this *has* to be a very difficult book to write--ie, author is writing to a very diverse readership in terms of audio expertise, etc. As one who is interested in high-end audio and in the process of upgrading a mid-range system to a true high-end system, I found this book invaluable. Well worth the $$ and time if you have even a passing interest in audio/music. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"As a long time lover of music, I started to get interested in how to get the best possible sound at home and started my journey into the audiophile world with this book. In my opinion, this is the only reason you should buy this book: if you are looking for a place to start and have absolutely no idea what you're getting yourself into.As other commenters have noted, yes, there are myriad problems with the technical details of the book. These are clearly not Harley's strong suits, though where he shines is in talking about acoustics and auditioning equipment. I also like that he occasionally reminds the reader that the point is enjoying the music, not getting bogged down in equipment (though it's hard to take him seriously sometimes, especially if you read the reviews of $1000+ power cords in TAS). He certainly doesn't allow himself to get bogged down in the technical details and underlying principles.All in all, \\"complete\\" is a misnomer, to say the least. There's no need to keep harping on his complete lack of technical prowess, but the book falls short in other areas, too. I, for one, was appalled that there is only one page in the entire book that covers headphones and headphone amps - a primary listening method for many an audiophile, and he doesn't even bother going into detail about them.You know how there are those people on forums who know a lot about one little thing and assume that they're knowledgeable enough to talk about other related things? That's this book. Take it for what it's worth.It's a great introduction to high end audio, and the studious reader will not adopt it as his bible, but use it and the information in it as a jumping off point into this wacky, wonderful world of audiophilia.Happy listening!"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"Harley perpetuates myths. If you read between the lines, he is implying that in general you get better sound as you go up the price ladder for preamplifiers, power amplifiers, integrated amplifiers, CD players, speaker cables, interconnects, and power cords. Bull. Rigorous double-blind tests have consistently shown that much of what Harley advocates is garbage.This book is filled with bad advice and twisted logic. Here is some of the idiocy. Flipping a two-pronged AC plug on a CD player or turntable may improve its sound. AC-power conditioners may improve the sound. Banana-plug terminations are sonically inferior to spade lugs. Liquids and coloured paints may improve the sound of CDs. A \\"high-quality, properly set-up LP playback system, playing a record in good condition, will sound better than any CD.\\" Do not use fluorescent lighting in the listening room. Technical performance matters for tuners but not as much for other components. \\"Loudspeakers costing a little more than $2500 are often disproportionately better than those costing a little less than $2500.\\" \\"The component may have a flat (accurate) measured treble response, but the distortions it introduces give the impression of too much treble.\\" And according to Harley, double-blind tests are fundamentally flawed. Yet if it suits his agenda, he is shameless in citing a positive result published in _Stereophile_--a joke magazine among audiophiles who refuse to listen to hype.I am not going to try to list all the stupid \\"advice\\" Harley gives, but if one could somehow compile all the bogus audio information, myths, half-truths, hype, and lunacy, this book would be the result. Harley is part of the subjectivist school of high-end audio that is more interested in hype and myth reinforcement than helping audiophiles obtain the best value for their money.Exacting double-blind tests have repeatedly shown that the placebo effect can trick naive audiophiles into believing that expensive components can sound better than inexpensive components and that worthless treatments and accessories can be effective. Harley is aware of the placebo effect, but because it is convenient for him, he claims that it does not apply to audio. He--again, no big surprise--provides no evidence to support his preposterous claim. It is astounding how anyone can sleep well at night after writing this amazing garbage. On the back cover, there is a picture of Harley smiling. He must have been laughing at how he is going to bamboozle more gullible audiophiles into spending more money than necessary.It is funny how Harley provides a section where he admonishes readers to be wary of disreputable audiophile magazines. \\"The high-end product review is thus not only more honest, but much more discriminating in determining what is a worthy product.\\" Hilarious. If all you want is the best sound, then keep an open mind, be prepared for the possibility that your ego may receive some bruising, and do your homework. Avoid this book and, instead, go to truthful sources of information like the periodicals _Sound and Vision_ and _The Audio Critic_, the Boston Audio Society, Ian G.

It is not easy sorting through the mess, which is where this book helps.The author explains what high end audio is about, mostly with an emphasis on 2-channel stereo (which is indeed what audiophiles seem to fixate upon the most). There are good sections on home theater and multi-channel playback. Ultimately, however, the focus is on stereo and separate high end components, rather than one-piece receivers and home theater, but most of the principles described in the book apply to those system and can make you a more informed consumer.For a novice, the book explains the roles and useful characteristics of different portions of the audio chain, such as preamplifiers, controllers, amplifiers, speakers, room acoustics, and what to look for. If you are a more advanced reader, the chapters at the end about how to read and interpret measurements are probably worth the price of the book.To answer some of the criticisms of this book: if you really want to get deeply into room acoustics, amplifier and loudspeaker designs, there are better books, e.g. by Floyd Toole or Tomlinson Holman. Acoustics and audio component design are complex engineering fields where new breakthroughs happen occasionally, but myths and outdated practices live long, so it helps if you read more than just this book.Bottom line: this is a nice, well-written book worth reading :)"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"Harley should have stuck on writing what &quot;high-end&quot; audio should be, and not delve on technical matters.

He offers tips for putting together a system for several price ranges rather than simply the high cost system. Instead of discussing brand names the author provides a description of the qualities that make amplifiers, speakers, turntables and the like high-end, i.e. capable of delivering high quality sound."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"I just purchased the latest edition of this book after owning the 3rd ed then passing it on to friends.The author, Robert Harley has done a service to audiophiles that few before him have dared, namely writing a book without the self-absorbed geek-speak of meters and metrics that have been used in excess to evaluate audio equipment. It does not matter if the author is not an engineer or a physicist (some of whom are terrible writers). What is evident (if you take the time to read the entire book), is his experience in this business and the number of subjects discussed, even if it is not at the depth that would please those with their Masters & PHD's.I supposed editors of audio magazines have a certain amount of pressure on them from the manufacturers of the gear. If they don't pander to the vendors from time to time, they don't get loaners to evaluate for the reviews, they don't get paid-for advertising, they don't get tours of the labs & plants where the equipment is designed / built, and they don't get invited to audio shows.This book is a bargain if you have any confusion about what constitutes high end audio or you are making the leap from big-box retailed audio to the real stuff. You aren't going to find this book on a rack at Best Buy. Harley covers a wide range of topics, not just about the electronics, players, and speakers, but on cables, placement of components, some rudiments of theory, how to buy, and a lot more. Let's face it, there is some pretty pricey stuff out there with known brand names on it, but how can you trust the marketing hyperbole that some high end audio vendors publish. After all, much of the advertising for it is written by expensive hired guns (and the pricier the product is, the more expensive is the marketing behind it).I would have given the book 4.5 or 5 stars, only because I thought it could have delved into more detail with some of the subject matter, but I'm guessing the publisher determined this, not the author.High-end audio purchases can be reasonably affordable. I discovered that there is a sea of difference between many products, independent of their pricing. This book is not perfect (which one is?) but it will steer you in the right direction before you plop down your dollars. Pretty interesting read, to-boot."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"As long as the author sticks to straight-forward info (such as explining why a pre-amp is often needed between a source component and a power amp) the book is useful. Too often, though, it degenerates into high-end silliness about interconnects, speaker wire, digital dither and the like. The author gets a bit pretentious when declaring that price and sound quality are not always related when he gives an example of $10,000 speaker vs. a more &quot;affordable&quot; product that goes only for $4,000!It's an ok book provided the reader keeps his/her BS detector powered up."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"The negative \\"reviews\\" of my book The Complete Guide to High-End Audio are a cleverly disguised attempt to discredit an entire field of audio with which the book's \\"reviewers\\" fundamentally disagree. Specifically, a vocal minority of audio hobbyists believes that all competently designed amplifiers or CD players, for examples, sound identical, and that high-end audio is an organized consumer rip-off. They also reject critical listening in the belief that measurements can completely define audio-component performance. The posted \\"reviews\\" are an attempt to discredit not just my book, but also the entire field of observation-based evaluation of audio products. Moreover, the \\"reviewers\\" resent the fact that I have a large and dedicated following through my books and as Editor-in-Chief of The Absolute Sound magazine. They also don't want you to read Appendix D of The Complete Guide to High-End Audio, an update of the highly controversial paper I presented at the 1991 Audio Engineering Society convention that makes perhaps the most compelling argument to date for the observational-listening approach to audio.The main line of attack is that the book is filled with technical errors and that I am technically incompetent. First, I have a degree in audio engineering and have taught a college degree program in that field. Second, I have been Technical Editor (or de facto Technical Editor) of the two leading English-language audio magazines (Stereophile or The Absolute Sound) since 1989. Third, I sent each chapter before publication to experts in specific areas of audio for technical review. For example, a world-class acoustician and physicist reviewed the acoustics chapter; a designer of reference-quality digital products reviewed the digital chapter; and so on. Fourth, The Complete Guide to High-End Audio has sold more than 100,000 copies and has been translated into three other languages. Fifth, the book has received rave reviews from highly technical audio experts around the world (excerpts are posted on my website).I invite readers to see through the agenda of those posting \\"reviews\\" and to form their own opinions of The Complete Guide to High-End Audio."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"If you are reading this review is because you are probably about to shell out some serious money on a high-end system, and you want to make a decision that you'll not regret afterwards.

Some of them do not even cost money, like speaker placement, but have a tremendous effect on the quality of the sound. This book tackles this issue, and many more, like no other book does.

Online posts and archives tend to assume a base of knowledge that I just don't have. This book delivers it and then some. If it has any faults, they are not apparent to me and would be vastly outweighed by the valuable information presented in an understandable yet pleasingly challenging way.

It will prevent you from buying equipment that you may soon become dissatisfied with and in the long run, it will save you a lot of grief as well as money. The author makes a point to emphasize that \\"high end audio\\" refers to the quality of the component/system and not the cost. However, like most things in this world, you will find that the two are usually closely related.The body of the book is not overly technical, however it does provide several appendices for those who wish to delve into the theory behind the concepts. It is also quite through and is intended for the reader who wishes to get into some depth on the subject. If your interest is only in a basic overview, I would suggest that you look elsewhere.I have read the book thoroughly and still find myself referring back to it on many occasions.

You will definitely learn a lot more than listening/reading to subjective/biased magazine reviewers and snake oil salesmen that are at every store trying to sell you a new piece of gear every six months and you'll be very proud of yourself at the end.

True-to-form, Robert Harley's \\"Complete Guide to High-End Audio\\" contains both the good and bad of \\"High-End Audio\\". That is, he presents a lot of great information, great advice, and he throws in a good dose of total nonsense and mis-information as well.The problem, for many readers, will be in figuring out which of Mr. Harley's advice is valid and which of his many statements should be discarded as nonsense.Welcome to the world of \\"high-end audio\\".

I have some of those types of books focused specifically on hifi and acoustics. They're useful but not much fun to read. This book is genuinely enjoyable to read and still educational. I'm no hard core audiophile and don't presume to hear all the \\"esoteric\\" nuances that audiophiles seem to hear (or imagine they do). But Harley comes up with real definitions for things like \\"air\\", \\"bloom\\" and \\"grainy\\". And some topics he absolutely nails. For example, for years I've tried to understand how to use Small/Thiel parameters to model an isobaric subwoofer. He answered my questions in one sentence. That's impressive.This is just a fun book. At 600ish pages I'm amazed at how fast I'm absorbing it."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"I wish I had read this book a few years ago when I started seriously attempting to have good sound at home. I have been reading lots of audio magazines and on-line sources, and if I had read this book earlier I would have gotten much more out of the time I spent. It makes me want to go back and re-read many articles.Robert Harley not only covers high-end audio very well, but goes above and beyond by the excellent appendices which include a great introduction to the audio electronics physics principles. I read the book cover to cover and could barely put it down.I cannot believe the negative reviews that some have posted--Mr. Harley clearly knows this area and it comes across throughout the book. One reviewer mentions \\"high-end silliness\\" regarding digital dither--well this is an area I do know well and there is nothing silly about it. I am a software engineer and have been using dither in image processing and sound processing for decades, and completely understand it. Mr. Harley did a good job pointing out the high-level idea, while referencing another book for the details (which the reviewer clearly did not find time to check out). Regarding speaker cables and interconnects--I just replaced my speaker cables recently and the difference in sound was dramatic. Anyone could hear that. In fact the (tube) amplifier bias needle on some of the output tubes, which had been fluctuating with the amp output before, is now stable. It seems clear that there is an objective difference here as well as the obvious subjective difference.I am so happy to have a new understanding of the science (and art) of audio."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"Consumer Audio is a field rife with baloney. The higher end you go, the sillier *some* of the hype gets as well. There are a number of honest, high quality boutique audio manufacturers that can get lost in the shuffle with all the dubious claims made by some firms. Audio shops can also be very intimidating as well - especially when you don't know how to ask the right questions or what they might be. How can a budding audiophile put together the a great sounding system he or she can afford while avoiding spending a lot of money on things that don't matter and cut through the baloney?First thing - aside from reading materials - is locate a store where you can rely upon the experience and knowledge of the people to steer you to the right system - and one that is interested in your business long term (Audiophilia is a life long pursuit with upgrades, subtractions and additions over a few decades).Second thing - self education. A lot of people pick up magazines and read the reviews - and this set would likely be interested in a book like this, written as it is by the founder and editor of The Absolute Sound.This book, unlike most audio magazines, does not review equipment, but is a road map through the embarrasement of riches that high end has become. How do you evaluate speakers and, as the author said - find the 2% of speakers worth owning? How can you evaluate a system to find if it is right for you? If you are going to buy a high end CD player - what things make a high end player sound good? How does the current round of SACD and DVD-Audio disc players work - and are they worth it to a prospective audiophile? How does a turntable work - and what considerations do you have to give when you go and purchase one? How important are interconnects? How much of your budget should you spend on source, preamps, amps and speakers?Some people when reading the book may be distressed that there might be some technical details in the explanations might not be to their liking or there are a few errors. To dismiss this book (the only one of its kind in wide circulation, BTW) is to throw the proverbial baby out with the bathwater. Given that the author has listened to, evauated, panned a lauded more equipment that most readers will ever see in a show room let along personally evauate, the &quot;how to put an enjoyable system together that sounds great that will fit your budget&quot; part of the book (and a valiant attempt on EXPLAINING the technology behind the components and speakers!) makes it a &quot;must buy&quot; to someone contemplating dropping some kilobucks on a sound system.I purchased the second editions and was able to use it to put together a great sounding system for less than I though. I especially liked his explanation on how to allocate the budget for your system."},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"Amazon should not allow anonymous reviews.

It's helped me get the most out of my equipment, and the sound that comes out of my system is just incredible!Now on to secondaries:Q: Who should NOT buy this book?A: Anyone who likes to bicker and get into some pee-ing contest over how they're so inclined on their technical knowledge of &quot;physics&quot; that they blatantly forget what this book is all about, namely high-end audio!Q: Who SHOULD buy this book?A: Anyone who appreciates music and the reproduction thereof from a stereo system.It not only covers all aspects of components but also the intricacies of connecting them to each other. In fact, it contains quickly accessible information on how to improve your system's sound within a short period of time. It has helped me go from a great system with GOOD sound to a great system with GREAT sound just by adding an AC line conditioner, per the author's recommendation.Overall evaluation: This guy (Harley) may NOT be a physics guru, but he surely knows his HIGH-END audio systems; hence, the book is entitled &quot;The Complete Guide to High-End Audio&quot; and NOT &quot;The Complete Guide to Physics of High-End Audio.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to High-End Audio","review":"Well, re the negative reviews of what Harley may or may not have screwed up vis a vis Ohm's law, etc., notice that NONE of these negative reviews have any specificity at all, e.g., which concept, what page or chapter, how it was erroneously presented, and what the correct answer is. It would have been nice to be able to give the nay-sayer some credit for catching an error, if only they would specify what that error is and show us the way. Absent that, the critiques aren't worth much. And if they're so damned obvious to these trained folk, how difficult would it have been to have given a proper critique, instead of just making noise? Per Mr. Twain, thunder is impressive, but it's lightning that does all the work ....As to the views expressed that hardware store stuff equals or exceeds the mega $$ fluff which people like to be talked into buying, particularly cables, that may well be true, but Harley does insist on A-B-A listening tests and, tho it might be difficult (it always is), it's the only way to tell.As to the rest, the book does an excellent job of teeing up and explaining all the current hi-end products, as well as historical developments, with appropriate caveats and illustrations. It really is an outstanding comprehensive guide, well worth the cost. And Harley's views on and presentation of types of products or audio theories or whatever are given in the same fashion he suggests be the ultimate lodestar for hi-end audio: neutral and uncolored.

It is a quick survey that gives background information about most of the players, whether international, regional or domestic.The account is concise, however, and sacrifices some details for the sake of brevity and coherence. Rabinovich's style is rich and attractive. For readers familiar with the Middle East, the book would serve as a fresh reminder and wouldn't take more than a couple of evening to finish.Another drawback is that the book covers the period 1975-1984 without covering the rest of the civil war that ended on 1990. Perhaps an updated version with the war's conclusion and perhaps some analysis of the aftermath of the war are currently needed.If you are looking for the history of the Lebanese civil war, this book is the one you are looking for. If you want some more history of the war, get Kamal Salibi's A House of Many Mansions as a supplement. Between the two books, you would have a complete and comprehensive idea of the Lebanese modern politics and its history."},{"Title":"Principal facts for 1747 gravity stations in southern Kansas and central Oklahoma (Open-file report)","review":"Lebanon has been a land of conflict and tragedy since its creation in the middle of the 20th century. Perhaps the greatest tragic event that Lebanon has experienced in modern times is the bloody civil war between 1975-1990, that left thousands dead, Lebanon's economy in ruins and resulted in excessive migration of the Lebanese population to neighbouring countries.The conflict during that period is of considerable political complexity, with the various religious groups of Lebanon, the various political parties, the PLO, Syria, Israel, the United States and the Soviet Union, affecting the crisis of the Lebanese state and its development. What Rabinovich has accomplished in this book, is a clear analysis of the political situation of Lebanon during the years 1970-1985, and the international diplomatic efforts that were made to resolve the crisis. Rabinovich's work stands out as a careful and reliable analysis on the events that shaped the history of Lebanon and the broader geographical area during that period, and the significance that each political actor played in the events that preceded and followed the second Lebanese civil war.Reliable works on Lebanese history are still rare, as historical research on Lebanon seems to still be limited, or not widely published in English, with most books on Lebanon being written by journalists rather than historians or political analysts. Itamar Rabinovich however stands out as a distinguished professor in political science, and his experienced knowledge of the history and political situation in the Middle East is obvious to anyone who has read his work. Another benefit of this book is the objectivity that it holds throughout the narrative. Rabinovich only seeks to explain, not to judge or criticize, which allows the reader to draw his/her own conclusions and keeps the narrative clean from unneeded bias.The negative side is that the book does not cover the whole period of the conflict, since the Lebanese crisis ended in 1990, and not in 1985, making the book an incomplete account. We can only hope that Professor Rabinovich will one day return and complete this work with the light of the new evidence and sources that are emerging."},{"Title":"Principal facts for 1747 gravity stations in southern Kansas and central Oklahoma (Open-file report)","review":"A nice work and very relevant about the Civil War in Lebanon. This showed the various fighting between Shiite, Sunni, Druze, and Christian factions. This war destroyed one of the few functioning democracies in the Middle East and brought in the armies of Syria, Israel, and the PLO. Lebanon has never been the same. Theocracy is rearing its ugly head through the Shiite, and the Christians have been marginalized resulting in mass emigration. The Palestinians continue to play a role in Lebanon's future, and Syria is still assasinating national politicians. The Middle East wars basically destroyed the demographics of the population resulting in the outside influences of her regional neighbors. It was interesting to hear Asad in the appendix justify his interference in Lebanon's internal affairs by saying they are a member Arab state, but it was strictly forbidden for the U.S. or other western countries to intervene.This is a nice authoritative read about the causes of Lebanon's Civil War. It shows how each group overplayed their hand, and caused the death of thousands."},{"Title":"Principal facts for 1747 gravity stations in southern Kansas and central Oklahoma (Open-file report)","review":"It needs to be updated.

A short easy, consice, and pleasent read not full of polemics or bias. It covers the main actors involved, the struggle and the outcome. The Lebanese Civil war began in 1976 with the attempted assasination of Pierre Gemayel, a Lebanese Christian leader. In retaliation a cycle of violence broke out originally between Phalange militias and PLO elements, widening into a costly wider war, that dragged in all communities eventually dividing the nation between christian and Muslim. In the ensuing violence and massacres more than 100,000 may have been killed. The Syrians intervened in the first year and in 1982 so did the Israelis.After the Israeli withdrawel from Beirut Lebanon became a Syrian colony accept for the south which was jointly contested by israel and Shia Islamists, and the north which was largely given over to the Maronites. However more than 200,000(mostly Christians) were forced to flee in the period.This is an important work.Seth J.

How you treat them.Passino is a strategist who would agree with Michael Porter that information can help give you strategic advantage, but advantage only comes through people.This book is a must read for any serious student or executive who has a lasting belief that technology can benefit enterprises of all kinds. It's a mandatory read for anyone responsible for a multimillion dollar systems investment."},{"Title":"Making I/T Work: An Executive's Guide to Implementing Information Technology Systems","review":"As one of the early North American pioneers of the SAP technology in late 80's, I have assisted numerous clients in implementing complex projects in an effort to drive significant business value and the realization of business strategy. Making I/T Work does an excellent job of capturing the lessons learned over the past decade and shares a practical framework for how to get it done right. The book combines the value of change management, alignment, and dynamic planning in an easy-to-read story. It is a must read for any executive embarking on a similar journey."},{"Title":"Making I/T Work: An Executive's Guide to Implementing Information Technology Systems","review":"Having spent 32 years in Information Technology, I find this book right on the mark. It is a must read for ALL CEOs and their I/T executive that may be contemplating a major change in their orgainzation or heading into to a project of any type or size. The authors use more than a half century of experience to describe how any major project, with or without an I/T component, will fail if proper management techniques and practices are not understood and followed. You may even think this book is about you and if you don't read it carefully and heed the advise, it may well be in the future!"},{"Title":"Making I/T Work: An Executive's Guide to Implementing Information Technology Systems","review":"Making I/T Work outlines an effective methodology for planning and executing technology initiatives. One of the nice things about the book is how it alternates between narrative and lesson, one reinforcing the other. And this is done in a style that is knowledgeable and confident without being preachy or pedantic.However, Severance and Passino have written a book that goes beyond IT implementation in its message to executives. Based on solid research and practical experience, Severance and Passino have provided a framework for bringing an organization together focusing on a common goal and executing according to a plan. Some would label this 'change management'. I would call it a platform for competitive advantage on a sustained basis. As the authors point out, knowing what to do really isn't all that difficult. Where the majority of companies have trouble is in execution. Great book!Gene TanskiCEO - Foresight Technologies"},{"Title":"Making I/T Work: An Executive's Guide to Implementing Information Technology Systems","review":"Regardless of an individual's role in organization transformation, Making I/T Work can serve as a textbook to map progress in the deployment of I/T. This includes senior management, mid level managers, end users, I/T staff, consultants, and shareholders. The authors have laid out a very logical approach to plan a major organizational transformation and to then monitor progress against strategic goals in a very dynamic environment.This book is very timely and relevant to what is needed in today's industry -- technology accountability, managing for results, and spending money wisely on I/T. Modernization and automation by themselves do not ensure business or organization success.Organizations want to ensure that their I/T investments are not only aligned with business priorities/visions at the enterprise level but that they can monitor I/T's effectiveness in a timely manner. Making I/T Work provides a roadmap on how to accomplish just this. The authors offer many pertinent questions to be answered at each step of the transformation process to reach a successful conclusion.The framework offered by the authors can serve as a guiding template to keep participants focused on the organization's strategic goals. I found this book to be immediately beneficial with respect to my current role in I/T initiatives. I highly recommend this book to anyone participating in a major transformation effort."},{"Title":"The Universe Within: A New Science Explores the Human Mind","review":"I was an Econ major until I read this book - I now have an undergraduate degree in cognitive science and a DPhil in neuropsychology. This book turned me on the fun stuff that is the science of the mind. It led me to Douglas Hofstadter, on to Oliver Sacks and a host of other authors and I was so influenced by it that I mentioned Morton Hunt in the dedication to my dissertation. Buy this book if you want to be captivated by what we are beginning to understand about how the mind works - how we think, remember and solve problems and engage in conversation."},{"Title":"The Universe Within: A New Science Explores the Human Mind","review":"Yep it is all of the fun questions that we need answering. And Morton tries to explain how and why. The back cover has a prominent selection that explains the book better than the introduction.The prewired brain:Improving your memory:Do we ever totally forget anything?How logical are we? Not very. How much does it matter?Do you \\"pigeonhole\\" other people, experiences, events? Is it bad to do so?Where children's ideas come from:Solving new problems:Mind over computer:There are several illustrations and tests. No breakthrough theories."},{"Title":"The Universe Within: A New Science Explores the Human Mind","review":"Hunt has done an excelent job in this book in discussing the field called cognitive science.I read this book in 1983 just after I had submitted my dissertation on J M Keynes's logical theory of probability at the University of California,Riverside.I discovered that there was nearly a one-to one onto correspondence between the major conclusions of cognitive science ,with respect to decision making ,reported in Hunt's book and the conclusions and analysis contained in chapter III and Part III of Keynes's 1921 A Treatise on Probability.There are five fundamental conclusions reported by Hunt.First,\\"Deductive thinking is an information-rearranging process...\\"while\\"...inductive thinking is an information-extending process...\\",(Hunt,p.157).Second,the most important form of reasoning is\\"...by analogizing from a set of similarities\\",(Hunt,p.158).Analogical reasoning is plausible reasoning based on degrees of likeness,similarity,and resemblance.It is reasoning based on a qualitative,comparative and/or interval estimate approach to probability that incorporates the mathematical laws of mathematical probability only as a limiting case.It must be pointed out here that Hunt fails to challenge the Tversky-Kahneman error that conflates probabilistic reasoning with the limiting case of mathematical probability laws.These laws are deductive in nature and not inductive(Hunt,p.184).Induction plays THE central role in understanding our world through learning by experience.Third,inductive thinking,while error prone,eventually leads to error correction.Fourth,\\"induction refers to those processes by which we group similar objects into categories,or recognize patterns that happen in some regular order\\",(Hunt,p.158).Thus,pattern recognition is fundamental to problem solving,teaching how to solve problems,and scientific discovery.Scientific discovery is the accidental and/or systematic result of pattern recognition applied to new data and/or a new problem.A scientist who makes a fundamental breakthrough \\"sees\\" or \\"intuits\\"or \\"perceives\\" something in the new data or information that his colleagues are unable to recognize.Finally,evolutionary processes have developed the mind's inductive capacity and it is this developed capacity to reason inductively that is the major reason for the supremacy of the human species,both to destroy and to create.I have deducted one star because practically all of these points were made long ago by John Maynard Keynes.Keynes never made the mistake of conflating probabilistic reasoning based on analogy,similarity,and pattern recognition with the purely mathematical laws of mathematical probability.These laws hold as a limiting case.The fact that in many decision situations it \\"appears\\" that the decision maker is violating the mathematical laws of probability is explained by the fact that in many such situations the prerequisites needed to apply the mathematical laws of probability are not satisfied.Keynes would never make the claim that most decision makers do not understand the concept of regression to the mean(see Hunt,pp.186-187).Regression to the mean automatically assumes that a unique probability distribution fits the data.The usual assumption is that a normal distribution fits the data.The fact is that in many instances such assumptions are false."},{"Title":"Echoes in the night: Memories of a Titanic survivor","review":"Frank Goldsmith was nine years old when he became a survivor of the Titanic. Though he lost his father during the sinking, he and his mother did eventually make it to Michigan to live near his relatives to whom they were en route when the disaster struck. Many years later, Mr. Goldsmith took the time to write down his memories of being on the Titanic and his impressions of what happened during that fateful night. Also included in this slim book are several photos of people who Mr. Goldsmith knew from the sinking, as well as much correspondence showing what happened to not only his mother and her friends, but how the American people, the Red Cross, and the Salvation Army (but not the White Star line) came to their aid.Mr. Goldsmith did not pretend to be an author, but his dedication in sharing his first-hand account is actually well written. Though many of the details were either forgotten or glossed over, this book is indeed a treasure for anyone who is at all interested in learning more about the disaster and its aftermath. Published through the Titanic Historical Society, this is a gem and should be a part of any serious Titanic buff's collection."},{"Title":"Echoes in the night: Memories of a Titanic survivor","review":"First of all, I'm writing a review for the REPRINTING of this book. The name of the book is titled, \\"Titanic: Eyewitness my story\\" by, Frank Goldsmith. This book can be easily purchased on the Titanic Historical Society website, in their online store. It is a thin, blue book, that has a painting of the Titanic sailing away from Southampton. This book is a reprinting of the, out of print, \\"Echoes in the Night\\".As for my review, this book is very interesting. From what I hear, it's the ONLY book written from a child in third class. It has an interesting description of the lifeboat & lowering, as well as the sinking of the Titanic. I've looked over the book many times and am very amused when I look it over.If your like me, and are trying desperately to find a copy of \\"Echoes in the Night\\", my best guess it to purchase this new edition for now. Still keep looking. 2 years ago, a used copy appeared on ebay and sold for almost $400! I'm sure there are some copies out there that are for sale. Good luck!"},{"Title":"King Arthur Pendragon: Epic Roleplaying in Legendary Britain","review":"It's been a whlie since I've played this, or any other game.This game lives up to it's title. While, perhaps, a bit more gritty than the \\"Once and Future King\\" stories, the rules do an excellent job of re-creating the world of King Arthur. I've been Role Playing for quite a while now... 14 years? And this is one of the best games out there, and a very refreshing change from the Monty Haul-ism of D&D; and the like.The emphasis here is on ROLE PLAYING. The rules focus on attempting to become a perfect knight, a paragon of virtue, and a knight of renoun. Unlike other games, this game incorporates a \\"winter season\\" that assumes downtime, and allows your character to age. Yes, aging is a part of this game, and perhaps your character's children will get to adventure as well.The Traits operate on a balance scale of 20 points - The total of these two attributes add up to 20. So you have, perhaps, Merciful 17 - Cruel 3. Passions are things you feel strongly about, your Lord, hate of the Saxons, etc.This is a sample of the way the rules are designed to help you Role Play rather than Roll Play.Combat and Magic are taken much more seriously than in D&D.; Your character's hit pionts are derived from their stats, and stay that way for the rest of the game (more or less). The most hit points you can have is 39. Armor absorbs damage. Now, what's the most damage our 39 hit point character can do with his sword? 7D6 - that's up to 42 points, with an average of 24/25.Combat is to be taken seriously!As for Magic, well. This isn't D&D.; There's none of the flash-bang Magic that there is in D&D.; In fact, Merlin would be impressed by the magic a 2nd level D&D; wizard could do. Spells take a long time to cast. Holy Ground, High Holidays, group ceremonies, etc. have a great effect on the outcome of spells. This is a game where players will spend weeks or months preparing spells, to be cast in holy places, on high holy days. Then spending time resting and recuperating after spells have been cast.I don't know how supplements handle magic, Faerie, etc. Notice again that the emphasis here is on Role Playing, Storytelling, not FLASH-BANG effects. This game gives you opportunities to describe events, tournaments, adventures, celebrations, not just hack-and-slash fighting.This game isn't for everyone, even those who it is for may take a while to acclimate. Like Castle Falkenstein, and Amber, this game is designed to help you tell a story. The rules add to the drama, they aren't just a collection of rules on how to create powerful characters and how to fight with them. Role Playing came out of Wargaming, and it shows. This is one of the few games that elevates Role Playing to the status of art. This is a game that returns to us the lost art of Story Telling."},{"Title":"King Arthur Pendragon: Epic Roleplaying in Legendary Britain","review":"King Arthur's Pendragon is what more role-playing games should be about. That is story. The game mechanics are all directed to telling the epic story of a group of knights as they advance through the years. Through the years is an important point. Unlike some games where players seem to go from one battle to the next for no more reason than &quot;killing is fun&quot; and &quot;we get more gold that way&quot;, Pendragon is about how people grow and change. They sart out as young knights who rapidly rise in prowess until age finally starts to nibble away at them leaving them old and infirm. Not to worry, each character aims to have heirs that will take up the cause and follow in their father's legendary foot steps. The scope of the game covers usually 60+ years in the life of Arthur ( starting at his age of 3 if you use the expanded time of Anarchy ).The game mechanics are simple and straight forward with events resolved usually by a skill test on d20 and damage rolled with d6. One element that adds much to the colour of the game are the Personality traits and passions. Personality traits are 13 matched pairs of qualities that define how the character often behaves ( example is Wordly and Generous ) with each pair adding to 20. Knights who posses high levels in certain passions gain fame for their chivralous or religous behaviour. Passions represent oaths and duties to others. Strong passions can aid a character to do impossable feats but can also blind a character to other situations.This game is a classic that has withstood the test of time for a reason and that is it one of the best games around. I especially like running this game with more mature players who want more than another slasher flick or want a more heroic tale to tell."},{"Title":"King Arthur Pendragon: Epic Roleplaying in Legendary Britain","review":"This is one of the most beautiful treatments of Arthurian subject matter I've seen, RPG or not. I don't like Chaosium's combat rule system for this type of game, but the personality and passion trait systems work great plugged into other RPGs, if you spend a little time converting. The strength of the game lies in the reverential yet exciting treatment of the whole milieu. Beautifully illustrated, particularly by Arnie Swekel and Lisa Free. This belongs in any game library."},{"Title":"King Arthur Pendragon: Epic Roleplaying in Legendary Britain","review":"Now, part of the review guidelines for this forum is that one should not simply praise without giving good reason why: however, in this case there are so many good reasons for praise that i am overwhelmed.So, to keep it simple: this is the Arthurian roleplaying game. You play a knight, or maybe a clecrk or lady, or maybe even (though i would not reccomend it) a magician.Yes, that is about it for \\"character classes\\". You see, the game depends a lot more on your characters background and personality than his \\"powers\\". Do not worry though, there will be lots of fights anyway.If you like medival stuff (but not so much that you let facts get inthe way of fun, wich the medivals themselves would find silly) you will like this game.A lot.The not - so - simple, pretentious version...I suppose one way to start would be its base material, the most splendid cycle of legend in Britain, the chronicle of King Arthur Pendragon. Sadly, the legend in our time has been tainted by superficial sentimentality, dried out by cheap attempts at making it historical (often just an excuse to make it but another version of poor conan the barbarian), and mocked by new - age foolishness. The wonder of this game is that it takes all these limited approaches and simply lets them be absorbed by the origional noble medival tales, creating a setting of vibrant richness.Another important point: this is a game that is much larger on the inside than the outside. There are mysteries in it that simply never will be solved, even though one feels a hint of their massive importance. But building on them is a clear, if complex, world of heroism and everyday responsibillities. But even if you try to stick to \\"normal\\" knightly deeds, you can still get caught up in the labyrinths of politics and romance.Last but not least, this game does exactly what it was intended to: rules, mood, and setting are in perfect symbiosis. This becomes painfully clear when talented but lesser designers try to muck about with the basics: just look at fourth editions pathetic magic system. Still, at least they had the good sense to make it optional.This is the best role - playing game in the world. Try to be worthy of it."},{"Title":"King Arthur Pendragon: Epic Roleplaying in Legendary Britain","review":"Pendragon is great. This book contains detailed data, written in a clear way, about life in Arthur's age, beginning in the year 510 after CHrist. THe only flaw is the combat system, which is too violent. Of course, a battle till death is a violent event, but after loosing so much time developing your character, you discover how easy is to be killed using this combat system. ANyway, the authors give you a perfect set-up to go aboard a journey of history, not only a journey of killing, earning gold or casting spells,like AD&amp;D does, for exxample."},{"Title":"The Voyageurettes: Their Tales and Legends","review":"Take a humorous and fantastical canoe trip through the wilderness with a zany bunch of women who imagine they're the Voyageurettes, the distaff (and historically overlooked) side of the famous French Voyageurs.

DiMassa is witty and bold and clearly very angry with a world that has and continues marginalised women and create normalising barriers for non-hetrosexuals.While the work is clearly tongue-in-cheek and based on exagerrated fantasy, the truth resonates, and DiMassa has a wonderful way of saying and doing exactly what all women have wished they could do. The characters are wonderful, particular Chicken, Hothead's lovely yoga-esque cat and her blind but centred friend Rox. It is definitely not as violent as I had imagined and much more plot driven, which is good.The Complete work chronicles an entire comic, and while the work at the beginning is quite basic, the middle section is an absolute joy to read. However, the final section is somewhat patchy and difficult to follow, as Hothead slips into depression and seeming hallucination. The art progressively becomes more refined, and was very funny at times.Overall, the entire piece was better than I expected, let down only by the confusion shrouding the final sections of the work. Nevertheless, a favourite comic collection of mine, to be read when I am feeling particularly inflamed by societal inequalities."},{"Title":"Complete Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist","review":"Hothead Paisan dares to do the things most of us just think about when confronted with homophobia, racism, sexism, and well, sometimes just because.

The result was a series of brutal wars in which both sides suffered terribly.This Osprey volume is thin but don't let that fool you; it contains a pretty decent amount of information. Discussed are the armor, tactics (including the famous Parthian Shot), and military history of both empires. The plates by the late Angus McBride are well done and add some color (literally) to the book. The Roman defeat at Carrhae is one of the topics covered although the book makes clear that Parthian forces were far from unstoppable as the Romans DID win many of the battles they fought against their eastern rival. Sassainian Persia was more of a danger to Rome at its height and under the famous/infamous Chroses II Parviz very nearly conquered the Byzantine Empire before the Emperor Heraclius counterattacked and crushed Persia. Weak from defeat, natural disasters, and political nightmares, the Zoroastrian Persians would ultimately fall to the fanatically fierce armies pouring out of early Islamic Arabia. The ancient world was truely coming to an end.Overall, I recommend this book about two of Rome's most skilled and powerful foes."},{"Title":"Rome's Enemies (3): Parthians and Sassanid Persians (Men-at-Arms)","review":"Excellent men-at-arms, although personally I feel that both of these peoples deserved their own title. The text and plates both detail the Scytho-Parthian horse-archers, Partho-Sassanid savaran, and infantry and mercenaries in Persian service, as well as the virtually never ending campaigns between Rome and these two great peoples between the 1st Century BC and the 7th Century AD, when the Arabs finally overwhelmed a Sassanid Empire already weakened by Byzantine invasion."},{"Title":"Rome's Enemies (3): Parthians and Sassanid Persians (Men-at-Arms)","review":"This is one of the good sources of information without it going into a steep price tag like the Cambridge Histories [which I do own].

The illustration is done very nicely, and as far as a general outlook it is rather nice introduction to anyone with absolutely no knowledge of Persian/Parthian history.However the book does not do much to break from the roman-centric view of the wars with Parthia/Persia. The age old habit of downplaying Roman defeats,and glorifying Roman victories have also been used, starting with the authors description of the battle of Carrae.

Although cop-Alvarez is able to turn off the pressure this time, he decides to use his spare time investigating the killing.The evidence (and author Aileen Schumacher's story) keeps returning to the tragic events of 1923 when a white lynch mob descended on the black town of Rosewood, burning it to the ground. Still, what possible connection could there be between an ancient racial injustice and contemporary murder?Schumacher does an excellent job balancing between the present and the past, drawing parallels, and letting the suspense of the horrors of 1923 add to the sense of danger in the present. ROSEWOOD'S ASHES is a fine mystery with enough twists and turns and red herrings to keep any reader interested. Where it excells, though, is in its descriptions of people and their relationships. Tory's relationship with her father and with Alvarez. Lissy's relationship with 'The Man,' and Alvarez's relationships with just about everyone.I recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"Rosewood's Ashes: A Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mystery (Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mysteries)","review":"Engineer/mystery writer Aileen Schumacher has developed an outstanding series featuring engineer Tory Travers. Murders with an engineering angle have also thrown the widowed mother of a teenage son into a burgeoning relationship with Detective David Alvarez. &quot;Rosewood's Ashes&quot; has Schumacher trying something very different. The background for this novel is the infamous and disgraceful Rosewood, FL massacre of the early 1920s. The author pulls off a coup as she uses three different time lines to develop her story. Never once does she lose her reader or the sense of where she is going with the story. The government of Florida has decided, many years too late, to make restitution to the survivors and descendants of the African-American town which was destroyed by white vigilantes. The story of Rosewood is told through the eyes of young Lissie from 1916 until the terrible night she witnesses the horror and is able to escape. Near the present time, Lissie, a nursing home resident, has no desire to talk to the historians, sociologists or reporters who come calling. One researcher, however, gets Miss Lissie to talk which she feels she must do for the sake of one individual about whom she has always cared deeply. It is after Lissie's death that Tory is forced to return to Gainesville, FL where her estranged father is in a coma following a hit and run accident. David comes with her as support to visit the man for whom she has good reason to feel animosity. On the plane trip to the Sunshine State, Tory and David meet a young woman who is working on the Rosewood project for the university. Tory discovers her father has pledged a small fortune to the Center for Heritage Studies at the university for the in-depth study. When the woman is killed, by yet another hit-and-run driver, in the parking lot of the airport, it just may be that there are people who want to stop all study of the past as it involves Rosewood. Another murder and surprising coincidences involving the ever-present white supremacists as well as some people of color who might have something to lose, add to the suspense and mystery. Schumacher, whose series has been one of my favorites since her first book, has stepped it up a notch and taken some chances with this masterful book and has succeeded with great conviction. This could easily have been a stand-alone novel. The parts featuring Lissie and the last years of Rosewood are moving and convincing. However, her many fans will be happy to see the return of Tory and David as well as being immediately taken aback by a rather surprising development in their relationship. &quot;Rosewood's Ashes&quot; can be savored as modern history, an indictment of man's continuing inhumanity to man, or a very satisfying installment in a superior mystery series that has not been appreciated as much as it should be. Once you read &quot;Rosewood's Ashes,&quot; you'll want to read Schumacher's other books. Well, perhaps not &quot;A Guide to Hazardous Materials Management,&quot; but certainly the first three books of the series."},{"Title":"Rosewood's Ashes: A Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mystery (Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mysteries)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, a mystery set in current times with the events of 1923 when a white mob attacked a black town of Rosewood, Florida. The mystery unfolded well, covering both current happenings and past events. I found the flashback scenes fit into the story nicely, without being abrupt at all. Fascinating historical story, and I thought the relationship between Tory and David has matured quite nicely and believably."},{"Title":"Rosewood's Ashes: A Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mystery (Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mysteries)","review":"In a segregated section of Florida in 1923, a white woman from Summer accuses a black man from Rosewood of raping her. A lynch mob from all over white Summer want to find and kill the individual blamed for the rape. However, by the time the mob finished its grisly agenda, death reached double digits and Rosewood was burned to the ground.In the present, engineer Tory Travers receives a call informing her that her father was in a coma in a Gainesville hospital after a hit and run accident. A pregnant Tory and her lover El Paso special cases police officer David Alvarez land in Florida and people connected to Rosewood are dying. Alvarez investigates the rising homicide count while Tory stays by her father's side. Neither one is aware that a killer will try to murder both of them and others to keep certain Rosewood secrets are buried.This novel is the best Travers-Alvarez mystery yet released because the personal relationship does not take a backseat to the who-done-it. The witty repartee and the feelings flowing between the protagonists bring more depth to ROSEWOOD'S ASHES than the well written pervious novels. Juxtaposing the story of Rosewood against modern day events further lead to a compelling and complex tale worth reading.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Rosewood's Ashes: A Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mystery (Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mysteries)","review":"Not exactly a historical mystery, Rosewood's Ashes is a modern murder mystery set in the world of history -- the academic study of the racially-motivated 1923 tragedy that occurred in Rosewood, Florida. But this is no dry tale. The plot is fast-paced and focused even as it alternates between the the present and the past. The world of Rosewood, 1923, comes to life along with that of modern Gainesville. And the relationship and banter between the unlikely detecting duo of Tory Travers and David Alvarez is lively and entertaining.

Tory and David are about the most engaging detectives to come along in a great while.

Not surprising, as Schumacher grew up here and still has family in the area (she now lives in Florida). ROSEWOOD'S ASHES is great, too, and continues the development of the personal relationship between Tory and David, but I rather look forward to Tory and David being back home in their next book. And I am definitely looking forward to the next book and hopefully many more!"},{"Title":"Rosewood's Ashes: A Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mystery (Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mysteries)","review":"Even though I live in the state of Florida, I knew little about the massacre that occurred in Rosewood, Florida in 1923. Seamlessly intertwining the fourth Tory Travers and Detective David Alvarez mystery together with a fictional version of these historical events is what author Aileen Schumacher does beautifully in ROSEWOOD'S ASHES.Tory Travers has been estranged from her father for decades. However, when the former Senator is left comatose following a car accident, Tory is discovered to be his closest living relative, so she gets the call about his being in a Gainesville, Florida hospital. She and Detective David Alvarez fly from New Mexico to Florida, where Tory grew up and from which she fled years ago in disgrace and disgust.On the small plane into Gainesville, historian Amy Cooper of the Center for State Heritage Studies chats with David and Tory and explains much of the research done on the Rosewood massacre. However, before the three leave the airport, Amy is hit by a car. Despite this tragic death, Tory travels onward to her father's bedside.The Center is overseen by the University History Department where former Senator Tom Wheatley has decided to fund an eminent scholar chair to the tune of $2 million. Almost immediately after Tory's arrival in the ICU, the head of the Center stops by to be sure that the Senator signs the official papers for his donation, should he awaken. Shortly thereafter a member of a racist group arrives and gives Tory all the reasons she should not allow this to happen. As Tory seems to be visited non-stop, another death occurs. The closely-knit, three-member Center loses a second member under suspicious circumstances.Two distinct storylines parallel each other throughout this novel. I found myself engrossed with them both. Just as I became completely wrapped up in one, the storyline would switch to the other, and I would become immersed in that one. In the 1923 storyline, the entire town of Rosewood would ultimately burn to the ground following a white woman's allegation that a black man attacked her. These events seemed just as compelling as today's events that unwound in the second storyline, or should I say that the other way around? The Rosewood story is told from one individual's point of view . . . one who survived long enough for a researcher to find her and learn more about the history of a community that just vanished into the night.As to the current circumstances, Tory Travers keeps running into people who remember her from her childhood as Vicky Wheatley, a life she left behind. I can't help but wonder about the analogy of Tory relinquishing her childhood identity and the survivors of Rosewood wanting to leave well enough alone in the past. Then there is David Alvarez, Texas detective and \\"family friend\\" always on Tory's side and always asking questions. There are important, life-changing decisions that need to be made between the two of them. Tory is as stubborn as ever butting heads with the equally tenacious David.There is also a question, rising up from the intertwined stories, regarding the familial history behind Tory's mother's name of Hodden ... the same last name as the storyteller for the Rosewood history. An intricately carved box from Rosewood dated 1917 seems to be the key to answer this and many other questions.This is one book for which you won't want to miss the discovery process and conclusion."},{"Title":"Rosewood's Ashes: A Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mystery (Tory Travers/David Alvarez Mysteries)","review":"This book is different from other books by this author butexcellent. As usual it is full of interest and character.The difference is there are historical flashbacks and thatcan make it more difficult to read flipping between nowand &quot;then&quot;.

Tory, an engineer, and David, an El Paso cop and Tory's lover return to Florida when they receive word that Tory's estranged father is lying in a coma in a Florida hospital. David's casual conversation with historian Amy Cooper on the late-night flight takes on sinister implications when Cooper is struck and killed shortly after arriving in Florida. Cooper's involvement with a project to identify and make reparations to the survivors of the 1923 Rosewood Massacre draws Tory and David into the investigation, a second murder, and a scheme to manipulate history that goes awry. Balanced against the contemporary plot are flashbacks told from the point of young Lissy who approaches womanhood in the years leading up to the massacre. Schumacher skillfully creates and authentic voice for this young black girl that is an engaging contrast to the crackling repartee that is the highlight of the contemporary episodes with Tory and David. With two of the most entertaining characters in mystery fiction, a masterful balance of the contemporary and the historical plots, and another peek into Tory's shaded past, Rosewood's Ashes will stand as one of the must-reads mysteries of the year."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy","review":"I've had this book since high school and I still use it in college.

Its entries on the canonical philosophers are in-depth and first-rate distillations. All the most famous thought experiments are summarized, and many of the more esoteric philosophical concepts explained. It is heavy on logical concepts; indeed, there's a decided Anglo-American Analytic bent.Which leads to my problem. One thing for which the volume can be criticized is the lack of strong representation of contemporary Continental (post-structuralist or deconstructionist) thought. When it does appear, it is sometimes given a dressing-down of sorts. Foucault, Derrida, Deleuze, Chomsky, Irigaray, Foucault etc. are given short shrift--and I myself am rather partisan to the analytic-pragmatic tradition, but I see no reason to virtually ignore these very important developments in critical fields.

It's basically an abriged encyclopedia of philosophy, full of concise explanations about philosophers and philosophical themes. It's not perfect.

This necessarily means some entries are better written than others, and from time to time authorial bias seeps through and slants the way a theme or philosopher is presented.

Of course some editorial bias is to be expected, but in certain entries it seems to step over the line.Now with those two gripes out of the way, I can say that the comprehensiveness is impressive.

This is a surprisingly accessible reference book and yet could also easily serve the needs of those in academia.It was surprising however, to see that one of the most prominent 20th Century philosophers is listed, yet his mentor, who heavily influenced him and his entire life, is not listed at all. A mentor who put out much in the way of philosophical writings in the second half of his life. When Mohandas Gandhi began a philosophical life of absolute non-violence as a way to the truth, few realize that most of the ideas which steered him in this direction came from Leo Tolstoy's religious and spiritual writings. While oversights can be forgiven, they can also bring into question the integrity of a work such as this. In Gandhi's entry in the Companion, Tolstoy is not even listed (nor does Tolstoy have his own entry), and this is the person who started him on the path of absolutist non-violence. And the author of Tractacus Logico, Ludwig Wittgenstein, carried Tolstoy's works around with him while he was a soldier in World War I, yet nary a mention of that in Wittgenstein's entry. I do not believe Tolstoy's influence can be overstated as his works touched and influenced many people, and yet he does not even garner a short entry.An excellent reference notwithstanding.**** stars."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy","review":"Strengths: Entries under logic and Wittgenstein.

The work is written from the point of view of analytic philosophy, and thus tend to give short shrift to some thinkers in the continental stream. Still, the \\"fathers\\" of continental thought (Kant through Hegel, into Nietzche and Heidegger) are well represented and their philosophical works are amply dicussed and fairly treated. Overall, the articles are all that one might want from a \\"companion to philosophy\\" (and much of it is actually good reading) I frequently pull the beast (1000+ pages paperback) down from the shelf; that is the best thing I can say about it. You will not regret owning this book, no matter your philosophical bent. If you are a student, I cannot imagine how you have made it this far without it, one-stop encyclopedia can be great resources. Good job, Oxford Press."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy","review":"Although I agree that there is much valuable information in this work, it should also be noted that this reference work is an artifact and an outgrowth of the context from which it arose. Specifically, this work is the product of the type of philosophical inquiry promulgated by those who contributed to it (see partial list of contributors above), and thus, many of the entries found in this work can be traced to the now receding tradition of Oxford philosophy that rested on the foundations of logical positivism and linguistic analysis. Consequently, definitions such as the one for \\"synthetic a priori judgments\\" traced back to Kant are treated from a perspective endemic to analytic philosophy in which the concept is treated as if it were put forth as a proposition when, in reality, Kant made no such appeal to propositional values in and of themselves, but was concerned with the nature of human knowledge and reality itself. Being cognizant of the analytic bent of this reference reveals that the source of the error cited lies in the fundamental misunderstanding of philosophers enamored by linguistic analysis who imposed this interpretation on the work of Kant to support their own (philosophers such as J.L Austin, Wittgenstein, Gilbert Ryle and Geoffrey Warnock) common point of view.Another telling example of the inherent philosophical bias presented in this work can be found in the definition of philosophy itself. In the opening paragraph of this entry philosophy is defined as \\"thinking about thinking,\\" which is congruent with the way that Oxford philosophers had attempted to define it, despite a tradition of over 2,000 years in which understanding the nature of reality--in all of its variated and complex manifestations--was viewed as the central philosophical problem pursued by the pre-Socratics, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Kant and the British Empiricists to Hegel, Heidegger, Nietzsche and Sartre, representing an unbroken tradition of thought to this day.Being aware of the subjective nature of a text such as this illustrates the truism that all texts are inherently and necessarily products of the minds that create them, and even texts that purport to be merely informational and introductory carry within them certain prescribed notions and ways of presenting knowledge, which can have serious ramifications on the understanding of the information presented itself. Thus, with this work, as it is with all philosophical texts, one should not merely accept the statements presented within as objectively true or valid, but use them as fertile points of departure for critical thinking, meditation and further investigation; that is where the true value of this work lies."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy","review":"This work is comparable in many ways to the Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy: both are modeled on the dictionary format, both are multi-authored, both are very popular, both are in second edition. I have spent many happy hours with both. Each has its excellent and useful entries and each has its mediocre or useless entries. For many purposes they are interchangeable. However, Cambridge charges a little over half of what Oxford wants but the latter is definitely no better. In fact,the logic entries in the Cambridge are uniformly better. The Cambridge entry \\"Church's thesis\\" is written by Wilfried Sieg, an accomplished and respected expert in the field. The Oxford entry is by Stewart Shapiro an equally qualified expert. Both imply correctly that Church's thesis is not a proposition admitting of mathematical proof or disproof in the usual sense: it is a proposal to \\"identify\\" the pre-theoretic intuitive concept of \\"effectively calculable function\\" with the mathematically precise number-theoretic property \\"recursiveness\\". But, the Cambridge entry is several times as long the Oxford and it is much more informative concerning the historical and philosophical importance of Church's thesis. A somewhat different comparision applies to the entries titled \\"Church Alonzo\\". Again the Cambridge entry a much longer and much more informative than the Oxford. The Cambridge entry is by John Corcoran, one of the editors of the journal HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF LOGIC, whereas the Oxford entry is by Gregory Mellema, who does not have much of a track record in the field. Both entries are flawed. Toward the end of Corcoran's otherwise accurate piece there is a confusing typographical error: 'Church's thesis' is printed where 'Church's theorem' is clearly meant. Mellema's murky and overly elliptical piece does not make it clear that Church's thesis has not been and cannot be be proved in the usual sense; it even suggests the opposite by referring to it as a \\"result\\"--a word widely used as a synonym for 'theorem'. The Cambridge victory is far from being a shutout. Oxford deserves some points for its two appendixes: one presents a set of \\"Maps of Philosophy\\", which are well worth looking at even if you ultimately think you could have done better yourself, and a useful if somewhat subjective \\"Chronological Table of Philosophy\\".

It suits a Sunday morning.\\"Well, maybe, but that would be a Sunday morning for logical positivists, Wittgenstein linguists, Kierkegaard intellectuals, professional logicians and perhaps child prodigies bored with their deferential calculus homework.There are 249 contributors, contemporary philosophers, most holding academic positions at prestigious institutions of higher learning throughout the world, who wrote the 2,230 entries arranged alphabetically from \\"abandonment\\" (a term used by existential philosophers) to Zoroastrianism (the ancient Persian religion). In-between, the entries range from the whimsical to the esoteric to the downright impenetrable. An example of the whimsical might be \\"cat, Schrodinger's\\" from quantum mechanics. An example of the esoteric (as least to my mind) could be the entry on \\"corpuscularianism\\"--which I won't attempt to define. As for the downright impenetrable, how about, \\"logical theory,\\" which, according to Christopher Kirwan of the University of Oxford who wrote the entry, \\"is best seen as a vaguely delimited and shifting group of problems.\\" (All the entries are signed with the initials of the author who wrote the entry. These contributors are listed near the beginning of the book.) Or if that isn't enough how about the various entries entitled on the \\"history of the philosophy of\\" which includes \\"language, history of the philosophy of\\"; \\"law, history of the philosophy of\\"; \\"mind, history of the philosophy of,\\" etc.There are entries on the philosophers themselves of course. All the great Western philosophers, Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Hobbes, Descartes, \\"the blessed Hume\\" (p. vii) (I agree with Honderich's exalted designation!), Kant, Hegel, etc. appear in lengthy entries. There is also a smattering of greats from the non-Western world, Buddha, Lao Tzu and others in shorter entries. Clearly the emphasis is on Western philosophy, but Eastern philosophy, I am happy to say, is not neglected. Also not neglected is religious philosophy. While there is no entry on Christian philosophy as such, many of the great Christian philosophers have entries. There are entries on \\"Hindu philosophy\\" and \\"Buddhist philosophy\\" and even an entry on Jainism. National philosophies, in so far as such a thing can be discerned or identified, are presented, including entries on \\"Japanese philosophy,\\" \\"Russian philosophy,\\" \\"American philosophy,\\" etc.Additionally there are entries on the ideas and problems of philosophy such as \\"universals\\"; the \\"problem of evil\\"; \\"scepticism\\" and many others. Many of the fallacies of philosophy such as the \\"undistributed middle\\" or \\"denying the antecedent\\" appear with (sometimes difficult) explanations. There are entries on the history of various ideas, such as \\"epistemology, history of\\"; \\"metaphysics, history of,\\" etc. There are even black and white photos of various philosophers, or in the case of the ancients, photos of statues of the philosophers.I have only one problem with this book. Many of the entries assume too much knowledge and understanding on the part of the general reader. This is because the book is \\"directed partly to general readers for whom philosophy has a fascination greater than, or at least as great as, any other part of our intellectual and cultural existence,\\" and partly \\"to those who study and practise the subject, and are scrupulous about their guides.\\" (p. viii) In other words, this is a book aimed at professionals or the nearly so. As such it is a challenging book both to read and to understand. At least it was for me.There are three appendices, one on logical symbols; another on \\"Maps of Philosophy,\\" which presents groups or categories of philosophic ideas in pictorial or schematic form; and a third, \\"A Chronological Table of Philosophy\\" lists philosophers and important philosophic events alongside other historical people and events beginning with the \\"First flourishing of Greek philosophy\\" about 2600 years ago and the birth of Zoroaster to moral philosopher T. M. Scanlon's publication of \\"What We Owe to Each Other\\" and (ironically, it would appear) the slaughter of Rwandans in the 1990s.Bottom line: a must for the professional academic philosopher and for the dedicated amateur, but decidedly not for dilettantes."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy","review":"I purchased this to have on-hand as a reference for my self-directed study of philosophy and am I glad I did.

The varied entries are easy enough for an intelligent layperson to understand, yet they had the depth that would be useful for undergrad philosophy students.As well as covering the greats, and different branches of philosophy, there was good coverage of contemporary philosophers - something lacking other encyclopaedias/Dictionaries. Also, an eye-opener, was the coverage of some [possibly] curious problems [e.g. death] which, again, are not found in many other works of reference.In contrast to another recent popular tome [the Cambridge Encyclopaedia of Philosophy] this book is definitely NOT dry and boring. This is important, as it combats the image of the philosopher as a dull academic with nothing of interest to say about life."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy","review":"If there's one volume on philosophy to own, it is this one. Its entries on the canonical philosophers are in-depth and first-rate distillations. All the most famous thought experiments are summarized, and many of the more esoteric philosophical concepts explained. It is heavy on logical concepts; indeed, there's a decided Anglo-American Analytic bent.Which leads to my one problem with it. One thing for which the volume can be criticized is the lack of strong representation of contemporary Continental (post-structuralist or deconstructionist) thought. When it does appear, it is sometimes given a dressing-down of sorts. Thinkers like Foucault, Derrida, Jameson, Deleuze, Chomsky, Irigaray, etc. are given short shrift--and I myself am rather partisan to the analytic-pragmatic tradition, but I see no reason to virtually ignore these very important developments in critical fields."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to Philosophy","review":"Having gotten tired of going to the campus library to meticulously look up concepts, idealogies, philosophers and terms, I broke down and bought the new edition of the \\"Oxford Companion to Philosophy.\\" I must say that it has helped me many times to better understand concepts and ideas of many philosophers and has subsequently helped to reduce the time I spent looking things up online or in other books. The entries are very detailed and very well written to explain and elaborate on the details that a student or any person may need clarification on. Since this edition is around 40 dollars I wouldn't buy this book just to have it on your bookshelf but if you are like me and sick of going to the library at night then get this book.

For those interested in the German book I put the review in German.Wie viel Spannung kann man in vierundzwanzig Stunden Handlung unterbringen? Beinahe unendlich viel, das beweist dieses gro&szlig;artige Werk von Dan Brown. Zwei Wissenschaftern (einer ein ehemaliger Priester und die zweite seine Adoptivtochter) vom Forschungsinstitut CERN ist es gelungen eine relativ gro&szlig;e Menge Antimaterie zu schaffen. Gro&szlig; ist nat&uuml;rlich relativ, denn das Volumen ist einem kleinen Wassertropfen vergleichbar, aber die freisetzbare Energie entspricht in etwa jener der Bombe von Hiroshima. An dem Tag an dem dieser Thriller spielt, wird dieser Forscher ermordet, und die Antimaterie wird im Vatikan versteckt - es verbleiben keine vierundzwanzig Stunden um die t&ouml;dliche Bombe wieder zu sichern. Da die Illuminati - eine kirchenfeindliche Sekte von Wissenschaftern - die Verantwortung f&uuml;r den Vorfall &uuml;bernehmen, wird der Symbolistikforscher Robert Langdon eingeflogen um bei der Rettung des Vatikans zu helfen. Gemeinsam mit der Adoptivtochter des Ermordeten macht er sich auf eine h&ouml;chst spannende und interessante Suche - dass es zwischen den beiden irgendwann funken muss, wird nat&uuml;rlich niemanden verwundern. Ein Thriller, mit vielen unerwarteten Wendungen, der dem Leser kaum Zeit zum Atmen l&auml;sst beginnt.Auf sprachlicher Ebene muss man den Roman als nicht gerade gro&szlig;artig, bestenfalls Mittelma&szlig; einstufen, dies tritt jedoch angesichts der Qualifikation Unterhaltungsroman eher in den Hintergrund. Stilistisch hinterl&auml;sst das Werk sehr ambivalente Gef&uuml;hle. Zum Beispiel wird die Spannung durch die unsaubere Technik der Geheimhaltung bereits bekannter Informationen versch&auml;rft, ein Trick der gar nicht notwendig gewesen w&auml;re, denn der Roman w&auml;re auch sonst spannend genug. &Auml;hnlich verh&auml;lt es sich mit einer falschen Vorblende. Insgesamt aber ist das Buch stilistisch durchaus ordentlich gemacht. Die Charakterisierung der einzelnen Personen kann als durchaus gelungen bezeichnet werden. Zumindest die zentralen Gestalten des Romans haben durchaus Ecken und Kanten und eine zu ihrem Charakter passende Biographie.Zusammenfassend kann man sagen, dass ein unglaublich guter Unterhaltungsroman vorliegt, und die Kategorisierung Unterhaltungsroman l&auml;sst mich auch &uuml;ber die genannten Schw&auml;chen gerne hinwegsehen. So manche der dargestellten Informationen sind wenn auch nicht wahr, so doch zumindest gut erfunden. Die sprachlichen und stilistischen M&auml;ngel, w&auml;ren f&uuml;r gro&szlig;e Literatur unertr&auml;glich aber dieses Ziel wollte der Roman ja auch gar nicht erreichen. Er will viel mehr Spa&szlig; machen und dem Leser kurzweilige Stunden verschaffen - genau das aber erreicht Dan Brown mit diesem Buch.

I have heard a lot in the news about the issue of music and children's learning, so I wanted to take a look at this book. With the CD-ROM that comes with the book, I was able to get a good grasp on this process and the extent of the relations between music and learning, and how it might affect my children.It does get somewhat &quot;text-bookie&quot; at times, but I think that is helpful for those who want that more technical information."},{"Title":"Keeping Mozart in Mind, 2nd Edition","review":"Keeping Mozart in Mind is intellectually sophisticated, yet fun and interesting.

Apparently, Mozart was intuitively expressing pure thought! (this is my conclusion). Shaw's research has demonstrated a clear and uncontradictable connection between music learning and math understanding. His approach, if implemented in schools, will change the way math is taught forever, and bring music back to the core curriculum where it belongs, as a rudimentary human language. Underprivileged kids who learn math and music together in a sequential curriculum experience an evening-out of the playing field which enables them to achieve as high scores on standardized tests as the rich white kids in wealthy districts! THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE THE WORLD! Hurray for Shaw. If this book is hard to read, keep trying and keep trying. Our kids' future may be at stake."},{"Title":"Keeping Mozart in Mind, 2nd Edition","review":"Other than the CD rom, I found nothing practical or inspiring in this book.

THE WILL TO KILL covers all bases from the chapter on &quot;The Law of Homicide&quot; which provides the reader with specific legal definitions of the various catagories of murder, to the victimology of murder and statistical information on a local and world occurance of the phenomonon to put the entire topic into regional and global perspective. This infomation is of great value to the professional in the field of criminology as well as to the student in the criminal justice and related fields.Whereas traditional and historical forms of homicide are explored such as serial, mass and cult motivated murders, the new and recent trends of murder are also covered such as school shootings, workplace violence and hate motivated murder. The disturbing trend of youthful killing is discussed with predictions for furture involvement of America's violent young people. Finally, the last chapter of this work, &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot; looks at the insanity defense and the dilemma of handling youthful killers in the courts. Capital punishment is also a topic of the last chapter.Throughout the book, interesting and informative case studies are cited which provide the reader with direction for further research on the topic. The overall demographic coverage of this book can save professional and student a great deal of time searching out similar information from numerous sources.Speaking as a professional criminologist, I look forward to Levin and Fox's next book, DEAD LINES: ESSAYS IN MURDER AND MAYHEM."},{"Title":"The Will to Kill: Making Sense of Senseless Murder (2nd Edition)","review":"The subtitle and back-cover blurb for \\"The Will to Kill\\" are misleading. This volume does not \\"Explain[] Senseless Murder,\\" nor does it (contrary to what the back cover says) \\"answer [the] age-old question\\" of \\"Why do people kill?\\" by \\"showing that power and control are at the center of the killer's motivation.\\"A better subtitle would be \\"An Introduction to the Study of Murder.\\" Only one chapter (Chapter 2, about 25 pages) actually deals with WHY people kill, and even that chapter does not advance a particular thesis. Rather, it provides a (somewhat superficial) review of major theories.The other chapters discuss homicide law in the United States, U.S. demographics relating to murder, investigation of murders, punishment of convicted murderers, and eight categories of murder (serial murder, mass murder, family murder, etc.). At their best, the authors do a good job of presenting the relevant statistics and illustrating their points with specific cases mostly from the past 20 years. At their worst, they venture into facile policy recommendations.On balance, this is a good overview of the issues involved in the study of murder in the USA."},{"Title":"The Will to Kill: Making Sense of Senseless Murder (2nd Edition)","review":"A very intriguing book that tackles perhaps the most challenging question of human behavior.

Somewhat older evangelical standards include Morris (NIC, 1959), Bruce (WBC, 1982), and Wanamaker (NIGTC, 1990). Thus this new volume is a welcome, and long-overdue, addition.It is quite new (2002) and part of the Pillar Commentary series; a series that did not originally start out as a series. The series now contains eight volumes, of which this is the most recent. New Testament scholar D.A. Carson is editor of the series, so readers can expect these volumes to be of consistently high quality. Indeed, there are no \\"duds\\" to be found in the first seven volumes.The author, Gene Green, teaches New Testament at Wheaton College in Chicago. He has produced a very readable and reliable commentary on the two Thessalonian letters.Green is well abreast of all the latest concerns: theological, historical and textual. Yet in keeping with the aim of the series, the volume is not overly technical. Theological disputes, textual considerations, and social/historical background discussions are all given due attention, but none in overbearing detail. This means all the volumes of this series are quite helpful to pastors and lay people, but will also well serve the academic and scholarly community.This newest edition looks to be of equal value to previous volumes. The extensive bibliography is followed by a thorough introduction, The book is especially helpful in setting forth the letters in their historical and cultural backgrounds. And theologically disputed passages are given fair treatment, with various options presented.And the author is not afraid to take sides on some of these contentious issues. As an example, those who see a pre-trib rapture in 1 Th 4:16-17 will not find their views confirmed here. Green argues that this passage is not \\"the stuff of speculative prophecy or best-sellers on the end-times\\". The context of this passage makes clear that Paul (whom Green takes to be the author) is seeking to comfort and give hope to believers, especially in relation to those who have already died.Similarly, favorite texts found in 2 Thessalonians by those with sharply held eschatological viewpoints will be treated in differing ways by Green. While not all will agree with each of his interpretations, he backs them all up with thorough research and exegesis, and with even-handedness and a charitable spirit.All in all this is one of the best works now available on the epistles from an evangelical perspective, One eagerly awaits more works by Green, and more volumes in the Pillar series."},{"Title":"The Letters to the Thessalonians (Pillar New Testament Commentary)","review":"Gene Green is a New Testament professor at Wheaton College (Wheaton, Illinois) and former New Testament professor and missionary in Costa Rica. \\"The Letters to the Thessalonians\\" is a volume in the Pillar Series of commentaries.The Pillar New Testament Commentary Series is intended to help pastors with preaching and teaching. Thus application is emphasized, as is meta-narrative (unity within a book, among the works of a particular Biblical author, and unity within the Cannon as a whole). Thus, textual criticism, the history of interpretation, and lexical studies are relatively minimized so that the central message and practical application of the book can be emphasized.This is Green's second commentary on the 1 and 2 Thessalonians (the other being a Spanish-language commentary). While fitting his commentary within the general purposes of the Pillar Series, Green seeks to emphasize Paul's message in the Thessalonian correspondence through a thorough exegesis of the letters' recipients--the Thessalonians themselves. He writes, \\"This commentary...is an attempt to read these letters in light of relevant materials from the city and world of that era in order to help us better understand the impact of the gospel of Christ in its first readers.\\" (xiii).To accomplish this goal, Green begins the body of this work with a lengthy history of the Macedonians and especially the Thessalonians. He particularly examines the pride the Macedonians had in their history and culture, their relationship with the Roman Empire (and their surprising strong loyalty toward Rome), their strong economic status and prominence within the Roman Empire, and the treasures they had received through the Greek philosopher and Roman writers. This opening section takes 74 pages.Within the commentary proper, Green uses the New International Version (NIV) translation of the Bible, but presents it in a unique way. Rather than reprint pericopes and then comment on them, Green includes the NIV translation (in italics) within the narrative. This reader greatly enjoyed this approach and found that it greatly aided the \\"flow\\" of the book. Whenever it is practical, Green includes information that will explain to the reader the culture and social institutions of the 1st Century Thessalonians. He cites numerous ancient authors (e.g. Juvenal, Aristotle) and uses archaeological/historical evidence to explain social institutions and popular opinion with an eye toward showing Paul's writing relates to these young Christians and how they would have reacted to his words.Themes consistently woven throughout the commentary include 1) the fact that the Thessalonian congregation is a persecuted congregation, which is adding great anxiety to these young Christians; 2) even still, they are clinging strongly to their faith in Christ and allowing it to influence their lifestyle greatly as their acts of love and evangelism are world-renown; 3) they are having trouble incorporating Christian eschatological teachings into their worldview; and 4) many within the congregation (in rebellion against Paul's teaching) are opting to engage in the patron-client institution (ancient groupies) rather than learn a trade and be self-supporting. The end result is a splendidly unified and consistent commentary.This reader found this commentary highly readable; the prose flowed and the structure was well-planned and kept in mind throughout. In accordance with the Pillar goals, the author came across as very pastoral and with an genuine desire to help other pastors in their duties. He makes many helpful connections between the theology contained in 1 and 2 Thessalonians and practical applications in Christian living--both ancient and modern.Two final notes of importance to those considering purchasing this volume: 1) while this reader did find the prose flowing, it was consistently interrupted by parenthetical citation. While footnotes are used extensively, Scripture citations are consistently cited parenthetically, which does break the flow of reading. 2) These letters are well-known for their eschatological teachings (e.g. the resurrection and judgment, the Son of Destruction), but Green does not emphasize the details of the last day; rather he angrily criticizes those who sensationalize the end-times (and make a lot of money doing so) through popular works of fiction. Instead, Green shows how these eschatological teachings are intended to bring great comfort and hope to the believer and inject joy into his day-to-day living. He holds his cards close in this commentary, neither promoting nor criticizing pre-millennialism nor amillennialism...but this reader tends to believe he sympathizes with the amillennialists.In all, this is an excellent and enjoyable commentary in 1 and 2 Thessalonians. It comes highly recommended, especially for pastors."},{"Title":"The Letters to the Thessalonians (Pillar New Testament Commentary)","review":"This is a very good commentary on Thessalonians. The Pillar commentaries are faithful to God's word and stand under the scripture and not over like some commentaries. One strength of this book is the extensive background of Thessolonia in the 1st century. This historical background provided good perspective. For example the patron-client relationship explains Paul's emphasis on working and not being a dependent. The sexual mores of that time relate to the calling for sexual purity (as well as in our time). Sometimes there seems to be too much detail for points that seem obvious. Also, this is a straight exegesis with little in the way of application."},{"Title":"The Letters to the Thessalonians (Pillar New Testament Commentary)","review":"The writer's introduction is expansive without going into too much unnecessary detail. His exposition of the text, verse by verse, is comprehensive, giving valuable insights into the social milieu of the times, as well as the various nuances of the text in the original Greek.

Does \\"Rich people are inhuman sadists who use their special powers to control us!\\" count as sharp satire? Maybe it does to an alumnus of the Young Communist League like Pohl.The novel is set in a university in 2196. My experience in academia suggests that professors (who take credit for their students' work, use grant money to finance their personal hobbies, espouse wealth redistribution in the media while plotting tax evasion in the privacy of their luxury apartments and summer homes, et al) are a ripe target for satire, but Pohl doesn't take that tack. Maybe the professors he knew in the 1950s were not like the professors I knew in the 2000s.Anyway, the novel follows the structure of a mystery or detective story, and Pohl has math professors as his heroes. The math profs discover that the incredibly ugly and incredibly rich university president and other wealthy people are immortal telepaths who have murdered numerous people in order to hide their conspiracy to rule the world. This conspiracy includes setting loose smallpox to kill most of the population, but does not include amassing weapons or any kind of defense; once the math profs finger the telepaths it only takes a dozen police officers to subdue them.Pohl produced in Gateway a brilliant masterpiece, and I continue to read him in hopes of finding that he has gifted the world with a similarly impressive work. Drunkard's Walk is, emphatically, not that work. Still, Pohl's style is not bad, and Drunkard's Walk is short and its plot holds together pretty well (I am being hard on the book because I don't appreciate its anti-capitalist politics and I find stories about epidemic diseases and conspiracies boring. I feel that I can safely recommend Drunkard's Walk to anyone who likes left-wing conspiracy novels or whose current address happens to be \\"Zuccotti Park.\\""},{"Title":"The Official Blackbook Price Guide to U.S. Coins 2005, 43rd Edition (Official Blackbook Price Guide to United States Coins)","review":"Excellent reference material.

From there, it's up to police detective Christopher Daniel to retrace Max's steps and uncover the events leading up to his apparent murder, which we see unfold.Max is discovered by hot director Maggie Nash, with whom he has a sizzling affair. They are joined by rising ingenue Kristen Caulfield, but soon Kristen and Max are falling in love behind Maggie's back. Did his spurning of her turn Maggie insane? Or did Max's inability to commit drive Kristen over the edge?Along the way, we are introduced to several other characters who might have had their own reasons to see Max crash and burn, like Maggie's wicked younger stepmother, Nicole, who had her own designs on Mr. Jaxon. Or did producer Bruce Borger, who carried a torch for Kristen, do the dirty deed? And what of Max's mysterious old friend, the unseen Nicky?It's a nest of vipers, a den of snakes, and they all writhe under Racina's careful watch. The author has said this is most likely to be his biggest success because it is his sexiest, and the graphic nature certainly lends credence to that speculation.After all, \\"Never Forget\\" did get picked up as a book of the month for the Doubleday Book Club and the Mystery Guild for September 2002.\\"Never Forget\\" follows Racina's grand tradition of books with interesting, gripping plots that are a sight to behold as they progress.In his \\"The Great Los Angeles Blizzard,\\" (a precursor to Mikkos Cassadine's weather machine), a, um, blizzard hits Los Angeles. In \\"Snow Angel\\" we see a psychotic killer murder the parents of the object of his obsession to grow closer to them. In \\"Hidden Agenda,\\" the heroine is a big star news reporter who might just be the center of a massive conspiracy to control the news, while the heroine of \\"Secret Weekend\\" finds herself trapped at the top of an unfinished apartment building and at the mercy of a killer.Like these, \\"Never Forget\\" is very much a \\"Watch what happens under these circumstances\\" book, ruled by Racina's wild imagination and fueled by his great sense of entertainment and intrigue.They're wild, unpredictable and fun.And like the legends of Luke and Laura, these creations of Racina's may prove to be unforgettable indeed."},{"Title":"Never Forget","review":"Reading a page of this book, like any other by Thom Racina, is a lot like eating potato chips: you'll find it hard to stop after just ONE! This is another of his compelling mysteries full of glitzy characters and locations, with plenty of steamy and sordid sexual activity peppered throughout. What's especially wonderful about this is the author's ability to consistently pull of the satisfying surprise endings! And NEVER FORGET is no exception.

Instantly engaging!"},{"Title":"Never Forget","review":"Sex, sex, and more sex....where's the suspense? Even with the great opening sequence in which Max Jaxon crashes his glider into the side of a mountain, what happens in the rest of this soft-porn farce is tedious, confusing and full of characters it's hard to like. How can we like our hero, Max? He thinks with his you know what, and his lack of commitment and his own egotistic desires brands him superficial and super-boring. Kristen is almost as bad, she falls for anything; Maggie is a Jekyll-Hyde lesbian with more teeth than a comb; Nicole is a self-centered and murdering golddigger; Chris Daniel is a cop with no sense of humor and some of the stiffest dialogue ever written.While the ending does pull a good surprise, it's torture getting there.NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"Title":"Never Forget","review":"Never Forget was a good book with some great characters.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"This book is beautiful and amazing. I came up on it by chance, swapping books with a classmate. It is a gift. A gift Elizabeth Ehrlich passed on to her children and to the world. Her heritage, which could have been private and might have been lost, is now preserved and available.At first glance Miriam's Kitchen is all about food. Almost every chapter revolves around it: Miriam's cooking, Grandma's recipe, the memory of a taste lost to time. This is a cookbook in narrative, except, interwoven between stories, there is more. Beyond kashrut, beyond fond remembrances, beyond even Miriam's kitchen, lies something ancient and important.The author's journey begins with the decision over whether or not to have a kosher kitchen. Being kosher is difficult, and Ehrlich isn't sure why she should attempt it? She doesn't really believe in God, why should she keep the commandment? The author turns to Miriam, her mother-in-law, as an example. In Miriam's kitchen she discovers the past, the combined history of generations of mothers carrying Jewish traditions down to Ehrlich. She discovers obligation, the need to honor those who came before and the desire to create something to pass on to the future.Miriam's Kitchen is a story of discovery. In Elizabeth Ehrlich's search for a Jewish base, from which to raise her children, she finds identity and her own definition of faith. It is deeply human and relatable (no matter one's own background) and above all, it is precious."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Even though I am not of Jewish background, this narrative made me think about my own culture and traditions. How will I, as Christian, portray my faith through everyday life to my children? Will it be through food, like Miriam and Elizabeth? Or will I hold keepsakes from my ancestors, to show them off with pride later? Or will I oppositely not try to mix our religious culture with modern culture? I shiver thinking about the latter, for I want my children to possess the qualities of a good a faithful servant of my Lord. Elizabeth Ehrlich gracefully introduces the practice of Kashrut to her children by allowing them to grow up in a kosher kitchen. While to others, they may have seemed restricted in what they could eat, Ehrlich and Miriam hid that evidence shockingly well by educating them on how it was a decision, not a restriction, and creating absolutely wonderful food creations, like chocolate cake, baked apples, chicken soup with fresh vegetables, or Kneydleh (a dumpling), only to name a few. I personally remember being hungry almost the whole time I was reading Miriam's Kitchen. Ehrlich expresses her Jewish culture by sharing stories of her in the kitchen. This is such an inspiration to me, and to find how I can share my faith in everyday life. She so finely embodies it into her day to day chores and labor that not only is she of Jewish faith, she IS the Jewish faith. I believe this book is not only for people of Judaism. Religious persons of all faiths and backgrounds can be enriched from this book, finding within themselves what makes their religion special to them."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"In Miriam's Kitchen, author Elizabeth Ehrlich invites us to share in her experiences and thoughts about what it really means to hold onto religious tradition in our increasingly modernized, secular society. Elizabeth grew up very close to her two Jewish immigrant grandmothers -and though she didn't particularly connect with their religious rituals at the time, she loved their traditional cooking. As an adult, she began to bond with her Jewish mother-in-law, Miriam, a holocaust survivor from Poland. Miriam's Kitchen is a chronicle of a year Elizabeth spent learning how to make Miriam's traditional recipes, and her reflections on everything Miriam had to teach her--not just about cooking, but about religious tradition and life. This book contains many short essays about particular dishes and their significance, recipes, stories from Elizabeth's childhood, and reflections on her re-awakening to the role religious ritual could play in her life. Charming, very easy to read, and hard to put down! Even if you are not Jewish, you will probably end up wishing you were by the end of this book--if only to be surrounded by so much delicious food!"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"While studying religion in an intellectual setting, one finds that the study of certain religions, such as Judaism can become very one-dimensional. Textbooks that teach of Judaism can consist of a lot of history, holidays, Jewish laws, and terribly horrific stories of hardships and oppression. Although interesting, it sometimes does not give you a very good display of what the religion and culture is in the now. Religion within itself is not a history; it is alive and well as we speak. This book more than any other I have read truly gives you and intimate look at the lives of Jewish Americans in a way that I have never yet encountered. It gives you an insider's look at the everyday present life and struggles of maintaining a \\"balancing act\\" of holding firm to Jewish beliefs, while not segregating oneself from the rest of the world. And what better a place to learn through the center point of every household in America, the kitchen. This book is a beautiful memoir that not only displays both the frustrations of keeping up with a kosher kitchen and sometimes exhausting Jewish laws, but also gives you a deeper understanding at the honor, tradition, and beautiful culture that goes into each bite of cabbage soup. I absolutely loved this book I would recommend this book to anyone who seeks a better understanding of the Jewish life in society today. I also urge readers to try out some of these amazing recipes that the book suggests!"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Miriam's Kitchen by Elizabeth Ehrlich is a book that is rich with the Jewish traditions of faith, family and food. She had creatively used food to tell stories of her past, the past of her family members and the way that food has shaped her own household. This book is a testament to the value that people have on tradition and that it is not just about being Jewish or Christian etc., but it is about honoring what you believe in, what makes you feel whole. Ehrlich was able to craft a novel that emphasizes how tradition makes her feel secure and a part of something, something that has been passed down through generations to her and her family and something that she holds dear in her heart. You travel with Ehrlich everywhere from her childhood home in Detroit to the traumatic concentration camps that held her In-laws during the war. She shares with you the most brutal, sad, happy and joyful moments in her life. A great read that left me feel nostalgic for my own traditions in my family and something that left me feeling both hungry and satisfied."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"When Elizabeth Ehrlich begins to question if there is more to her life than just her present surroundings, she looks towards the past to dig into the Jewish heritage of which she was raised to find answers. She seeks guidance from her mother-in-law, Miriam, and begins to explore the traditions passed down from generation to generation through the means of the kitchen. Ehrlich takes one year to write about the journey of trying to keep these Jewish traditions, starting with Sabbath, to just see where that road leads her. What she soon discovers is a much deeper commitment than she may have originally expected that brings her to keep a kosher kitchen, attend a Mikvah, and even learn enough Hebrew to participate in synagogue. Throughout the book, Miriam's Kitchen, Ehrlich honestly describes her struggle with complete commitment and the possibility of losing one's individuality for the sake of community. She finds, however, that she feels enhanced as a human being and that these traditions have brought meaning and purpose in her life. Ehrlich's memoir is a wonderful and entertaining story of her thoughts and memories as an American, a Jew, and a mother."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Miriam's Kitchen is a personal memoir by Elizabeth Ehrlich. Ehrlich is a Jewish woman who documents a year in her life in which she begins to transform her kitchen from a more secular one, in which you might find shrimp or the occasional cheeseburger, to a kitchen that follows all of the laws of keeping kosher. The novel is broken up into months, but the stories within are not always organized linearly. The book mainly focuses on the relationship Ehrlich is forming with her mother in law, Miriam, whom the book is named after. Miriam is a polish Jew who survived the holocaust and came to America, bringing with her the recipes and traditions remembered from the old world. These Jewish foods are ones that Ehrlich recalls fondly or with greatly detailed memory from her childhood, and she wishes to hang onto them. The book is peppered with stories of these recollections. The book elaborates on keeping kosher and the struggle that it brings. The pieces of the memoir are brought together with recipes that are taught in Miriam's kitchen, as well as firsthand stories from a number of relatives who survived the holocaust. All of these aspects offer a compelling tale of one woman's attempts to learn the traditions of her family and the people she was born to. We see how much time goes into Pasech, and the author's turmoil in what the tradition means to her, is it for her? Her religion? Just for the kids? Overall the book does an amazing job of showing the reader how modern American Jews may alter their lives in order to follow Jewish tradition. Profiling three generations of American Jews, Miriam's Kitchen gives the reader a personal and realistic perspective of the Jewish religion in America."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Miriam's Kitchen is a terrific and comforting read from a Jewish standpoint. The author, Elizabeth Ehrlich's style of writing is true to a memoir style. Her writing is reminiscent of the flow of thoughts and storytelling. I love how the book not only follows a chronological timeline of the months of the year but also the developmental stages of her religious identity and relationship with her mother-in-law. The personal memoirs and recipes are great because they have captured the Jewish immigrant family culture that has been lost to many as time goes on. I also love how the author gives power to the female roles in Judaism by showing how the women have kept the families together and the tradition alive. It is a truly inspirational book and definitely worth the read for younger audiences to get in touch with their Jewish roots. I think Miriam's Kitchen will be equally inspirational for non-Jewish readers because its elements of domesticity and self-discovery are identifiable for anyone."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Miriam's Kitchen is a great read that explores a woman's search for self in her Jewish culture through the observation of traditions - most especially the practice of keeping a kosher kitchen. In a series of vignettes, journal-type entries, and recipes, Erlich recalls her heritage, her youth, and her personal search for her spiritual identity in her adult life. We follow Erlich's trials and tribulations of maintaining Jewish traditions in the modern day society, as well as her relationship with her mother-in-law, Miriam, who teaches her how to cook and passes down recipes.Erlich's prose is accessible and easy to read. She is relatable for anyone, regardless of age or religious tradition. The stories are arranged into months of the year, but not in chronological order. They range from childhood remembrances to old family anecdotes to her wedding and the birth of her first daughter. The relationship between Erlich and Miriam is touching and the Jewish culture is apparent in each and every scene. Altogether, it is a great book that can be enjoyed as a heartening memoir as well as a rich, first-hand source of Jewish cultural information."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Reading Miriam's Kitchen was a delight.

I love the stories that the author tells about her life and her family as related to food and Jewish tradition. I could relate. The recipies provided in the book are delicious. I am keeping the book as a reference."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Elizabeth Ehrlich is a Jewish American woman who rejected, for many years, her connection to the practices of her Jewish faith. It is only through her discovery of her mother-in-law Miriam's kitchen and the foods prepared there that she learns to value the traditions that shaped her own family, traditions brought from the Old World and translated into the New. Through entries in her journal, through letters, memories, stories, and above all, through Miriam's recipes, Ehrlich recreates for us the story of her spiritual awakening and her self-guided journey into the lives of her foremothers, who nourished their faith and kept it alive and growing in difficult times, difficult places, through pain, separation, and even despair.This often funny, often heart-rending, always beautifully-evocative book is a powerful testimony to the importance of women's domestic contributions to the survival of their families, their communities, and their faith.Susan Wittig Albertfor Story Circle Book Reviewswww.storycirclebookreviews.org"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Miriam's kitchen is a thoughtful, interesting, warm and homey memoir.

Have enjoyed it immensely."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Enjoyed the recipes, sharing in the author's thoughts about keeping kosher, learning Miriam's history. I wish I'd written this book-I love it."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"At its best, this is a wonderful memoir that affirms the role of women in preserving traditions and ritual, and celebrates the life of the author's Holocaust-survivor mother-in-law. It focuses on how we pass on traditions and ethnic identity via food. I loved the descriptions of the family holidays, which were rich with details about food preparation.That said, I agree with a previous reviewer who said this book was too long by at least a third--I had to really push myself to finish it. The repetitive commentary on how difficult it is to keep kosher and strictly observe Passover were tedious--I got the points the first time they were made(and couldn't help thinking about the people in my life who do both and don't make a production out of it.) Additionally, I found the author a little annoyingly judgemental (i.e., if you don't keep kosher, you have broken the link between your children and their ancestors)--but hey, it's her book! Finally, I found it a little odd (or not well explained) that: 1) she became extremely observant in this one area, but did not seem to adopt many other traditional observances, and 2) she was faily accepting of the inequality of the sexes that can co-exist with orthodox observance.Bottom line, the stories of Ehrlich's parents and in-laws were fascinating, while the story of her own journey needed some editing."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"I really enjoyed the first 200 pages of this book, but after that I found it repetitious. How often do I want to go with Erlich through her struggles about a kosher kitchen? How often do I want to hear how terrific her mother-in-law is? That woman's perfectionism would have gotten on my nerves if I were her daughter-in-law. I know she suffered horribly through WWII, but I don't think that's a reason to assume she's now some kind of saint. Anyhow, I liked the childhood memories a lot - many were like my own. And the writing, if a bit flowery, is very good. I finished the book and was glad it finally ended."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"I was touched by the special relationship that the author developed with her mother-in-law, Miriam. Through Miriam, we are all so fortunate to hear her life's story, and ultimately, many women's stories from the Old Country. While the author does skip around in thoughts, her essays touch on numerous New York style traditions. I enjoyed reading the index afterwards, and realizing how many different topics she had covered. My synagogue did a book review and it was very favorable. Just one warning: many of the recipes apparently are NOT coming out right! Be sure to read the hilarious disclaimer about the recipes in the front of the book. The recipe I tried (Choc. chip and pineapple cake with meringue) DID come out delicious and was very different! Also be aware that this really is not a cookbook,per se, so it should be read as a story. Some of the stories ARE holocaust-related and as such, contain sad episodes. This book mostly establishes a mother-in-law's successful attempt to bring Judaism back into the major portion of her daughter-in-law's life. Anyone who has decided to keep kosher after being married will laugh with sympathy at some early attempts to do things right!"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"If I could give this book a 10-star rating, I would. Elizabeth Ehrlich has written this memoir from her heart, and it shows. The memoir traces the deepening relationship between Ehrlich and her mother-in-law, Miriam, as well as Ehrlich's memories of her fiercely left-wing family in the inner city of Detroit. Both families celebrate their Judaism through food, drink, ritual, prayer and family ties. Ehrlich's views on Judaism shift as she travels the road to middle age, first as a young girl, then as a young adult, next as a new wife and, finally, as the mother of three young children. Along the way she explores such complexities as Miriam's memories of the Holocaust and her native Poland, the challenges of managing a kosher home, and the joys and regrets of interfaith unions.Travel Ehrlich's road with her and you won't regret it-- her book is rich with memories and love. An added bonus: the reproduction of many of Miriam's mouthwatering recipes."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"This book is a lot of things. It's a cookbook (although I will take a previous reviewer's warning to heart and be careful about following the recipes); it's a reminiscence of sorts (the memories of Ehrlich's mother-in-law Miriam and others about European/American/immigrant Jewish life in the era of World War II); and finally, it's a book about a certain way of Jewish living. All three of these books are wonderful.The chapters with recipes in them put me in mind of the movie &quot;The Big Night&quot; (that's the one where you saw all that marvelous food being prepared in Stanley Tucci's restaurant in preparation for Louis Prima's visit). These parts of the book are the print equivalent - my mouth watered just reading about the preparation of those dishes.The other parts of the book describe a world that's fast becoming extinct. There is a new wave of religious fervor in Judaism, but it's just not the same as the religion my grandparents observed. That was a meeting of the Old World with the New, and I don't really think that will happen again.I do hope that Ehrlich writes a sequel (or some columns for distribution in newspapers or magazines). I'd like to know how she and her family are continuing to reconcile their version of religion with secular America. I'm sure it will become harder once Miriam and Jacob, her in-laws, pass on. They have been her teachers and guides (Miriam more so than Jacob), and I would like to know if she's truly acquired their commitment as well as their recipes."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Most people who read this book are women. I read this book because my wife was so affected by its content (she cried all the way through), that I just had to read it. I cried too! While the author catalogues her aging mother-in-laws unique recipes, she also reflects on the cycles and rhythms of life held by Jewish traditions. In effect, she is challenging all of us (not only Jews) to look at what valuables, or values, we can, and should, transmit to our children. We are also left with the deeper question of our responsibility, observant or not, to understand and pass along our family and religious traditions. In addition to your children, this book will make you want to connect with your entire family, and get in touch with the family history and traditions that make you who you really are. This book is heartily recommended. It also makes a great gift, especially for a Jewish relative or friend. And the recipes are good too!"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Ok, so I'm like a Hawaiian/Chinese guy living in San Francisco who picks this book up and finds it to be the first in a long time that moves him to tears. Sometimes it's like visiting a parallel universe - for a goy to understand why his hand gets slapped from the butter dish at his Jewish friend's houses - and at others, it's a beautifully written account of how a working woman in the 90s (re)discovers her immigrant heritage. I think this book will touch anyone with immigrant roots; all of us can identify with the hard work, sacrifice, and the scents that emanate from our mothers' kitchens. Those scents will always signify - home, and this book captures those scents in an elegant bottle."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"I finally read this book after meaning to for a long time--and I'm glad that I did.The premise of this book, a true story, is that a young Jewish daughter-in-law is learning to cook from her husband's mother, Miriam, who is a cook par excellence and a concentration camp survivor. Although the book is peppered with everyday and Jewish holiday recipes, the beauty of the narrative is the growing appreciation that the author, a young career woman, finds for her aging mother-in-law.This book is a rare combination--a book for foodies (of which I am admittedly one) and a book for women who are learning to appreciate the wisdom of an older generation.The book is sometimes funny, sometimes serious, but always tantalizing and perpetually interesting. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"This book moved me as few have in a long time. Ehrlich draws vivid portraits of people, places, and mouth watering recipies you can almost smell. The stories of her childhood and those of her husband, parents, and in-laws are told in an effectively simple, straightforward manner both engaging and enthralling. As a first generation American of Holocaust survivors, I related page after page to Ehrlich's details of life in The New Country where immigrants clung steadfastly to customs - and foods - from their homelands while trying to fit in and assimilate. I cried as often as I laughed, recognizing my own family in this wonderful book, and bought copies for all my friends. It was hard to put down, and even harder to put away at the end."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"When I opened this book, the author opened her front door and welcomed me into her family, her home, and the treasures of her heritage. Miriam's Kitchen gives being a Jew a warm cozy feeling. As Ehrlich describes the homes of her parents, grandparents, and in-laws, the reader sits at the kitchen table with all of them. We see the development of a contemporary, observant Jewish home through the kitchens and traditions of two generations. When you read it, you go home for a visit, or a holiday, or a celebration. Miriams Kitchen is Judaism passed on through the hands of its women. You can almost smell the luscious aroma of the Jewish Kitchen. This book is now in my personal library, my mother's and my mother-in-law's. It is to be shared, like a glass of tea. I cannot wait to try the few special recipes which are included. A Great gift for the women you love!"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Elizabeth Ehrlich wrote a beautiful book, so beautiful that you may feel impelled to kiss the pages. She brings us Jewish family life rich with images and words that deeply evoke the reader's feelings and memories, but that some how never get lost in excesive sentiment. In this nicely balanced and charming piece of literature, Ehrlich writes, &quot;Religion is a story that tells us how to live,&quot; but Miriam's Kitchen too is a story that tells us how to live--and how to serve; how to respect, how to love, how to appreciate, how to observe, how to question and while we are at it, how to make coffee cake and sweet and sour cabbage. It's at once very Jewish and at once something that can be appreciated and enjoyed by anyone from any ethnic or religious background. Best advice: Buy more than one copy. It's the kind of book you will want to give away again and again."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"This book was a joy to read. I loved reading a book about cooking, celebrating and raising a family. I feel that so often the importance of what women do as homemakers is undervalued. Its nice to read a book that honors this work. Miriam's is both funny and warm. I recommend it to anyone who dearly remembers their grandmothers."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"This book is mesmerisingly honest and artfully structured. Ehrlich's mid-life spiritual awakening in the kitchen resonates with my own--although I'm a midwesterner of Irish Catholic descent. Anyone who knows that suffering teaches us to cherish and nurture life will find affirmation in this book."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"This book brought me laughter and sadness. It touched me emotionally and took me back to my childhood with my immigrant grandparents. The Jewish holidays and the food - I was there again. Turning my home kosher 20 years ago made me understand the humor and dilema that was experienced and so beautifully written by the author. I purchased 2 copies - 1 for each daughter."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"As one who has struggled with spirituality, the laws of kashrut, and being the one in my family to carry on the heritage of \\"Jewish cooking\\", I loved this book! I learned a lot about Jewish customs and laws (my husband did not believe me about burying your dishes until I showed him in the book) and I identified with the author in many ways. I learned to cook the way she did, and wrote down the recipes as she did (make a well with the flour . . .) so her descriptions were very meaningful. I've tried and loved some of the recipes. This book would be a wonderful newlywed gift, especially for someone converting to Judiasm or considering keeping a kosher kitchen!"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"The book began with great promise--a connection to the past via ritual, religion and food--but a serious editor would have improved it by cutting 1/3--which would allow the author to make her lovely treatise without repeating the same points numerous times. When the author, for example, linked kosher pizza orders with the kosher rituals of ages past--I thought, &quot;enough already, she's made that point many times.&quot; But she continued to make it and others like it again and again. This is all the more irritating because of the potential of the book."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Having grown up Jewish in a secular house, with grandparentswho kept kosher and walked to shul on the holidays, thisbook spoke to me. Ehrlich paints a wonderful picture of theprevious generation and the things that gave meaning not just to their lives but to the lives of the families they raised.The recipes are a wonderful addition to the book and theybring me back to both my grandmother's and my mother's kitchen.I'm thankful to say my mother is still a wonderful cook and Iam collecting all of her recipes to pass on to my children.My one criticism of the book is that it is poorly edited. I find some of the sentence structures to be very awkward. I almost didn't continue reading the book because I found the writing to be less than elegant but... the subject matter drew me in. It was a worthwhile read for me but I wish the writing were better."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it then. I recently rediscovered it on my bookshelf and again, I am swept away by the deliciousness of the book.For anyone that has ever tried to learn old world recipes and learn to maintain a kosher home/kitchen the book speaks volumes. I know many people say the book is repetitive, and it is. I suppose it doesn't bother me because I understand how many times a person and try and fail at maintaining a kosher kitchen and how many times a recipe can fail despite every good intention.I am not a mushroom eater but I was particularly interested in the egg salad recipe in the book (It is not listed as the others are, just written about in the short chapter titled, \\"Egg Salad\\") I was interested enough to try it and I am glad I did. The cooked onion gives a real warm to the dish and I found that I could get away with very little salt. I used canned mushrooms that I had dried and reheated in the skillet with the onions. Very yum!"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"I found this book at the library in the cookbook section. Yet it is much more than just a cookbook. It's a story of love, Jewish culture, and family. Erlich is such a wonderful writer that after reading the chicken livers with gravy over egg noodles story, I wanted to run out and buy the ingredients to make the recipe -and I don't even like liver! Yet the story had my mouth watering and wondering if the dish could give me strength as it did for Erlich.I haven't searched yet but I hope Erlich has written a follow-up so I can see how she and her family are carrying on Miriam's traditions today."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"As a young adult, raised much of my life entirely on Christian beliefs, values, and customs, I thought this tale of Jewish immigrants and their descendants would seem foreign to me. However, I was truly amazed by the power of this book to cross the lines of culture and be accessible to everyone--but most easily understood by Americans. The tale of immigration and then subsequent loss of culture, language, and history is a common and well-understood concept in this country of immigrants. Despite its common theme, Miriam's Kitchen transcends the ordinary, becoming a tale of self-discovery and love for one's ancestors. The author, Elizabeth Ehrlich creatively weaves the stories of her own and her husband's families and ancestors with her chef training in the kitchen with her mother-in-law, Miriam, a holocaust survivor. Her desperate struggle to unite her Jewish beliefs and a desire for observance of Jewish laws with what she believes is right and best for her family and her community, forms the major conflict in this book. All in all, an incredibly moving story of the struggle to keep a different culture alive in today's America."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Elizabeth Ehrlich's touching memoir invites the reader into a world of delicious egg salads, honey cakes, latkes, vegetable soups and vanilla cookies made with love by the hands of mothers, sisters, grandmothers, great-grandmothers and one very special mother-in-law, Miriam. Mouth-watering recipes aren't the only things which Ehrlich and her family have to offer; memories, traditions, stories, wisdom and more are served up with each new recipe. The food from Miriam's Kitchen does more than just ease one's hunger; it connects one to their past, their family long-gone, their heritage, their roots, their culture, their religion and their future. These recipes are a legacy which has been cherished by generations of Jewish women who have executed the ancient rituals of Jewish religion and in so doing have played an important role in preserving the religion itself within their children--the next generation. Miriam's Kitchen is more than just a recipe book; it is a testament to generations of laboring and loving women of the Jewish tradition."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Everyone has a history, and everyone has a past. This past influences who we are and who we become. Traditions are passed down through generations in order to preserve the history of family. In Miriam's Kitchen by Elizabeth Ehrlich, the author compiles stories throughout her life in connection to recipes from her mother-in-law, a Holocaust survivor. The influence of her mother-in-law, Miriam, shapes Elizabeth's spiritual and religious journey. This memoir follows a women's awakening into religious and family values. The memoir is outlined throughout the span of a year, with each section encompassing a different month. These months make up her spiritual journey from longing to continuity. The religious journey outlined parallels Ehrlich's life as she grows into becoming a woman, a cook, and most importantly traditionally Jewish.The author outlines the main idea that she is trying to convey perfectly in the last paragraph of the introduction. \\"I embrace them all. I consider the law, the restrictions, the presumptions of happiness, the doubt. I inventory layers of translucent recollection evoking food, love, home, apocrypha, anger, ritual, laughter, conflict and regret. The result is a collage, but also a way of life. That collage is my religion, and it is what I am passing on.\\" (Ehrlich, 1998). This memoir is about wonder and interest, a search for a history, reclamation of tradition, and an integration of that tradition into the modern world."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books.I first came across this book when I was living in Holland, and one day, while browsing the second hand book market in Amsterdam, I came across an editor's copy, how it ended up there I don't know, but I bought the book. I never realized how homesick I was until I read this book. . . it brought back such beautiful memories. The stories reminded me so much of my grandmother, now gone 25 years.Each chapter is organized by month, reflecting the Jewish holidays that take place in each month, the endless preparation, the planning, and most importantly, the cooking associated with each holiday.I was also brought up as an Orthodox Jew, and I so dearly remember my grandmother and mother cleaning and cooking for weeks, getting ready, especially for Passover. Walking to shul and then coming home to a delicious meal - I can close my eyes today and almost bring back those tastes.This book is a loving tribute to Ms. Ehrlich's mother-in-law, but it is a story of life as well, how to survive when survival is unthinkable, how food connects us so strongly with our past, and how making those special holiday meals helps to forge a strong spiritual future for our children.I did not realize how important it would have been for me to ask for my grandmother's recipes before she died and this is something I will always regret. I was able to find a lot of my grandmother's cooking in the recipes included in this book as well, and I make those recipes often, especially the egg salad, which is exactly how my grandmother made it. When I make it now in my kitchen, exactly as Ms. Ehrlich describes, I can almost feel my grandmother's presence - it makes me want to weep because it is such a small way of feeling close to her again.If you don't know a lot about the Jewish religion, this book is an easy and interesting way to become acquainted with our customs surrounding holidays, family, life and death. If you have been brought up in the faith, then this book will touch your heart, because it will remind you of your childhood, your grandparents, and perhaps your life now.Even though it is not a cookbook, all of the recipes are authentic, easy to make, and delicious. I have made all of them, many times over.I loved this book so much that when I returned to America I brought it with me. Because I was afraid that my editor's paper fronted copy would wear out, since I had used it so much, I bought two additional copies. The first copy I keep with my cookbooks and refer to it often - the second I gave to my mother, who treasures this book as much as I do.This is a wonderful, affirming story of life. It is a must read."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"I purchased this book for my mom. She called me 3 days later-crying over what a beautiful GIFT this book was to her and how it stirred such beautiful memories of her family and especially her grandmother."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"\\"Miriam's Kitchen\\" is Elizabeth Ehrlich's inspirational, poignant memoir of life lessons learned in the kitchen of her Polish mother-in-law Miriam, of Miriam's sorrows and hardships translated into endless baking for Elizabeth's family. Like all things Jewish, the bitter with the sweet: there are recipes and mouthwatering descriptions of desserts: cakes, including chocolate sour cream and chocolate-chip pineapple cake, honey cake, Mandelbrot, cookies, and danishkes, holiday dishes (gefilte fish, kneydlekh, kompot chai, latkes), and scrumptious sides (sweet-and-sour cabbage, kugel, summer squash) from Miriam and from the author's grandmothers as well.Not merely an authentic document of vanishing, labor-intensive, but ultimately rewarding Polish-Jewish immigrant cuisine (which it excels at), \\"Miriam's Kitchen\\" also traces the lives of the author's grandmothers and the role that Judaism played (or failed to play) in her upbringing. The main thrust of the novel is the heartfelt search for Jewish roots, beginning by a gradual kosherization of her kitchen (one must have at least two sets of dishes, utensils, and sponges), and extending to the mikvah (ritual bath) and Torah study.The book is divided into a year, with each chapter covering a month. At the beginning of each chapter is a short diary segment chronicling the author's self-doubts, past treyf transgressions, and regret that she did not spend more time with Miriam sooner. Each chapter is filled with luscious smells from the past: Jewish comfort food as Miriam's mother's mother taught her, prepared without modern conveniences, many recipes existing only in the mind of the chef, having never been written down. Throughout Miriam's lessons, we are given glimpses of Miriam's hardships encountered in surviving the Holocaust, of the pioneering spirit of a young Israel, and the death of her daughter and long wait for grandchildren from Elizabeth, of longing fiercely for someone to love and to pass her knowledge down to.This beautifully written novel was an inspiration: delicious recipes, to be sure, that recalled cooking next to my babcia as she would make babka, pierogi, golabki, and nalesniki in a small, cozy apartment kitchen, and the loss of culture with the death of the older immigrant generation (I never did get written copies of my grandmother's recipes that she cooked from her memories of her girlhood in Poland, something which I dearly regret). The most moving part of the book for me was the author's spiritual reawakening and the reconciling of Jewish tradition at odds with the lure of the modern world: refusing her children hamburgers and milkshakes, un-kosher fried chicken, and pizza with pepperoni in favor of cooking at home, of reclaimed family time on traditional Shabbats, of rediscovering the power and magic of ritual, and ultimately, a greater sense of purpose in her life."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"This book was the most pleasant surprise of my summer. It was so much fun to read, and I also learned a great deal about keeping kosher and other aspects of Judaism. I am Jewish, but of the &quot;secular&quot; sort Erlich frequently mentions in regard to her parents; thus there was much I did not know. It is true, as other reviewers have commented, that the parts about the difficulties of keeping kosher become a bit redundant by book's end. Still, this was one of the best reads I've had in a long time, and I'd recommend it to anyone, Jewish or not, who wants to connect with the (VERY different, though by the clock not that long ago) time in which our grandparents and great grandparents lived. I only wish my Grandma were alive to read it."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"I stumbled across this book and have found it to be the best &quot;cookbook&quot; I've ever read. The stories are so moving on not only a personal, but historical and political level. Because of this book, I am re-examining my links to my foremothers via the kitchen. A must read!"},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"This author has written a treasure of a book, tying family stories, her own life, and the recipes together into one scrumptious feast. Literature meets cookbook and the result is fabulous. Many thanks to Mrs. Ehrlich for taking us with her on her journey. And bless Miriam for remembering.One odd sidenote. My grandfather's family was from Bohemia and supposedly were Catholics. How strange to see what I thought were Bohemian words for pot roast and dumplings turn up here as Yiddish. Were the languages so fluid or similar or was a part of my family Jewish in the mid-1800s? Life can be a mystery."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"I was excited about learning about this family,but when I started reading the book it was not what I had thought.It was not just one chapter to the next progessing thru time,it was my months and recipes and jumped from the authors adult life to childhood memories.I just found it scatterd for me.Perhaps I should have read more of the other reviews before I purchased the book."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"This memoir begins is centralized around many kitchens and the foods prepared within them by numerous relations of the author and narrator, Elizabeth Ehrlich, a Jewish-American woman, finding her way back to faith. Through snapshots of daily life, family stories and her own experiences, she realizes the prevalence and presence that the Jewish culture and her own family heritage has on her life, as she tries to understand it in her youth, escape it in young adulthood and reconnect as she herself becomes a mother. Miriam, her mother-in-law, is the one she first turns to when she realizes that the traditions she can recall from her parents are only a shadow of the true religion, a handful of important holidays and a reluctance to eat pork. Through Miriam, she begins to renew the traditions and soon finds that each step towards being a little more kosher in her cooking draws her evermore back to the Jewish faith.I found the memoir similar in a way to the novel \\"The Joy Luck Club\\" by Amy Tan, in which the Chinese-American daughters of immigrant mothers fight or stray from their heritage and finding their way back. The flashbacks and stories highlight events that make their mothers who they are and illuminate for their children, the reasoning behind their values, hopes and dreams. Similarly, it is about striking a balance between the choice of alienation by holding on to the old too tightly, and complete integration in embracing the American culture and forgetting the old. Ehrlich reflects that the traditions, stories and the Torah aren't just meaningless ritual or purely spiritual, but they teach how to live, guidance that she would like in her life.It was touching and revealed some of the intricacies of Jewish tradition, as well as the obligation that comes along with any family practices. In general though, the chapters jumped around between stories from the immigrant generation, to points in Ehrlich's life where she was fascinated or exasperated by her heritage, then a handful of recipes here and there. It brings to attention the struggles of keeping Kosher, Sabbath and connections within a scattered and gradually less devout tribe. Other than that, this is definitively a slow, reflective memoir, a stream of consciousness piece, in which Ehrlich eventually reaches a full Kosher kitchen with her children on their way to learning the Torah."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"Miriam's Kitchen is a moving story of one woman's reconnection with her cultural identity. Through food and her mother in law's many kosher meals, Elizabeth Ehrlich begins to adopt a Jewish identity that she feels gives her a sense of meaning and purpose. This book shows us the importance of heritage and the ways that one's past can anchor us in the present and the future. Without knowing where one has come from, how can we know where are going? Miriam's kitchen is a story of self discovery that many people will find is a parallel to their own lives. Unique to this story is the role of food in Jewish life: keeping Kosher is keeping the mitzvot and following the commandments, the very essence of Judaism. The book shows us that Jewish adherence to Halakha is not empty ritual, but in fact a meaningful aspect of one's life that allows the Jewish people to live in union with God. Highly recommended biographical narrative."},{"Title":"Miriam's Kitchen","review":"I picked up this book not hearing anything about it. What a treat! Not only are the recipes a treasure, but the entire book is. It is truly heartwarming and I will go out of my way to seek Ms. Ehrlich's future books."},{"Title":"Salt boy","review":"I really liked this book because it's a book about a boy and his father and the boy making his father proud of him.

The driving time doesn't seem so long."},{"Title":"Tarabas,: A guest on earth,","review":"Nicholas Tarabas... the monk Hildebrandt, Siddhartha, Parzifal, Goethe's particular Faust, and a host of lesser examples would make one suspect that Germans and German writers have always been obsessed with the Mitteleuropean \\"Three Rs\\": Repentance, Renunciation, and Redemption. Of course, book-worthy repentance has to be prefaced by vivid sins; Tarabas's sins are chiefly of violence - beginning with a simple fist fight but crescendoing to a horrific pogrom - and drunkenness. His renunciation, however, is total, an excruciating commitment to suffering and squalor described in achingly credible detail. And his redemption is ambiguously impersonal, posthumous, useless to anyone except as an icon. Truly, everything about Tarabas - the character and the book - is iconic and archetypal; one might almost suspect that Joseph Roth had been studying Karl Jung.Tarabas is a young Russian of good and wealthy family, a university student who is expelled for semi-serious anti-Tsarist activity. He spends some aimless years in America, then returns to Russa at the beginning of World War 1 to become a ruthlessly effective 'front' officer, a veritable devil of a fighter. The Russian Revolution complicates his story, deprives him of his self-satisfaction as a fighter. He becomes an officer without a war in a fragment country which may be Belarus. Eventually, bad gets worse, he presides over a pogrom without being sober enough to grasp the situation, he commits an act of violence against a harmless Jewish idiot that somehow awakens him to his own degradation.Joseph Roth wasn't in fact German. He was a Jew from the eastern fringe of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His descriptions of Tarabas's anti-semitism, and the anti-semitism of Tarabas's world, must have been monstrously painful to write. But Tarabas is a Christian of sorts, and Roth frames his story of 'redemption' in essentially Christian mystical terms.There's a huge ambivalence in this tale; the author wears a three-cornered hat of Judaism, folklorish mysticism, and outright skepticism. I reckon that it's the intellectual tension of Roth's ambiguity that makes this book worth reading... that, and the stunningly beautiful prose, sentence after sentence. Ordinarily, this is a genre of fiction that doesn't compel my interest, but how could I not be compelled by writing like this:\\"In the out-house where the miracle had occurred two candles had now been lighted. They were stuck upon a log of wood and lit the Virgin's face with their uncertain flame.... The candles, continually renewed -- no one could tell were they came from; it was as though every peasant had brought candles with him to Koropta -- shed shadow rather than light. A solemn darkness reigned within the room, a darkness of which the candles were the shining core....\\" Into this luminous darkness, in a few moments of prose, the Jews of Koropta will be dragged pathetically and forced to worship a painting of the Mother of Jesus while being spit upon, kicked, defiled, vilified... after which they will be herded back to their ghetto to be beaten to death or incinerated in the fires that will destroy their homes.Does Roth's writing remind anyone else of Bela Bartok's music? If you don't know Bartok, the comparison will be useless, but if you do, it may be telling: the amplification of a folksong/folk tale, the simplest of material, by means of sophisticated harmonies and resonances; the harsh passion; the relentless impetus. In these ways, \\"Tarabas\\" very much resembles Roth's \\"Job\\", a novel that blends 'shetl' humor and Biblical desolation, and both novels remind me a lot of Bartok's opera \\"Bluebeard\\". On the other hand, Roth's greatest novel, The Radetsky March, is constructed on a totally different pattern, without any of the Bartokian romanticism, a large-canvas historical novel rationally analyzing the collapse of the multi-ethnic Hapsburg order. Roth was, in my opinion, one of the very finest fictionalists of the 20th Century, whose work is just now coming to the attention of English-speaking readers."},{"Title":"Tarabas,: A guest on earth,","review":"Tarabas tells the story of the restless life of Colonel Nikolaus Tarabas. Exiled to America by this father, for taking part in anti-Czarist activities, Tarabas becomes jealous over a woman and seriously injures a bar owner in a drunken rage. \`The hearts of foolish, easily intoxicated people are impenetrable.'A gypsy has predicted that Tarabas will be both a murderer and a saint. Thinking that the bar owner is dead, Tarabas uses the declaration of the Great War as an opportunity to flee America to join the Russian military. Here, as the Great War becomes the Revolution, Tarabas again commits an act of violence, this time against a Jewish man.Again he flees. This time, as a beggar trying to atone for his sins, he eventually finds peace when the Jewish man forgives him.While the main themes of the novel are crime and punishment, guilt and forgiveness, it is Tarabas's restlessness and inability to settle and to really belong anywhere that has stayed with me. Yes, Tarabas is guilty of inhumanity, but he is not alone. I find this novel thought-provoking, bleak and unsettling: I love it. I am tempted to reread Dostoevsky to seek out parallels with both \`Crime and Punishment' and \`The Idiot'. But the reread will have to wait. There are a number of Joseph Roth novels to read first.\`A new generation is growing up which knows nothing of the old story.'Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Tarabas,: A guest on earth,","review":"Tarabas, the antihero of Joseph Roth's short, intense novel, is, without doubt, a manifold 'sinner'. A young Russian officer, returning from a leisure life in New York to Eastern Europe, throws himself with great vigour into war action in 1914. He had been banned from his Galician home by his strict and powerful father, following some serious misdemeanours, politically and private. While in New York, a gypsy fortune teller predicts that he will be a \\"murderer and a saint\\" and that he will \\"sin and atone during his lifetime\\". This prophecy, woven like a red thread through the story, engraves itself into the young man's consciousness, increasingly influencing his actions. In this novel, published in 1934, the author compresses the many-sided realities of war and its fallout on a local population, into powerful and at times exquisitely crafted scenarios, mostly centred in and around one village Koropta in an unnamed, newly independent, country.How much can a fortune foretold guide a person's actions? Following Tarabas life at the end of the war, the answer is: very much indeed. The swift transformation of by now 'Oberst' (Colonel) Tarabas from sinner to (not-quite) saint, when and why it happens, is as doubtful as it is essential for the totality and importance of the novel. But then, plausibility is evidently not of great concern to Roth here. At one level, and a fundamental one, the novel reads like a parable of human behaviour and morals during war and occupation, exemplified by Tarabas's excesses in both. At another level, the novel excels in highly realistic and detailed description of the circumstances in Koropta and the surrounding farms, that lead to a pogrom against the Jewish population in the village. Painful as it is to read, this section stands out in its heart wrenching intensity and power. Last but not least, in his portraits of the likes of Tarabas himself, his father, the General and, especially Tarabas's Jewish counterparts, inn-keeper Kristianpoller and sexton Shemarjah, Roth develops vivid characters that are difficult to forget.For me, this was my first foray into Joseph Roth's work, not having attempted to read his acknowledged masterwork, THE RADETZKY MARSH, published in 1932, until now. Roth, a liberal Jewish Austrian journalist living in Berlin in the 1920s and early 1930s, left Germany in 1933 and died prematurely in 1939 in Paris at the age of 45. TARABAS was his first work published in exile. While he wrote somewhat disapprovingly about his novel later to a friend, it remains an important and deeply affecting piece of writing for the historical moment in time and with food for reflection far beyond its time. [Friederike Knabe]"},{"Title":"Tarabas,: A guest on earth,","review":"This was Roth's first novel published in exile, 1934. It is his usual compact version of material that could fill a 500 page novel. It was received with mixed comments. The less positive voices said it gave too little structure to too much material.It is not a very complex story, but it is a very difficult story to digest. Our antihero Nikolaus Tarabas is a thoroughly dislikable man. He grew up a Russian citizen from a rich family in the Western regions of the Czar's empire. In the course of events his home region becomes an independent country but never receives a name from Roth. We learn that the region is Catholic and has a large Jewish minority.Before NT found his calling as a ruthless and efficient front officer in war, he had a phase as a student in St.Petersburg, where he joined a political group and got caught in the preparation of an assassination. He was lucky to get away and immigrated to the US. There he became a violent and jealous drinker, got himself into trouble, (a Gypsy fortune teller has predicted that he will become a murderer and then a saint), and was lucky that WW1 broke out. He volunteered for the Russian army, went home, joined in his reserve lieutenant's uniform, was an excellent officer, made it to a captaincy.Then revolution comes and makes him redundant. He is sent home. With 26 of his soldiers he offers himself to his new country and gets hired as a colonel with the task to build a regiment. He is not good at greater tasks though. His peak is over and he learns that soon.He gets posted to a town that is much afraid of peace. War was bad enough, but what now, what horrors are going to come now?The town has a Jewish population. NT is a man with deeply rooted anti-Semitic feelings.At this time, the narrative slows down. While most events so far were told as if in fast forward mode, now we watch the unfolding of events that lead to a pogrom, in slow motion. Key event is the discovery, by rebellious soldiers, that a wall in a Jewish pub has a painting of the Virgin Mary under its plaster. The Mother of God has descended on us! Good catholic peasants and soldiers start a riot which leads to a pogrom.By this time, NT is already a half broken man. He has started to doubt himself, his abilities and his role in life. When he commits an act of personal cruelty against a Jew during the crisis, he breaks down and breaks out of his life pattern. He becomes a repentant sinner and a vagrant. He dies in a monastery after reassuring himself that the victim of his cruelty has forgiven him.The novel has two main streams of narrative: the \`sin and redemption' story is set in a background narrative of the \`peace to end all peace' history of the post WW1 experience in Central and Eastern Europe. Roth is often misunderstood as preaching nostalgia for the lost days of Kakania. Not so. He was a lamenter of the horrors that came after the relative stability of the pre WW1 world.The tale of the anti-Semitic riots serves as a focal point for the novel and for NT's life. It is a brilliant piece of prose. Jewish/Catholic conflicts are part of the broader picture that Roth paints.I wonder why Roth abstained from giving the new country a name. We all know that it is likely to be Poland (though it might also be Lithuania). Roth was from the Austrian part of Poland after all. Many of his stories are rooted in Galicia. This one here is deliberately vague about its site.Is this novel among Roth's great achievements? All in all I would say no, but it deserves 5 stars any day."},{"Title":"Common Sense, Science and Scepticism: A Historical Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge","review":"An excellent introduction for those coming to epistemology for the first time. The author avoids potentially confusing formulations of the issues and generally presents the various positions well."},{"Title":"Common Sense, Science and Scepticism: A Historical Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge","review":"Alan Musgrave is a good writer and the book is both interesting for the expirienced and those new to philosophy. It should be noted though that the book is written by a follower of Karl Popper's critical rationalism and that it beacause of that sometimes differ in its conclusions from mainstream analytic philosophy, mostly in the last chapter. So it's a quite god introduction to epistemology and its history but also a brilliant introduction to critical rationalist epistemology."},{"Title":"Common Sense, Science and Scepticism: A Historical Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge","review":"Musgraves introduction to epistemology is great! the problems discussed are very well set out. Musgrave writes clearly and is easy to read.Plus, hes autographed my book!"},{"Title":"Common Sense, Science and Scepticism: A Historical Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge","review":"This is the best introduction to epistemology that I have read. Musgrave writes with clarity and grace, taking the reader to the heart the theory of knowledge. Unlike most introductory texts or short histories, which merely summarize the conclusions of great philosophers, &quot;Common Sense, Science, and Scepticism&quot; focuses on the arguments of the philosophers. Thus, the book is an excellent introduction to what it means to &quot;do&quot; philosophy. The text is rewarding, and anyone interested in philosophy can read it with profit."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"I enjoyed this book for it's realistic characters and historical detail. The author's thorough research manages to bring the story to life by explaining everyday practices without impeding the story's progress. Re-read many times, so well worth the money!!!"},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"I have only just recently bought my Kindle. I have read many of Gillian Bradshaw books based upon Rome and the Mediterranean in print, and have very much enjoyed them. I purchased this for my new Kindle. It has literally hundreds of typographical errors. Some minor that don't interrupt the flow of the book much once you learn to ignore them and not be frustrated. But there are some that I have to stop and think and figure out what it actually should be so that it makes sense. Very frustrating. I don't find these kinds of errors in print books."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"This fine work of historical fiction set in the Rome of Augustus. Hermogenes, an Alexandrian Greek and trader, travels to the capital city to settle a deeply personal matter involving a debt owed to him by a powerful \\"new man,\\" the presiding consul Tarius Rufus. Hermogenes's uncle was ruined and his father met an accidental death because of this debt, and Hermogenes stubbornly pursues its redemption. Unfortunately, Rufus is both arrogant and desperately concealing the fact that he is in bad financial straits, and plots to have Hermogenes eliminated to conceal his secret.Without giving too much more of the plot away, the result is an entertaining tale that takes the reader inside the travails that even a wealthy foreignor would encounter trying to speak to power in ancient Rome. The book is at its best in the way it handles slavery. Slavery, and in particular the relationships between masters and their slaves, saturates the book. As a fictional examination of slavery in Augustan times, it is an excellent work and is a highly entertaining story.I found myself only able to give this novel three stars mostly because of my difficulty in classifying it. I disagree with \\"Publishers Weekly\\" in that strictly speaking, I do not regard this novel as a thriller. In thinking of how to specifically recommend it, I found myself hard put to do so in any terms beyond good historical fiction; I wonder how much appeal it would have beyond those of us who treasure the Greco-Roman world? I kept thinking that while this audience would find the novel very good indeed, anyone else would probably find it dull."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"This is not a very good book- it's written as though it's intended for a sixth grade audience- one which knows nothing about Imperial Rome. The protagonist behaves in an unbelievable way- NO Roman citizen of the period would spend even a fraction of the time that this guy does worrying about the slaves and their treatment. And a Roman consul who physically attacks a citizen- unbelievable. Then there is the woman who rescues our hero, the female gladitator! Don't waste your time. The mysteries of Steve Saylor and Lindsey Davis portray a much more accurate picture of ancient Rome and it's citizens."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"This was a very good book for historical fiction fans.Hermogenes, a Romanized Greek banker from Alexandria, travels to Rome to collect a debt that he inherited from a relative. He has no reason to believe that everything won't go according to law. After all, the man who owes him is very wealthy. Why would he miss such a paltry sum? Unfortunately, the debtor, now a powerful consul, sees no reason that a &quot;true&quot; Roman should pay the likes of a Greek. This sets off a wild ride for Hermogenes as he runs a round Rome just a step ahead of his enemies trying to collect his money and go hom in one piece.The best part of the book is the setting. Like many ancient history fiction books, the plot need not as important as the scenery. There is plenty of historical &quot;eye candy.&quot; Ancient Rome really comes alive -- the government buildings, prisons, centurions, city walls and gates, and even the different types of housing, both tenements and high-class villas.This isn't to say that the plot suffers -- it is very good, too. All the characters play their parts well -- the golden=hearted Hermogenes, the loyal Maerica, the merchant Crispus, the fair but tough Taurus, and the properly rotten Pollio and Rufus.With both the Emperor and his right-hand man, Agrippa, absent from Rome, we get to see the rest of Rome -- its consuls, prefects, and businessmen. The plot begins quite simply, but even when events go crazy, I still understood them. There are not too many characters, and they are well-developed. I especially liked the scenes in Crispus' house, describing the people who work there.I admit that the story is very pat with a &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending. Also, Hermogenes is often too good to be true. Then again, everyone keeps calling him a &quot;strange man.&quot;All in all, this is a very good book -- a good view of the ancient world and a good story."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"As a huge fan of any good book about Romans (especially Colleen McCullough's series) I eagerly snatched this one up and I wasn't disappointed. Although not grand in scale like many works set in Rome at its heyday, it is exceptionally faithful to the historical accuracy of the time (16 bc) and to the leading figures who interact with the main character, a fictional Alexandrian businessman from Egypt. The author is a gifted storyteller who immediately immerses you into Rome and the plight of this proud and honest \\"Greekling\\" who gets himself caught up in high-power Roman consular plots and intrigue. The author also does an excellent job of peering into the hearts of her characters, and deftly weaves the appropriate amount of loves lost and found into the plot, not to mention the ubiquitous greed and pride that goes with any Roman story. Believable and interesting from start to finish, it is very well written.And my measure of a books success - I had great difficulty putting it down until I was done! Highly recommended for fans of the Roman era and lovers of a well-told story."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"Gillian Bradshaw's newest, &quot;Render unto Caesar,&quot; came yesterday and I just finished it - it's that good. I'm a fan of all of her books and admire her ability to create three-dimensional characters set in ancient Rome, Athens, Alexandria, or Britannia, but I think this book is at the very top of her form.Set in the mid-period of Augustus' reign, Hermogenes, a young Greek merchant from Alexandria who has &quot;purchased&quot; and very proud of his new Roman citizenship, comes to Rome to settle the problem of a debt, inherited from his uncle, from a wealthy Roman who, it turns out, is now Consul of Rome Hermogenes thinks, as a respectable Roman citizen, he can politely demand payment under Roman law and all will be well. What happens, however, when he asks the powerful Lucius Tarius Rufus for his 450,000 sesterci debt, sets a plot in motion that is as enticing as any thriller while full thought-provoking historical questions that will intrigue and puzzle. Bradshaw's book is centered in a very real sense of just what real life might have felt like in ancient Rome, from what a wealthy man ate at a dinner party to the refuse and fleas of a fourth-rate insula room for rent. Hermogenes is a fascinating and ultimately admirable character, deeply committed to the idea of Roman justice, proud of his citizenship - yet a Greek from Alexandria in the generation just after Actium and Cleopatra when Greeks were despised as effete and Egyptians as subhuman. His adventures and dangers in Rome feel satisfyingly three-dimensional, without any of that unfortunate trend towards setting a &quot;2003 plot in a toga&quot; that mar some Roman efforts. Bradshaw's scholarship is impressive, and invisible. From the smells and sounds of the early-morning Roman market to what multi-millionaires do to recalcitrant slaves (feed them to the lampreys, which is historically accurate!), Hermogenes dwells in a concrete time, space, and growing danger. And throughout, the question resonates - what does it mean to be a Roman citizen? And is it more, or less, than being a free man in a free country?The plot twists and turns with no simple answers but driven by the pacing of the characters themselves. If you only read one book about ancient Rome this year, make it &quot;Render Unto Caesar.&quot; You'll never feel quite the same way again about the Rome of Augustus and the &quot;Pax Romana.&quot;"},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"I used to only like a story (movie or book) of ancient Rome if it had lots of military campaigns and gladiatorial gore in them. Then like most teenagers I grew up and discovered novels like those written by Gillian Bradshaw could offer something without all that.This tale of a Greek moneylender (Hermogenes) who travels from Alexandria to Rome to collect an inherited debt owed to his deceased father shows its writers undoubted knowledge of her subject matter. You can find as much fascination with the descriptions of Rome circa 16BC and the life of its populace as you can wishing its principle character success in his mission to recover what is rightfully owed to him.Hermogenes task is made all the more problematic by the fact that the man his father once did business with is now one of the Consuls of Rome. Only outranked by Emperor Augustus. The advantages of power, the need to find people you can trust to help and the subtle art of survival when you are a small fish in a big pond all result in plots developing within plots - which helps the story stay fresh and interesting.Of particular interest was the characters who come into Hermogenes struggle. The most fascinating for me was Cantabra the Hispanic Celt and former gladiatrix. Attractive but hardly feminine her relationship with Hermogenes is a fascinating weaves of contrasting characters. The kindly and trusting Greek with educated and polite tongue vs the street wise and straight talking Celt provide many fine moments in this book.Another highlight of all Gillians books are the \\"authors notes\\" at the end. In these notes she provides answers to questions one might raise about the events within her story. Fact and fiction it may be but her notes support the fact she writes an accurate account of the times - no research short cuts for this classically educated authoress.An excellent and enjoyable read and as a bonus you learn something about the place and its people."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"Hooray, another Bradshaw historical! Gillian Bradshaw has a special gift for characterization that makes all her work a treat to read, but her historicals surpass the rest. As histories they make the ancient past not just vivid, but also human and comprehensible. Her readers become privy to mindsets vastly different from their own.Bradshaw's novels also do what good fiction must do--grip the reader and never let go. Even better, her books bear re-reading, again and again. My absolute favorite continues to be _Island of Ghosts_, but this latest outing is another fine addition to the bookshelf."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"I'm distinctly non-female and a committed non-reader of romances. That being said \\"Render unto Caesar\\" is really at heart a love story. It is just so well written with such engaging characters that even I enjoyed it.It centers on a Greek/Hellenistic moneylender from Alexandria in Rome in the mid-augustan period. There are actually a couple of very touching love stories interweaving in the main narrative. In a sense the whole novel is really about love: A mans love for his daughter, a boy's love for his mother, a patricians love for Rome, a Greek's love for Alexandria, a man unrequited love for his slave and a slaves unrequited love for his master and, obviously, a very touching romantic man-women love story.Gillian Bradshaw makes the characters and setting come to live with lots of touching details and everyday stories. For instance when the main characters, the Greek banker, Hermogenes, has borrowed a slave boy from his Roman host to have him shown around the city. The boy is being showered with gifts from his master who is in love with him, unfortunately he doesn't really like bedding men and he feels guilty over the fact that he doesn't appreciate his master's kindness. Obviously his parents and siblings wants him to rejoice over his good fortune since the fact that his owner has taken a shine to him is good news for everybody concerned - the owner being a kindhearted man who treats his household slaves kindly. A wonderful way of bringing across the alien viewpoint - A slave feeling guilty about not appreciating being taken to his masters bed. Anyway, as Hermogenes is showed around the city by his guide he buys honey cakes not just for the boy bit also for a little girl called Erotion, and her mother Tertia - the slave women taking care of his rooms. The boy instantly gets worried that he intends to bed her and Hermogenes has to assure him it's just that she is kind, attentive and doing a good job:The boy went deep red and bit his lib. \\"I'm sorry, sir,\\" he mumbled staring at the road. \\"I didn't ...I know it's not....I mean, if you did, you wouldn't even have to give her cakes.... it's just that she is my mother\\"I found the whole situation really touching. Lots of little touches like that capturing the different way people think about things and mixing the casual cruelty of their society with the gentleness of individuals."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"If you don't like Gillian Bradshaw's writing and plotting, there's something wrong with you. It's that simple.\\"Render Unto Caesar\\" is just the latest in a stunning parade of historical novels by this classical scholar.It simply doeasn't get any better than Bradshaw."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"What a great book! I've read a few of Gillian Bradshaw's novels now and I have enjoyed every one. They are written in a light style and the plot moves along quickly, taking you with it. This was no exception.Hermogenes is an Alexandrian trader who travels to Rome to try to reclaim a debt from an important Roman civic person. We read lots of really interesting vignettes about how the Romans saw other nations - Barbarians - and how their notion of honour appeared to be generally only honour to other Romans. Hermogenes is accompanied by two slaves from Alexandria and before long the two slaves are having to act as bodyguards to him. It appears that he has poked a rather nasty wasps nest in trying to reclaim his debt. One of his slaves is killed in a fight with some of Hermogenes' new enemies and his life is saved by Cantabra, the female gladiator of a barbarian (celtic) tribe. She becomes his new bodyguard and the tender and rather surprising love story between them is wonderfully written. Hermogenes gets deeper and deeper into Roman politics and Roman money until eventually he wins back his debt, at the cost of many beatings and much trouble.What I liked about this story was that there was a sub-theme about the position of gay men and boys in Roman society, as well as Greek. Some of the issues were explored - that of slaves not having the option of saying \`no' to their masters (although Cantabra actually does this) and the way in which gay people were seen in Greek and Roman society. This is all done in a way that doesn't feel like you're being preached to or lectured at. No mean feat!This is a good yarn set in any era but the Roman details just add to the enjoyment. I recommend this book wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"This was the most enjoyable work of fiction I have read in some time. I found the characters engaging, the plot interesting, and the little details concerning everyday life fascinating. Well researched! I especially appreciated the notes in the afterword. Thanks to Ms. Bradshaw's recommendation, I am now enjoying Mr. Carcopino's work."},{"Title":"Render Unto Caesar","review":"Before I get to the meat of my review of this enjoyable book, I must complain about the number of typos and wrong words in the Kindle edition -- which went beyond the acceptable. Not the author's fault but very sloppy work by the publisher and editor.Now to the book itself which I found absorbing. The setting is Rome, the year 16 B.C. Hermogenes, a well-to-do Greek banker from Alexandria, arrives in the city accompanied by a couple of slaves to collect a debt he has inherited from his late uncle. The debtor turns out to be an obnoxious Roman consul, Tarius Rufus who refuses to pay and physically attacks out hero who is rescued by Cantabra, a former female gladiator.We gradually learn that Hermogenes is an overwhelmingly decent and moral man, concerned about the well being of his slaves and in fact considerate of the feelings of everyone with whom he comes into contact. This sets him apart in the brutal society that is Rome. My one criticism of this book is that Hermogenes seems to have landed in ancient Rome from somewhere in upscale America circa 2008. He is indeed a metro-sexual although a very heterosexual one. His developing love affair with Cantabra takes up the bulk of the latter half of the book.There's quite a lot of detail about the banking, credit, loans, slavery, sexual mores of the period that keeps this book interesting. The hero is an interesting and sympathetic character. The love affair is sweet. It's a pretty good read."},{"Title":"Surface Mount Technology Terms and Concepts","review":"Though this book was compiled quite a few years ago, it is still an essential reference guide for anyone involved with SMT assembly.

It's based on a Japanese-language text by a noted historian and an aviation buff, and rendered into workable English by the British historian Christopher Shores. The result is a much more accessible book than the earlier one by the same Japanese authors about the larger Japanese navy air force. There are many photos, side-views of JAAF fighters, accounts of the major campaigns, biographies of the aces (happily arranged in alphabetical order so you can quickly look them up), and an appendix listing every major air combat and every JAAF pilot lost in 15 years of war. A solid book that belongs in the library of every serious student of the Pacific War. -- Dan Ford"},{"Title":"Japanese Army Air Force Units and Their Aces: 1931-1945","review":"The careful translation of the original text into a more nicely-flowing English; the influence of the master historian, Chris Shores; the decision to publish by the renowned Grub Street Press: this should be a much better book than the volume detailing the naval fighter units of Japan by the same authors.But it's not.If you spend the better part of forty dollars hoping for a book that is more like Mr. Shores' &quot;Bloody Shambles&quot;, Mr. Ford's &quot;Flying Tigers&quot;, or even Mr. Bergerud's &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot;, then you'll be sorry."},{"Title":"Cooley: The Career of a Great Heart Surgeon.","review":"This book turned out to be a very good biography of Dr. Denton Cooley.

I was honored to have the opportunity to meet Dr. Cooley, who, at 88 years of age, had just ceased surgical practice three years ago. Though he is a man of great ego, he is also a man of great intellect and accomplishment, so perhaps such an ego is well deserved. This not a \\"grabbing\\" book from the beginning, it begins by focusing upon the conflict between Dr. Cooley and his mentor/nemesis. However, one interested in Dr. Cooley's phenomenal accomplishments in the area of cardiac surgery, as well as his being an outstanding individual from his teens and showing great promise from an early age and fulfilling such promise will be pleased at the thoroughness and story of this incredible man."},{"Title":"Human Body: An Illustrated Guide to Every Part of the Human Body and How It Works","review":"what a great little book, it covers all the systems of the human body, anatomy atlas for the muscles, bones, nerves, and cardiovascular system. it is perfect to throw into your schoolbag or handbag so you can study anytime - anywhere.

I was looking for a more general, simpler atlas of anatomy with explantion of fundamental physiology without the complexities that Netter's incorporates into almost all cross-sections/plates.The positive things about this book is that it has good and easy to understand guides on physiology and common illnesses. Almost all major body parts are described with clear to-the-point short paragraphs.However, even though the book is full of color illustrations on every page, they are over-simplified to the extent that many are either out of proportion or poorly drawn. For example, on the page where it's describing how air and food pass through the laryx then food goes to esophagus and air goes into trachea, the three diagrams there show different sizes for epiglottis and pharynx, even though apparently it's explaining the same system!!! I would really have to say the diagrams/illustrations are at most middle school level, exactly what you would expect from a middle school biology textbook. The only redeeming quality is the succinct tutorials.I would higly suggest another beginner's and general atlas that has much higher quality illustrations and is much more accurate than this one. I strongly recommend \\"Essential Atlas of Anatomy\\" which has excellent diagrams at almost the same quality level as Netter's but without being too complicated for beginners and 1st and 2nd year medical students to understand.If you are already fairly familiar with human anatomy but are actually looking for a simple atlas of physiology then this would suffice. Since you already know the correct anatomical proportion and position the inaccuracies in the book wouldn't affect you.

Another highlight of the book was the description of the function of the cells at the beginning, which is more detailed than other anatomy books I've read. On top of all that, the book ends with a description of the major afflictios of the body, which is also very useful for those interested in pathophysiology or medicine. My only complaint? I wish the integumentary system had its own section rather than being lumped in with the cell pages, but it's nothing major and doesn't detract from the book.All-in-all, the book is small, well-illustrated, and very descriptive.

John Hick is one of the leading philosophers promoting the idea that all axial (major) religions are valid paths to god as well as many lesser known belief systems. Being that his audience is mainly composed of Christians or influenced by Christian culture, Hick focuses on Christian exclusivists (those who believe in only one way to God and that being Christianity) must overcome their confining worldview in light of the fact Christianity has failed to bring about the Kingdom of God; we're no better than other cultures and sometimes worse. Anyone wishing to defend an exclusivistic path should read this or any of the other books among Hick's publications. Anyone thinking Christianity might be wrong in it's traditional approach should also read this book to discover a new, valid approach. As Paul said, \\"...when I became an adult, I put away childish things.\\""},{"Title":"God Has Many Names","review":"This book provides an excellent overview of Hick's Pluralistic Theology of Religions - accessible to the general public. Whether you agree or disagree with Hick's pluralistic conclusions, the philosophical grounding of his arguments against Christian exclusivism have set the stage for over 50 years of continued debate and dialogue on the subject. I recommend this book for anyone interested in the phenomenon of religious diversity, questions about conflicting religious truth claims, the possibility of salvation beyond any given religious tradition, religious pluralism, and many other areas to which John Hick is an internationally recognized author and scholar.Note: For a more thorough presentation of Hick's pluralistic theology of religions, see John Hick \\"An Interpretation of Religion\\".An Interpretation of Religion: Human Responses to the Transcendent, Second Edition"},{"Title":"God Has Many Names","review":"As a leading apologist for religious pluralism, Hick in this book profusely offers sound proof for the case. The erudite philosopher diligently gathers a bundle of psalms, scriptures and theologies from the world's monotheistic religions, concluding convincingly that all ways worshiping the Creator,or First Cause, or Eternal Being have congenial essence and each one reflects its own cultural influence on the perception of the Supreme Being.Very well done, Mr Hick. This book seems less verbose than his other marvelous work \\"Metaphor of God Incarnate\\" but more knowledge-oriented."},{"Title":"God Has Many Names","review":"Depending on where your faith is placed, this book will be one of your favorites or heretical!!

As Hicks quotes from the Bhagavad-Gita.......&quot;Howsoever men may approach me, even so do I accept them; for, on all sides, whatever path they may choose is mine&quot;."},{"Title":"God Has Many Names","review":"I would first like to comment on the structure of the book, then take a look at a few of Hick's arguments. Finally, I'll mention a little about what I thought over all.Structure:I was really excited to read this book. I've read many articles but never a book on religious pluralism. I know John Hick is considered an authority on the subject as well, so I was anticipating a good read. However, I came to notice that the book became increasingly disorganized half way through the book. I don't mean to say that the transitions between chapters were incoherent; but rather thoughts mid-paragraph changed subjects and questions raised were not answer.Arguments:Its noted that Hick calls these arguments \\"theories\\" and \\"hypotheses.\\" However, if we are going to at all take him seriously, its necessary to examine these beliefs as if he does, in fact, believe them.(1) The unoriginal argument of religion's conditioning based upon geographical status, socio-economic status, etc. is deeply flawed and I thought Hick would have offered a more rigorous support for this claim than he did in his book. For example, to say that a person is a Christian because he/she was born in the West and that if that individual were born in, say, Morocco, he/she would have been Muslim is a principle that goes for the pluralist as well, if we are at all to take this argument seriously. That is, if the pluralist were born in Morocco, he/she would also most likely be Muslim. This argument doesn't work--in this simplistic form that Hick offered at least (pg. 74).(2) Hick makes that argument that religious experience is one that reveals a part of Reality's (the transcendent force that some call God, or gods) character. Now, he does manage to defend his position in saying that where religions differ in religious experience is simply an \\"image\\" of seeing Reality; thus, the more perspectives of religious experience we have, the more complete picture of Reality we have. He also manages to state that the conflicting points among religions only seem to be conflicting. In reality, they do not reflect contradictions of religious experience per se because they are religious experiences on different levels. However, then, my question is how, with Hick's pluralism, one is able to confront the issue of religious experience that communicates to the individual the invalidity, falsity, and heresy of another person's religious experience (I Kings 18:20-40). I believe that instances such as these, which can be found in the teachings of many religions, discount Hick's argument--or at least suspend it until his theory is further developed.ThoughtsFor brevity's sake, I will conclude by saying that if Hick's thoughts (that Jesus was a metaphorical figure which was only used by ancient philosophy and religion to lead us to the transcendent Reality) reflects his own heart, Hick is not a Christian by the Bible's standards (Ex. 32; Is. 2:6,8; Jer. 51; Luke 24:36-39; John 3:16; John 14:6; Rom. 3:26; Rom. 8:29; I Cor. 8:6; I Tim. 2:5; I John 2:23; II John 9)."},{"Title":"God Has Many Names","review":"If you're looking for a book that likes to bash orthodox Christianity, rejects the historical person of Jesus Christ (the God-man), and advocates the view that God can be some impersonal entity then this book is for you. It is obvious that Hick has an agenda in this book: orthodox Christianity is not helping the cause for the creation of a Marxist-Leninist utopian world, thus, needs to be deconstructed to something that doesn't resemble Christianity at all. His main argument is that people of various religions experience the same \\"God\\" but do so differently because of their social, cultural, and geographical environment. Thus, YHWH is basically the same person (or entity, according to Hick) as let's say the Norse god Odin experienced differently. If this is not blasphemy, I don't know what is. He, thus, thinks that a Christian can work together in harmony with an Odinist, Hercules worshipper, Shintoist, Baalist, animist, etc. for the creation of a Marxist-Leninist paradise on earth. Hick is one guy who is angry at orthodox Christianity and wants to do something about it. It is obvious he is not working within the Christian paradigm but against it. In fact, he rarely quotes from Scripture to back up his points - which is no surprise, since Scripture does not support his outrageous claims. Jesus told his disciples in John 14:6 that he is \\"the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me\\" (NIV). Since Jesus said this, I can only believe that his words are true. If you are looking for good books on religious pluralism from an orthodox Christian perspective I suggest you get James R. Edwards' \\"Is Jesus the Only Savior?\\" and Ronald H. Nash's book with the exact same title. These books will surely demonstrate to you that soteriological pluralism is full of untruth."},{"Title":"The Evolving Human","review":"THE EVOLVING HUMAN is a fascinating account of Penny Kelly's kundalini awakening in 1979. I love the way Kelly shares the full breadth and depth of her highly personal experience, and the way she describes the many varied effects of kundalini (such as heightened sensory and extra-sensory awareness). In sequential fashion, Kelly tells the story of how she first entered the realm of &quot;I AM&quot; knowingness, and how she gradually began to feel and appreciate the way her kundalini experience sensitized her to the world. Little by little, Kelly found herself learning to use the great power and wisdom conferred by kundalini, even as her rational mind continued to search for answers and a deep understanding of what had happened to her. In addition to providing a personal record of kundalini awakening, THE EVOLVING HUMAN also has a series of appendixes which provide a description of the stages of human spiritual evolution, and some useful pointers for analyzing dreams, and improving one's telepathic skills.In one of the most fascinating parts of this book, Kelly describes how she lived through a period of time in which she felt herself living out two future paths along with her normal day-to-day life. One was much &quot;safer&quot; yet ultimately less satisfying, while the other was more true to living up to her full spiritual potential. She chose the path of fulfilling her potential, and I am certain that the world is a much better place for it! Kelly now lives at Lily Hill Farm in Michigan, where she teaches classes about developing intuition as she works in the gardens, barns, and kitchens. THE EVOLVING HUMAN began as a series of hand-outs for these classes, and due to popular demand grew into this beautiful book.My kundalini awakening took place in 1994, and many things Kelly describes in THE EVOLVING HUMAN remind me of experiences I've lived through. How wonderful it is to have this book at one's side, as reassurance that kundalini is a normal part of the process of human spiritual evolution. I give this book my highest recommendation for anyone who wishes to better understand how the kundalini experience transforms one's life."},{"Title":"The Evolving Human","review":"I really loved this book. It had two parts, basically.The first part was the story of Penny's kundalini awakening and the unravelling of her familiar routines as her psychic powers made it more difficult to handle day-to-day life.

The second part of the book she shares practical information we can use to navigate our lives with our own awakening consciousness. We can stay painfully rooted in old ways or we can evolve into a vaster, more compassionate and capable human.

I personnally like it when someone is able to link spiritual experience to scientific knowledge (the author is an engineer by background)- the author also did a great job in researching the kundalini experience among Christian mystics and what kind of terminology they use for it.- Then of course is the detailed descriptions of her varying experiences with kundalini and emerging super-natural abilities and the challenges they posed.Now what I didn't like:- The author describes her experiences along with her life-story and for me it was excruciating to read how dysfunctionally she behaves in her relationships and particularly towards her children. Lets summarize it like this: intellectual arrogance combined with exceedingly low emotional intelligence. Sorry, if that sounds harsh but I could hardly stomach it.- What's more - even after living with kundalini for many years and developing many supernatural powers she still mostly wishes to get rid of it. Many times I wanted to shake her and shout,'don't you realize you won the jack-pot?!?

Both are trying to overcome deep rootedissues and bargain with matters of the heart. A wondeful storyabout refocusing on what is really important in a marriage.Reviewed by aNN Brown"},{"Title":"Bargain Of The Heart (Arabesque)","review":"This is the story of a couple who are on the brink of a divorce. Crystal, a burnt-out schoolteacher, has suffered a miscarriage 5 months ago. She has spent some time in Japan (why? we don't know) and upon her return she tells her husband Richard, an up-and-coming lawyer, that she wants a divorce immediately. Richard is stunned. He was not aware that anything was wrong. He is the \\"typical\\" workaholic husband, the career-obssessed lawyer who has taken his wife for granted. So he makes a bargain with Crystal that she will allow him to date her for three months. If after that, she wants a divorce, that is fine with him. If she refuses this deal, he will hold up the divorce for her. Since Crystal has quit teaching, this means financial hardship for her. So Crystal agrees.The couple spend the next three months dating each other. Crystal lives out in the mountains, in their cabin. She spends time with her aunt Annie who is recovering from a gunshot that broke her hip. Annie's alleged attackers are being defended by Richard (Annie's nephew by marriage) who believes the two boys innocent of this particular charge. Fortunately, that does not destroy the relationship with Annie.What I liked about this book was the details of living in a small town, and life in a southern African-American community. What was particularly interesting to me was that I did not realize until about page 20 or so that this was a romance about an African-American couple, and for most of the book (the couple's relatives aside) I could not tell who was black and who was white. It was really nice though, reading about settled African-American families with their complex interrelationships, as opposed to the virtual absence of African-Americans (and other minority groups) from mainstream romance. And yup, I loved the fact that Crystal came from three generations of teachers and that Richard came from at least 2 generation of civic and political leaders.There were many secondary characters with their own stories. There was Crystal's aunt Annie and her budding romance with a local farmer Travis. There was Richard's parents and their apparently political marriage of convenience. Dare I say that I liked the fact that his mother (although critical of Crystal privately to Richard) treated Crystal decently? She was a complex person in her own right, with her own hopes, fears and dreams. By the end, I understood why she put all her eggs in one basket (all her hopes in Richard).Although the minor characters - Sadie, Abel etc - were occasionally distracting (with a running feud between Sadie and Abel in particular), they did add a lot of color and depth to the story. Literacy was a very strong theme here, because Crystal is asked to carry on her aunt's literacy education efforts locally. She ends up teaching a group of adults in their later years how to read. And Richard and his mother are completely supportive here. [Nice change].I did find the mystery part a bit underdone (and the ending was rather abrupt). The mystery of who shot Annie was cleared, but not why. The villain got off too easily IMHO. And I suspected at least halfway through one of the possible suspects, if not the exact motive. But the mystery of the brakes was never solved. Nor was the issue of the fire (accident? arson?). That was the only major detraction from this book."},{"Title":"Bargain Of The Heart (Arabesque)","review":"The book was in very good condition for the price ($0.01) I paid for it. I would highly recommend this seller."},{"Title":"Folktales of the Irish countryside","review":"This author has gathered Irish tales from current oral sources and translated them for us into English. These come from his family and acquaintances, and cover a range of story content and styles.We see here the rich and ancient Celtic worldview of a dynamic reality vested with spiritual and non-human entities that interact with humans. Here we find spirits of the dead who are among us until they have finished some business, often requiring interaction or approval from a living person. We learn of fairy folk and magical people.Dynamic StoryOne common characteristic of folktales everywhere is the lack of simple detail that would bog a story down. No unessential information is included. To the scientific and linear logical mind, we see many details left unexamined, why did they do this, why didn't they just do this, why would it happen this way, etc. The oral-relational story focuses on the action, the inter-relationship, the relational progress to the goal.Nothing happens but what will enable the story to happen! Real-world dynamics are not in focus. This is one problem with moderns reading \\"traditional\\" stories. They reflect a different worldview. These are similar to other North European tales in the Germanic cultures, many Americans are familiar with.Layers of LoreDanaher points out some of the Germanic elements that show up in some of these Irish tales. Some of the tales resemble tales reported in other folktale collections. Danaher points out areas of similarities or differences that may indicate some relationship with earlier Germanic tales that entered in to the Irish Celtic oral lore over the centuries.Many of these Germanic stories, in fact, seem to have roots in even older Celtic stories of the Celtic tribes absorbed by some of the Germanic peoples in early history. Some of the tales here or similar ones have been catalogued by world folktale specialists. He points out that some of these may have been borrowed in recent times from written sources.Oral Germanic SourcesIt also seems to me that Danaher has overlooked a likely ancient oral source for some of these tales. He does not seem aware of the fact that a great source of such Germanic tales, now Celticized in Ireland, derive from Germanic settlement groups in Ireland itself. We know that many Norse (Viking) groups raided and settled in Ireland, especially the north and west in the Middle Ages.Likewise, the Anglo-Normans lords brought much of their original German lore with them when they conquered the British Isles, including Ireland. These Anglo-Irish lords were captivated by the Irish culture, becoming more and more Irish over the centuries until they blended with the local people. Their Germanic concepts of the spirit world likely contributed to their new Irish worldview.Oral EntertainmentThese are entertaining stories, recovering a not-too-distant past where the oral world of imagination was an important part of the normal culture. This oral value is pointed up in the first story, about a young many who has no story, and how a mentor arranges for him to have a personal adventure that will make a good story!Story-telling is a high value in all oral-relational cultures. Our recent focus on literacy has changed the way modern society thinks and organizes its sense of reality. These Irish tales are a pleasant reminder of our dynamic imaginative heritage that sees reality as an open universe, to be explored and experienced.Dynamic WorldviewThis provides a high adventure compared to the often pedantic and dull confines of a deterministic scientism that tells us all is determined forever and simple facts related to cause and effect are all we have to discover.Here we see strange and likely imaginary realities. Many of these stories are obviously only in fun, but revel a sense of wonder and dynamism in the human interaction with our world!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I came to Florida from Tennessee in 1968, the very year that \\"A Land Remembered\\" ends. And yet upon reading it, I have been blessed enough to encounter enough of the \\"old folks,\\" to see the vast lands stretching out west of Melbourne, the old-timey ways, and so forth, to know that it all rings utterly true, and that all of these things arose organically from all of those things that came before.Written in rough-hewn elegance, with lots of dialogue, some genuinely funny places, and a big dose of \\"rural-ity\\" that is found, perhaps, in all southern rurals, this book touches deep places in those of us who have been here for over 40 years. Just as Sol MacIvey witnesses a drastic change to Florida during his life, I can say that even since 1968 I've seen dramatic changes--sandy dunes and sea walls transformed to upscale subdivisions, rough palmetto land transformed to apartments, miles of riding alongside the Atlantic (where you could just park the car alongside the empty highway and run down to the beach) now cluttered with houses and condos, leaving only a few designated places to access the beach.If the MacIveys witnessed and wrote the first part of Florida's American history, then surely I have seen the second part...and my son will see the third part. Especially disheartening is the well-intentioned draining of the Everglades. While allowing us to grow vegetables and create subdivisions, it stole something precious.As Zech MacIvey noted the animals freely sharing a waterhole, I hope that I am made to better realize that I am not just connected to the modern world, but to the wild world, as well. When I \\"hog\\" the water, that means other animals aren't getting it.One look at Tampa, Florida, which used to be a place that married the wild and the modern pretty well, and we see that the unrelenting growth, the willingness to build, build, build anywhere and everywhere, has stolen that \\"Wild West Florida\\" atmosphere, even from some of the county's more remote areas.My point in all this rambling is to say this: WE ARE STILL LOSING FLORIDA. When is enough enough? When will we have enough people here? When will we insist that no more new houses be built except on preexisting properties. What we have is nothing like that portrayed in \\"A Land Remembered,\\" but it is still precious--all the more so because there is so little left of what makes Florida truly special.If I have any criticism of the book, it is that I would have wanted it to end on a slightly more optimistic note, or perhaps with Sol MacIvey simply lost in his memories, and not with the dark foot of \\"progress\\" squashing the life out of the wild. But in any case, it ends well, makes it's point, and is an epic story of it all.How do you know a book is good? When you don't want it to end. I didn't. And in a real manner of speaking, the story is not yet all written about what is to become of my beloved Florida. I hope that the latter chapters find us reclaiming some of our past."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book made me proud to be a native Floridian.

Once I started reading, however, the tale of the MacIvey clan did keep my interest and kept me turning the pages. (Yes, I did read them too.) Smith essentially tells the story as a flashback, setting up the reader for the long haul to find out exactly why the action in the opening pages has come about. Clever ploy (if hardly original), and it works well here.The problems of the book are, alas, significant. Smith uses a lot of dialogue, but his characters sound more like the author's parrots than real flesh-and-blood. People just don't talk this way, not even in the 19th century. (Compare this with, for example, Charles Portis's \\"True Grit.\\") The characters are essentially stereotypes, and the main figures are simply flawless salt of the earth. The original MacIvey family, white southern \\"crackers\\" of the late 1800s, apparently has not a prejudiced bone among them when it comes to blacks and Seminoles -- not bloody likely. The book also includes some amateurish editing mistakes.Smith concentrates his story mainly on the years in which south Florida's cattle industry was developing, from the 1860s through the 1890s. From that point on, the story of the MacIvey clan grows increasingly episodic and hits only a few predictable high points of 20th-century Florida history -- e.g., the 1920s land boom and the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane disaster (the latter described much more memorably in Zora Neale Hurston's \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\"). Smith seems to want to celebrate the pioneering spirit of the free-ranging Florida cattlemen of the 1800s while decrying what later generations did in despoiling the state's environment. However romantic the 19th-century cattlemen may appear to some people, I find it hard to think that they were any less responsible for the ultimate ruination of south Florida than the lumbermen, \\"Big Sugar,\\" or the coastal real estate industry in the 20th century.For all its flaws, however, anyone wanting an introduction to this era of Florida's history would probably find \\"A Land Remembered\\" a fast and relatively painless read. Smith has some good stories to tell. Based on this book, it's too bad he's not more painstaking and imaginative when it comes to the characters that populate those stories."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"He really brought home what life was life in early Florida. The writing style was a bit unusual, but his characters were real, and the story fascinating. It's a don't miss read."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Book was delivered in a timely manner, even though it was the Christmas season."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"For the thousands of individuals who decide to re-locate to Florida each year, Patrick Smith's \\"A Land Remembered\\" should be must read. It provides a glimpse of Florida's past and shows a state dominated by cattle ranching and orange groves. For others who have lived here all their lives, the book is a reminder of just how hard life in Florida was for early settlers. While the characters may not be the most compelling in all of literature, they are a good technique to illustrate the developments that have shaped the Florida of today and make us aware of how relatively easy we have it."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Most of the reviews of this book indicate this is one of the best books that the reader have ever read and good history to boot. I started reading this with expectations that were way too high. This is not a well written book and it appears that very little if any research was done to ensure the historical accuracy. I'm appalled that this book would be used in either a history or English class.It appears that the author wrote a book of poor struggling crackers (starting in 1858) and imbued them with the sensibilities of white middle class southerners of the mid 1950s."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Being a native Floridian, I loved learning about the early times of this state. I was born in Miami in 1940. A mere 15 years later than the books end. This book is a must read for anyone who loves this state..!! Mr. Smith captures the strength and endurance needed to settle in this once harsh environment. I couldn't put it down and is more suspenseful than fictional novels. I loved it."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book was chosen as a community read here in Venice, Florida. It is well written and gives a great sense of what this Florida was like many years ago. The strength of those who settled here was tremendous. The book depicts that strength and all that such lives encompass."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"i thank my in-laws highly for insisting i read this book. I just couldn't put it down. It's an absolute page-turner. A masterpiece. I hope a movie is in the works one day."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Being a 4th generation floridian, I found this book fascinating, and captivating. Most people coming to florida have no idea of floridas rich and wild history. Patrick Smith brings this out in vivid detail. When the west was won, Florida was not close to being tamed. Those of us who live here reconize the places in the story which adds to the reality of the book."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"As a life-long resident of Ft. Pierce, I enjoyed this book because of its historical perspective. Where Florida came from, and where it appears to be going are accurately presented, and following the generations of the family through the years makes it all very entertaining. This is the book I send to friends from the north when they seem to have a &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; view of Florida. I have also enjoyed Mr. Smith's other books."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I grew up in Florida but have lived out-of-state for several years. This book made me pine for my home state. I remember big sprawling cattle ranches like the book described. My dad used to take me hunting on some property he owned with several men. The palmettos, boar, gators, deer, armadillos were common place. Like the setting of A Land Remembered. Every time I go back to visit I see another piece of &quot;old Florida&quot; being swallowed up by developments, malls and sprawl. This book was so enlightening too. I never thought about how the early Florida settlers lived. This book also reminded me of The Yearling. I have bought several as gifts for my Florida friends."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"You will be glued to this book's amazing story. You will learn about life in Florida for Indians then the coming of white settlers, the civil war, the land rushes, the wilderness and the incredible hardships of early Florida life. Once you read it, you will probably immediately read it again."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A definite read for anyone interested in old-school Florida. Day in and day out Florida's history is being swept away by country clubs and amusement parks. This book will open a new page for some and bring back childhood memories for others. I grew up the child of swamp crackers but if not for the book I would have long since forgotten my own heritage. I would also have to agree with one of the preface writers in that Patrick Smith posseses the ability to disappear and let the story tell it self."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A Land Remembered is a fascinating book. It should be a requirement in our schools here in Florida. Not only does it have some history to it, it has a wonderful story to it."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I did enjoy this book. I like to read about history and this one tells a lot about Florida that I didn't know. I would recommend it."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Multiple generations of the MacIvey family survive in the hardships of living deep in the backwoods of Florida to become multimillionaire land owners."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"As a native Floridian, I was extremely interested in this story. The hardships that these pioneers endured were incredible. Such spirit and willingness to work! Highly recommend this to all readers who like historical fiction."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Though it was a bit slow getting into once you realize this story is taking place in towns and cities you call home, the book becomes a fascinating narrative of what Florida's humble beginnings were like. Having been born and raised outside Tampa, this book really opened my eyes to the history of where I live."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Patrick D. Smith here tells the story of three generations of the MacIveys, a Florida family who battle the hardships of the frontier to rise from a dirt-poor Cracker life to the wealth and standing of real estate tycoons"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Great story told very well.

She loved her Christmas gift. We both like Patrick Smith. Thanks again."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This is a well written historical novel that is also well researched. The story is fast paced and compelling. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an interesting story spanning three generations of pioneers."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Not really a history of Florida - but a great story of the roots of an american family pre-civil war and continuing into the mid- 20th century. Fascinating saga of the true pioneer spirit -- worth reading."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I have read this book 3 times and will read it again I am sure. After reading this book, as I travel through Florida, I see it with new eyes, imagining the way the land might have looked and the people who might have lived here. It is a very readable book, describing life throughout the settlement of Florida through more modern times. The story tells of a family through generations and the struggles and joys they encountered as they learned to survive through unimaginable hardships and the joys and life lessons they experienced. Whether you have ever been to Florida or not, this is a GREAT book."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I first read this book several years ago and loved it. Then it started to go around to my girlfriends. Somewhere it got lost and I could not find another copy. When I saw it for sale on Amazon, I decided to purchase a hardbound version and two paperbacks. This way I will always have a back-up. Since I live in NE Florida, rereading this wonderful novel, I understand much more about my home and it's beginnings. Thank-you.

It is an interesting story following the life of a pioneer family. The way it is written makes you feel like you are right there with them. I felt the hardships that they endured in the story. I am a Floridian but you don't have to be to enjoy this book about old Florida. The cities mentioned in the book really existed - I looked them up in an atlas."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"By the time I read this book I had been working for the National Park Service in Canaveral Seashore for a year. What I felt lacking in my knowledge about central Florida of the mid 1800's to the present was answered in the sweep of the story of the McIvey's and their fictional footprint on the savannahs and hammocks of Florida. The book used the templete of known happenings, areas, weather, flora and fauna to give a three dimensionality to this pivotal era and helped me bring alive Florida to the visitors to our lovely park. The book is a JEWEL and should be a MUST READ for anyone who loves history."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This is an enjoyable three generational saga of a pioneer family who comes from Georgia to settle in Florida during the Civil War.The McIvey family, Tobias and Emma McIvey and their young son Zech leave war torn Georgia for the Kissimme plains and start out as squatters on a small tract of land which their son and grandson later turn into an empire.This a story of survival and then later a story of the land being overrun by real estate developers, the railroad and \\"progress\\".Some readers have stated that they found the characters to be stereotypical but I enjoyed all the characters and mourned their passings.If you like to read about the settling of the United States and particurlarly that of Florida, then this is an exceptionally good historical story about the early days of Florida."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"\\"A Land Remembered\\" is a truly excellent book.

A trip worth taking indeed."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Having been lucky enough to be born in the area and loved it,this book brings back to lot of memories,its still exciting to go out into the swamp these days,just too many people and progress,My grandfather told us when we were very young to enjoy it while we had it,he had lived the changing times in Florida and did not like it very well.This book would make a great movie."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book was recommended to me by more than one friend.

I am anxious to read more about the history of Florida!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Well written with a few errors. Model T Ford had to be hand cranked, a person could not get in and start it. Spanish-American war covered in chapter dated 1905--seven years after the war. Very interesting from a native Floridian's point of view. Characters come through well. First chapter could have been a short prologue."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I first read this book at a friends house while on vacation. It was my friends book, and she told me how much she had enjoyed it. As I was reading, I laughed, and she asked what was happening, so I read that portion. She was doing a jigsaw puzzel, and asked me to keep reading. The men had been working on a major project,so when they came in for a break, they heard me reading. They sat and listened also. They asked questions about the beginning. So I started reading from the beginning to all three of them. When the men went back out to work, my friend wanted me to read to her where we had left off. Of course I wanted to read where the book for myself, so I read on my own when I could. In all I read the book 2 1/2 times in a week.I came home and read his other books, but \\"A Land Remembered\\" was my favorite. I told several friends about it. As you can see I ordered the book for myself. In reading it again, I realized that It was almost like reading it for the first time. It is so full and power packed, you can't put it down.

There is much more to see and know than just the tourist traps! Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This is an excellent book. We're not sure if it's such a page turner because we're from Florida or because it's exciting and informative and interesting but either way, every single person we've turned on to it has liked it."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This was one of my bedtime books, it keep me up until the wee hours of the morning for several nights. It was such a great read. From the start of modern South Florida with McIvey to the step into old Florida with his family starting new, this book is as close as it gets to real life in the old south and drives the stake home on how we have forever changed the face of Florida. During my genealogy research one of my relatives suggested that I should read it and WOW what a surprise. I could not read a page without comparing the lives we live today with how they lived back then."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A FABULOUS STORY THAT IS LARGELY BASED ON FACT ABOUT AMERICA'S LAST FRONTIER: FLORIDA.

IT SPANS 150 YEARS OF FLORIDA HISTORY FROM THE CIVIL WAR THROUGH TO THE PRESENT COVERING SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF A FAMILY THAT WAS INVOLVED IN SHAPING THE STATE'S HISTORY FROM CATTLE RANCHING THROUGH TO REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I read this book and totally loved it. Being a Florida native, I enjoyed the references to Florida landmarks that I have grown up knowing. I was unable to put it down and suggested that my 13 year old son read it over the summer. However x-box and computer games seemed more interesting to him. Now that he is in 8th grade, his very first assignment is to read this book. He now can't put it down either. I smile when I see him reading without being told to do so. Patrick Smith captured the real Florida and captured my heart as a real fan. If you ever want to visit a real Florida Cracker Farm, go to www.Morningsidefarm.com in Gainesville Florida. The location of this farm is not too far from the original hammock that the MacIveys lived on in Chapter One."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Patrick Smith is one of our best writers and this is the very best of his excellent novels. He captures a place and time mostly overlooked by historical fiction - the open range cattle days of Florida. You don't have to be a native Floridian with a background, decades ago, of messing with cattle to enjoy this story, but it sure makes this story ring true! If you love Florida, cattle, outdoor adventure or just first rate fiction, this book is for you. I don't know how Patrick Smith has flown beneath the radar of so many readers across the nation. He ranks with the very, very best."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A Land Remembered is an amazing book that tells the story of three generations of the MacIvey family. The novel takes place in Central Florida, starting before the Civil War. The first generation arrives in Central Florida with literally nothing but their determination, desperation and their love for each other.Patrick Smith paints a clear and detailed picture of the endurance and sacrifice made by a young couple in order to even just barely get by. The stark reality he portray is extremely vivid.The hardships that are experienced by the different generations range from natures fury in fires, ice storms, insect swarms covering miles and miles of the grasslands, hurricanes to the emotional hardships of sacrifice, lost love, doubt and loneliness. The MacIvey family looses their footing in several business ventures through the natural disasters and also through the greed of others. The one thing they never loose is their love and caring and determination to take care of their family and to see each other through the difficult times that they are faced with. Each generation must come to terms with what is is truely important in their lives and the simple values that the family began with always seem to come clearly into focus.The visions of Florida as a raw, unsettled land that tolerates but never encourages those daring enough to challenge her have a unique clarity to them.Through everything that occurs, this wonderful family pulls together, creating a history that Patrick Smith has crafted into an unforgettable novel."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Patrick Smith gives the reader an opportunity to glimpse at Florida from 1848 to 1970 through the eyes of the MacIvey family members over three generations. It is an enthralling book, if you're interested in the state of Florida from before Civil War times through present day era. I have read this book four times and am very much a fan of this author. In fact, I have met this studious writer of history, twice. Step back in time and read about Florida in its days of infancy. Enjoy reading about a family that survived in spite of rough times, the elements, outlaws, and animal predators. I have read this to my class and they beg you to keep going! They enjoyed it tremendously! If you do read it, I'm sure you will be captivated by its great story and the personnae of its characters."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"As a history professor, I've found numerous people have used A Land Remembered as their introduction to Florida history. I finally gave in and read it myself and can see why this is the case.Patrick Smith compellingly recreates an aspect of Florida history that predates Disney, NASCAR racing, tourism and \\"God's waiting room.\\" He takes the reader on a three-generation journey through Florida history from the Civil War to the 1960s. Told through the experiences of the MacIvey family, it recounts the family's rise from hardscrabble poverty to wealth and influence.At the same time, we see the evolution of Florida to the state it is today, and laments over its change, a \\"land remembered.\\" Along the way the reader will encounter the formative events of Florida history from the Civil War onward.Smith's portrayal of Florida's cattle raising history should enlighten many readers of a little known and often neglected part of Florida's history.The book may be flawed in some of its literary aspects, but for accessible history it has few peers."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I've read this book MANY times...starting 13 years ago when I was in the 11th grade! Our teacher had Patrick Smith come to our school and we got to meet and talk to him about his book. Let's just say that this book had such an impact on me that when I became an English teacher I had my students read it! Every student in my class fell in love with it and couldn't put it down. Even students who proudly declared, \\"I've never read a book in my life,\\" devoured it. It is easy to read but has such a deep meaning for Floridians.The MacIveys are amazing...the way they dealt with life in the wilderness is so fun to read about. This book has something for everyone...romance, friendship, war, history, you name it. It portrays a pretty accurate picture of how Florida developed over the years. I highly recommend it for anyone from Florida or anyone wanting to study Florida history. It is one of my most treasured novels that I could read over and over again."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Patrick Smith's biography must be wrong; he was surely born in Florida. I enjoyed A Time Remembered more than any other book I have read. While its down-to-earth characters and smoothly flowing action make it enjoyable to anyone, the book is especially endearing to me and my cracker family. I am currently reading it to my grandfather, born 84 years ago in Kissimmee (one of the towns featured in the book). As we read, we stop constantly for him to comment on the places and activities of the characters or just to reminisce. According to my expert, Smith's characters and settings are entirely authentic. Each hurdle the characters surmount is true to my grandfather's memory. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to know more about Florida than just sand and beaches. Those of us who know the real meaning of a cracker will especially appreciate Smith's work."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This is a great book. It chronicles three generations of the MacIvey family, beginning with Tobias MacIvey's arrival in Florida in 1858 and ending with Solomon MacIvey's realization in 1968 that much of the original Florida is gone. In that time span, the MacIveys suffer through tragedy and bask in success, as the family rises from poverty to great wealth. The book's strongest characteristic is Patrick Smith's ability to describe the Florida that was - the Florida before developers and retirees and rockets and theme parks. I'm not certain that the Florida pictured so well by Patrick Smith exists anywhere in today's Florida, but it makes wonderful reading."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Even though this book is fiction, you will wish it were true, so that you could meet the decendents of this family. Having researched Florida history it runs so close that it could be storys passed down through the generations. It follows a family through three generations, how they scatched a poor earning in Florida's diverse landscape from swamps to scrub lands, and palmetto flatwoods. It is proof there were cowboys in Florida long before cattle grazed in Texas, and how the pioneering families survived long before Disney's grandfather was even born. This book is well written and I would recommend it for teens and adults alike.Read it, you will soon be reading Mr. Smiths other books!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I'm a student in 9th Grade at a high school in Miami, Florida, and we were told to read A Land Remembered. At first, I was thinking &quot;a book about Florida in the 1800's, who wants to read this!&quot;. I was totally surprised of how good this book was once I started reading it! It's about a fictional family, the MacIvey's, that are struggling to survive in early Florida. The story is filled with passion, love, suspense, it has some poignant sections, and it has a dash of humor one in a while. I recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained and at the same time wants to learn about the history of Florida. You won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"So you've been to Disney and the beaches and you think you know Florida? This will open your eyes and your mind to the \\"real\\" Florida, before theme parks, beach motels, air conditioning and cheap souvenirs. An amazing first-class chronicle of Florida's land, people, wildlife and wild places. Unforgettable, well-written story of a Florida family and the one of a kind beauty of Florida's natural habitat."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I've never in my life liked reading books. Of course it's the same with every student. Just the fact that I had to read books over the summer for my Sophomore year was enough to make me a little irritated. Then I saw the size of A Land Remembered and thought &quot;Oh this can't be good.&quot; After the first couple of chapters, however, I was hooked. This story is so deep it makes you want to keep reading. It's amazing to think of how hard life in Florida was before all of the technology. (Especially since I live in Florida)Overall, this book is great.

The independent MacIvey family flee Georgia during the Civil War...wanting no part of the madness that was the \\"War between the States.\\" These were hardy, common sense, no time for whining, illiterate folk who faced physical hardships and formed close, simple, and unbreakable bonds with those they lived and worked with. Concurrent lives of the Seminole Indians living on the fringes of the Everglades and white man's society are woven into the plot and, represent Florida before the white man-- in all it's harshness and beauty. The story ends during the late 1960's when Miami is about to become one huge megagopolis swallowing up \\"The Land Remembered\\" but not forgotten"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Excellent book about early Florida history and the peole who settled north and central Florida.

It is well written, humours at times and dipicts Florida history and provides a glimps at the dlifficulties the early settlers encountered."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Florida is (or was) so much more than beaches, theme parks, retirees and strip malls. Gripping account of the early days; the Native-Americans, palmetto, cows and horses, wild boars and real estate available for a song. Not a happy story, but well worth reading. Great characters; could use more development and description. Family dynasties are fragile, and it is sad to think of one like this fading away."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"it was a great story and i would recommend it to all.

The focus of the story is on three generations of the men in the family as they adapted to the land that is Florida."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in awhile....not that I read too many books but I cant imagine anyone not being pulled into thisdetailed story of old Florida.

I just finished reading this old friend again and as always..I cried all the way through it."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A Land Remembered should be a must read for every Florida High School student. Patrick D. Smith did a fantastic job of painting a description of his characters, their emotions, and historical events in their lives, and I felt like I was right there with the main characters experiencing what they were experiencing! From the food they ate to the clothes they wore, to the emotions they felt, his portrayal of early Florida was a wonderful page turning experience for me. Several of the characters in A Land Remembered actually reminded me of some of my, late family members. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and have shared my copy with several relatives and friends and continue to tell others about it."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Historical view of old Florida and the extreme hardships and endurance that people went through every day in a not so tropical paradise at the time.No wonder you never saw people smiling in old photographs..their lives were very grim and exhausting from just trying to survive the harsh elements and find food every day to eat.Life almost seemed like a form of everyday punishment. A must read for every child/adult 12 and up.How good & easy we have it now ,should make any reader most thankful for our trail blazing forefathers."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book was written in a great style that made you feel close to the characters.

It's the kind of story you just can't stop reading. My goodness! What those people went through. It truly makes me appreciate the quality of life we have today vs. yesterday but at the same time, you long to know what it must have been like back then - - A Land Remembered takes you there. We've laughed, we've cried and we've grown to love the MacIveys as if they were kinfolk. It has truly enriched our lives and given us a new appreciation for the settlers who came before us."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I read anything and everything that hits the shelves. History is one of my favorites. One out of every 100 books that I read make me want more and this is one. Awesome book, great history facts within the story and a truly delightful story it was.

Although I was born and raised in Florida, it's history never interested me. This book's endearing characters and depiction of life in undeveloped Florida drew me in and absorbed me! It is now my favorite book. I look forward to reading more Patrick Smith and learning more about Florida's past. Do not overlook this touching story!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A Land Remembered by Patrick D. SmithOh, how lucky you will be to read, and live with the MacIveys through so many years of their lives. But you will do it while in a comfortable setting, which most likely has air conditioning or heat, and where you can run to the kitchen for food and drink. Not so with this new family, and all who crossed their life's paths.This book takes you through decades of one couple's life, and of those who would also carry their name of MacIvey. Living in, and traveling through various spots around South Florida, when not many people did live among the scrub, prairies, or marshes. And what few settlements there were, were much less than we can imagine them to have been.Smith gives lessons in the actual Florida cities, and areas of land. And places the story in the happenings of Florida as it was at the time. Not in long detailed descriptions, but by the simple facts and truths, which were happening as they lived daily.The idea of &quot;less&quot; is repeated over and over until you realize how little it takes to live, or to do more than exist in this hard new land. You can feel, that how we all think to live today, is so very different than the ways, needs, and wants of the past.Do read on and take the various adventures of living next to this family. Suffer the hardships, work along with them to find a way of just living through the days. Venture with them as they herd Long Horn cattle across the state. Find out what true wealth is all about for them. Experience tens of thousands of dollars, and also the simplicity of owning a new pair of britches, an apple, a colored ribbon. Learn of character verses possessions.I have lived in South Florida since 1956. Many of the places and experiences of Florida, which were written of, I have been to, and heard about. That is real. Smith writes of possible real lives, which were so believable in this continuously flowing story. In only hours of smooth reading, I lived and worked right along with them. How fortunate to be able to experience such wonderful lifetimes.You too can experience this family, and the lands of South Florida, that Smith has written for all of us to share, in &quot;A Land to Remember.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I read previous reviews and was a mite skeptical...no reason to be.

Have bought at least 6 copies for friends and family. A wonderful &quot;make you feel good book.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I read this book in two nights, you can't put it down. Patrick Smith has written a book that captures your dreams for many nights to come and proves that the only good stories are found in books!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This Book will keep you away from the everyday temptation to rot your brain out by the black box in your house called a television. You will be transported back to a time in Florida's History from the mid 1800's thru the middle of this century. You will take part in a family's struggle to make it in this harsh land before air-conditioning and mosquito control. You will stand in awe, laugh and cry with this family thru three generations of an inspiring journey. You will not put this book down all night and when done you will say one word, &quot;WOW!&quot"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Knowing this book won several awards and is well thought of in Florida, I was surprised at my disappointment after reading it. I think it's an old fashioned book for today's reader. The main characters seem a little too fiction-perfect (except for Sol, of course, and he takes a while to be questionable). They are all decent to all blacks and Seminoles (and you know that wasn't the mainstream experience). They are even decent to drunks. The hard-working women who support their men die tragic deaths at young ages. One fellow has a white wife and child and a Seminole \\"wife\\" and child, but that's all right with the Seminole lady because he's such a decent chap, and later it's all right with the white child, too. In spite of all these contrivances, I think I did learn something about the importance of cattle to the history of Florida."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"If you're interested in Old Florida and you want a book that's both pretty historically accurate (and equally informative) as well as compelling and engrossing than you've found the right book. Unlike other accounts of Old Florida, this book is both a history lesson and a novel and that's what makes it special. You read this as if you were reading any other magical tale, wrapped up in the characters - their lives, their decisions everything. It describes in such amazing detail and accuracy what life was like for 3 generations of crackers and I literally feel like I know Tobias, Zech and Sol. EVERYTHING about this book stunned me and I loved it - its like taking a journey.But I must warn you, its a painful and absorbing read too. Sad and tragic at times, I actually found myself moved at the misfortune some of the characters faced and some of the deaths left me reeling because I could no longer believe that person was \\"gone\\". Speaking of gone, its also amazing at how he describes all that there was down here, so much wilderness and now we see what we have done to all that. Funny thing is, since the book starts and ends in 1968 (the last cracker) we also see through their eyes how they reacted to Florida dramatic changes in the span of only 100 years.A MUST READ IF YOU WANT AN AMAZING NOVEL ABOUT FAMILIES CARVING OUT LIFE IN A LOST BUT NOT FORGOTTEN FLORIDA!!!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A must reading for all living in FL to appreciate what it was like before A/C , running water etc."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"As a Realtor, I give this book to people who move to Florida. Love the story about the early days of the state."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I read this book while camping near Lake Okeechobee and it proved a perfect background for our visit. The story was grand and the characters nicely developed. What I found most interesting was the underlying evolution of attitudes about the land as the generations progressed. My only criticism was that the pace seemed to speed up as each generation was covered, so it felt that the story of Sol was barely told and his whole life was covered in about 30 pages while the first generation story of Tobias and Emma was most of the book. All-in-all, a great read and worthwhile for anyone interested in the history of Florida."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. You don't have to be a native Floridian to enjoy this book"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Patrick Smith keeps his reader fully engaged from the first word on. This is an action book. Smith doesn't waste our reading skills by explaining the trauma these early settlers in Florida faced. He shows us. (yes, a trite phrase we've all heard but true.) As a newcomer to Florida, a Snowbird, this book has piqued my curiosity about this wonderful land of white sand, endless sky and wide vistas. So, so very good."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This account of Florida pioneers was spellbinding. It was recommended by a history major even though it was fiction. Apparently is it a fixture in the FSU history department. Major events in Florida history are wound around a family that emigrates from Georgia. The dynasty moves on to the founders of Miami (early on, called 'Fort Dallas.'). It is a good read and yes, we cried when the characters we loved died. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This is a very enjoyable novel presented as a factual historical piece. The drovers are real and the situations are mostly real. The Alligators attacking the cattle like African crocs attacking impalas at the river crossing is exciting and it makes good reading but reality is something else. I especially enjoyed the historical tracking of the drovers to market and zig zagging across Florida in their cattle drives. The places are real and the descriptions alone are worth the money for this book. The author obveously isn't familure with Alligators but I give poetic liscense for that because it did make good but puzzeling reading.Clean cut and clear descriptions and following a family across the old florida pathe makes this a highly desireable book for your library. I recommend it to all."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A Land Remembered is an awesome read! I haven't been this captivated by a story in a very long time, I had a very hard time putting it down the few times I unfortunately had to. I haven't read a book in this few of settings probably ever. I live in SWFL so the way Florida geography and history are tied in to this story is very fascinating. I've always loved pondering the way things used to be or used to look and this book paints a far more detailed picture of that in Florida than I could have ever day dreamed on my own. I can't wait to read it to my son, I think he will love it too."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This was recommended to me and I would have bought it for my kindle, but decided it get it in hard book. Wanted to be able to pass it along to family and friends who also live here in FL. A great Read!!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I read this for a book club and once I started I could barely put it down. Learned a lot about the history of Florida and will read more of this authors books."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I'm a fifth generation Floridian. This book made me feel as if I knew the McIvey family, it was as if I was reading about my family's past. This book shows the reader the beauty of old Florida. We should respect this lovely state and try to preserve it for the future. The author has a meaningful environmental message. I recommend it to anyone--especially Floridians..."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"You might think that Patrick D. Smith IS Sol MacIvey reincarnated in this tale of Old Florida. How else can you explain his vivid, captivating description of life in early Florida? I am a native Floridian and when I grab my cherished pictures and family mementos to evacuate for a hurricane, you can bet my copies of ALR will be with me! This book is a timeless treasure and not a one-time-read. I had read this book several times and when it became assigned reading for my daughter, we each grabbed a copy and read it 'together'. During each of the pivotal points in the lives of the MacIveys, we would make eye contact and either smile or wipe away tears. No words were exchanged because the book is filled with emotion and you really 'feel' the characters as real people with real pain and sorrow. This book should be required reading as you cross the state line into Florida. It is truly a rite of passage for Floridians and any one who loves history. We are blessed to have this account of pioneer life in wild Florida. If I could sit around a campfire and listen to stories told by anyone.....it would be Patrick D. Smith."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Normally, I can't stand historical fictions. Oft times, the historical facts are wrong, or the history is too extensive and makes the characters virtually obsolete. However, &quot;A Land Remembered&quot; is none of these things. It is the perfect balance between characters, historical accuracy, and length. The characters do not undergo extremely extensive developement, but they do change with each event they witness. There is obviously a lot of research involved in the dates of certain events and locations of rivers, swamps, etc, but it doesn't go into things like how wide a river was and how fast it ran, or approxamately how many Florida Alligators inhabited the swamps, and that's definately a plus. No points can be taken off for the plot; it was very unpredictable and fast paced. The book in itself was neither too long nor too short. I know my review has sounded much like a textbook, but that's because I can't write book reviews worth a crap. :P I think anyone interested in Florida history should read it, or if you aren't interested in Florida history, this book will make you more interested."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I am not a fiction reader first off. I was sitting next to another Florida native on a plane and we were talking about how we gre up in Florida, the real Florida, not part of the huge subdivision that has swept up most of our state. I read some of the other reviews and while I realize that everyone gets something different out of a book, I was surprised to read some of the content of negative reviews. Sure, this book isn't written for someone that is reading it to make sure it has all of the elements of a style guide for writint a book, but I thoroughly enjoyed the book and did not feel like anything was left undone.There may not be a detailed character development, but that was fine for me. I'll fall asleep half the time when someone is giving me every detail about a person or a scene. I like to use my imagination and picture a charater for myself. What this book has is content of character, not filler describing characters. I know exactly what Tobias, Emma, Frog, Bonzon, Sol, Skillet, and all of the others look like. Thay will probably be completely different for you, but to me that is what makes this book worth reading. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I think you would too."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"No high school student in Florida -- no college student with a history major -- should graduate without reading this. This 100 years covered by ALR is a forgotten era... early Spanish explorers are taught... as well as recent...WWI on... Smith fills the gap of Florida unknown history.I hate books I love so much I dread reaching the end. But with ALR, there is no end ... like all great family stories, ALR is a story you will never tire of hearing and rehearing. The end...? where you start again...I have given several copies -- and some crackers will join me on the next cracker cattle drive re-enactment...I've known the MacIvy's all my life...though too much time has been away from my Florida home... and always will know them as part of my Florida family history.Thank you Patrick Smith -- no wonder the late Florida Governor Lawton Chiles kept this book on his night stand. You can't do better."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I am a fourth generation Floridan so naturally this book appealed to me, but I had no idea just how captivating it was. The MacIvey family will make you laugh, they will make you cry, and they will make you sit up, take a deep breath, and swell with feeling. You will FEEL this book and that's as good as it gets."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I am a transplanted northerner who could see no beauty in Florida, it looked like a bunch of bugs and muck to me. That it, until I read this book. What a wonderful way to learn about the old Florida and realize why so many things in Florida are the way they are now. The characters were as developed as they needed to be. I read the book as a history class assignment and now my entire family has had the opportunity to also read the book. It is a fast paced, easy read book that my 12 year old was as impressed with as I. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the west, Florida is forgotten as a part of the &quot;pioneer&quot; spirit but this book reminds one and all that Florida played a very special part in creating a nation."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I must say, that when I was first recommended this book by stepmom, I thought that there was no way in a hundred years I would like it. After the first five pages, I was hooked. There are such vivid descriptions you almost think you are there, living what these characters went through."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"You couldn't ask for a more vivid depiction of frontier life and the struggles of a family to survive the extremes of weather, poverty, lawlessness, and desolation. You are guaranteed to laugh and cry as you ride the trail with a family of true Florida Crackers. It is written with such detail you would almost believe the story was true! Definitely one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Being a native Floridian with real \\"Crackers\\" in my family tree, I found this book mesmerizing. I didn't want to put it down. I have a greater respect and sense of awe of what the pioneers endured back then. You will not be bored with this book! I believe that the Florida schools should include this as required reading for the Florida History classes."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book was our book club selection and rated a 9.8 out of 10. It tells about the early settlement of Florida and the life-threatening challenges and that faced the settlers who tried to tame the land. It follows several generations of a family and ends with the third generatiion. Each character captures the reader with well-written and developed characters. The description of the trials and dangers leaves the reader spellbound and unable to put the book down. I loved it so well that I gave this book as Christmas presents."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"As a native resident of Florida I discovered this book in the early 90's. When I started teaching I discovered that Florida History and Geography were not getting as much attention in Elementary School I decided to use this book as a foundation to teach my students about the history and geography of Florida. I developed worksheets, a timeline, quizes and vocabulary tests among other things to inhance the study.The students got into the book and would go home and talk about it to their parents all the time. Some parents got interested and bought the book and started reading. It created a lot of discussion at their homes. I even had some grandparents of some students that read the book.I still have former students and parents ask if I am still teaching the book. One parent said her son does not read much but has read this book three times. I encountered a former student, now a senior, the other day who said it is still the best book he has ever read.I recommend this book for any teacher or anyone who is interested in the history and geography of Florida."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This may the best book ever written. The story, the characters, the history, the landscapes. This book is lacking nothing. It will keep you up late. This is a book that will entertain any person regardless of whether they like reading or not. Everyone I have spoke to that has read this book has read it more than once.(Including myself) All I can tell you is if you consider yourself a \\"reader\\" and you don't have this book, your library is like a birthday cake without the candles. It's just not complete. Anyone giving this book less than 4 stars must just hate reading no matter what the book says. This is the kind of book that turns a person that doesn't read, into an advent reader.(For me personally, that book was Man Eaters of Tsavo, but that's a different review.) It has everything. If your a man, woman, or child........ it doesn't matter, read this book."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"You cannot put this book down once you start reading! It takes you back into Florida pioneer life with each part of Florida being remembered, Kissimmee, Naples, The Everglades and Seminole Indians, The Civil War, cattle rustling days, and the will to survive without the Law to protect you. It is the personification of frontier life....the elemental struggle of man and nature."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A phenomominal book about early settlers and the start and hard work of carving out a life in the early days of Florida! This book should be in every Real Floridian's home, read and cherished . Also for anyone wanting to know the very early beginnings of our wonderful state of Florida! Beautifully written and easy and so interesting to follow with much knowledge!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"'A Land Remembered' by Patrick Smith was selected by my bookclub as their November 2011 read. I excitedly tried to load the book on my Kindle, but sadly the book is not offered for Kindle.(A study-guide review is offered for Kindle.) I was able to order the paperback version from Amazon.com. The pricing was fair and the shipping was expedient. The book proved to be a fun, quick read. It is not a 'deep' book, but offers insight into Florida's history by following a ficticious family through 3 generations. The book is well written and provides an enjoyable insight into Florida's past and the progression to present day Florida. The story gave me an appreciation for Florida's natural beauty versus the manmade 'Disney' version of today. This book was just the diversion I needed at the stressful Holiday time of year. I recommend it highly to anyone wanting a pleasant easy read."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book was recommended to me after I read Pratt's \\"Barefoot Mailman\\" series - I enjoyed the perspective of an emerging state with historical connections.

It is a very informative historical novel."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"My aunt and uncle lived in Florida when I was a kid and my parents first took me there when I was a few months old. Florida has always been such a special place to me, no matter where in the state I visit. My uncle used to tell me wonderful stories of old Florida and I could never get enough. This is a wonderfully told story of a family's life through many decades and changes in Florida and is also a great overview of Florida's unique history. I wish I had found this book when my uncle was still with us. I hated for this book to end."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I have recommended this book to everyone I know. A must for Florida residents. Even though, this is a fictional story, there is so much history intertwined you learn a lot about how Florida evolved."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"The native Floridians that go many generations back should read this book!

This book truly is the old Florida many of us remember!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book does such a beautiful job of covering early days of Florida.

I read A Land Remembered as I was going into 8th grade in 2006 and it is absolutely the best book I have ever read. I 've never read Pillars of The Earth but it's sort of like that book because it's abou the life of a family and the story spans multiple generations. No other book that I have read has ever come close to A Land Remembered. I went on to read another of Patrick Smith's books but it wasn't nearly as good."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I liked this book a lot and can see why it would make a great teaching book for children in school. It gives you a glimpse of what early settlers in Florida had to endure and how even the simplest of things just were not available to them until transport made them so. Times were harsh but people were stronger than they seem to be today.Good quick read, left me with a pride in being a \\"cracker\\""},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Absolutely loved this book. A true depiction of old Florida. Will keep this one on my bookshelf. As a sixth generation Floridian I can relate. Florida has changed so much since I was small. The woods and fields that I played in as a child are no more. The book also showed the pioneering spirit. My great great grandfather drove cattle from South Florida (Tampa area) during the Civil War. He is now listed on a monument in Plant City at the old high school (where my father attended) as a member of the \\"Cow Calvary\\". My grandfather ran beef cattle on the old homestead."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A Land Remembered is by Far my favorite book. If you live in or plan to visit Florida it is a must read. You will get an incredible education about the History of Florida packaged in a page turning novel. This is about the \\"real Florida\\" not just Palm Trees and Beaches.After reading this book, as you travel thruout the State, you can't help seeing Florida through different ideas. I have given this book as a Birthday or Thank You present, and everyone enjoys it"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book was recommended to me by another Floridian and after purchasing it and reading it, I purchased 3 more books for family and friends. It is a very good book, from which I learned a lot about the early days in Florida and many of the things which make Florida such an interesting place to live."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book is a gem. It was recommended to me by a sailing friend in The Bahamas who simply wrote, \\"Buy it. Buy it Now!\\" He was right. The book is a rich novel that helps the reader travel back to the Florida of 140 years ago. You can taste the hot climate, you can see the Noah's ark of wildlife and you experience the struggle of subsisting - and then prevailing - in a wilderness that no longer exists. Absolutely superior writing. Rich. Colorful. Expressive. Awesome."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A LAND REMEMBERED traces three generations of the MacIvey family from the 1860s to the 1960s as they struggle to survive and, ultimately, prosper in late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century Florida. The family goes from mere subsistence to affluence to wealth through cattle ranching, agriculture, and real estate, and their rise coincides with the settling and despoliation of the state. Along the way, the family suffers many hardships, losses, and reverses, but always endures.This is a very absorbing narrative, one of those books that you are sad to finish. The characters are mostly very three-dimensional, and the \\"moral\\" of the book, while certainly identifiable, is presented in somewhat ambiguous terms -- you are not bashed over the head with preachiness.As a native Floridian with a pretty good knowledge of the state's history, I appreciated the contextual accuracy of Patrick Smith's narrative -- he links the MacIveys' story in with such important events in Florida history as the Civil War battle of Olustee, the Spanish-American War, the building of Henry Flagler's railroad, and the Miami real estate boom of the 1920s (and the hurricanes that ended it.) And as a lifelong resident of the state who has traveled through almost all of it at one time or another, I also appreciated Smith's geographical accuracy.Anyone who wants a taste of what the \\"real\\" Florida was like and who enjoys a good historical novel should check this gem out."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This is one of the best books ever written, hands down.The writing is a bit basic and gritty, for lack of a better term,somehow Patrick Smith manages to pull at every heartstring you never knew existed. You'll laugh, cry, smile, gain and lose your faith in humanity in one fell swoop. Words cannot describe why this book is a must read for anyone who has good taste in books, in life, in the very reason we are alive. Read this book."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"The story moves and has many twists and turns. The characters all support each other while they struggle through life. A nice ending"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book has been lauded up and down the State of Florida for its wonderful historical content. But when any tale is as badly imagined and poorly written as this one, isn't it also necessarily true that that we must question its historical accuracy as well? From the stereotyped Indians, speaking in their unbelievably clear, brief, measured syllables, to the aw shucks blacks, to the backwoods men themselves and the wise all-knowing cook/womenfolk they marry, there are no real people. It is as if Patrick Smith has peopled his land with a lot of little plastic action figures like the kind boys used to get in a bag. Even the countryside itself isn't well depicted. Land Remembered is like a western in reverse - how the West Was Lost. All Patrick Smith adds to formulaic western writing is a little cheap bitterness. Read Peter Matthiessen. Read The Little House on the Prairie books."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Don't turn to this book for an easy way to learn Florida history. Sure, it's an easy read, but it only looks at 100 years in the lives of American pioneers in central Florida. Forget 300 years of Spanish settlements. Forget the Seminoles. As far as this book is concerned, they didn't exist.If you're black, you may also be offended as I was by the author's portrayal of the few black characters. The Indians were portrayed with dignity; the black characters were either servile or buffoons. Unfortunately, my white &quot;friends&quot; saw no problem with this.This book has been suggested in some Florida communities as one book everyone should read as a community project. I think &quot;A Land Remembered&quot; is a poor choice."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"The author did not fully develop the characters and it seemed like he killed them all off at once. He took like 40 chapters to go through two generations and then killed them all of in like two chapters."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"The characters are not believable and the plot is is not engaging. It could be used in middle school for an atmospheric read of Florida in the 19th century.It is not challenging enough for serious readers or anyone who knows anything about Florida."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"\\"A Land Remembered\\" is the first historical fiction book I've read about Florida. At first, I felt like I was reading any other wilderness, prairie family book, and at times, it felt it redundant in its chapters. I had not read a book about a family raising cattle and starting orange groves, so this was all new to me, but it quickly became old during the course of this book. The constant span of years confused me, as I didn't see character development at all. I found the flurry of characters to be overwhelming, and each character not to be admiral (more so in the second and third generation of MacIvey's). After chapter 32, I lost all respect for the story, as it all seem fantastical and unrealistic to me. Finally, I could not see the point author Patrick D. Smith was making, and I think it was washed out due to the vastness of this book. I really wanted to like this book, and I enjoyed it for a while when the freshness of wild Florida was being revealed, but after that, the interest wore thin for me. I \\"sorta\\" recommend."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Lead to believe that the book \\"A Land Remembered\\" was what I ordered, but instead got only a summary. I have read the paperback book and wanted to have it in my Kinkle library so I could share it with others. Loved the paperback book but am not happy with the summary."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"First off before I get to what turned me away from this book I will give the book credit on its very few good points. You can learn a lot about Florida's early history in this book. You can learn a lot of SLANG words, even when a character isn't speaking, in the author's description of places and such, and you can become a better sleeper! That's it!I was forced to read this book in my Economics class. What the teacher expected us to learn about world Economics in this book is beyond me. Anyway, I have never seen a book written so ridiculously farcical as this one. It's a disgrace to me because when someone reads this book to learn about Florida, a state I'm proud to be from, they will think we are just a bunch of idiot cow farmers.ON THE CONTENT--The start of every chapter it seems starts in a cow pen. In the first half of the book all they do is round up cows and sell them. There is no description of the characters, very little character development. If you have read this book please tell me what Emma looks like? Was she tall, short, fat, skinny? Ho about Bonnie? She had a blonde pony tail right? What else do you know about her? She was introduced, then killed like in the next chapter...WHYYYY?Most people who enjoyed this book have never read anything else so they don't have anything to compare it with. The plot is harrowing. The author obviously didn't know what his plot was at the beginning. He started off describing Florida then at the middle, or the beginning of the end of the novel he totally went off track and the novel was about death.I have never seen such disastrous love scenes. The romance in this novel..well I hate to be so blunt but it [disappointed]! What was the point of the Indian Tawanda and Zech's relationship. He meets her for like 5 minutes and they are already kissing etc etc. Again there is no description of what she even looks like. Was she a fat Indian, or was she tall. How about Zech? Do I have to say more...A 10 year old could have wrote this book if he had a history book on Florida in front of him.I know a lot of you may have enjoyed this book but when you delve deep into it the book really isn't that great. All it takes is a few character names and a little knowledge on Florida and you could probably write something better than this."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A Land Remebered might just qualify for one of the most boring books I've ever read. I was required to read it for my florida history class and lets just say i waited until the very last minute to read it for a reason.TOBIAS, FROG, BONZO, SKILLIT, ZECH... WHATS UP WITH THESE NAMES?- yeah this book was not only stupid and pointless but all of the characters were so unbelievably ignorant that it was hard to bring myself to turn the page.ZECH= MAN WHORE- tawanda or glenda???? the choice was obvious for me but of course by the end of the book i realized he picked glenda who was not my choice. =) what can i say i guess i have bad taste. but seriously lets get real, girls dont say stuff like.. \\"its cold, put your arm around me\\"OVERALL- i have to read volume 2 next. i would rather shoot myself"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book was a truly wonderful read. It mixed the history of Florida, with the fictional tale of a family that came, settled the land and endured hardship after hardship, before establishing them selves. The book is well researched and the characterizations and plot are both very well developed. I cannot think any who likes to read that would not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I was given this book when I was fifteen by my father to read and my eyes rolled into the back of my head thinking it would be one his boring historical novels. Much to my pleasant surprise it turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read (and I have read quite a few). Not only does it give many historical truths about the land (which I can verify having family settled in FL in the 1820's) but it also gives a mix of every virtue that makes a book great-friendship, love, adventure, tragedy, and substance. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone given non-FL natives, men, and women alike can relate to this book."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Read this book just for the pure entertainment of it. Nevermind that you will have been introduced to the visera of the history of the state of Florida, a state that most think has no history. You might be interested to know that the state of Florida currently maintains a herd of cracker cattle just to preserve the blood lines. Many ranchers in this state lovingly preserve cracker horses for the same reason. This is a book that is rich in the history of Florida, that can be read for pure enjoyment."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I loved this book. I've bought numerous copies for friends as gifts, and I think that they mostly agree. It's a fictionalized history of central Florida. It's very well done"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book has such history and depth. Amazing descriptions of Florida before all of the development! A must-have for any Florida resident!!! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book was interesting from the standpoint of early Florida history. However, the characters were one-dimensional and not very well developed. I would recommend it only to someone with an interest in early Florida."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"several people recommended this book but because of the fact i'm such a fan of non-fiction, i hesitated.What a mistake. tried not to read it too fast because it was so good. for anyone who wants to know the true florida, this book is a must."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This is not my type of book...I'm more of a mystery thriller type of fan. But a friend recommended this book, and after a couple of chapters, I was hooked. This was a good story about growing up in the deep south, and never giving up, no matter what nature throws at you. Tobias and Emma started it all, and with good hearts and open minds, raised a family in the scrub. There were difficult times, but the family was strong and persevered. Tobias' son Zech had the foresight to purchase thousands of acres of land that became more valuable as time wore on. Unfortunately, with time also comes progress, and good ole days that are gone forever. As a friend recommended this to me, I now recommend it to you. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This was a book club book and we all liked it very much. Didn't want it to end. Learned a lot about Florida. Felt sad (again) that Indians were pushed out of their homes, lied to and mistreated. It is sad to see this coastal state overdeveloped and concreted-to death. Blocking ocean views with high-rise hotels is a travesty. This author is a gem. His main characters were admirable. He was not preachy about the environmental issues but he does educate readers about them. I will read his other books."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"If you'd like to get a sense of what it was like to live in South Florida with the early pioneers, this is the book for you. Great choice for a book club. Lots to discuss and relate to times of today. Lots of good lessons learned."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"When my Aunt Nila first sent me a copy of ALR I was not impressed with a &quot;trashy&quot; romance triangle cover. However, on a beach weekend, I grabbed the copy and when I had read the first few pages on Jupiter Beach, I was immediately transported into Patrick Smith's endearing tale of three generations of the MacIvey family and their struggle for survival in early Florida. I would say that 85% of all the honor students I have taught at Coral Gables High in Miami rank this as one of their all-time favorite books. Many have reread it a second time. Smith depicts pioneer life graphically. He is stronger on plot and setting than character and helps teach us a strong respect for the land and a preservation of our past and heritage. This is a great book to teach for environmental concepts and for a love of a sense of place."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"The book was excellent. Unlike the comments from the previous reader I found the pace of the book to be perfect. The characters in the story were FULLY developed. How else could I have felt saddness for their passing? The books pace closely paralelled the movement of life in general. The speed picks up towards the end as did the actual pace of life in the story. Patrick Smith does it again."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Wow!!! You will not be able to put it down. It is also a great book on tape if you are taking a long trip. I have lived in Florida since 1972 and I never new some of the events mentioned in this book.What a wonderful story. I know that it was fiction, but someone did their homework on this one.It was also very entertaining and thought provoking. Thank you Mr. Smith for a super story."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A friend loaned me this book. I couldn't put it down until I finished. I loaned it to another friend and her husband. They couldn't put it down either until finished. I am now buying another copy to send to a friend now living in Montana who was born in Chuleota Florida. I wait to see if he also will be unable to rest until finished with this great story of Florida history"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"An excellent introduction to Florida whether you be 96 or 6 years old! Especially if you've come from outside of the state and think you've come to \\"paradise\\". Here Smith has well strung together the many events that brought Florida to where it is today. Along with presenting characters that are very much like like the real life pioneers and carpetbaggers that help put our state together.One of the admirable parts of his endeavor was to start with the main characters crossing into the state from Georgia and then to travel the family to south Florida and the treks back and forth to Punta Rassa. This is written very well. Those who know the history of Florida will find this an acurate portrayal. Others might want to follow the map that accompanies the book.Do yourself a favor and enjoy the history, heritage and culture of Florida while reading a sweeping adventure!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"It's easy to see why almost every reviewer gave this book 5 stars. The story follows the MacIvey family from 1863 through three generations to the present. As they scratch out a hardscrabble living, the reader follows their experiences during the Civil War, and through Florida's pioneer days.Immerse yourself in their struggle to build a home, drive cattle to market, start orchards, deal with rustlers, wild animals, life and death in Central Florida.You learn so much about Florida's early landscape and the damage done by settlement, as well as the effect on the Native Americans. Some of the homespun life reminds me of Rawling's classic, The Yearling. I highly recommend it, not just for Floridians, but for everyone to know more about their country's development in this unique region. The story is compelling."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I dreaded being assigned this book in a college class on Southern History, but once I started reading the book, I couldn't put it down. The characters are so realistic, and the book is fairly accurate historically, as well. I recommend it to history buffs and romantics alike."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I was told to read this book by my Grandfather. I actually got it, only because my Grandfather was with me at the time, and I had no intention of reading it. I am typically the stereotypical woman, and most of what I read is romance novels. Late one night, having read all my others books, I picked up A Land Remembered and began to read it. At the second chapter, I was still not too into it, but I keep reading. Pretty soon, I couldn't put the book down, I just wanted to know what was going to happen next. I am a native of Florida, and I found it so interesting to read about these places that I have been visting all my life. I had never thought about what Florida like back then. The book leaves you almost wishing that Florida would have remained as it once must have been. Or you are at least wishing you could have seen the state so wild and beautiful."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"It was on a tour in Florida that our tour guide suggested reading this book. It was the besthistoric novel I've read in a very long time. To hear names like Miami, Palm Beach and others as beingwilderness and knowing their present state is just mind boggling and following generationsof this family and their adventures is so interesting that you can't put the book down. I would recommend itto anyone."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A Land Remembered in on my top ten list of all time greatest novels, which is interesting because I don't often read or enjoy historical fiction. This moving and epic novel tells the story of three generations of Florida settlers fighting to survive in old Florida. These settlers not only survive but prosper as well. However, with this prosperity comes a human and environmental price."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I can't begin to explain how much this book grabbed me and I think it is exceptionally well written. It is a real page turner and virtually everyone else I know who read the book felt the same way. If you are up in the air on this book, read it. I would categorize it as one of the best books I ever read and well worth the time spent reading it - great entertainment value in a book!A Land Remembered"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I grew up in Florida before most of the modern development. (Born in 1938) Through the story of a settler's family struggling to survive, this book takes you into the areas where you have been but before they changed. Areas around Gainesville, Jacksonville, Kissimmee,Fort Myers, Lake Okeechobee, the Everglades and into the West Palm Beach/Miami area. Wild cattle and horses, folks living off of the land, land selling for 25 cents an acre, Miami before the raiload and everybody else got there. You will want to re-read it when you are through because you will almost certainly not put it all together on the first trip."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"The best recommendation I can give for this book is to say that neither my wife or I wanted it to end while reading it. Like any good epic, the plot here takes the reader a long way over time and events, with characters that you come to know and become vested in.With much of the story reflected by the natural environement of Florida, as far back as the mid-19th century, the narrative reminded me of a style similar to Cormac McCarthy's trilogy about the west, except that Florida's geography seems to hold a lot more serious threat for people of that time than the western landscape did.I've read some of the critical reviews here, and I have to say that, while I understand them, I didn't find them relevant to my experience with reading this book. Any interaction with a book or movie is subjective, based on what you're looking for or require out of your experience. Personally, I was greatful to the author for successfully creating a story that blended actual Florida history and geography with realistically probable environmental conditions of the area.This book is a really unusual treasure in my opinion."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read for a long time. You can actually visualize what is happening as you read this book. It is filled with such real warm, happy, and sad happenings all the way through the book. I couldn't hardly put it down."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Few who speed along I-4 and enjoy the air-conditioned comfort of the Florida as we know it, give a passing thought to what our state was like before the rapid development of recent decades. Even those who have the occasional black bear in their back yards forget how close to the wild Florida we are and buy into the myth that there was nothing here before Disney. If you have not yet read a novel about early Florida History, this is the book for you.Author Patrick Smith depicts the life of early Florida pioneers, the Macleveys. From hacking their first rude cabin out of the underbrush to daunting cattle drives down to the Gulf, this best-selling novel, brings to life three generations of a Florida family. They brave frontier hardships that are similar to those of the Wild West and as they tame the land, their understanding of it changes.The novel ranges from 1858, when the first MacIeveys come to Florida, through 1968, with their grandson in his old age. They endure interaction with Civil War deserters and forge friendships with Native Floridians. They face threats from the weather--dealing with the same kinds of hurricanes and freezes that still shape Florida living today. The main characters are presented in an engaging fashion, as they wrest their future from the land, and make successful transitions from cattle to orange groves to real estate development that characterize the growth of Florida's prosperity. The narrative flows easily and the story holds new adventures on every page. Having read this novel, you may feel drawn to learn more about the pre-Mouse Florida.Some of your children may have read this book since a teacher's manual is available for it to teach language arts, social studies, and science in conjunction with the Sunshine State Standards of the Florida Department of Education. If you do not know the derivation of the term \\"Crackers\\" for long-time Floridians, this book will tell you. Patrick D. Smith, is a multiple award winning author; he is a native of Mendenhall, Mississippi and came to Florida in 1966. \\"A Land Remembered\\" is his sixth novel."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Wonderful book, a historical novel that makes me thankful that I am living in the 21st century. Patrick Smith does a great job and transforming you across time to a place that would be very foreign to visitors in the Sun Shine State today! I learned so much, it caused me to get the atlas out and look at the possibilities! Wonderful read, would recommend to anyone who ever thought about being a cow boy!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This book, a novel, should be required reading for Florida middle/high school students. Period. And, for those who live in Florida who are the least bit curious about the history of their state, one of the most peculiar in the union, this easy and mesmerizing book will have readers flipping to a map over, and over, again, searching for geographic mentions which correspond to today's maps. This historic novel is an example of the \\"I can't put it down\\" gendre'.At 10 times any asking price, this book is worth a buy - and the reader will recommend it to a friend and pass it on, I guarantee."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"From the 1830's to modern times, a review of the population growth and despoliation of the state of Florida.

He laughed out loud several times. He said you know it's a good book when you feel like you are friends with the characters."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I'm an avid FL outdoorsman and really enjoyed the vivid mental pictures painted by the author as he details the chronicles of the MacIvey family through 3 generations. Although it is technically a fictional story, it seems very real and gives the reader realistic insight on what it was like in FL in the late 1800's, what really happened to the indians that lived here before us, what happened to our wetland resources, how did a few people come to be so filthy rich, many questions that I had before reading the book. If you live in FL and have similar questions, get this book, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A wonderful, historical novel of the Mitchner style, which brings to life three generations of Central Florida's history. It is the best book of this type I have read. There are others which are close, including a three volume history of the area around Everglade City which begins with the title, \\"They are Killing Mr. Watson.\\""},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"For anyone who has ever wanted to know the history of how Florida was settled, this is certainly the right book! Very descriptive and not for the faint of heart! Having lived in the area north of Lake Okeechobee for many years, cattle and orange groves are to this day in abundance!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"Nicely written. I read it from cover to cover in one sitting. I was engaged by the characters and the descriptions of the culture, history and land were appropriate to the story. As a Floridian, it was a pleasure to read about my state's historic background and the life of those living here in our not so distant past."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. It should be required reading for all Florida students, if not everyone who has moved here. A Land Remembered is a true American classic - more than a great novel, more than a history lesson. Everyone I know who has read this book agrees that their perspectives have been fundamentally and pleasantly changed forever. Thank you, Patrick Smith."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I never tire of reading this book, thrilled when I could get it on my kindle. I also have the printed copy which has been well read. My grandson is an avid reader so I gave him a printed copy to enjoy through the years. Well worth reading, more than once."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"The book was a most interesting journey through time and places little known to me.

This book makes me hunger for more history of Florida, a frontier like no other."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A Land Remembered is a five star read.!

The characters are well developed and although it is fiction it certainly reads as fact due to the great research by Patrick Smith.I loved it and will read it again!"},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A well written book on Florida Cracker history. Good characterization and use of localities. Reveals the difficulty of living in early Florida."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"I simply loved this book!!! It traces a pioneer of Florida, from the early times in a land still wild. This book is filled with the blood, sweat, and tears of what it took to scratch out a living in this harsh land.

The discriptions are so good you feel like you are living the story."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"A most enjoyable read with an acceptable amount of Florida pioneer history blended in. Highly recommended to those who enjoy historical fiction."},{"Title":"A Land Remembered","review":"This was a great book.

The Appalachian Trail was the idea of Benton MacKaye, and we are treated to his story of the beginning of the Trail in the Foreward to this book which he wrote.Ronald Fisher, the author, travelled parts of the Trail starting in Georgia and ending in Maine over a six month period. His companions were Dick Durrance, a National Geographic photographer, and his wife Jill. They sampled \\"interesting portions\\" of the Trail and also explored the surrounding coutryside. So the book is not only an introduction to the Apppalachian trail, but also a splendid photographic essay of the eastern states as they were over 30 years ago. All this is done with color photos reminiscent of the National Geographic magazine, a wonderful text by the author, and eight two-page color maps of the trail.The format is pretty formal. Each of the eight chapters covers a different geographic area and consists of eight pages of text, ten pages of color photos and a two-page map. The text ends with a one page Epilogue entitled \\"Before You Hike...\\" This provides some basic advice on getting started on your own exploration of the Trail. A three page Index and a list of Additional Readings completes the volume.This is a wonderful, brief, and colorful introduction to the Appalachian Trail. Being more than 30 years old, I would suggest getting some more up-to-date resource guide before you start hiking. Yet for the armchair traveller, this is a delightful place to start."},{"Title":"The Appalachian Trail","review":"I didn't expect much from a book that was published before I was born; however, it was one of only a couple books my local library had on the Appalachian Trail. Because I'm seriously considering a through-hike of the AT at some point in the future, I figured it still might be able to give me an historical glimpse of the trail. I wasn't disappointed.What it is:- A great National Geographic book with lots of full color, clear, crisp and (admittedly) dated photos. Photos are printed on glossy pages. Text is printed on heavyweight manila colored matte paper that has a nice texture. Maybe it's just me, but the heavyweight paper added to the experience of reading about 1970s trail life in an \\"old\\" book.- A story about the author, author's wife, and photographer as they section hiked portions of the AT.- A nonfiction storytelling book that gives vignettes of trail history, trail conditions, the life of people who live near the trail or hike the trail.- An easy read. Of the 199 pages, 1/3rd are full size picture pages. Chapter text is generally about 5-9 pages long.What it isn't:- A how-to book. You're not going to get distances, equipment reviews, or tips on how to hike.- A single threaded story from beginning to end. The book is--delightfully, in my opinion--broken up into chapters that make the reader feel like there is a new subject, new perspective, or new theme rather than one continuous novel.In the end, I really enjoyed reading it. The book helps me understand how the AT used to be. It gives me something with which to contrast current conditions as I hike."},{"Title":"The Appalachian Trail","review":"It wasn't quite what I wanted for my son.

The authors took account of the thoughts of other great epidemiologist and epidemiology textbooks. I find this book very useful for all people that want to know a bit about epidemiology or want to know if epidemiology can be a good career choice.The authors have a clear and down to the point narrative.

I have read a lot of the titles off of Oprah's book list but this is by far the worst of them all. I find the main character so obnoxious and annoying that I spend majority of the time angry at her. I am unsure if Ms.Gilchrist expected us to feel sorry for Rhoda or if she wanted us to hate her. The story isn't funny, it isn't sad, it isn't anything except a waste of time. I typically enjoy stories that are set in the South because I find the whole atmosphere of the area of intoxicating but this did not do the South justice. I really enjoy poetry but the amount of poetry in this book is over the top. We are expected to believe that Rhoda is really brilliant but her personality does not fit her supposed intelligence. The book's jacket summary gives the idea of a fullfilling and warm novel but it is really lacking and cold.

G. Jung's fascinating and provocative explorations into his own psyche, and others'. Regrettably, the book is almost utterly hagiographic: It contains little critical discernment and substitutes summary for scholarship. All in all, typical of the Jungian approach to historical enquiry: full of names, self-justifying, occasionally interesting, but more like cotton candy (vanishing upon consumption) than like true intellectual or psychological nourishment. A major disappointment."},{"Title":"Jung and the Post-Jungians","review":"If this book is any evidence, Jungian psychology is a silly little movement run by people without much depth. The author parades for us a group of minor thinkers, most of them working in pop psychology (the genre to which this book really belongs). Some of these people may have something to say, but they are always on the fringe of the respected psychological traditions. You get the sense that they can never quite break in and yet are sadly desperate to be taken seriously. This would be an interesting story, yet the author manages completely (I would guess deliberately) to ignore the 'hot' issues in Jungian psychology: its heritage of affiliation with the Nazis; its abuse of clients ('analysands'); its founder's self-designated messianic status; his assault on women in his care; the cult-like structure that his modern disciples have designed to keep it going and themselves flush. In short, whether you're looking for depth or honesty, you're going to be disappointed. A minor book about a minor trend."},{"Title":"Oceano Practico/ Oceano Useful: Ortografia facil del Espanol/ Easy Spanish Spelling (Spanish Edition)","review":"I bought this pocket grammatical dictionary for my daughter to help her with her advanced Spanish high schoool class, however, I myself fell in love with it.

As a homeschooling parent I have been able to teach Shakespeare using the extensive notes, illustrations, vocabulary and other tools in the Cambridge Shakespeare texts.The structure of the paper version of these books is very conducive to reading the play and studying it. Unfortunately the structure of the electronic version is very difficult to read. The notes are mixed in with the text randomly, not put in linked footnotes or end notes as one may expect.

For example, House describes how Crusaders recoiled as they entered Damietta after a long siege as if they saw what liberators of Auschwitz or Belsen beheld in the 20th-century. Relationships as these make House's pictures of human strife both cruel and unyielding.A battle that was infernal like Damietta is pitted against Francis' losing battle against disease and self-imposed deprivations. Witnessing suffering on a large scale, when measured by successive months at Damietta, traumatized the little saint. If the macabre scenes of utter and complete destruction shake the reader to the core, they were sure to have been eclipsed by Francis' own suffering. House's skills become clear as he moves between collective tragedy and personal loss, thus making Francis a microcosm of the larger revolution(s) in politics, economics, science, philosophy, theology, and religion-state relations.House packs for the ride. Thrown into his travel gear are hefty measures of facts and favorite anecdotes about Francis. Little new can be spotted among these staples. However, House makes the staples fresh as if picked from the vine earlier today.Such \\"fresh\\" ingredients provide more than mere sustenance for a piety-starved generation as ours. They offer a new look at an old saint."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"This book focuses on the historical events of this saint's life without much embellishment on the spiritual nature. Of course, a biography of St. Francis can't ignore the spiritual side of this man entirely and I think the author gives his due respect to his accomplishments.From a well to do youth to a poverty stricken reformer, this life is one to be admired no matter what a person's background. The book sufficiently discusses the historical events as an outword expression of the transformation of the man, but not necessarily the transformation itself for the student trying to study the method.If you wan't to learn of the man and the development of his order, this book will do nicely. However, if you want to understand the meaning of the man, you will find this book lacking."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"Writing a biography of a renowned and revered religious figure is a daunting task, since both skeptics and true believers are likely to take offence at some point. While I have my own reservations about some of the author's choices, for the most part the book does a good job of relating the impact that Francis' life had on his community, his church, his generation and history since.His radical ideas were in opposition to the example set by the church of his day, yet he was entirely submissive to it. He was extraordinarily gifted and endowed in many ways spiritually, but these same gifts could make him an ineffective administrator. Bringing out these and other contrasts is an effective way to explain both his inspirational and human elements. I appreciate the author's discussion of some of the miraculous events attributed to him without being either dismissive or unquestioning. These make the book an excellent example of historical writing.My only complaint is that I found the author's occasional comparisons to other religions to be more distracting than helpful. However he may be viewed today, Francis did not live his life as an ecumenical figure. He was wholeheartedly, entirely and unreservedly a servant of Christ. To stray too far from this takes away from a true understanding of his life and rather embellishes than enriches the narrative."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"This biography of Francis is written for all readers, whether religious or not, and covers the life and times of Francis, who lived from 1182-1226. From his devotion to the poor and sick to the relationship between him and Clare and his journey over the Pyrenees barefoot, Francis Of Assisi provides a lively reading of his experiences."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would give me a more indepth look into this remarkable man's life. Instead, I found myself severly dissapointed. The book does give a good overview of the world around St. Assisi, but really didn't give me any new insight into the facts surrounding the man. Not only that, the author seems to be delving into an almost Jungian religious view. I would not have minded a Catholic view (because St. Assisi was obviously Catholic)or a secular view, but I found the author's choice of religious viewpoint to be completely without rational or support."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"Excellent book on St. Francis. The only complaint I have is it isn't very good with maps and showing the reader where Francis traveled. Having been in Assisi helped me to imagine where Francis traveled. It's wonderful to read that the saints are human and do err. Faith gets them through! An excellent introduction to the life of one of the most revered saints, and also a good introduction to his faithful compainion, St. Clare."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"Adrian House saunters through the life of Francis of Assisi pretty much as I imagine Francis himself traveled the Italian countryside. He is in no particular hurry, he takes time to digest the curiosities of his journey, and on occasion he stops altogether to sing and celebrate what he had discovered. House is deeply respectful of his sources--Thomas of Celano and Bonaventure of the thirteenth century, for example, or Bishop John Moorman of our own day-and he is less skeptical than other biographers of devotional sources like The Little Flowers. He has produced a biography that neither labors under its own gravity nor settles into the bog of ecclesiastical mush.It is House's periodic detours that also distinguish this work. We get a primer of Italian city-state politics, street life in the towns, the idiosyncrasies of bishops and noblemen, and the temper of contemporary church life and piety. We get a very thorough immersion into the appalling poverty that was the routine lot of most grim souls in the thirteenth century. We get descriptions of the papal court on vacation, the atmosphere of a medieval ecumenical council, and the eccentric sumptuousness of the Sultan's war camp. We learn probably more than we want to know about the horrors of the siege of Damietta during the Fifth Crusade. We also enter into the private musings of the author himself who takes time to speculate on such matters as whether Francis had some premonition of the Big Bang Theory.House's Francis is a saint in every sense of the word: a humanitarian of historic proportions whose religious commitment to Gospel and Church almost single-handedly redeemed medieval Catholicism as a holy communion. In retelling an oft-told tale, House succeeds in giving us new ways to look at Francis. He attributes to the saint the same quality that Shelby Foote sees in Abraham Lincoln: the ability to stand outside of himself and understand how he looked and sounded to others. Francis was the master of the symbolic gesture: preaching naked, taming animals, singing and dancing. Spontaneous as he was, Francis knew exactly what he was doing and precisely what he hoped to communicate.Where many biographers find Francis the soul of innocence, House understands that his subject was brilliant. It is no coincidence that Francis cultivated precious relationships with men who could do him much good: Guido, Bishop of Assisi; Innocent III; Cardinal Ugolino/Gregory IX. It was the influence of these men who preserved Francis from the fate of many other like-minded reformers of his time: the brand of heresy. How is it that Francis \\"happens\\" to be in Rome for the Fourth Lateran Council to protect the interests of his new order, or at Damietta to serve as missionary-negotiator on behalf of Christian crusaders with the Sultan?House's interpretation of the \\"later Francis\\" is intriguing. In Chapter 21, \\"The Small Black Hen,\\" Francis chooses discretion over valor. He decides, albeit resignedly, that absolute poverty was not worth the enduring distrust of the Church hierarchy. Perhaps with the idea that he himself would become a marginalized friar free to pursue Gospel absolutes, he decides to let the Church legalize the governance of the now several thousand brothers he had attracted. This change of heart would open the door for permanent friaries, libraries, schools, and a more conventional religious lifestyle. Like many saints, Francis was an autocrat, and his change of heart on the matter of poverty and church authority was a blind side to his feisty co-founder Clare, then engaged in even more intense struggles with the Curia over matters of the rule and financial security. Clare, in some respects, emerges in the final chapters as the strongest but last of the old true believers. The ultimate loser was Elias, who became the target and scapegoat of disillusioned friars in the years after Francis's death.So who were the enemies of Francis and Clare? House talks about them incessantly [why the need for a \\"Cardinal Protector\\"?] but never says exactly who they are or, more to the point, whether their concerns about the nascent religious movement were justified. We come to find, for example, that civil rulers were none too happy about the proliferation of lay followers of Francis, all of whom as professed pacifists refused to bear arms and thus gave weight to church over state. It is also clear that many of Francis's enemies were members of the Roman Curia. House echoes the conventional wisdom that many churchmen perceived the friars as dangerously loose and unstructured and as unsettling to local clergy. Is it possible, though, that some churchmen of vision saw what Francis and Innocent refused to anticipate: an inevitable divisiveness between idealism and reality?For all of his love for things Franciscan, House does not enter into the tired polemic over the comparative virtues of today's Franciscans vis-&agrave;-vis the contemporary intimates of Francis. One gets the sense from this narrative that Francis's distinctive embrace of poverty was a message to the poor as much as to the rich. Francis, master of the religious gesture, understood that his hyperbolic example of poverty was an affirmation that the poor life of the citizenry was a holy one, not a meaningless one. His observance of poverty was about Incarnation, not subjugation. Were Francis alive today, we can conclude, he might have less to say about personal possessions and everything to say about the human experience.."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"I have long admired St. Francis of Assisi. A truly holy man, I was confirmed under his name. And yet, his ideal of living a life of poverty and service is something I could never find the courage to emulate to any significant degree. Still, it is heartening to read of his life. In our modern world, we need all the inspiration we can find. Adrian House has done a good job of using the life of Francis to provide inspiration for us.One of the main things I like about House's work here is that he provides the story of man who is truly human. I quickly tire of biographers who try to throw only good light on their subjects. This is a particular danger when writing of a person many consider to be a saint. Still, for saints to really inspire, to lead us towards the good, we must be able to see ourselves in them. Like many great saints (Paul, Augustine, etc.), Francis lived the rather loose life of a wealthy young man for many years before the revelation that turned him into the man he became and House is not afraid to show us this. Even better, House recounts instances of Francis losing his temper and making mistakes after his transformation but with the caveat that Francis, unlike most, always tried to make amends for his transgressions. This, in my mind, is what is best about Francis.The weakness of this book is that is caters a little too much to a modern, ecumenical audience. Francis was a product of twelfth century Italy and we lose a sense of time with all the interspersed quotations from post-Middle Ages, multicultural sources which shed little light on the man Francis was. I love to read Shakespeare, Buddha and the like, but not here. This is somewhat a matter of taste, however. I am already well-versed in the Christian milieu and, therefore, don't need help to connect to Francis. Non-Christians may find this book more palatable because of House's style.On the other hand, the only really modern writing I want to see is modern scholarship and, fortunately, there is that too. House handles Francis's mystical side very well and I liked the way he points out how the Orders Francis founds get hijacked and turned away from Francis's ideal. People like to criticize modern religions expression but we should take the time to look back at the original spirit of these groups and rituals before decide it has no value. House's book gives us this opportunity."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"Adrian House's enthralling account of the life of St. Francis is likely to be esteemed a biographical landmark; not a make-shift model only worthy of a few key-points and temporary praise. House captures Francis' life as a total reality - molding society, his friends and loved ones - into one harmony conveying Francis' life as a pilgrimage compelled by the joy of Christ, affection for His Creation, and pashion to meet the needs of others...ultimately living out the example of his Savior. This book also includes the Franciscan Rule of 1223 following the epilogue, and eight colorful illustrations throught the book indicating key features in St. Francis' life. Entertaining and edifying...down right stimuli for the imagination."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"Usually, a historical text such as this one bores me to death with its &quot;educated&quot; language and more detail than one could ever care about. But today, while searching for a birthday gift for a friend who, like me, has been touched by the piety of Francis, I sat and read for an hour, and was compelled. I usually am especially intrigued by the relationship between Frances and his young proteg&eacute;, Clare. I was pleased to find a book that admitted that theirs was a love affair, albeit unconsummated, and pretty much in her mind, only; a situation I can relate to, unfortunately, only too well. Finally, here is a text that shows me what Francis was about, but doesn't seek to convert or evangelize. Detailed enough to clear up some things I may have read elsewhere without boring me with too much. When I got to the photographs in the center of the book, it was the photograph of the bones of Francis that brought home to me that this man did exist, and I found myself mourning his loss right there in the bookstore. When a book does that to me, I've got to have it.Did we need another biography on Francis of Assisi? In my opinion, yes, we did, and this is the best of all of them. This is a book that, once I was able to try it, I bought it. Not at the bookstore in which I auditioned it, but here, at Amazon.com, where it was cheaper."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"I checked out this book at the library a couple of years ago and was so impressed by it that I had to have a copy of it in order to reread it at my leisure. That's saying something, my friend.This biography is written for the non-religious and the pious alike. The author approaches Francis' life as he would anyone else's. This is refreshing to me because, especially if it is a religious figure, I want to see the subject of a biography in all his foibles. Why? Probably because I have many foibles also and I can relate to and consequently be more inspired by a real human being who, in spite of his or her foibles, was able to transcend them to do great things.The author does a fine job of putting the reader inside the time, place and family in which Francis grew. Though he doesn't go into as great a depth about it as I'm sure other biographies do, Francis spiritual growth is well-written. His prayer life must have been genuinely awesome. The author at one point cites a person who peeked in on one of Francis' hidden prayer session and was in awe of it all, stigmata and all.I think Francis has so much to say to us today. I really believe that any Christian who does study his life is the spiritually richer for it--and that probably goes double for any unbeliever as well."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"The strongest parts of this biography are in House's relation of the changing feudal world around Assisi and Perugia to the papal-German battles in Italy and the rise of the mercantile class into which Francis was born. Also, the chapter that looks into the early spirituality of the first friars adds valuable understanding to what must have inspired many to take up the evangelical and mendicant challenge.The excursion into the Middle East, especially the siege of Damietta, remains helpful for an appreciation of the never-ending cruelty of warfare in this contentious region, but you do lose sight as a reader of the place of this episode within the immediate experience of Francis' diplomatic apostolate. In later stretches of the narrative, the debate over poverty receives important attention, but the machinations of the friars replacing the discipline of the Order's founder with a more pragmatic system needed further explanation, as did the claim by House that the refusal of the Third Order to bear arms for a lord undermined the whole feudal structure and helped advance the power of the middle class. Certainly, the latter theory deserves much more depth than House gives to it here.The few photos are excellent. One in particular, near to the life of the saint, shows his face hallowed out like an El Greco figure, if not as elongated, seemingly hunched over and suffering with an individuated expression as if drawn by one who knew him. It speaks eloquently for a man who, while praising nature, punished his Brother Ass of a body into an early death.Such a contradiction, House only can hint at, stands as his legacy."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"Read the Saint, Founder and Prophet, the most exhaustive and complete compendium of source documents on the life and spirituality of St. Francis. Adrian House references documents contained in this compendium in his creative interpretation of what is actually known about St. Francis. In particular, his discussion of St. Francis' sexuality bears no resemblance to the source documents from which he says that he obtained his background information. It is true that the Church rushed to canonize Francis and so the Church authorized biography by Thomas of Celano was very one sided and lacking in candor, especially concerning Francis' life before conversion. However, subsequent second hand accounts of Francis' life as well as critical writings and analysis by many scholars and historians have provided perspective, at least sufficient in scope to paint a consistent portrait in key lifestyle areas. Adrian House writes well and his perspective is interesting, but it's very far from a reasonable, scholarly interpretation of the best source information available. His reference to credible sources may lead the reader to believe that what House writes as fiction is supported by historical fact. Read the sources and make up your own mind."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"A work at last that captures brilliantly both the human and the spiritual in Francis of Assisi. In the chapter on Clare alone, for example, House throws great light on and debunks completely the relationship between the two as romantic or physical. It may have begun that way for Clare--she was, after all, only seventeen when they met, House tells us--but she quickly intuited the transcendent, divine nature of it (hence, the essence of her greatness)and went on to found the Poor Clares as we know them today. Placing Francis squarely in the confusing, violent, and hedonistic tendencies of his time, House does not shy away from pointing out the incredible strength, courage and overwhelming devotion to God that it took for Francis to resist and undo all that to become the world's greatest saint. Is his not the REAL revolution we are all looking for today in the confusing, violent, and hedonistic times we live in?"},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"After visiting Assisi recently, I became fascinated and motivated to learn more about the life of Saint Francis. Most important, I was looking for a biography that would attempt to pierce through legend to find historical facts, while at the same time giving respect to the religious life and saintly accomplishments of Francis. This book exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend it. Very accessible, very easy to read, sequenced logically, and informative."},{"Title":"Francis of Assisi: A Revolutionary Life","review":"Powerful details of this saint's life. First to receive the stigmata. His prayer composition which begins, \\"Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace...\\" was known by me my entire life before realizing it was penned by St. Francis.

The 50 Coolest Movies of All Time","review":"I discovered this book through JoBlo's website, and it's a wonderful take on all of our fave films. Jo not only gives a fair and honest review to some of the best movies out there, he includes fascinating tidbits on &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; action, as well as why he found each film so engrossing. It's as well-written as the reviews you find on his website, each chapter endowed with Jo's razor-sharp humour and wit.I've recommended this book to all of my fellow film-loving friends.

It sits on my shelf with Ebert's HATED, HATED, HATED classic and one or two others.As a fledgling film critic myself (http://www.reel-reviews.net), it has proved incredibly helpful.

Critics trying to be smart, trying to see the artsy in everything.Well, with Berge G., it's all different. He presents the 50 Coolest Movies of All Time, and his book definitely is the Coolest Review Book of All Time. What makes the difference is that this man is a movie buff himself -- he knows what he's talking about.

The critique's are fun and easy to read, and the 'what's cool' and film tidbits are pretty interesting. The book is written in a chatty, internet style, and thus, feels very casual. Overall, a fun, quick read."},{"Title":"JoBlo.com Presents... The 50 Coolest Movies of All Time","review":"Joblo has done something interesting with this book.

Some movies I have never given a thought about seeing were reviewed in that little black book of movie goodness and he convinced me to lay down the money to rent them.

He attacks them from an everyman perspective. As much as I love very intellectual dissections of films, I also love his approach. The inclusion of absolute classics from the likes of the Coen Brother's (&quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;) and John Woo (&quot;Face/Off&quot;) side by side is massively refreshing. I personally become frustrated when reading a positive review of a movie I loathe, but his reviews are never heavy handed.

Sholokhov captures the breath and sweep of the steppes of Russia as he draws the reader into maelstrom of the First World War, the Russian Revolution and Civil War. It is a time and a land that was caught between the modern industrialized West and the near medieval Russia- Cossack Calvary charging German machine guns, the slash of sabers, and the incongruity of machine guns mounted on ox carts.But more than a story of war, this is a story of people. Sholokhov creates for us characters who we deeply care about. The doomed love affair between the protagonist Gregor and Aksinia is both filled with passion and heartache. We even come to care about Akisina husband, the brutal Stephen, We see them caught up in catastrophic events far beyond their control. Although often cited and an apologist for Stalin, I wondered as I read it why it was published in Soviet Union. Our hero Gregor is first swept up on one side of this conflict to the other- clearly he is not a dedicated revolutionary, but just a man trying to survive in a conflict he cannot comprehend. It is a story of survival, love, and revenge. Since my last reading of this novel probably fifteen years ago, I can still vividly picture in my mind the word images that Sholokhov crafted with his pen. Images as simple as the flies settling on the ceiling of the peasants hut, to Stephen brutally stomping his wife Aksinia. His description of the First World War is brutal, perhaps surpassing Remarques All is Quiet on the Western Front.Russians write great novels and this is one of the best. If you are unfamiliar with Russian literature you would do well to read Quiet Flows the Don as your first Russian novel."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"Hailed as the best war novel to emerge from the Soviet, Sholokhov's epic has indeed solidified its position in world literature as a must read for those interested in the art of war. Yet, far more than a mere war novel, And Quiet Flows the Don, just as War and Peace had done, masterfully combines the men's martial vigor with the delicate sentimentalities that question war. The blend of peace fades into this gnawing passion in soldiers' bones as they march off to fight under some cause, a cause that has only become too hazy for name. Dedicated to the Cossacks who have resided by the Don for ages, Sholokhov follows a young Cossack's journey into the unknown terror of war. And Gregor Melekov's personal tragedy, blends w/ an array of Cossack characters: swindlers in love, Red Guards with a faith...the plot may appear too scattered at times, yet following Tolstoy's grand tradition to capture a supreme idea through the chasms of minute details, Sholokhov depicts the anguish of a people too wrapped up in honor, unable to cope with the nascent order of New Russia, regretful about allegiance to the Czar who ensured tensile peace, and ultimately lost to themselves as to &quot;mistake each other for the enemies&quot;. We are taught that war does such to people, is peace to heal the wound then? I have yet to conclude this epic w/ The Don Flows Home to the Sea, but the glimpse of peace and yearning for tranquility have long glittered in the eyes of Gregor and his brothers/comrades, exhausted by struggles. A wonderful folk style book that brings one closer to the true picture of Cossack life--acquaint one w/ their lust, their yearning, their cowardice, and their courage."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"Sholokov's \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" is one of the best novels to come out of the milieu of the old Soviet Union. A truely Russian novel and well worth reading both for it's own sake and for the insight into the time of the First World War, the Revolution and the Civil War that followed. I've owned and enjoyed this book for many years.However, when looking to pick up a copy of this book, CHECK THE PUBLISHER CAREFULLY and make sure you order a version that's what you think it is. The reason for this is....Amazon associates reviews of a book with many different versions of the same book from different publishers. Unfortunately for us customers, Amazon is seeing a growing plague of new Print-On-Demand Publishers who are specialising in reprinting copyright-expired books. Such as \\"And Quiet Flows the Don.\\" Some of these publishers produce quite good quality books, some do not. What you do need to do is check the publisher carefully for all these older \\"copyright expired\\" books.A fine example of the \\"not good quality\\" is the imprint of \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" published by General Books LLC. The version published by General Books LLC is scanned in using OCR technology (and using pretty poor quality OCR scanning equipment and software from the look of their books), is overall of very poor print quality, uses automated reproduction with no index, no illustrations and an excessive number of typos.To quote some specifics from the publisher's own web site:\\"We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check. Our OCR software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....After we re-typeset and designed your book, the page numbers change so the old index and table of contents no longer work. Therefore, we usually remove them. Since many of our books only sell a couple of copies, manually creating a new index and table of contents could add more than a hundred dollars to the cover price....Our OCR software can't distinguish between an illustration and a smudge or library stamp so it ignores everything except type. We would really like to manually scan and add the illustrations. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies....We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book. We would really like to manually scan each page and buy multiple copies of each original. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies.....\\"General Books LLC are flooding Amazon with these low quality publications (450,000+ listed under General Books LLC so far) and, unfortunately, many of them have the reviews associated with the original or with better quality imprints associated with them. The For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in an unfortunate purchasing decision.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another book, and they've used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first)."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"I am very surprised to see that there are not more reviews of this book. Either it shows that people are too drawn to this magnificent work to leave behind the world Sholokhov created, even for a moment to type, or that not too many people are reading this life changing novel because they are not aware of it. I am very reticent on writing reviews, since I do not find my pen to be adequate enough to motivate fellow Amazonians to give my tastes a chance. Anyhow, since I am so spell bounded by Sholokhov's world, I could not any longer sit in the shadow and silence my voice.I am still reading \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" and momentarily I am on Volume 3 of this epic tale (and it cannot get any bigger than this, well maybe Tolstoy, but even the \\"Silent Don\\" is a different caliber than good old \\"War and Peace\\"). I am sure the translator of \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" must have spent years performing the task of translation. The sheer amount of detailed description evokes such intense emotions and vividness that the reader cannot but live in the world Sholokhov created. The best way to put it in simple terms is that \\"one is there, or rather the Don is here.\\" How much love, meticulous care and tenderness went into developing, writing and presenting the story of the Don Cossacks in the midst of the First World War, the Russian Revolution and then the Civil War is incomparable to any work I have encountered. Though, while I have to state that Mann is my favorite novelist, \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" has to be my favorite novel (so far). Do not be fooled by those who say that this is Communistic propaganda. Serious minded ironists always masked themselves in order to raise sensations and satire of the dominant discourse.Sholokhov's epic is bar none the best narrative I have come across, period. Granted, there are many avid readers who adhere to peculiar authors and works, who will from the first get-go choose to disagree with me on my praise of Sholokhov, I am only exuding my affections and gratitude to Sholokhov for having offered the world an absolute beautiful tale of life. This is Realism at its best. Sure, we can all debate whether an author can depict reality objectively, or purely from a perceived account; but still this does not suffice for me to avoid the Silent Don tale.

Sholokhov won the Nobel Prize for this novel of war and revolution among the Don Cossack host. Although painted across a backdrop of history, it is primarily the love story of Gregor and Aksinya. As much of great 20th century Russian literature, the style harks back to Tolstoy, but the subject matter is undeniably Soviet. Published in 1929, \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" was the pinnacle of Sholokhov's career. He never again produced a work to compare, although to be fair to him, his career coincided with the height of Stalinist conformity in the arts. This was an era when simply being a famous writer was dangerous - think of the careers of Pasternak, Babel, and Pilnyak.

Life during moments of peace-whether long or fleeting is given exquisite touch through the characters who cannot avoid the war around the corner. This epic story grapples with the blindness of war where people engage in killing each other even after they have forgotten the causes and purpose of the war, regarding instead those close by as the real enemies when in reality they are fighting for the enemy who are those who manipulated them into war. Union Moujik, War and Peace can be seen in this story and go further to compliment this insatiable topic of war, peace and diplomacy. I liked the message these books carry whether consciously or unconsciously."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"Mikhail Sholokhov is not a name that rolls of the tongue. It should. He was a brilliant writer from a preternaturally early age. His multi seried novel starting with \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" first published in the 1930's is a wonderful, mesmerizing journey into Cossack life on the precipice of the Great War and on to the Russian revolution. Despite it's sympathetic and quite human tone it was both heavily censored by the new Soviet government AND reversed by Stalin who is said to have loved the books.There continues to be questions about whether or not Sholokhov wrote it or copied it. In either case someone wrote a great book! The people of the \\"The Don\\" are extraordinary, indecent, savage, romantic, traditional, loving, violent, spiteful, superstitious and full of intrigue. No one is spared from Sholokhov's pen as men are rapists, opportunists while hard working and sincere. Women have a very short end of the stick but still display a broad range of raw emotion.Sholokhov pulls several interesting ploys. He portrays the calm of the flowing Don to lull the reader into seeing the people as similarly placid and living much as they had forever but they are clearly not. There is much conflict and emotion that boils through. He takes interesting long tangents where a seemingly throw away character will be writing diary entries about life and war only to let us observe through that person what a main character is doing on the battlefield. Then he takes us through some of the same scene from the main character's viewpoint. And finally the two characters; in this case Yevgeny Listnisky and Grigory Melekhov ultimately meet again in a very intense scene.There are so many images stuck in my head of village life, army camps with salty language and lamentable deeds and of course the underlying challenge to Czarist power that creates yet more tension. At it's heart this one seriously messed up romance with heaps of betrayal, denial, anger and of course passion.Loved it. On to book II in 2012."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"Mikhail Sholokhov won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1965, primarily based on the writing of this book in 1928. It is an epic novel; the story of the Don Cossacks and the impact upon them of some of the most tumultuous events of the 20th Century: the First World War, the Communist revolution in Russia which ended that country's participation in the war, and the ensuing civil war thereafter, between the \\"Reds\\" (the revolutionary forces) and the \\"Whites\\" (the forces of the old, Czarist order.) The Cossacks were the legendary warriors who had mastered the tactics of the cavalry; and, at one time or another had struck fear into most European armies. (They were also \\"the enforcers,\\" who were often called upon to help quell internal dissent in Czarist Russia). Only once in the book did Sholokhov hint of their origins: they were serfs who had fled their \\"masters.\\" And they settled along the Don River, one of the great ones of Russia, and with the Volga River, flows into the Black Sea. One of the most extraordinary aspects of this novel is that Sholokhov wrote it less than a decade after these cataclysmic events; that Stalin was in power, definitely an \\"enforcer\\" in is own right, with strong views of how the past should be represented; and that Sholokhov is relating the story of those who, in very large measure, fought on the side of the losing \\"Whites\\" in the Civil War (although, for sure, as the book depicts, there were numerous exceptions.)The book starts on the Melekhov farm in the village of Tatarsk, on the Don River. During the last war with Turkey, Melekhov brought back a Turkish \\"wife\\" who genes would be passed into the family line, and there are repeated references to the family's Turkish features throughout the book. The first third of the book describes village life during two years of peace, from 1912 to 1914. If there is a principal character in the book it is Gregor Melekhov. The loves and hates of the village are described, including his adulterous affair with his neighbor's wife, Aksinia, and his ill-stared marriage to Natalia Korshunova. Woven into this section are insights into the economic structure of village life. Perhaps the most impressive aspect is the author's evocative depictions of the natural world, which recalls the nature writing of Joseph Wood KrutchThe Best Nature Writing of Joseph Wood Krutch. Sholokhov only foreshadows \\"the Gathering Storm\\" of World War I on a couple of occasions, and uses the character of Osip Stockman, a dedicated Bolshevik, to foreshadow the coming Communist revolution. I believe this portion of the book is the strongest, and most coherent, and could be a stand-alone book.War does come, and Sholokhov's depiction of it, mainly of the small unit fighting involving the Cossacks, rivalsErich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front (Bloom's Modern Critical Interpretations). As one other reviewer noted, there are some powerful passages, such as: \\"He had no cap, nor had he the upper part of his cranium, for it had been cut clean away by a shard of shrapnel. In the empty brain-pan, framed by damp strains of hair, glimmered rose-coloured rain-water.\\" The larger picture of war is omitted, and although a large portion of this section is devoted to the beginning of the war, the disastrous (for the Russians) Battle of Tannenberg is omitted. This battle is depicted in excruciating detail in Solzhenitsyn'sAugust 1914For many Americans, the classic movie and book about this period isDr Zhivago / Movie [VHS] In the next section, the one of the Revolution, there is a scene that must have inspired one of the more powerful scenes from the movie. This is when the Russian armies are disintegrating, and there is a tense confrontation between the men who want to go home, and the officers who want them to keep fighting the Germans. Sholokhov has the officer standing on a wooden barrel, lecturing the troops, and it was the decisive action of only one soldier which turned the tide in favor of the revolution. Worse is to come, and Sholokhov describes it well: the Civil War, the \\"brother against brother,\\" as whole Cossack villages were literally torn apart.I agree with many of the 4-star reviewers in that there were perhaps too many characters, and too many loose ends. But, for me, that is the essence of the epic novel, as well as real life: the bit parts, the major actions, and life goes on, without any neat summation or redeeming purpose. It was a wonderful re-read, after 43 years, and still merits my original verdict of 5-stars."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"This is a book about the Don Cossacks and the end of their centuries old way of life due to the Soviet revolution and the - almost disregarded in the West - long Civil War with the \\"White Russians\\" that ensued immediately afterwards. This is a review of a novel; so, for those prospective readers who haven't the faintest idea as to where the river Don lies or what exactly a Cossack may be, please to consult a map and historical source. This review would be far too long were I to attempt to delve into Cossack history.Maxim Gorki - quoted on the cover of my edition - says that the only book to which this one can be compared is Tolstoy's War And Peace. Unfortunately, he is right. This book, for all that is to be said for it, is simply not of the same calibre as War And Peace. In War And Peace, we have the characters of Pierre and Natasha whom - through Tolstoy's deeply percipient eye - we come to know, suffer along with and love. Here, we have Gregor and Aksinia whom - Be honest with yourself! - we end up pitying, if even that. The problem with this work as a novel is that a wall exists between the modern, Western reader and the characters, the Cossacks, who are given to about as much introspection as the animals they tend. The only \\"character\\" that truly shines in this novel is the Don region itself, for which the reader does develop a sense of the deeply instinctual way in which the Cossacks loved it.Sholokhov paints scenes worthy of a water-colourist or Breughel, differing as the setting and landscape suits:\\"The day declined to its close. The September stillness lulled peacefully and with inexpressible sweetness. The sky had lost its full summer gleam and was a hazy dove-colour...Held down to their huts and their daily round, the people pined in their labour, exhausted their strength on the threshing-floor; and the road, a deserted, yearning track, flowed across the horizon into the unseen.\\"Even in the midst of war, in this description of a decapitated Cossack, Sholokhov retains this water-colourist touch:\\"He had no cap, nor had he the upper part of his cranium, for it had been cut clean away by a shard of shrapnel. In the empty brain-pan, framed by damp strains of hair, glimmered rose-coloured rain-water.\\"The novel eventually becomes more than a bit of a slog, as the same sorts of characters do the same sorts of things under the same sorts of conditions. Nevertheless, I do recommend the book. Flowing beneath all the bestial actions, lilac prose and insufferable characters is a very Russian undercurrent of fatalism concerning a way of life drawing its last breath:\\"The grass grows over the graves, time overgrows the pain. The wind blew away the traces of those who had departed; time blows away the bloody pain and the memory of those who did not live to see their dear ones again - and will not live, for brief is human life, and not for long is any of us granted to tread the grass.\\""},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"...but a good one nevertheless.Sholokhov's And Quiet Flows the Don provides valuable insight into the culture of the Don Cossacks. The reader is allowed to glimpse how the people of the Don see themselves and their immediate neighbors: Russians, Ukrainians, and (to a lesser extent) Kuban Cossacks. The reader get's a good sense of Cossack village life and the relationships between various social classes.The author doesn't do a very good job of character development: characters seem almost \\"wooden\\" and their passion feels like a construction, not natural. So it is harder to empathize with the protagonist, Grisha Melekhov or the propagandist Ilia Bunchuk. The author's attempt to preach Soviet propaganda to his audience is annoying, but it doesn't interfere with the plot too much. The reader gets a sense at the end of the story that a big change is coming, and that village life in Tatarsk will never be the same again once the Soviet government is established.This is not the best novel out there about the Cossacks or the Russian Revolution. Nikolai Gogol's novelette Taras Bulba is much shorter, but has better character development and does a better job of conveying the passion of the Cossacks in their fight against injustice. For a novel on the Russian Revolution, try Boris Pasternak's Dr. Zhivago. Character development is superb: the audience can empathize with the protagonist Yuri Zhivago, and the author does a masterful job showing the transformation of the revolutionist Pasha Antipov into the new Soviet Man Strelnikov."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"The page size is 7.5 x 9.5 inches but the text is centered on each page and measures only 5 x 3 inches, so the book is much larger than it needs to be.

It reminds us of how some struggles have not changed in 90 years."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"I first read The Quiet Don in high school (1977) and have reread it twice since. I have to agree with the positive tone in the other reviews. This novel's powerful characters and scenes combine to make an unforgettable experience. It is remarkable it was even published given its political ambivalence. Socialist Realism it isn't. If you like this work I think you'll also like Konstantin Paustovsky's Story Of A Life."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"Sholokov's most famous work is, as it's heralded to be, an epic, almost complete story of the lives of the Cossacks during the Russian Revolution. This must have been a very daunting topic to cover in a novel. I could not imagine coming to a typewriter and trying to encapsulate so many emotions and nuances from a time of such uncertainty and upheaval. Sholokov, however, was up to the challenge, and carefully shaded scenes follow one after the other, genuinely penetrating the minds of his people in all their complexities. So in that respect Sholokov succeeded with rare precision. However, the book overall was largely clunky and unfocused. The first third, very entertaining, lays out what you think are to be the main characters, and sort of mixes them together with soap opera-esque contrivances. Once the war begins, however, the story gets smudged. Characters are introduced and never fleshed-out, there is a weak sense of cohesion, and the story stops being a story, and turns into a docu-novel without a through-line, or much of anything that the reader can hold onto. The war in all its terror is convincingly portrayed, but it doesn't have a face or a heartbeat. One gets the sense that this is a book to return to every so often, to get a better idea of its intensities, but at the same time the prospect is uninteresting. This is a must-read for anyone interested in highbrow Soviet writers, or the time period in Eastern Europe, but general readers would do better to divert themselves to Solzhenitsyn."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"I put off reading \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\" for a variety of reasons but I decided to tackle it on a cruise earlier this month. I found that the book started well and moved along well. The characters were interesting but not compelling. It was hard to find anyone to cheer for; these folks have more than their share of shortcomings. One of their prime faults is something I come across in a lot of Eastern European novels; battered women. There's a supposed hero in this novel who steals another man's wife and then beats the daylights out of her later on when she has an affair with another man. That was one of the better romantic situations in the book. I've come to accept that it was a cultural thing but it doesn't make for endearing characters.I found out a lot of interesting things about the Eastern Front in WWI although I suspect it was mostly fiction. The Russian presence in WWI was marked by large numbers with minimal armaments. The were a lot more victories in this book that I suspect there were in the War itself. Still, I enjoyed the varying alliances and the detailed examination of the breakdown of morale and support.The Russian Revolution emerges rather swiftly as it did in history. However, we are totally unprepared for the events because Sholokhov gives us next to nothing of the political and economic factors leading to the uprising. There was one scene I recall in which a paragraph was spent telling how a political agitator explained the economic injustices of the existing government. We got no specifics; just a mention that the soldiers and workers were educated to their oppression. I got the sense that Mikhail Sholokhov wrote the books without any politics in it and added some here and there later on to get it through the censors. There are speeches referenced but not much specific dogma given. Personally, I figured that Communism was a hard enough sell so why drag an otherwise decent book down in order to \\"explain\\" it. There are characters that agitate for the cause but there are no Strenlikovs in \\"And Quiet Flows the Don\\". Pasternak had the knack, Sholokhov didn't.I thought the closing section on the Civil War was interesting. To me, the Russian Civil War that lasted through much of the 1920's is one of the most overlooked events of the 20th Century. For that reason, I will not take so long to get around to reading the next book in the quartet, \\"The Don Flows Home to the Sea\\"."},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"My order was taken care of in a prompt and efficient manner.

The GREAT tragedy in this book is their love affair, the primal. visceral, elemental love of Bunchuk for Anna and the horror of his stunned self negating nether world of mourning, Nothing in the book equals the strength of that narrative in this opinion--and there, the author walked with the greatest of the great Russian Authors despite the Stalionist stench that permeates the attempt at poetry and philosophical substance in the idealistic musings of young Anna.A brutal book to say the least. I think the character dialogues are the best parts of this book and I think the author should have attempted a play here and there--perhaps approaching Chekov. What was missing from this book? ---That was a scene that one thought was definitely going to happen And that was a final visit to the general's mansion by Gregor. You may say he delt with that in the final and rough hewn leaving of a desperate Aksina--I think not because she was ever on his mind even in pitched battles or their aftermath. NOT his wife--always Aksina. The general's 8000 acres and his Czarist officer son whom Gregor beat up---should have played into the end of this novel----perhaps the sequel may have it, but it surely was missing here.There was symbolic mood coloring in pastoral and animal discriptions- and how this author loves the color 'lilac'.A Good read, I hope the sequel is as good----BUT the author was a revered commie---and sooner or latre the party line finds its way in to Soviet era literature--"},{"Title":"And quiet flows the Don (A Borzoi book)","review":"A story about village Cossacks who lived through the first world war, followed by the Russian Revolution, it seems to be modeled upon War and Peace. Despite very negative presentations of women and some Sovietized propaganda throughout, it does provide a view of the Cossack life and culture.

Furthermore, if you believe your security worries are over because you are running a firewall, then you also must read this book.The role of firewalls in computer security is only one of the topics covered. Other points are the limitations of firewalls, some of the tactics used by hackers to break into systems and how some of the features of firewalls are implemented. These topics are critical to the effective use of a firewall in the securing of a personal system. Like most other instances of complex technology, it is necessary to understand some of the inner workings of firewalls if you are to use them efficiently. Also, this will help you understand the security holes that they do not cover, or may not cover if improperly configured. In many ways, this is the most important information found in the book.In computer security, a false sense of security is the worst position to be in. To have any valid sense of security, you must also be paranoid, trusting no one and no thing until proven otherwise. After reading this book, you will still be paranoid, even after installing a firewall. However, at least now you will know many of the things that you should be paranoid about."},{"Title":"Personal Firewalls for Administrators and Remote Users","review":"What a fascinating idea, a book about personal firewalls. The book tries to do a review TCP, the principles of information security and what firewalls are and by trying to cover too much fails to meet the promise of its title. It doesn't cover personal firewalls in any depth, but it does have an important purpose. There are a number of small business and home office owners that simply do not understand the importance of a firewall or a personal firewall. The language in the book is clear, friendly and approachable. The work is designed to be understood and is a quick read, which is important for a small business owner that will only invest so much time learning about firewalls and security. I learned about a firewall I had never heard of, Kerio, but the book doesn't cover Tiny, one of the most important personal firewalls. For someone in information security already, this is probably two stars, but for someone with a small office wondering what a firewall is and if they need one, I would be very comfortable recommending this book. Lisa Yeo has the potential to be a great writer, she seems to have a knack for covering a topic with just the number of words needed. I would encourage her to try again, personal firewalls is a topic that needs to be covered, but next time do it with a strong technical review team.The book layout is one of the better jobs I have seen, the font is easy on the eyes and large enough to actually read. They do a fascinating trick where code examples and notes are allowed to extend further into the left margin than the text of the book.

A lot has changed for the better in that time.The method allows someone with average woodworking skills and a nominal disdain for the dangers of chemical coatings to create a boat that can provide generations of pleasure without the continuing demands a wooden boat makes on time and wallet. This is not to say that such cold molded boats are maintenance free, nor inexpensive however!While much of Mr. Parker's book is related to the construction of a large (44 feet) boat, the information is invaluable regardless of boat size. It seems likely he would recommend something a bit smaller for your first attempt, but I got the feeling (I'm fighting the urge still) that even I could build that cruiser and head for the Caribbean.The technical information alone, replete with careful practical and experiential considerations, makes the volume well worth adding to your bookshelf if you are planning on making, rather than buying, a boat, or if you just enjoy the pleasures of fleshing out your dreams with a significant bit of knowledge and an understanding of craftsmanship.If you are serious about wooden boats, whether to dream of or build, I would put this on the shelf together with titles by John Gardner, Samuel Devlin, Iain Oughtred and John Brooks & Ruth Ann Hill."},{"Title":"The New Cold-Molded Boatbuilding : From Lofting to Launching","review":"I was been in the boat building industry for many years, read many books on the subject, and have been building a few myself since then, but Reuel B.

This form of marketing was common in America during the years just before and after the Civil War. A typical salesman's sample consists of sample sheets in a sample binding. Sometimes these sheets are in a prepublication state and thus may have bibliographic interest. A customer could choose among alternative styles of binding, and a sample book usually includes the spines of available styles mounted inside the covers. The sample book might also include a printed prospectus describing the virtues of the work or edition with recommendations from well-known persons. Most specimen books also include blank forms on which the salesman entered the names, addresses, sometimes occupations, and the number of copies his subscribers agreed to purchase.

The characters are well developed and the supporting cast is terrific. There are many great one-liners and the accompanying music is enjoyable. I consider this movie one of the best romantic comedies of the 90s. However, MGM has only occassionally produced outstanding DVDs. Unfortunately, this DVD has some artifacts, pixelation, and bare bones content. I was disappointed in the visual and sound quality for a film made so recently (within the last ten years). I would recommend this DVD only if you are a big fan of this film or don't demand quality and rich content in your DVDs."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; may not be the greatest movie in the history, but it surely is the best modern romantic comedy I ever saw. The only film that can possibly surpass this delightful one is, perhaps, &quot;When Harry Met Sally ...&quot; Maybe tied.Hugh Grant has starred in many films since then, but his best role is still Charles of this film, who unwittingly finds his love in Carrie, an open-hearted American played by beautiful Andie MacDowell at his friend's wedding. One miatake is, he foolishly couldn't realize it before he let her go after one-night stand. But as the number of ceremony goes up (including one funeral), he gradually comes to notice that he threw away the best thing in his life. And while he is wondering what to do, friends around him start to search for their real love, including his own brother David, his timid friend Tom, Tom's sister Fiona, and Charles's eccentric roommate Scarlet. But where should Charles go? Going back to his countless ex-girlfriends? Or, Carrie? But she got already married.To be honest, a little abrupt ending of the film damages an entire movie's strength a bit, but all comedies have to pay the price to end the show within an appointed hour. What is incredibly splendid about &quot;Four Weddings&quot; is that the characters are all so lively and sparkling with witty dialogue that you think they are not acting at all. Actually, on top of Hugh Grant, many actors are still associated with the roles in this film even if they got more populality after this film; Kristin Scott Thomas is later to be nominated Oscar for her turn in &quot;English Patient,&quot; but she will be remembered as deliciously aristocratic Fiona. John Hannah made his name popular through the Hollywood blockbuster series of &quot;Mummy,&quot; but still he is kind-hearted Matthew to those who have seen him recite W H Auden (most touching moment) in &quot;Four Weddings.&quot; This is that kind of film that changes the cast's life. It happens once in your lifetime.With this great ensemble cast, we have fantastic script by Richard Curtis, filled with funny lines uttered by completely believable characters. He does not fail to take great care of minor characters, and give them equally good moments. Look how Serena, in love with handsome David who is hearing impaired, learns sign. Trying to impress him, she mixes up &quot;nice&quot; with &quot;mice,&quot; but, you know, when boys and girls are in love. nothing can stop them from understanding each other. Cute.Brilliantly written, &quot;Four Weddings&quot; is a superb model of romantic comedy. If you like this type of movie, you surely will fall in love with it; and if you're not, your mind will be changed just like mine (I didn't expected much from it, so I didn't go to theater until the last day). And the film never forgets the sad side of life as the title implies. Sad thing is one of the cast Charlotte Coleman, who played most unconventional bridesmaid Scarlett, has passed away recently. She is terrific."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This was a very good movie. Hugh Grant is charming and funny in a clumsy way. Andie MacDowell is cute and charming as well. The cast as a whole is terrific. I recommend this movie to all. The DVD on the other hand, was very poor. I have watched a lot of DVDs in the past year and this was one of the worst. I felt like I was watching a VHS tape. The picture was very bland and the colors were muted. I know the English are pale, but this DVD transfer did not do them any justice. On top of the poor video quality, the sound was just as awful. The volume was very low, and jumpy at times. The dialog at times didn't come through clearly and there was no use of the surround channels. This movie could use a thorough update to the entire pakage. A new video transfer, a new audio 5.1 channel mix and some extras would have made this a top DVD. Instead MGM decided to skip all the goodies technology has to offer to keep the price of this DVD down. Too Bad, Its a Great Movie."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"As a movie I will rate it 4 stars, but the video quality is very bad, lot of artifacts, blury images, MGM transfer is really a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"The 1994 movie, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", was an international box office hit and the pioneer in the film genre known as the 'Romantic Brit-Com'. This is a genre of usually small budget, comedic films, that are about the romantic lives of good looking, young Brits (usually with a close group of witty, quirky, supportive friends), who must overcome self-doubt and bad timing to make true love happen. A good number of these films star British actor, Hugh Grant and have been written (and sometimes directed) by Richard Curtis (\\"Notting Hill\\" \\"Love Actually,\\" \\"Bridget Jones\\"). Curtis has been so involved in this genre, that he's basically been annoited \\"King of the Romantic Brit-Coms\\". \\"Four Weddings\\" was pretty much the first of these films. This movie mostly takes place at public events, which are of course the \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" in the title. In the film we meet Charles (Hugh Grant) and his close knit group of quirky, witty, supportive friends. We never find out what they do for a living, what their backgrounds are and only get hints of how they know each other. It's as though we are guests at a wedding meeting these people for the first time. What we do find out is that Charles seems to be a perennial wedding guest/Best-Man. He has great doubts about his troubled romantic life and wonders if he is ever destined to meet, that one special person, who he might actually marry. He also always seems to be putting his foot in his mouth and getting into embarassing comic situations (I love the scene, where he gets stuck at a table filled with all his ex-girlfriends!) At the first wedding he meets a glamorous American named, Carrie (played by a luminous, Andie MacDowell). They meet, flirt, even wind up in bed with each other over the course of the different public occasions. But of course because of self-doubt and bad timing, these characters can never really seem to get it together and declare their true love for each other. It's not hard to figure out how this all ends, but the long and winding road over the course of the four weddings and a funeral are quite funny, sad and interesting for all. This is due to the very funny and poignant script from Richard Curtis and sure direction from Mike Newell. The cast is top notch. Hugh Grant has a star making performance in the lead role. Other standout performances include actors Simon Callow as the gregarious, full of life, Gareth and John Hannah as Matthew, who just stops the film with an emotion filled eulogy. Kristin Scott Thomas is also very good as Charles' friend Fiona, who secretly pines for him. Finally, mention should be of British Comedian, Rowan Atkinson's short, but drop dead hilarious turn, as a very nervous, new Vicar, who can't seem to get the wedding vows right! (\\"Do you take Lydia Jane Hibbert to be your Awful wedded wife!\\") Originally, this film was released in a pretty primitive bare bones release. It has now been released in a newly minted, 'Deluxe Edition'. The picture is cleaned up and presented in widescreen. I thought the sound in this edition left a lot to be desired. The extras are wonderful. They include a full length commentary track from the filmmakers and a number of short documentaries and featurettes on the making of the film, that prove to be very interesting. But best of all are the deleted scenes (with commentaries), that flesh out the backgrounds of the characters a little more. This film is a wonderful romantic comedy, that leaves you wanting more. Great film! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This utterly charming, little British film took me completely by surprise the first time I saw it. I did not know what to expect going in, but I quickly found myself falling completely in love with it.The plot is structured around the five events mentioned in the title. A magnificent group of seven dear friends attends a string of weddings, none of them, unfortunately, involving any of the principles. Our focus is on Charles (Hugh Grant), a devilishly handsome man who is completely incapable of committing to marriage. He is, as an ex-girlfriend describes him, a \\"serial monogamist.\\"There is some hope, however, that that might change when Charles meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell), a beautiful American woman. He falls in love with her, and we suspect she might love him, too, but instead she gets engaged to Hamish (Corin Redgrave), a boring, but rich man, twice her age. Our hearts break along with Charles' because we know that she is making a mistake. He is too disappointed, though, and too afraid to do anything about it.There is something so pleasing about friendship in a movie. When it is done right, as it is here, it involves the audience in a way that most stories cannot. While watching this film, I could not help but wish that I knew them all better. Who wouldn't want a group of such trusted and wonderful friends? Because we like them, and because we feel we know them so well, the events in the film aren't just happening to somebody else. They are happening to us as well. That is why &quot;Four Weddings&quot; is so touching and so moving.The acting is nothing short of brilliant, especially the work done by Hugh Grant. Not since Cary Grant has an actor displayed such suave, British charm and natural good looks. He is a delight to watch and, no doubt, has an excellent future ahead for himself. Andie MacDowell is equally enchanting. She has never appeared as lovely in a movie before as she does here.The screenplay by Richard Curtis is extremely well written. The scenes have the ring of truth to them; the characters feel as real as anyone we know. The writing always hits just the right note, striking a delicate balance between moments of great humor and romance, as well as deep sadness.Mike Newell's direction is fine, never distracting us the center of the film: the characters and their words. At the same time, there are moments of inspired visual artistry. The sight of Charles arriving late for Carrie's wedding, standing alone in a broad, Scottish moor, is touchingly sad. Even better is the funeral chapel, stranded in a bleak, industrial wasteland, overlooking the dull, gray Thames. It is a very evocative and poignant moment.I do not want to give the impression that this is a sad film because it is not. At times it is rather hilarious, the romance is always enticing, and it does have a happy, if unexpected, ending. More importantly, all of its emotions are genuinely earned. &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; is one of the most delightful films I have seen in a long time."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"&quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; is one of the few romantic comedies I appreciate. It's a lovable, hilarious look at the wackiness of love and weddings. Andie MacDowell and Hugh Grant are fine leads, though MacDowell's character is written rather weakly. There really isn't much for her to do, except perform the duties of &quot;unrequited love interest&quot;. The other characters are very vivid, though. Hugh Grant truly shines in the role of his career as bumbling bachelor Charles, whose main characteristics consist of being late to weddings, stumbling over words, and fear of commitment to one woman. Grant is romantic and sympathetic without being coy, and I found myself falling in love along with Andie MacDowell! But the best part of the film is the supporting cast. I think it is responsible for the film's status as a comedy classic. Charlotte Coleman is perfect as fiery Scarlett, David Bower is hilarious as David, a bumbling bachelor like Charles, but lacking his suave charm, and Simon Callow is fondly memorable as flamboyant Gareth, perhaps the funniest of them all. My favorite performance, however, is that of Kristin Scott Thomas. As the icy, longing Fiona, she's an understated revelation. Director Mike Newell has called her performance the best of the film, and I agree. Scott Thomas is a great ensemble player (see &quot;Gosford Park&quot;), and here's hoping she lands another comedy soon.There is a pitiful lack of special features on this DVD, but at half the price of most, it's still worth owning. A movie this fun doesn't need lots of extras to justify its purchase."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"It is worth it to watch this for the wonderful, warm portrayals of Gareth and Matthew, the zingy Scarlett, the brittle but brilliant Fiona.But what an odd storyline. We're supposed to believe that Charles truly loves Carrie. Er, what for? The character Fiona has a one-word dismissal of Carrie that should have stopped the action right there.Interestingly, Fiona, for all her bad luck in her love life, is the best judge of character, with the most insight, in the film. She alone of the main characters knows that Matthew and Gareth are in a couple and is comfortable commenting on it, she alone has the courage to criticize the woman (who turns out to be a jerk)that Charles initially plans to marry. When the writers went to so much work to show us that Fiona knows people and then expects us to suspend that knowledge it is difficult to root for Carrie and Charles as a couple.Reviewer after reviewer blames Andie for making Carrie bland and uninspiring. I think it is the fault of the writers. We don't know what Carrie does for a living, what her family is like (except for a brief speech she makes at her own wedding--no interaction, just the actress talking--again), anything about her except that she is a pretty tease (to be polite about it). In contrast, we know that Charles is devoted to his brother, that he has remorse about past relationships, that he can live with a woman without sleeping with her but wants a real relationship. &quot;Carrie&quot; never had a chance, no matter who played her.So, three stars for the subplots, none for the silly main plot, leaving us with an enjoyable but not great movie."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" (1994) a British romantic comedy/drama, caused something of a sensation upon its release. It broke all records for worldwide box-office take by a British picture: and not very many British pictures since have done as well. It was received rapturously by many important critics, and was nominated for a \\"Best Picture\\" Academy Award. It boosted the careers of its director, Mike Newell, and most of its talented cast members. It also made its star, Hugh Grant, flavor of the decade - and counting -- as leading man of any English-speaking romantic comedy. It put its author, Richard Curtis, at the head of what has since become an English cottage industry, the creation of romantic Brit-coms (see \\"Notting Hill,\\"\\"Love Actually,\\"etc.) Yet, when it was made, the budget was so tight that those glorious Scottish wedding scenes were all filmed in Hampshire, a Home County near London. And the numerous wedding scene extras were required to wear their own evening dress.Most everyone knows the plot, but here goes. Charles (Grant) is one of a group of young friends looking unsuccessfully, it seems, for love. Charles is commitment-phobic; yet he, his roommate, Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman), and the crowd seem to spend every Saturday going, late, to weddings, where they are frequently members of the wedding parties. Disastrous best man speeches are made, rings are forgotten. Then Charles spots the beautiful American Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at a wedding, and much yearning ensues. Carrie announces her engagement to, and marries, a rich, older Scot, Hamish (Corin Redgrave). But, of course, true love triumphs and triumphs and triumphs. There are viewers that consider MacDowell's performance too passive, but everyone agrees Grant created the perfect romantic English lead, shy, stuttering, hair in his eyes. Coleman, who unfortunately died much too young, in an asthma attack, made Scarlett touching and real. Redgrave, well, of course.The supporting cast was also uniformly excellent, and funny. Rowan Atkinson is hilarious in a small part as Father Gerald, priest in training. James Fleet does good work as Tom, the crowd's millionaire. Kristin Scott Thomas is beautiful, beautifully-dressed, witty, touching and intelligent as Tom's sister Fiona, who's unfortunate enough to love Charles. Theater stalwart Simon Callow shines as the gay Gareth; and, as for John Hannah, playing his lover Matthew; well, it's all been said, hasn't it. Though I'd add that I never yet have re watched this movie -- did so again last night--without being reduced to tears by his reading of WH Auden's \\"Funeral Blues\\" poem at Gareth's untimely funeral.If you love the movie, the Deluxe Edition is useful. Its extras are very helpful: Audio Commentary with filmmakers, \\"Wedding Planners\\" Documentary, \\"Two Actors and a Director\\" featurette, and the featurette on the making of the film. The deleted scenes are uniformly funny, too, and give us a bit more back-story of the characters, which the movie doesn't give us a lot of."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"I bought this book shortly after reading the screenplay of Notting Hill(also by Mr. Curtis and another beautiful volume). This book is fully worth reading, whether you are a fan of the film, the genre of romantic comedy, and even if you wish to learn the ins and outs of filmmaking. That said, the bonus sections, especially the scenes cut from the film, make this book more than just a &quot;companion&quot; piece and frankly, are the bits I keep going back to.All in all, the book makes for an enlightening look into how words on a page become a successful film."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Hugh Grant shines and Andie McDowell is incandescent in this Oscar nominated tale of a bumbling English fellow, his friends, the mysterious woman he continues to encounter at various events, and in the end, a relationship that is truly written in the stars. The comedy is deft, meaning not overwhelming, but contributes to the story in gentle, effective ways. And the \\"funeral\\" of the title is a powerful scene as it celebrates the life of one friend who unexpectedly dies in the course of the proceedings. That scene has been celebrated also for popularizing WH Auden's superb poem \\"Stop the Clocks\\" a raging masterpiece that offers affection, solace and condolence in a way few works have ever done since. In it, the character speaks Waugh's tragic words \\"He was my north, my south, my east and west My working week and my sunday best My moon, my midnight, my talk, my song I thought that love would last forever, I was wrong.\\" A splendid note of sadness in an otherwise delicious romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"I really laughed at this one. Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell's story line is hilarious, but I was really moved by the touching portrayals of the unconventional couple and other minor characters. A extremely pleasurable film! There are some flaws: I'm not a great fan of either Kristen Scott-Thomas or Andie, but they passed muster in this one. The wry sense of humor that prevails more than makes up for a couple of silly lines. All in all, though, the story kept it going...I'm still smiling!Grade: excellent!"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"It speaks to us...doesn't it?

Yes. It is a lesson we should all learn early in life - Listen to Your Heart!"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"OK so this film may have been on TV quite a few times now, but you need to own a copy too. It's one of those films you can watch time and time again without getting tired of it. Every time I have seen this I have picked up something new.The film centres around the character of Charles, played by Hugh Grant, who sees his friends getting married (and in one case dying) which causes him to think about his own relationships and what the future has in store for him, while all the time making witty (and sometimes silly) comments on his friends' actions.While Grant is undoubtedly the star, this is to some extent an ensemble piece and there are delightful performances from John Hannah and Simon Callow in particular. Watch out for the late Charlotte Coleman as well. Andie MacDowell is the American here, yet does not seem at all out of place in the curious world of eccentricity, class, and tomfoolery into which she is thrown (I can say this, I am English!).The script is just brilliant, by Blackadder/Vicar Of Dibley writer Richard Curtis, and is another element that makes you want to watch the film again and again.Finally, the film has one great thing to recommend it, and that is a sympathetic deaf character who does not appear to have been put in the film solely because of his disability, and who is served well by a script that neither patronises nor ignores his deafness."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Four Weddings and a Funeral is an extremely funny film. If the opening sequence doesn't make you laugh, nothing will. And conversely, if Matthew's moving rendition of W. H. Auden's &quot;Stop all the clocks. . .&quot; poem doesn't leave you close to tears, then you must be truly hard-hearted. Unfortunately though, what could have been an excellent comedy has a major flaw.Charles (Hugh Grant) is a likeable chap whose friends are all getting married, leaving him as a sort of perpetual Best Man. Then American Carrie (Andie MacDowell) enters the picture and causes Charles to reassess his thoughts on marriage. Grant has charisma in spades, but sadly MacDowell does not. In fact, she is perhaps one of the least charismatic actresses ever. Not only that, but the limit of her acting ability seems to be a toothpaste-advertisement-style smile. Fortunately the casting of Charles's motley collection of single friends is excellent, and one can't help thinking he would be better off marrying one of them.The film is almost fly-on-the-wall in its style, which gives it realism and allows it to explore the relationships within the group of friends on an intimate and everyday level. Hence the subtle humour works better than, for example, Rowan Atkinson's very obvious laugh-line attempts as a preacher with a penchant for Spoonerisms.As one character notes, weddings have a habit of blending together in the memory and the director has played on this, creating four weddings that are visually similar and yet distinct. And of one of them is particularly memorable for the fact that it doesn't actually include a marriage ceremony. At its conclusion the film shows that whilst marriage is a noble institution, it is not for everybody."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"EmmaThompson stated,&quot;that if Hugh Grant had not agreed to do &quot;Sense&amp;Sensability&quot; prior to &quot;Four Weddings&quot;,she never could have afforded him then.&quot; This film is the only one my husband and I agree on watching together,and we have many,many times. I recall dialogue and end up laughing outloud, even in public.It has an honesty that carries throughout the entire film.Especially the funeral. There is a core group of brillant actors from England that continue to perform and excite the senses and leave one fully surprised by their cameleon like abilities in film and on stage. Grant and MacDowell have the chemistry of those wonderful actors of the past. A delicious give and take, eyes sparkling, and yet we, the viewers get the 'moment' as well.This is a warm,witty and intelligent film not to be passed up for one's film archives."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"I've finally seen what people have said is the \\"best modern romantic comedy\\" around. They're joking? There might be that movie in this mess somewhere, but the script and editing kill it.Charles (Hugh Grant) is a very attractive character and nicely written in his strengths (friendship, openness to the possibility of true love) and flaws (perpetually late, a complete lack of discretion). Carrie (Andie MacDowell) is less engaging. For someone supposedly so \\"experienced\\" (she lists 33 lovers), she apparently has no idea what she's doing in her relationships. She's attracted to Charles from the beginning but does absolutely nothing to encourage him other than invite him to have sex with her. (If Charles is a \\"serial monogamist\\" then she's a \\"serial monogamist\\" who cheats.) It makes one wonder how much is really there, how long before she's explaining to Charles that it just isn't working out, and there's this new guy who's now the one. After all, according to the script as shown, they've barely talked to each other.The script is much too obvious. There are real clunkers of forced scenes including one where it feels like someone said \\"oh wait, we haven't made this person awful enough for what's about to happen to her so let's give her one really bitchy line.\\" Charles's friends are a fascinating group, but only good acting prevents them from being cardboard stereotypes.The film has no idea whether it's making meaningful statements about relationships or being a screwball farce. It could have been cut either way. As it is, it feels as deeply real and as cheaply funny as the unmoving waves in one backdrop."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"I had heard so many good things about this film that when I finally saw it, I was surprised to find it so very disappointing. The story revolves a group of people who constantly find themselves at weddings, and yet they themselves never get married. At one wedding Charles (Hugh Grant) is entranced by an American woman, Carrie (Andie MacDowell). Upon finding that they are staying at the same hotel, they end up in bed together. The following day Carrie returns to the States, leaving Charles forlorn and alone. A few months later Carrie turns up at another wedding, announcing that she's engaged to someone else. Nevertheless, she and Charles hop in the sack once more. Carrie then proceeds to marry her fiance, and Charles continues to pine for her, wondering if perhaps he should settle for any ordinary woman rather than wait for the perfect one.The entire plotline is rather shaky to begin with, though it could have been done well, with some tweaking. But the main problem is that the romance between Charles and Carrie just seems utterly unrealistic. They meet for the first time, barely speak two words to each other before sleeping together, and Carrie promtly leaves the next morning, and yet Charles is madly in love with her. Why? They have nothing in common, know nothing about each other, and have known each other for one day. Carrie's idea of conversation is detailing the bedroom talents of each of her 33 lovers. And she sleeps with one man while engaged to another!The movie is further dragged down by the fact that there is not a whit of chemistry between Grant and MacDowell. As I watched them, I felt... nothing. Not boredom or disdain, but just a big flat resounding nothing. Grant acted very well, and MacDowell did a passable job with a less-than-ideal role, but the two just don't work together. I know Grant can do a great romantic comedy - I've seen plenty of his other movies - but MacDowell is clearly not a good match.The rest of the cast was fairly good. In fact, I enjoyed the numerous sideline romances far more than the central one. There are many funny moments (though a couple of the jokes fall horribly flat), and even a couple touching ones, just not between the main characters where they should have been. I liked many of the other characters, and found myself rooting for their romantic success rather than Charles and Carrie's. They actually interact with each other, whereas the relationship between Carrie and Charles seems to be based only on the fact that they've slept together. The movie wasn't an entire waste, and connoisseurs of Hugh Grant should see it, but it's not one I myself would watch again.

Unfortunately, Fox and MGM video didn't see it that way and dusted off an ancient HD master, putting no TLC whatsoever into this Blu-ray release.This film deserves nothing less than a full 6k restoration from the original camera negatives and audio elements. What you get here instead is a wobbly, scratched, and dirty print with gobs of edge enhancement slapped on to try and beef up the inherent softness in the image. Don't let the extremely high average MPEG-4 video bitrate listed on the package fool you... it's the old adage of garbage in, garbage out.It reminds me a lot of the typical cruddy treatment Universal heaps upon its catalog titles (unless it happens to be named \\"E.T.\\" or \\"Jaws\\"... and then Laser Pacific does the work).It's nothing short of shameful."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This is the film that did it for me. The story is so good, so darn clever, and I find Hugh Grant's performance utterly charming. But Andie MacDowell spoiled this entire film for me. Most pick on the final scene where she utters the film's last line as confirmation of her bad acting, but I think the problem existed long before. It is just that she was so conspicuously bad in that particular scene. You couldn't ignore it. She absolutely shattered the mood, so I was picking off glass, and I could hear groans. Her voice was so bizarre, it was like someone farted during a period of reverence. Before watching this film, I had no opinion about Andie MacDowell, but afterwards, I concede I developed a definite animus. I'm forgiving with actors - as long as they don't ruin the story or are at least entertaining, I really don't care. I mean neither Jackie Chan or Jean-Claude Van Damme can act, but at least they have some modicum of credibility. I can't say that about Andie MacDowell. She ruined this entire film for me. I realized she could not emote during the scene when she was recounting her lovers. She was the star, the focus was on her. You could see Hugh Grant's obvious distress, but her face was as blank as a plate. No inflection. No nothing. Even her voice didn't sound natural. I didn't believe a word she said. If the producers had brought on someone who was at least human, or someone who could speak in more than a robotic voice, then this film would have been stellar. Andie MacDowell was good in sex, lies and videotape, because the character was stiff, frigid and emotionally stunted, but she hasn't been able to duplicate that caliber of performance (or her just being herself). Surprisingly, Andie MacDowell was actually nominated for a Golden Globe for this role. The Golden Globes have lost all credibility, and I have no doubt it would nominate a shoe sole if it can nominate Ms. MacDowell. The film could be good, but it was utterly ruined by Andie MacDowell, so I can't recommend it unless one wants to see how bad an actress she is. What I mourn is the loss of potential. This could have been a great film - only if she was removed. I would hire Andie MacDowell's agent in a heartbeat. He could sell anything."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This is an amusing movie. I ordered it as a gift for a friend whois a fan of Hugh Grant.

I got out my pop corn and tissues, ready to be won over by Hugh and Andi...what an awful letdown.I wanted to love this film, really I did, but it falls flat. The biggest problem is that I had no connection to Andi McDowell&#8217;s character at all, she comes off as cold and just mean. McDowell was great in &quot;Green Card&quot;, but comes across all wrong here. Perhaps she needed more screen time to develop her character. Hugh Grant's standard stuttering-shy-guy routine is tired and unappealing this time around (although it won my heart without fail in other flicks).There are some interesting things happening with Grant's circle of eclectic friends, but all that is pushed aside to chronicle Grant and McDowell&#8217;s relationship...which consists of chance meetings followed by a customary romp under the covers. I can't fathom how Grant's character falls in love with a woman he speaks to for ten minutes all together. The chemistry is just not there, and the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying.Skip this movie, I wish I had!When Harry Met Sally, Jerry McGuire, Circle of Friends, or Monsoon Wedding are excellent substitutes."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"I never cared for Four Weddings and a Funeral.

It's a look at life among the British hipper class, and many of the gags really happened to the screenwriter at actual weddings.Andie MacDowell is a delight in her usual quiet way, and the rest of the supporting cast add spice to this tasty confection.If Hugh Grant would work with a speech therapist, he might become as charming as he thinks he is.

A gang of smug friends habitually attends weddings (which they despise) of other friends (to whom they seem indifferent). Each of the smug friends - apart from two of the men, who are a couple - is single because either their lovers have left them or they themselves are indecisive. The male-male couple seems genuinely happy together, but they, like their smug friends, cannot refrain from relentless mockery of the weddings no one forces them to attend. But even the married couples are prompted to wed out of a desperate fear of being alone. It's all very cynical.And the principal romance is disastrously mishandled. The hero (Hugh Grant) is a perfect specimen of repugnant insipidity. The heroine (Andie MacDowell) is a sinister mannequin with nymphomaniacal pretensions. Likes repel in accordance with the laws of attraction. In Four Weddings and a Funeral, which boasts a screenplay that should have failed an undergraduate workshop, these two grotesques find each other irresistible. Several inevitable tragedies arise, most notably the death of one of the men of the male-male couple. (But he ate pans of sausages for breakfast and was unpleasant to nearly everyone except his boyfriend. So for me his heart attack was well-deserved.) This forces what's left of the smug gang to re-examine their smugness and, in a shocking adherence to the law of opposites attracting, they slowly pair off with other friends about whom they had previously been smug. As for the hero and the heroine, while they are busy not being repulsed by each other it transpires that the heroine is already pre-contracted to another grotesque, whom she marries. Everlasting loneliness looms over the head of the hero. So he decides to marry a grotesque whom he had previously jilted. But before the hero can vow to never again know the pleasure of a single moment's solitude, the heroine arrives to tell him that the grotesque she married was somehow too gruesome for her liking and that she is once more free to not be repulsed by the hero. Naturally the hero does the right thing and rejects his grotesque bride before witnesses. By now the twice-jilted grotesque is justified in opening the hero's throat but rather civilly punches him in the face. Anxieties ensue for the hero but are all for nowt when the heroine reappears agreeing to compromise with him on \\"not being married.\\" They bring their lips together in the rain and thereby provoke a thunderclap straight out of Rocky Horror Picture Show, a far superior film for which this surely must have been a sequel that lost its way.Absent any other merit this film does have the purely anthropological/sociological value of being set in the early '90s. So if you find it worth your while to be relentlessly assaulted by women wearing appalling dresses with inflated shoulders and men sporting more than usually floppy haircuts then Four Weddings and a Funeral will be momentarily distracting at best.Otherwise you're better off reading Jane Austen or watching an RSC production."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"A delightful film funny, irreverant but with heart."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Classic Hugh Grant.

I found it funny then -- or, more to the point, witty -- and I love it still, 17 years later. Hugh Grant is at his best here -- urbane, hapless, smart and comical all at once. The funeral sequence I've used repeatedly in my college English literature class to illustrate the intense effect the reading of a \\"death poem\\" can have, as the deceased man's closest friend reads W. H. Auden's \\"Stop all the Clocks\\". (Auden captures the essence of loss without wallowing in morbid, lugubrious, maudlin language; I've never seen a more moving funeral service.) Andie McDowell is charming, and the additon of Rowan Martin (\\"Mr. Bean\\") as a novice, bungling clergyman, was an hysterically funny touch. I highly recommend this movie, even to someone (mostly men, I imagine) who find romantic comedy unappealing. Believe me, this is not your average \\"chick flick\\", guys."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Hugh Grant is wonderfully charismatic and a master of self-deprecating humor. Being on a Hugh Grant kick lately I watched three of his films all in the same week. Love Actually, Sense & Sensibility, and 4 Weddings and a Funeral. Fun way to watch these movies because of the overlap in players and to understand classic British style: themes include tension between being proper and true to oneself, a wide cast of characters all intertwined, somehow, uncertainty of who will end up with who, extreme, offbeat secondary characters that are almost caricatures, and everything wrapped up neatly in the last 5-10 minutes of the film. This movie combines British and American themes, some as expected match ups and other surprises. Also rather British in that it is easier to describe who the movie is about as opposed to what the movie is about. Who it is about is an American woman and a British man who meet up at various mutual friends' weddings, seem meant for each other, but the timing for one, the other, or both always seems to be off. It is about missed opportunities and that oh so British theme of the struggle to be true to one's self in the face of opposing expectations. Four stars plus a bonus star for Hugh Grant."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" (1994) is one of my favorite movies: well-acted, a rollicking romantic comedy with one serious, touching scene, and an overall feeling of the vitality and the spirit of life. The movie creates a gang of friends, each one interesting and fun to be with. It may be Hugh Grant's best film where he's able to balance his boyish charm with a more ruminative side. The gang gathers at a series of weddings, and through wonderful vignettes we get to know each one: the hippie girl, the deaf mute, the Charles Addams Morticia-looking woman, the flamboyant, joyful gay guy and his devoted lover, and the clutzy millionaire.At the one funeral scene in the movie, Gareth's lover, Matthew, delivers a very moving eulogy that always tears me up. He reads W.H. Auden's poem \\"Funeral Blues\\" otherwise known as \\"Stop All the Clocks.\\" With the lines \\"He was my North, my South, my East and West/I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong.\\" As in other British movies slapstick comedy like Monty Python can be paired with the deadly serious.The movie begins with Hugh and his Platonic roommate hippie girl buddy late to a wedding, and at a fast pace the film travels through multiple lives and meetings. Charles (Grant) falls for Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at first sight, but he's always been unwilling to make a commitment to marriage, and has had a series of girlfriends. He's met the right girl but doesn't have the ability to effectuate. Grant can play flustered, irresponsible, self-absorbed, irritated, bedraggled, put upon, and still keep his impish, boyish charm.The multiple weddings are fun with their eccentric characters. Grant and his friend say awkward, indiscreet, funny things in wedding speeches. One of the film's hilarious highlights is when Rowan Atkinson (of Mr. Bean fame) officiates at his first wedding as a newly ordained priest. He says \\"Holy goat\\" instead of \\"Holy Ghost\\" and \\"Holy spigot\\" instead of \\"Holy Spirit.\\"The film's dialogue is literate and funny. It's clever the way Charles and Carrie use \\"skulk\\" for example. The film has great photography.At the final wedding suspense piles up, we in the audience get more involved and tense as the scene plays out. Stick around for the credits at the end: they're fun. And the soundtrack is fine too."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Okay so I watch this movie at least once a year.Its about a dorky English guy who sucks at meeting girls and is always late for weddings.Charles has a horribly shrill ex girlfriend his friends call duck face who carries a torch for him, and is even more pathetic at dating the opposite sex than he is.(If you can believe it) He thinks he is doomed to be single forever, until Charles falls in love with an American Girl wearing a Giant hat at his friend Angus's wedding.You have to love his friends too. Sarcastic Fi, who seems like kinda of a cold bitch at first , but once you get to know her, you see what she is all about. Bernard and Lydia who have epic sexual chemistry.

Hugh Grant's best role this side of an LA alley, I hate it when I'm snide like that. Anyhow, Grant fears he will never find the one, the lightning bolt one. Each wedding, his entourage of single friends, old school chums and a vagrant mop head dutifully attend, always late, always a little worse for wear. Every funny disaster at these loaded affairs are reviewed, Grant stutters through the pratfalls. He continues this technique through Notting Hill and Love Actually.

Fry - is possibly the greatest British film of all time, and is undoubtedly the most charming romantic comedy ever to grace our screens. Just a shame about Andie McDowell really, oh well, can't have everything."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Rowan Atkinson, who plays the nervous and shy Father Gerald, speaks those lines at a wedding. His writing partner, Richard Curtis, wrote this sweet, good-natured comedy of a circle of friends, all in their thirties, who attend weddings and gradually wonder the mysteries of love. Is it better to hold out for that ideal person or as the bumbling, nice, but not exactly fashion-modellish Tom puts it, \\"I always just hoped that, that I'd meet some nice friendly girl, like the look of her, hope the look of me didn't make her physically sick, then pop the question and, um, settle down and be happy.\\" The follies of finding anyone just to prevent from being lonely is also explored here, but so is the chain reaction that occurs at weddings, i.e. other people in turn end up getting married in serendipitous circumstances.The opening scenes to the first marriage of the various friends getting ready, set to an Elton John song, sets the stage for the story. The scenes of the slow-rising Charles and his female roommate Scarlett result in a series of comical scenes that elicit the f-word from them both, including missing the offramp leading to the wedding site.It's at the first wedding that Cupid launches a projectile at Charles (Hugh Grant) via Carrie (Andie McDowell), an American who appears at the wedding with a big black hat. What might have been a missed opportunity later turns depressing for Charles when he finds out she's engaged. Indeed, he has a history of ex-girlfriends that leads the sensitive Henrietta to call him a serial monogamist. But Charles is bewildered with awe at people who are actually ready to take that lifelong committment. After all, despite divorce being commonplace, the sanctity of wedding still carries importance. Both Grant's goofy and McDowell's sweet and lovable performances lift this film up, with the latter's winning smile, but they're not the only ones.Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas), nicknamed Fi or even Fifi, has a dignified beauty colored by a cynical tongue. In the first wedding, when Scarlett gushes over the bride, she says, \\"Scarlett, you're blind. She looks like a big meringue.\\" She also unleashes her tart tongue at meek Father Gerald, training to be a priest. She says it's rather like the first time one has sex, \\"a lot less messy of course, and far less call for condoms.\\" Gerald titters with nervous laughter.Of the other characters, Gareth, played by Simon Callow, is flamboyant, simply jovial, full of life, a true romantic, someone it's fun to hang around and be merry with, and as we learn later, a culinary eccentric. Seeing him cutting loose on the dance floor in the first wedding is a highlight. He plays with the theory that marriage is the last gasp between two couples who have run out of things to say, then says that true love is the driving force behind marriage.The pint-sized Scarlett (Charlotte Coleman) is another funny character. She has a shock of short bright red hair, sings offkey at church, and gets flirty with strangers at weddings. It was quite a shock when I heard of her death from an asthma attack last year.And David, Charles's deaf brother who's quite a dish, also gains some laughs in the conversations he has with his brother, and also with a girl who fancies him enough to take sign language lessons. Is that love or what?Another bit of trivia. According to Richard Curtis, Henrietta's nickname was toned down to Duckface for propriety. Guess what it was originally going to be? Hint: Duck gets replaced by a word it rhymes with. And for those who don't know, the poem read at the funeral is W.H. Auden's \\"Funeral Blues\\".With winning performances all around, great lines, be they witty, acerbic, or poignant, Four Weddings And A Funeral is a funny, romantic, and heartwarming winner from director Mike Newell (Enchanted April, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire [pending]). It give me hope that someday, maybe someday&#65533;E And if you don't like it, your name is duckface."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Charles (Hugh Grant) is what some people would call a player. He has had numerous relationships, but commitment is not in his vocabulary. Charles's fear of commitment suffers a challenge when he meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell). Carrie is intelligent, mysterious and honest, and is very self-confident and care-free. Charles struggles against his feelings as he finds himself falling in love with Carrie, but not wanting to speak those words aloud.This movie is humorous from beginning to end. Sometimes the humor is worthy of a laugh, but much of the humor just made me smile. Regardless of whether I was smiling or laughing, I was completely involved in the story and I wanted Charles and Carrie to end up with each other. There are four weddings, and a sad funeral, but each wedding and the funeral provide opportunities for an array of jokes and gags.I only have one complaint about this movie. There is significant use of four-letter words throughout. Unfortunately, one portion of the movie benefits from the language so eliminating it would also eliminate some of the humor, but there are places where the language was unnecessary. Obviously this movie is more suitable for an older audience. I would probably avoid showing the DVD version to anyone younger than 16 or 17 years old because of the language.I have seen comments about Hugh Grant and his \\"mumbling.\\" I guess I have a different definition of mumbling. I thought Grant spoke his lines about as clearly as I talk (maybe I mumble), and other than brief moments where he was being introspective - let's face it, people may mumble when they are thinking out loud - Grant does not mumble.I am also impressed that Hugh Grant somehow said four-letter words and left a string of girl friends behind him, and yet he still looked sweet and innocent. I guess that was why he was able to get another girl friend each time he dumped the last one.Andie MacDowell is beautiful and expressive and perfect for this role. She is sexy and mysterious and intelligent and sensitive, sometimes all at once. I could readily see why Charles was smitten by Carrie. As with most characters Andie MacDowell plays, she brings elegant and classy Carrie to life.This movie was good enough to gain two Academy Award nominations, for Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Beyond those nominations, the movie won 23 significant awards, such as the British Comedy Awards for Best Comedy Picture in 1994. The movie was nominated for another 14 awards of varying stature.\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" is a rare light romantic comedy that relies on an unusual combination of subtle and blatant humor in combination with an intelligent plot. I wondered whether Charles had a hope of capturing the heart of beautiful Carrie to the end of the movie, even as I was smiling and laughing at the humor. If you enjoy light romantic comedies, Hugh Grant or Andie MacDowell, you will find this award-winning movie to be worth more than one watch.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This film thrives on characters played perfectly by the foppish, bumbling Hugh Grant, the regal (and sardonic) Kristin Scott Thomas, and the very American and open Andie Macdowell. Everyone shines, but not any brighter than the scene in which they are written.The singletons are all secretly on the lookout for the person with whom to finally share their own vows. Fiona (Kristin Scott Thomas) is stoically in love with Charlie (Hugh Grant) throughout the film, although it is clear from the start he is meant to be with Carrie (Andie Macdowell) even if he doesn't follow-up with her after their one-night stand and even if their chemistry seems a bit questionable. I find Macdowell cute and pretty and sometimes witty, but rarely sexy.The wedding bits are usually hysterically funny especially with Rowan Atkinson as the priest, but it's the funeral scene that always compels me to watch this again.The recitation of W.H. Auden's Funeral Blues, complete and quietly, except for a few sniffles, is perhaps one of my top ten favorite poignant scenes in any movie."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"A runaway bestseller of a romantic comedy in England's best tradition.

He's a confirmed bachelor going to friends' weddings when he runs into her, and then a funeral intervenes. Then her wedding. Then his upcoming one...On and on it goes. We know how it's going to end.

Unfortunately Andie MacDowell doesn't add enough life to her important character and makes 'Carrie' almost lifeless and dull, which is the exact opposite of Kristin Scott Thomas performance which is quiet but right on the money. The whole movie is ultimately entertaining, fun and very funny at times. The ending is out of place and doesn't seem as smart as the rest of the film. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 7!"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Highly regarded as one of the finest British comedies of all time, \`Four Weddings and a Funeral' started off rather harsh (with perhaps 20 F-Bombs before another word was even spoken) and ended on the other side of sweet (awwww, they're kissing in the rain). In the end, \`Four Weddings...' works rather nicely, and while it's not the best British comedy in my opinion (I prefer screenwriter Richard Curtis' very own \`Love Actually'), it is very enjoyable and worthy of most the love and accolades it has received.The film revolves around a group of friends who discover love, friendship and life over the course of four weddings and a funeral (or should I say, \`three weddings, a funeral and half a wedding' to be more precise). At the center of this group is Charles, a bachelor who is afraid of commitment. His commitment phobia seems to fade away when he meets the mysteriously elusive American, Carrie, at a wedding. They have a moment and then she is gone and he can't stop thinking about her. The remainder of the film follows Charles as he tries to reconnect with Carrie, obstacle after obstacle falling into his path.I've read another review recently that mentioned how Andie MacDowell was perfectly cast as Carrie for the very fact that she is a boring actress, and her lack of natural charm made Charles interest in her all the more interesting. I can agree. I have never found MacDowell to be a particularly intriguing actress, that is for sure, but here she draws me in, mostly because I find myself trying to see what Charles sees in her.The film is littered with wonderfully full performances, especially by Hugh Grant and Kristen Scott Thomas, but no one can really be singled out as \`worst-in-show' since everyone involved rises to the occasion and hands the audience a wonderful experience. Grant though, should be singled out as \`best-in-show' for he really personifies what he has been trying to personify since he first appeared on the big screen. Some actors are always given a hard time for constantly playing variations of the same character. Some do so wonderfully, others not so wonderfully. Grant has made a career of, rather wonderfully, playing the commitment phoebe that unintentionally pushes everyone away with his arrogance. Charles is the perfect example of this character because Grant has softened him to the point where his arrogance is an understatement and his gentle nature is his major selling point. I am still baffled at the fact that Grant has yet to receive an Academy Award nomination, for he is constantly effortless in his roles and typically stands out in every film he inhabits as \`best-in-show'. Kristen Scott Thomas is also edible as Fiona, capturing the comedy within the script effortlessly, and inhabiting her character with real warmth and genuine heart. Her secret desires for Charles help create a three dimensional character who is both easy to love and easy to understand.It must be said that Richard Curtis knows how to pen a winning comedy. His style of wit and poignancy help elevate \`Four Weddings and a Funeral' from a generic romantic comedy to something much deeper and ultimately much more memorable. He has a knack for giving his characters something to sink their teeth into, something to really embellish and deliver to the audience. He creates characters that we can feel connected to, and we truly feel connected to the ones presented us in \`Four Weddings...'.In the end \`Four Weddings and a Funeral' is a feel good romantic comedy that hits almost every mark and delivers a beautifully fulfilling cinematic experience. It has its faults, sure, and it misses the mark in some areas, but not every film is aimed at perfection. What every film is aimed at though is entertainment, and \`Four Weddings and a Funeral' definitely entertains."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Guess what hooked me onto this movie more than 10 years after it came out?

This movie personifies that. It is upbeat and very easy to get into.Hugh Grant does his whole mumbling routine (which you either love or you hate - I happen to dig it) and the supporting cast is simply brilliant. Andie McDowell's place in this movie is something of a mystery. I don't know if her casting was genius or just grabbing any American actress who had name recognition. Her character should come off as, well, a bit of a whore but Andie couldn't play such a role if her life depended on it. She's just too nice. I think her playing the role may have saved it, though. Any other actress may have come off much less likable in the end.One of the only negative things I can say about this movie, and Richard Curtis, is that the gay people aren't written well. The gays are gay in name only, they just come of as flamboyant asexuals.

Auden.Funeral BluesStop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,Silence the pianos and with muffled drumBring out the coffin, let the mourners come.Let aeroplanes circle moaning overheadScribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead,Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.He was my North, my South, my East and West,My working week and my Sunday rest,My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;I thought that love would last for ever; I was wrong.The stars are not wanted now: put out every one;Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun;Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood,For nothing now can ever come to any good."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This movie raised Hugh Grant to stardom, at least in North America'; watching his performance, it's easy to see why. He's his typical likeable self - self-effacing, witty, bashful, and fun, all at the same time. It's a little more difficult to see why this film was nominated for best picture - it's only a good, not a great, movie. There are parts that are brilliant, but something is missing to tie the pieces together.Most glaring is the existence and motivation for Andie McDowell's character - why is she at these weddings? She can jets an incredible distance to come, yet seems to be unknown and is ignored by the wedding guests. It doesn't help that the character itself is two-dimensional and acts solely at the whim of the screenplay. Grant is left alone to carry the narrative forward on his own, but this time has virtually no help from the supporting characters, each of which has too little screen time to develop any personality. The inevitable comparison to the more recent &quot;Notting Hill&quot; hurts 4 Weddings. &quot;Hill&quot; has fewer characters, but they are better developed (and likeable), much to its advantage.Having said that, Grant's performance alone is worth the price of admission, and there are some good laughs. The DVD itself is terrible - the picture and sound are fine, but there are no extras whatsoever. Surely a film that was nominated for best picture (and one for which Grant won a Golden Globe) deserves better treatment than this."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"One of the best films of the past decade.

I really wanted to love the film, and while I enjoyed it at first, it quickly fell flat. The story is a let down and a bit of a stretch. While none of the characters were fully developed, I found myself despising Andie McDowall's character and couldn't understand why Hugh Grant was so infatuated by her. Their entire romance consisted of run-ins at weddings and funerals, two of which were their own--it doesn't quite add up! Characters come and go way too fast and I had troubled telling most of them apart. Way too many characters, far more interesting than Grant and McDowall put together, are unfortunately wasted here, so the film can concentrate on the implausible romance between the British womanizer and his American love interest. UGH!Overall, this was very unsatisfying and overhyped, definitely not as good as it should have been or is reputed to be.

I was furious when it was done because I had just wasted two hours watching a movie that has nothing to recommend it. This movie is neither funny nor inspiring.It was interesting in the beginning. Will the two main characters get together? My sympathy for Andie McDowell's character slipped when she had sex with Hugh Grant while engaged to someone else, and disappeared altogether when she recalled one by one her many lovers (32 of 'em). It's impossible for me to believe that she would remain faithful while married.Hugh Grant's character was not much better. When he couldn't have Andie, he asked someone else, someone who was absolutely crazy about him. Too bad the plot required that she be left at the altar.The only characters I liked were the two gay guys (what an incredible poem one read at the other's funeral).The two main characters were sexual slimeballs.

Most of the movie actually occurs at these ceremonies so the film is aptly named all around. Charles meets Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at wedding number one and a good portion of the movie revolves around whether these two will end up together or not. There are various subplots involving four of his friends as well as his brother, most of them involving romance of some sort.This is the movie that made Hugh Grant a star and it's easy to see why. He plays his stuttering nice guy to perfection and is helped by a script that any actor would gladly kill for. Andie MacDowell plays a terrific counterbalance with her mellow charm. The entire cast of largely unknown (in the U.S. at least) British actors does a fantastic job of infusing the film with warmth and life. Another plus is that this is the rare movie where the cast looks like real people instead of supermodels. It helps ground the film and make the characters seem more real.This deluxe edition DVD is a nice presentation. The picture has been cleaned up and converted to anamorphic format, the sound is crisp and there are some nice \\"making of\\" documentaries.

The humor is quirky, though, and probably not for everyone. For anyone willing to take a chance on something different, however, this is a true keeper. It was an instant classic when it was released and remains one to this day."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This is definitely a film that can be watched over and over again, with a very talented cast of British actors. James Fleet's Tom actually elicits more laughs from me than Hugh Grant's Charles. Andie Macdowell has definitely earned the enmity of fans of this British comedy everywhere for the apparent coldness of her character (\\"Hey, aren't the English supposed to be the cold fish?\\"). But Carrie, I believe, is the kind of woman who would sleep with another and still manage to mercilessly seduce and befriend everyone in her way.The movie, as a now cult hit, is curious in some ways. The film never explicitly states what Charles' job is. But there are two clues which should not be ignored. It seems that he is a writer or scholar of some sort, who deals with word origins and etymologies. 1) When he asks Tom to stop the car after the first wedding, he claims he wants to go to the inn \\"The Lucky Boatman\\" because \\"he is looking at English inns or pubs that have 'boat' in their title\\" (not an exact quote). 2) The second clue is given during the -ahem- amorous scene between Charles and Carrie that same night. Andie Macdowell asks Charles where he thinks the word \\"honeymoon\\" comes from, and he replies that it's honey because it's sweet, and moon because that would be the first time a husband would see his wife's bottom.As for the other characters, Tom and Fiona are of course landed gentry (notice the Farmer's Weekly magazine on Tom's little table when he wakes up in the morning in the first scenes of the movie). Scarlett says she's after a job as a sales assistant at a place called \\"Spank\\" that sells rubber products (this is when Charles gets the invitation to Carrie's wedding). I have no clue as to what Gareth or Matthew do, but perhaps they are academics, although Gareth's funeral takes place near a factory.I've always wondered what appointment Charles makes his brother David miss while Carrie is recounting her sexual experiences in the caf&eacute;. The building in the film does not look like a hospital or a bank.Previous reviewers state that Charles and Scarlett are siblings. No indication of this is given in the movie; they are simply \\"flatmates.\\" But Charles and David are of course brothers, and Charles refers to his father's funeral more than once."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Fans of Hugh Grant will enjoy this very funny and touching British comedy about a group of close British friends who go through life-changing events (marriages, funerals) together.

This movie is a blast, not least because it has no big soundtrack. Hugh Grant is just a pretty boy, but this is right in his range, and no one can beat him there. The gossip scene at one of the receptions is one of those I like to watch over and over. Andie M is remarkable and seductive. This movie breaks and mends hearts. One of the few times I've liked a movie recommended by someone at work. No chase scenes, just quiet comedy that will cut you up. Buy it, I'm not messin' with you. ...."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Never have I been so impressed with a film as I was with Mike Newell's British romp, Four Weddings and a Funeral. I can honestly say that this was one of those films that needed to have strong definitive characters to make the story work, and Newell accomplished this task with the greatest of ease. While he had done some work prior to this film, America was introduced to a very funny and very British Hugh Grant for the first time. His amazing and singular work in this film skyrocketed him to his level in Hollywood today. He could not have found a better step ladder.This film is funny, insightful, witty, and very personable. It is hard to find films of this caliber created by Hollywood anymore, so thankfully we have this film. Everything from the soundtrack (boasting several American songs), to the deeply humorous and intuitive references to American \\"pop\\" culture, to Hugh Grant's use of a certain word time over time, only keeps this film above all others. This is definitely one of those films that should be watched when life seems to be dragging and you need a bowl of laughter in your life. It should also be used by anyone that is a fan of British humor. It will turn any day into sunshine.Overall, this was a surprising film when I watched it for the first time, and it continues to impress. I am not a huge fan of Andie MacDowell, so it sometimes perplexes me as to why she chose this project, but thankfully this is counteracted by one of Hollywood's most classic scenes involving Rowan Atkinson! That man can do no wrong! I suggest this film to everyone at least once. It may not be everyone's \\"cup of tea\\", but watching it once caused nobody harm.Grade: **** out of *****"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Just watched this film for the third time, and my conclusion is the same as after my first viewing: the ending would have been much more satisfying if Charles ended up with Fiona (then I would have rated it a 5). She has more heart and honesty in her pinky than Carrie has in her whole body. I thought all of the other supporting actors/characters were wonderful as well.Granted, Carrie is absolutely georgeous. But what else is so appealing about her? She's sarcastic (in reaction to some of Charles' honest and vulnerable moments), disloyal (to the man she supposedly loves by sleeping with Charles while engaged), egocentric & insensitive(encouraging and lapping up Charles' compliments one minute and marrying someone else the next)and greedy (checking out what people have bought her as wedding gifts). Not to mention promiscious (32 lovers -- hope Charles gets a blood test). Overall, a very unappealing character. Of course, that's the character as written. All the more reason for Charles to have chosen the better woman - Fiona.I must admit that I don't care for Andie MacDowell as an actress. She's made many films, but her acting never seems natural to me. She always looks like she's acting (and preening), holding herself apart from the other characters, and never really connecting."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Let me start off by saying that I think Hugh Grant is drop-dead gorgeous. I would watch any movie with him in it. This is one of his best films, if not the best. It's funny without being desperate and touching without being depressing. The only thing I would change about it is the casting of Andie McDowell. She delivers her lines so poorly that it's distracting. If it weren't for her \\"performance\\", I might would have given this film five stars. Luckily, she doesn't have THAT many lines for a \\"lead\\" character.

I own this because I happen to think some of the lines/themes in the movie are pretty hilarious. Plus, as a fan of McDowell & Scott Thomas, it was a must-own for me. For those who are not die-hard fans of Grant or the latter mentioned, rent it first to see if it's a keeper for you. Admittedly, Grant does play the same charming cad as in most other films we've seen from him since the release of \\"Four Weddings\\"...BUT, many of the supporting actors make for uniquely witty one-liners and/or situations which are quite amusing. So, rent it first, then buy it. If you love the actors, though, you probably won't be disappointed.

These entanglements are buoyed by a funny, observant screenplay which includes references to David Cassidy and the Partridge Family as well as an hilarious stretch in which a nervous novice minister adds a new twist to the nuptials by referring to the bride-to-be as an \\"AWFUL wedded wife\\" or by concluding the rituals \\"in the name of the father, son, and holy GOAT\\". Rowan Atkinson aka Mr. Bean plays the bumbling minister to side-splitting perfection.This is the movie that elevated Hugh Grant to major stardom and familiarized American audiences with a strikingly beautiful, gifted young actress named Kristin Scott Thomas. Miss Thomas, elegant, witty, and world weary steals most of the scenes she's in. The entire cast is superb. They negotiate the movie's comic and melancholy turns masterfully.\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" is a serious delight. See for yourself!"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"A wonderful movie to watch with someone you love (or could see yourself loving somewhere down the line). The question of commitment rears its ugly head over and over, and makes it appear Charles (Hugh Grant) is unable to do so. In fact, the film seems to make the case he's been biding his time waiting for the thunderbolt to hit from out of the blue; when it finally does (in the person of Andie MacDowell), it misfires a few times.The film is enhanced by not being teddibly British (but suffers from not showing enough of Britain -- it might as well have been filmed in Toronto for all we saw of the countryside and Scotland). The supporting cast is marvelous, with Kristin Scott-Thomas and John Hannah moving on to bigger and better things. Andie MacDowell has been unfairly described as the weak link, but her character is rather ill-defined and flighty to begin with, and she didn't write the awful &quot;Is it raining? I hadn't noticed&quot; eye-roller at the end. Friends have told me other actresses could have been much better in the role; I highly doubt it.Definitely worth grabbing on video. The DVD holds no significant extras -- kind of a disappointment, since the screenplay book shows many deleted scenes and rejected TV spot scripts -- *some* of them must have been filmed."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"It is so unfortunate that Andie MacDowell practically destroys, in the final seconds of this film, all that has been so carefully created up until that moment. Hugh Grant and his merry band of friends are exceptional; the premise beguiling, and heartfelt. A gay relationship is of particular note, and provides the movie its one throat-closing moment. However, screenplay and most performances must depend on the believability of the Grant-MacDowell connection, and Andie is simply not up to the challenge. By contrast, Kristin Scott Thomas is the most electrifyingly real as she has ever been, in a slim but significant role. Charming, diverting -- could have been a classic, if we were rooting for them in the end..."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, made on a pauper's budget, is one of those little British films of which no one was expecting much. Surprisingly, though, it became the little engine that could and garnered much acclaim from fans and critics and cashflow in the theaters. It even shot up to the number one slot in the American box office. This was Hugh Grant's breakthrough film, the one which catapulted him to A-list prominence as a top flight comedic leading man. It made him a star.Thru the course of four weddings (and one devastating funeral), the movie chronicles the on-again, off-again romance of Charles, chronically tardy at weddings and commitment-phobic (his pals call him \\"a serial monogamist\\"), and Carrie, the lovely independent American girl. I got so into this movie that it wasn't until at the end that I realized I didn't even know what these characters - and those in Charles's inner circle - did for a living, only that they seemed to be fairly well-off blokes and girls and a tight-knit, fun-loving bunch of pals. But most of the story does take place within the confines of the weddings (and that one funeral), because those are the only instances in which Charles and Carrie ever interact. But for one exception, that being a sequence in which Charles accidentally bumps into an engaged Carrie and she invites him to accompany her as she tries on different wedding gowns.The screenplay is ridiculously good. And Mike Newell directs it, and I've always liked his stuff (ENCHANTED APRIL, INTO THE WEST, PUSHING TIN, and HARRY POTTER & THE GOBLET OF FIRE). The romance is nice enough, with Charles almost bemusedly wooing the ravishing Andie MacDowell. Back in 1994, when this movie was released, Andie MacDowell was the biggest name on this roster. At that time in her career, she was doing big things, what with GREEN CARD and GROUNDHOG DAY having done well, and this film only served to garner her even more notice. But if I were to nitpick, it'll be to say that we never do get to know her character as well as we come to know Charles. Even by the end of the film, Carrie comes off as enigmatic. But the love story is only one slice of a very savory pie. There's big heart in this terrifically fleshed-out supporting cast, these actors pitch perfect in their parts and most capable of winning over the audience. However, some are more pitch perfect than others, and so I point out Simon Callow as the gregarious Gareth, John Hannah who delivers a magnificent reading of W.H. Auden's \\"Funeral Blues,\\" and Kristin Scott Thomas who underplays it as the acerbic and sad Fiona. Meanwhile, Rowan Atkinson is simply hilarious as the flustered new priest who gets a chance at conducting his first ever marriage ceremony (in which he breaks out \\"the Holy Spigot!!\\" Hah!). But all the actors involved here are wonderful, and that I'd actually feel a measure of sorrow when one of their characters abruptly passes away is a testament to this little film's ability to affect the audience. Charles and his crew, they seem like a great bunch of folks, even if they teeter towards posh.But Hugh Grant owns this film. Hugh Grant wasn't really on Hollywood's radar before this picture, languishing as he was in forgettable made-for-TV films and overseas cinematic no-hopers. FOUR WEDDINGS is the film which, for the first time, showcased Hugh's comedic flair and impeccable timing. If you think he stammers and flutters those eyelids now, brother, he was a lot worse back in the day. But Hugh Grant oozes such charm and demonstrates such a quick and self-deprecating wit that the awkward habits somehow become disarming. For two samples of the man's dexterity with delivering convoluted lines, check out Charles's wedding toast and also his declaration of love for Carrie, with mad references to David Cassidy thrown in.What I have is the Deluxe Edition DVD, which offers these special features: Filmmakers' audio commentary, which is okay and sometimes interesting, although, frankly, I would've preferred Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell's two cents (and anyone else's in the cast, for that matter); 5 deleted scenes with optional commentary by the producer (including more with Rowan Atkinson's novice priest); \\"The Wedding Planners\\" and \\"FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL: In the Making\\" are two behind-the-scenes featurettes; \\"Two Actors and a Director\\" is a 5 minute segment of interviews with Director Mike Newell and Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell; a Behind the Scenes photo gallery; promo spots (pretty funny, actually, with Hugh and Andie each getting a 30 second spot to promote the movie); and the theatrical trailer. Not bad.I can't help but bring up Hugh Grant's later filmNotting Hill (Collector's Edition), and partly it's because it holds echoes of FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL. Both films feature an out-of-his-league Englishman romancing an American beauty, although NOTTING HILL is decidedly more fairy tale. Both films have wonderful supporting actors and that tiny whiff of elegance, and both films will make you laugh but then do a one-eighty and make you sad and make you reflect. Oh, but then NOTTING HILL doesn't trot out characters with names like Duckface, Vomiting Veronica, and Miss Piggy.

Weddings and funerals (and what happens during weddings and funerals) thus have special significance and meaning--so much so that this movie skips everything in between such as work and weekends and nevertheless manages to paint a lively and detailed portrait of a network of family and friendship, romance and relationship.Four Weddings and a Funeral is set in the \\"best parts\\" of the U.K. and thus technically qualifies as a \\"foreign\\" flick even though it's in English and probably made with an American audience in mind. It stars Hugh Grant as the very eligible but slightly bumbling bachelor, and Andie McDowell as the more forward American with the engaging smile. They seem to have been made for their respective roles. This movie was a real treat for me. Prior to watching this, I was lamenting that there hadn't been a good romantic comedy since \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" . . . ."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 'BLU RAY' REISSUE ***I recently reviewed the BLU RAY reissue of \\"Love Actually\\" - commenting on how beautiful the picture quality had suddenly become over the preceding DVD versions. Well - somebody seems to be taking care of business here too - because the print on this BR reissue of \\"Four Weddings And A Funeral\\" is exceptional also - especially given what's gone before.Filmed in the summer of 1993 and released in the spring of 1994 - Director Mike Newell and Producer Tim Bevan took a big chance on a then largely unknown Hugh Grant as the male lead. Playing Charles - a nice but bumbling 32-year old British bachelor - he's the love interest for the sophisticated and sexy American socialite Carrie (Andie MacDowell hot from her successes in \\"Green Card\\" and \\"Groundhog Day\\"). With six hundred thousand dollars lopped off their budget and only 38 days to shoot - it cost very little to make - and therefore when it became a global phenomenon it eventually grossed over $250 million in profit worldwide. \\"Four Weddings...\\" also made stars of Hugh Grant (and Liz Hurley in 'that' dress at the London premier). It laid the ground for so many British rom-coms to follow - highlighted the classiness of Kristin Scott-Thomas (\\"The English Patient\\") - Rowan Atkinson as a comedic genius - John Hannah as the thinking-woman's crumpet - and of course properly launched the 'film' career of England's best scriptwriter - Richard Curtis. It was even nominated for 2 Oscars - Best Film and Best Original Screenplay.Clarity - starting with spotlessly clean PolyGram Filmed Entertainment and MGM logos - the BLU RAY bypasses a menu and goes straight into the credits - and as the principal characters are established in the opening montage - its clear that some kind of restoration has been done here. It looks really great - bright, clean and amazingly fresh. The picture is also automatically defaulted to a 16.9 aspect - so it fits your entire screen without losing any definition to stretching.So much is visually improved in this transfer, but moments that stick out include - the scene outside the church after the first wedding where Charles spots Carrie across the churchyard - it's beautifully clear. When they are making their way back from the tent reception - drunk in a Land Rover singing \\"Stand By Your Man\\" - and Charles gets out of the car under some trees at night - it's 'so' clear. Charlotte Coleman as Charles' eccentric sister Scarlett and her scary dress sense - orange hat and purple dress - Rowan Atkinson as the trainee priest conducting his first wedding service and blowing almost every line - when Carrie turns up at the end in the doorway in the rain - all of it - just great. There are only a few occasions when you notice slight haze and blocking (Bernard and Lydia getting it on in the bedroom as Charles hides) - but mostly it's a joy to look at and really brings out the summery feel of it all - smartly dressed guests in sunny garden locations etc. It also shows a London landscape that has no Gherkin building, the lovely Lady Di was still with us and a person gave you a Fax number and not an e-mail address.It's very funny too - the script is fantastic in so many places - Charles describing one of his posh friend's new look \\"Tom...disastrous haircut...\\" - Scott Thomas describing the dress of the first bride Laura \\"...She looks like a big meringue...\\" - George the boor at the Boatman pub thinking he's in with the American sexpot - \\"Damn fine filly...\\" - Charles confiding in Matthew (John Hannah) about fluffing an attempt at wooing the same - \\"Do you think there really are people who can say...Hi Baby! My name is Charles! And this is your lucky night!\\" And Matthew replies \\"Well if there is...they're not English!\\"And when actual heart is called for (tears instead of laughter) - Curtis gives John Hannah the speech at Gareth's funeral complete with the W.H. Auden poem \\"Funeral Blues\\" at the end (\\"Stop all the clocks...He was my North, my South, My East and My West...my Sunday Rest...\\"). It's still evocative to this day. Even the gay relationship between their characters was handled with joy and class and didn't focus on disease and ostracization.Niggles - we've seen it too many times and it hasn't dated as well as \\"Love Actually\\" or \\"Nothing Hill\\" when it comes to repeat viewing. The terrible Elton John at the beginning. The lack of language subtitles shows an amazingly cavalier attitude to audiences outside of English speaking countries. The 'Extras' listed below are good - the 2004 versions put out on the DVD double (interviews with Grant, Newell, Callow, MacDowell etc) - but it would have been nice to have something new. But apart from those small points - there's little else. If only Terry Gilliam's film legacy was treated with such respect and smarts...To sum up - an evergreen movie and a very satisfying transfer to BLU RAY. So if you've any affection for this lovely British/American romcom - then acquire this version of it pronto - especially as its relatively cheap.Recommended.PS: this review is dedicated to the memory of the actress Charlotte ColemanBLU RAY Specifications:PICTURE: Widescreen 16.9 Aspect RatioAUDIO: English 5.1 DTS-HD Master AudioSUBTITLES: English For The Hearing ImpairedEXTRAS:Audio Commentary with Filmmakers Mike NewellFour Weddings And A Funeral - In The Making FeaturetteThe Wedding Planners DocumentaryTwo Actors And A Director FeaturetteTwo Promotional Clips (one with Hugh Grant as Lead, then Andie MacDowell as Lead)Deleted ScenesTheatrical Trailer"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"I frequently watch Four Weddings because it's a marvelously funny and classy movie. Several years ago I would never have believed that Hugh Grant could be a serious actor, but now I regard him as an excellent comedic actor, something like Cary Grant. His persona is similar to Cary Grant's: the handsome, appealing, but socially bungling playboy never-do-well. I love this persona, and I'm reminded of Cary Grant's movies with Irene Dunne.They are so hilarious because Dunne has a razor sharp wit and can put Grant in his place with her retorts.The cast of actors in Foour Weddngs is interesting because you have the upper class,the middle class, the intellectual, and the lower class represented. They don't mind mingling with each other, and they genuinely love one another. Hugh's lines are always funny, especially at the first reception. Another great moment of comedy is at the reception of Bernard's wedding when Hugh Grant is seated with old flames, and his indiscretions are brought up at the table by these former flames.Four Weddings is very balanced because there is a thread of sadness about the oneliness of the characters' not being married coarsing through the film, especially Hugh's character.Also, the death of the ebullient Garret, provides a wonderful foil to what might have become a silly film. Kristen's character is also sad because she never finds her love because she loves Hugh Grant's character. I wish that they would have fallen in love, instead of Andie McDowell's character.The film's music score is georgeous, also. Richard Rodney Bennett composed the music to Yanks, with Richard Gere and Lisa Eichorn. William Devane, and Vanessa Redgrave. Yanks is a great romantic movie.I highly recommend it, even if you don't think Gere a good actor.I freequently watch Four Weddings, and I heartily recommend it those who haven't view it or to those who need a romantic facelift.Ricky Wallace"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"We were surprised at the secure wrapping. and further surprised when the DVD opened without fuss since our zoning was never stipulated. And the film was clear and bright, but better, hilarious. We are looking forward to watching it again to pick up on the subtle nuances and oblique lines."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Classic comedy. All the supporting case is stellar. Except Andie MacDowell. She's not believable (is she really attractive enough to follow around at all these weddings?) and at this point in her career, she wasn't that good an actress. Or maybe this is her being good and in that case I just don't think she's all that and a bag of chips.The funniest scene in my opinion is Hugh stuck in the pantry.As for the DVD, I have the 1999 disc and it's as bare-bones as you can get (i.e., non \\"Deluxe Edition\\"), although it does include a 'Collectible \\"Making Of\\" Booklet'--wow! Hopefully the extra bucks get you some extras? Mike Newell did a fantastic Director's Commentary for Donnie Brasco so here's hoping.It's hard to believe that a romantic comedy was nominated for Best Picture (1994). Then again it seems like the Academy was big into nominating a British film almost every year in the 1990s."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Typical British humor.

I love Hugh Grant and thought that his character was perfect. It is a great romantic comedy and an excellent addition to anyone who enjoys this genre."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"No doubt others on Amazon have ably told you what this Best Picture-nominated movie is about, so let me only pause to add that my favorite part of this style-heavy mid-90's Brit-com (the one that made Hugh Grant and his boyishly handsome \\"Oh, shucks\\" grin a star) is when Carrie, Andie MacDowell's American-born character, \\"confronts\\" Hugh Grants' self-effacing Charles, with how extensive and well-remembered the rank and file of her sexual body count happens to be. The infatuated if commitment-phobic Charles stands in wide-eyed shock, even as he tries to handle what he is hearing with good-natured cheer, but just watching Charles as he forces his mouth not to fall open makes for an endearingly hilarious moment. (Hey, guys, if you didn't wanna know, why'd you ask? Right, girls?) There's also a show-stealing bit wherein Rowan Atkinson, Mr. Bean, himself, plays a nervously virginal vicar fumblingly presiding at one of the promised \\"four weddings\\" of the film. Really there are too many excellent performances here among British veterans of stage and screen---Simon Callow, Kristin Scott Thomas, Mike Newell, everyone it sometimes seems except a conspicuously absent Helena Bonham Carter---for this to be anything but a delight to own and watch again and again. Sure, many out there might dismiss Four Weddings and a Funeral as a \\"mere\\" chick flick, but I like it, and it's one of the more endearing movies to come out of Britain in many moons."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Mike Newell's secure directorial abilities allowed this reflective comedy -seemed to be inspired in the famous stylistic tradition of Oscar Wilde. The occurrences of a irreverent womanly is seen through a warm friendship, but at the time his friends get marry, he feels the social conventions exert the invisible pressure through suggestive comments, until he hits off with another wedding guest. If you are not absolutely involved with the spirit of the British comedy, maybe you experience the sensation of being out of focus with this existential comedy which works out as a healthy life's lesson, respect the in and outs of the singleness.But if you are disposed and accustomed to this genre, come and enjoy one of most original and marvelous comedies of the Nineties which consolidated Grant as one of the maxim exponents of this engaging genre.Totally recommended."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"The effects of personal want, need, love and desire on the friendships of a circle of eclectic individuals is examined with a spot of humor in the witty, clever and oh-so-British comedy of love, romance and finding that special someone, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\\" directed by Mike Newell. Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell head a delightful ensemble cast in this story of a group of long-time friends, all single, who watch and participate over a period of months as one by one those amongst them step up at last to the altar. Of them all, Charles (Grant) seems the most likely-- and at the same time the least likely-- to be next. Young, handsome and charismatic, Charles has no problem developing a relationship (he's had a number, in fact, as we learn in one particularly hilarious scene), but sustaining one is seemingly beyond his grasp. Until, at the wedding of one of his friends, he meets Carrie (MacDowell), an American, and she quickly enchants him. It is not the end of the story, however; for Charles, Carrie and the audience, it's only-- as they say-- the beginning.Set in contemporary England, one of the aspects of this film that makes it so engaging is the propriety with which the humor is presented. Refreshingly subtle, there's more of Noel Coward than Tom Green or Rob Schneider to it; a matter of manners, mores and innuendo taking precedence over gross-out, in-your-face, shock schlock humor. And though Grant and MacDowell are at the forefront of the piece, Newell does an excellent job of developing all of the characters, succinctly supplying enough detail to each individual to give the film some depth and dimension, without having to actually go too deep. He never lets you forget that first and foremost, this is a comedy. There's some insight provided, but this is not an in-depth commentary on human nature, though there are some overtones and implications in that direction (Charles is always late to the weddings, for example; perhaps a subconscious denial of the impending nuptials?). Most importantly, the characterizations are rich, and the story is involving and presented with an even flow that allows you to effortlessly be swept away with it.Certain actors make a career out of playing a variation of the same character in film after film, striving for that definitive portrayal. W.C. Fields played the hen-pecked husband in a number of films, finally perfecting that particular character in the person of Harold Bissonette in \\"It's A Gift.\\" For Hugh Grant, it's the retiring, somewhat self-conscious and stammering, eyelid fluttering charmer, of which he's done a variation in such films as \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" \\"The Englishman Who Went Up A Hill, But Came Down A Mountain,\\" Notting Hill\\" and \\"Mickey Blue Eyes.\\" But Charles is his definitive portrayal of that character, the one in which he achieves the balance and honesty that makes the character so believable. It's a good bit of work by Grant, and definitely one of his most memorable performances.Andie MacDowell, meanwhile, gives a rather composed performance as Carrie, the quiet American with a reserved bluntness who captivates Charles. MacDowell brings a sense of quietude to the role that is sensuously seductive, which lends credibility to Charles' infatuation with her. It's a role for which MacDowell is perfectly suited, as it allows her to play effectively to her naturally calm demeanor and exquisite beauty and femininity.In a part that has to be an actor's dream, Simon Callow is absolutely exuberant as Gareth, one of the fixtures of Charles' circle of friends. More than just an effervescent character, Gareth is something of the conscience of the film, laughing away and laying bare any and all pretense or hypocrisy like a modern day flesh-and-blood Spirit of Christmas Present. It's a character that gives needed balance and perspective to the film, and he's wonderfully played by Callow.Also turning in especially noteworthy performances are John Hannah as Matthew; Kristin Scott Thomas, who is quite alluring as Fiona; James Fleet as Tom, a character very reminiscent of his Hugo in the TV series \\"The Vicar of Dibley,\\" (and very effective here); Charlotte Coleman, memorable in the role of Scarlett; and Rowan Atkinson as the hapless Father Gerald.Rounding out the supporting cast are David Bower (David), Timothy Walker (Angus), Sara Crowe (Laura), Anna Chancellor (Henrietta), Simon Kunz (John), David Haig (Bernard), Sophie Thompson (Lydia Jane) and Corin Redgrave (Hamish). There's enough twists and turns along the way to keep this film unpredictable, including one scene near the end that initially seems so mean-spirited that it may have you biting your fist and crying, \\"Oh, NO!\\" But, not to worry, Newell provides an instant resolution consistent with the rest of the film, and it not only works but gets a good laugh to boot. Entertaining, pleasant and funny, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" makes for a satisfying, feel-good cinematic experience that just seems so wonderfully civilized amid the seemingly endless rancor abounding in our world today. It's what's known as the magic of the movies."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Four Weddings &amp; A Funeral was a hilarious film about dealing with the absurdity of attending these functions. Hugh Grant is adorable as a typical bumbling Englishman while Andie McDowell was wonderful as the beguiling American who sweeps Hugh off of his feet. I could relate to many of the goings on at the weddings. Unfortunately I empathized with the character of Scarlett who had trouble getting the blokes that she liked but was not interested in the blokes that liked her! All in all, a lot of fun to watch."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This film lets us take a peek at the 'lamer' side of weddings without letting the viewer slip into condescension and without the film getting heavy handed. It makes us laugh at the sillier things people do and say at weddings, but Four Weddings and a Funeral doesn't go so far as to put the institution of marriage down. Portraying the support that a circle of friends can provide, it shows us that there are other ways to be committed than getting married. While a light comedy on the surface, it raises some pretty serious questions about extended family issues.Hugh Grant is wonderful is his role as the bachelor afraid to fall in love, and Andie McDowell as the elusive American woman is as ravishing as ever. I will agree the script is goofy in a few places, but until I thought about some of the reviews written here, I never noticed it before. The supporting cast is outstanding. The sound is standard Dolby 2.0, and the picture quality is average to good. It is still good for quite a few laughs, and for less than 12 bucks, a steal. Great British comedy."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Although a comedy, there are some serious, sad moments in this film. By far one of Hugh Grant's best films.This movie will show the importance of love in life. No matter how much one thinks they can do without love, they may never be truly happy.Grant's character is quite the playboy. He is completely in love with an American girl, while all of the other girls are either in love with him or hate his guts.This movie will have you laughing outloud. So, if you need a good laugh, but don't want a Dumb (or Dumber) movie, then this is the one for you."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Grant &amp; McDowell seem to do best when the subject matter is light, and this film takes advantage of this. John Hannah is fantastic in a limited roll (you'd never think him capable of the messes he got into with the Mummy films after seeing this one)."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"When I first saw this movie, in theaters, years ago, I enjoyed it. I liked the obvious comraderie shared by Charles' (Grant's) crowd. Watching the friends interact made you think of your own friends.I bought it on DVD a couple years ago and watched it again recently...What a disappointment. I found I couldn't get past my dislike of MacDowell's character. What a lousy character. She is manipulative, a phoney, a liar, and is just a bit too superficial and casual when it comes to relationships and sex (she's obviously marrying Hamisch for money- he owns \\"half of Scotland\\" and is \\"twice her age\\"...and oh, she's only slept with 33 men) as can be... I found it so hard to sympathize, to root for these two when they were so self-absorbed and confusing. And that ridiculous line at the end: Is it raining? I hadn't noticed...\\" Yuck.Can't blame MacDowell- and I have to say, I usually like McDowell. I thought she was awesome in Sex, Lies & Videotape, Unstrung Heroes, and even Green Card. And you have to applaud the fact she is attractive even if she does not conform to the Hollywood standard of beauty. She is no size 4, and seems comfortable in her womanly figure.Anyway- this time around even the friends seemed a little stale- a little too forced, although the funeral was a thoughtful and moving scene. But Grant whining about commitment, and MacDowell sending mixed signals...why would I ever care for these two screw-ups??Anyway- it's an average movie- there are some great moments of comedy and they might even distract you from the leads, if you're lucky..."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"After the death of Charlotte Coleman, who played the wonderfully eccentric Scarlett in this movie, it seems appropriate to watch this movie purely for her. She did a lot of different TV stuff, this was really one of her only films, and she steals the show from bigger stars such as Hugh Grant.You know there's going to be a sad moment in this film, when there's \\"funeral\\" in the title, and it's the best moment in the entire film, it works, and it's so sad at the same time. John Hannah is also excellent in this film, and is not overly camp, despite what other reviewers may think.I really don't like many of the characters in this, but seem to enjoy the film for some strange reason. I mainly hate Hugh Grant's & Kristin Scott Thomas's characters, and Andie McDowell's character is just a pain in the neck. This woman cannot act, even in those Loreal adverts that she does. Her lines are delivered in a monotone voice, with no emotion whatsoever. Rowan Atkinson as the nervous first time priest, is an absolute hoot, complete with messing up his lines (\\"awful wedded wife\\", or \\"holy goat\\" for \\"holy ghost\\"), being unable to say the bride & groom's name, and generally just being his funny self.One of the best scenes in the whole movie, is when Hugh's character is at a table at a wedding - surrounded by 3 or 4 of his exes. This scene is set up for utter humiliation, and it's hilarious to watch it unfold.If you hate typically stereotyped English characters, complete with plummy irritating accents, then don't watch this film. If you're easily irritated by Hugh Grant (yes, I normally am, until I saw Bridget Jones Diary), then this is not the film. It's not a film you watch too many times however. And there is a region 2 special edition."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"ok. i loved the british characters. they were funny, touching, and altogether sympathetic. i would have preferred kristin scott thomas's character as the heroine, but oh well. i loved their sense of humor, and at the same time, i felt their sadness poignantly, particularly when john hannah gives his elegy. i think i actually teared up a bit. there were many of these precious moments.but leave the damaging factor to the american heroine. i'm an american, but i just could not and would not identify with andie mcdowell's character. she kept trying to give that mysterious elusive quality to the character and just utterly failed. rather than seeming elusive and aloof, she seemed more like a tease that just wasn't worth it.don't get me wrong, i'm a huge fan of romantic comedies, but that also means that i like my romantic comedies to be perfectly executed. the casting diretor failed miserably when casting andie mcdowell. either that or the screenwriter just didn't want to be nice to his heroine. but then, i really think andie's character could have been much more sympathetic if a different actress had played it - maybe even julia roberts, even when i'm not exactly a fan. i mean, how could a casting director think that viewers would find andie's character more desirable than that of kristin scott thomas (i forget the characters' names). i was honestly smacking myself in the forehead crying, why, charles why?i understand a lot of people did like this movie, and i admit that this movie had so many great moments. but i stand by my humble opinion that andie mcdowell, simply put, sucked."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"The Hugh Grant-Andie MacDowell relationship is tedious at best -- we're told there's instant chemistry, but I don't feel it, and their rush to the sack leaves me cold.

Four Weddings is a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"First of all, I have to say that romantic comedies aren't entirely my &quot;basket&quot;, so my review will be somewhat biased - you have been warned. However, hopefully I will be able to limit this bias by reviewing FOUR WEDDINGS as objectively as I can, as a movie, because I can see its merits - and its downfalls.I think the plot has been covered fairly well already, and is pretty much nothing more than a &quot;boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back&quot; kinda situation. Nothing amazing. What is amazing is the way in which Richard Curtis as a writer flawlessly captures that atmoshpere that always seem to be at British weddings; being British myself, I can say that his portrayal of the wedings (and the funeral) did completely and utterly capture the English eccentricity and reserve perefectly.However, once we finally got round to the last wedding, I was yawning - it was far too much of the same thing. It would have been more interesting to put some of those characters that appeared at all the weddings in another situation.When watching films such as FOUR WEDDINGS and NOTTING HILL, it is obvious just how few famous faces there are in British comedy; almost every single little cameo role in FOUR WEDDINGS was played by a relatively famous British comedic actor or actress, right down to Rowan Atkinson making an appearance with his co-star from THE THIN BLUE LINE, James Dreyfus. All these &quot;familair faces&quot; do add to the appeal of the movie for many people, and all play their parts wonderfully, but they do seem to be typecast - hardly any of them actually played anything that was a long way from work they have already done.The ending of the movie is truly terrible; it is so cheesy that I actually groaned out loud at the scene in the rain. Un until there, the movie had consintently hit just off-centre, which was nice, but the scene was unbearably predictable and trite. What was Richard Curtis thinking of?!Despite all this, FOUR WEDDINGS is a good movie - I just don't like it, but don't let that put you off.Dragyn"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This is a lovely British romantic comedy - but therein lies my problem. Like a previous reviewer, this reviewer has an issue with the DVD - not the movie itself. Well - actually - the movie itself too - as I had to come here to read how the characters are related - or not - to each other as it wasn't explained clearly in the movie. Or maybe it *Was* explained and I just didn't catch it, which brings up my other issue: there are subtitles provided in Spanish and French, but NOT English.

The extras make this a much better product than the bare-bones DVD that has been on the market for years.Still, I found the \\"making-of\\" documentaries slightly arrogant and self-congratulatory. The film snippets used in the featurettes were sped-up such that the characters' voices sounded noticably off-pitch. The deleted scenes were quite short (almost blurbs, really) and did nothing to illuminate the film.Most distressing, however, was the lack of care that went into the film's transfer to this DVD. Both picture quality and audio were sorely lacking. The screen was marked throughout with dust spots and blemishes that drew my eye away from the action, making this DVD picture slightly worse than the VHS copy I've been using for 10 years. Moreover, absolutely nothing was done to improve the audio. Some parts - including the opening song \\"But Not for Me\\" - actually sounded worse than on VHS. What this great film deserved was a full digital treatment.Fortunately, it's low price makes it worth purchasing for the extras alone.

Whether or not the film is liked is not the point of the following upgrade comment.Although it is generally true that most Blu-rays offer extra image definition and sonics over the previous DVD version/s there is not always a huge difference achieved. This may simply be because the original DVD is so recent that most of the technical information is already encoded into the DVD. Sometimes the transfer to Blu-ray simply lacks due care to be worthwhile.However there are occasions where extra effort has apparently been made and where all the above provisos no longer apply. This is one such film. The improvement is quite remarkable with a tremendous improvement apparent throughout the process of restoration. In particular the DVD letterbox imaging has been replaced with full screen imaging and the soundtrack has far greater range. Both imaging and sound have greater definition than offered on the previous DVD.Provided that reasonable allowance is made for the age of the original film stock, it would be reasonable to expect most purchasers to be more than satisfied with this transfer to Blu-ray. In my opinion this improvement is a real 5 star achievement and the restoration team deserves success for their efforts."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This is the one when we first see Hugh Grant as the bumbling, awkward British toff, hankering madly for sexy American (MacDowell) and having lots of fun with his smashing freinds who all slowly discover their desire to find that someone special.

And you'll laugh.Why the main character Charles (Hugh Grant) falls for the sensual nymphomaniac USAmerican Carrie (Andie Mac Dowell) remains a mystery, but at least they finally found a part for Andie Mac Dowell in which she makes SOME kind of sense.A funny British film which you have to have seen."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Mike Newell's stylish 1994 hit, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", expertly fulfills the traditional criteria of romantic comedy, the most important one being that unlike in real life, (almost) everyone finds love with the right person - a conclusion never really in doubt, so this piece of information won't spoil anything. A fine cast that includes Kristin Scott Thomas, Simon Callow, and John Hannah lends sparkle and charm to this tale of a group of long-time friends who, one by one, are crossing from carefree, single blessedness into the marital state. Except for one: Charles (Hugh Grant), who just can't seem to get himself over that line, despite successive relationships with attractive women who all want to hook him.Charles and his friends apparently occupy some blissful realm where little matters such as jobs and careers don't seem to exist. Two (Phoebe and her brother Tom) are obviously wealthy aristocrats, but it's a mystery how the others support themselves as they float around, showing up at one wedding after another and co-mingling at receptions with a clearly upper-class crowd in which all the women wear large expensive hats. All the same guests appear to show up at all the weddings.I'm not a great fan of Hugh Grant, whose lip-biting, stammering, hair-pushing mannerisms drive me up the wall. However, the role of the emotionally infantile and graceless Charles suits Grant almost too well, so it's hard to complain. As the film opens, Charles and his elfin roommate, Scarlett (a wonderfully eccentric portrayal by the unfortunately deceased Charlotte Coleman), are off to the film's first wedding, where Charles, as usual, is the perennial Best Man. Already troubled by his inability to commit, at the reception Charles meets a pretty American, Carrie, played by the mind-bogglingly talentless Andie MacDowell, whose casting is the only major flaw in this film. MacDowell could give Tippi Hedren a run for the \\"Least Talented Actress Ever To Have A Career In Films\\" award, and for the same reason: a hopelessly flat persona, voice, and delivery. This defect is particularly glaring amongst this group of fine British actors. MacDowell's flat delivery, devoid of nuance, imagination, color, or shading of any kind, turns her lines into the dramatic equivalent of Wonder Bread. It's a shame someone on the level of the rest of the cast couldn't be found for this role.At any rate, although Charles doesn't figure it out for some time (although, of course, the audience does), Carrie is the Thunderbolt that has finally hit him. For the rest of the film, we wait for Charles to acknowledge what everyone around him sees clearly, and, as we wait, we are treated to three more weddings and that funeral. The second wedding contains a priceless turn by Britain's famed comedian, Rowan Atkinson, as a priest nervously performing his first marriage, and mangling the language of the wedding service as he does so.The movie is also notable for including a happy gay couple (John Hannah and Simon Callow), without qualification or discussion. Callow, one of Britain's most distinguished stage and screen actors, gets to chew up the scenery a bit, while sharp-eyed devotees of BBC's \\"Wire in the Blood\\" and \\"MI-5\\" series's may spot a young Nicola Walker, later one of the lead detectives in \\"Wire\\" and an operative on \\"MI-5\\", as one of the maddening folk singers (\\"Can't live/without yuuuuuuuuu. . .\\") at the second wedding.The outcome of the story is never really in doubt; as is often said, it's the journey, not the arrival, that counts. In this case, it's the wit and stylish performances (with the exception of MacDowell) that make this journey enjoyable - not to mention critiquing those varied wedding dresses, church settings, flower arrangements, etc. The traditions of romantic comedy make it easy to ignore such minor questions as, \\"When do these people work? What do they DO?!\\".Nothing if not charming, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" goes down easy and raises many smiles."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"It was the surprise hit of 1994.\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", a film directed by Mike Newell (\\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\", \\"Enchanting April\\", \\"Donnie Brasco\\", \\"Prince of Persia: Sands of Time\\") and written by Richard Curtis (Mr. Bean\\", \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\", \\"Notting Hill\\" became the UK's highest-grossing film in history at the time (earning over $245 million worldwide) and also earning an Academy Award for \\"Best Picture\\".The film would also jumpstart the career of Newell but also its leading actor, an unknown talent named Hugh Grant who would go on to become an International star with \\"Notting Hill\\", \\"Mickey Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Bridget Jone's Diary\\" and also boost the career of actress Kristin Scott Thomas and John Hannah to name a few.VIDEO:\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:85:1). I tend to be one of the few who tend to get critical of films released in the late '80s and early '90s and brought to Blu-ray because a lot of film stock at that time used for films were not the best. Some films tend to look their age, some tend to look a bit soft. For \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", actually picture quality leaned more towards the good side.For one, scenes shot outdoors do showcase a good amount of color but at the same time, it does show its age where colors look a tad bit saturated. But just a bit. There is a good amount of grain and I did see some white speckles but for the most part, the film does look good, just don't expect picture quality compared to today's modern films.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, Spanish Dolby Surround and French 5.1 DTS HD. For this comedy, it's a dialogue-driven film with some music, so you can expect a more center and front-channel driven soundtrack. Fortunately, there is use of the surround channels as you can hear ambiance, especially birds chirping all around you at times. But it's not an immersive soundtrack but for this type of film and considering the age of the film, the lossless soundtrack is good.Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish and French.SPECIAL FEATURES:\\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" comes with the following special features:Audio Commentary with Filmmakers - If you owned the original \\"Deluxe Edition\\" of the previous DVD, the wonderful audio commentary with comments from director Mike Newell and Richard Curtis as well as Duncan Kenworthy are included. An in-depth and fun audio commentary worthy listening to!Four Weddings and a Funeral: In the Making Featurette - (7:45) Featuring interviews with the cast of \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" about their role and behind-the-scenes footage from the film.The Wedding Planners - (29:48) Featuring the making of the film, the challenges experienced while making the film and how casting was made for the film.Two Actors and a Director Featurette - (5:41) Mike Newell talks about hiring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell including interviews with the two cast members.Deleted Scenes - (9:56) Featuring five deleted scenes with optional introductions by producer Duncan Kenworthy.Promotional Spots - Featuring two never-used promotional spots by Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell and featuring optional commentary by producer Duncan Kenworthy.Trailer - (2:08) Featuring the original theatrical trailer to \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\".JUDGMENT CALL:When I was attending college, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" was the ultimate guy film which I saw many friends watch over and over and being the only guy around the group who had a girlfriend at the time, I would listen and hear them talk about how this movie spoke to them.Does \\"true love\\" exist? Is it better to be single and have fun?And I really don't know how many times my friends had this playing on their VHS but this was a film that spoke to people on various levels. Gave them hope!As for me, the film didn't speak to me in terms of relationships but it further enhanced my appreciation for British comedies. What I loved about the film was its various characters and while the film was primarily about Charles and Carrie, its the other supporting cast that I found entertaining and helped enhance the storyline around Charles.And sure enough, the film made Hugh Grant a star and Mike Newell, he would go on to make blockbuster films. I was surprised to see Kristin Scott Thomas in a more smaller role but watching this film back then, I had no doubt in my mind we would be seeing more of Thomas in cinema and similar to Grant, we would see more of Thomas in films such as \\"Mission Impossible\\" and \\"The English Patient\\". And another actor who would also gain from being part of the film is John Hannah who went on to work on \\"The Mummy\\" films.For the most part, everyone gave a solid performance in the film. If there was one person that actually irked me back then, it was Andie MacDowell's character as Carrie. For someone who knows people of great influence and someone who looked as if she was an intellectual, somehow her character and the lines she was given were almost making her come out looking like an airhead. But then again, perhaps I was too enamored by her in \\"Groundhog Day\\" and \\"Short Cuts\\" back then.As for the Blu-ray release, I know that many people own the Deluxe Edition DVD that came out in 2006 which has the same special features featured on this Blu-ray. So, is it worth upgrading? Well, because it's a catalog title, more than likely you are going to find this release for a lower price and if that is the case, then yes, it's definitely worth it to upgrade to an HD version, especially if you love the film, then definitely Blu-ray is the way go go.. But at the same time, it is not necessarily a film that showcases an immersive soundscape when it comes to lossless audio and as for the picture quality, just don't have huge expectations and expected significant differences PQ-wise over its DVD counterpart.But if you haven't owned or even watched the film before, then yes, definitely give \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" a chance! It's witty, fun and highly entertaining!Overall, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" is a film that many people love, some place it high amongst their top romantic comedies and as mentioned earlier, for some guys, this movie speaks to them, especially those wondering if \\"true love\\" exists. For me, it was just a fun British comedy, nothing more, nothing less and I enjoyed it.So, if you really love this film, then definitely upgrade to Blu-ray!"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (comedy, romance, drama)Directed by Mike NewellStarring Hugh Grant, Andie MacDowell, Simon Callow and James FleetMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer | 1994 | 117 min | Rated R | Released Jan 11, 2011Video:Video codec: MPEG-4 AVCVideo resolution: 1080pAspect ratio: 1.85:1Audio:English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1French: DTS 5.1Italian: DTS 5.1Spanish: Dolby Digital 2.0Spanish: DTS 5.1Polish: Dolby Digital 2.0Portuguese: Dolby Digital 2.0Subtitles:English SDH, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, French, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, TurkishDiscs:Single 50GB Blu-ray DiscThe Film 3.5/5Four Weddings and a Funeral was released in 1994 and was a breakout role for Hugh Grant. If you have seen Notting Hill, Love Actually or the Bridget Jones movies, you'll know that Grant plays similar characters in every movie. Writer Richard Curtis wrote all of those screenplays and understands what Grant can do. He typically plays eloquent characters who are a bit confused about what they want in life. He has great comic timing and plays his roles with a lot of charm.The movie opens with Charles (Grant) late for a wedding. We see him dash around with his flatmate, Scarlett, and drive like a maniac to reach the church on time. He's the best man, but he's forgotten to bring the rings. This opening sequence is pretty funny and sets the scene well.Almost all of the action takes place at the four weddings and the funeral mentioned in the title. We are introduced to Charles and his friends, and they appear at every wedding. Tom (Fleet) is one of the richest men in Britain, but is clueless about women and doesn't have a girlfriend. He's amusing and harmless and reminds me of Colin Firth's character in Love Actually. Gareth embraces life and throws himself into any situation without stopping to worry whether he's making a fool of himself, while Matthew is his lover.The story is full of good observations about human behavior. If you have ever been to a wedding, you'll recognize the types of character portrayed in the movie. Some are there because they genuinely want to be, but others tag along as an excuse to get drunk or to seek romantic partners of their own. Some are touching and others are embarrassing or annoying.At the first wedding, Charles encounters Carrie (MacDowell). He likes her instantly and changes his plans so that he stays at the same inn. They have a romantic moment, but it quickly ends when Carrie announces that she has to return to America.The rest of the movie shows meetings between Charles and Carrie at each of the weddings. Their situations change each time, but it's clear that they like each other. Charles runs into previous girlfriends continually, but considers marriage as something to be avoided for the most part. In contrast, Gareth thinks marriage is a good way to get out of a boring conversation.Charles has a brother, David, who is deaf and communicates through sign language. That sets up a few of the funnier scenes when Charles lies about what David is saying. Another interesting character is Father Gerald; a young priest played by Rowan Atkinson. Most American viewers will know him as Mr. Bean, but he's appeared in numerous movies of this type as well as Blackadder, which was a TV series also written by Curtis. Father Gerald isn't a very good priest, but he'll probably make you laugh.The movie succeeds because the characters are believable and similar to people we have encountered in our own lives. It's easy to identify with the main characters because the story rings true. It's above average in terms of romantic comedies and also works as pure comedy. Even if you don't care about Charles and Carrie, there's plenty to smile at. I wouldn't rate Four Weddings and a Funeral up there with Love Actually, but it's worth seeing.Video Quality 3.5/5Unless you bought Target's exclusive version in January, this is the first time you'll have had the chance to see Four Weddings and a Funeral on Blu-ray. The result is a clear upgrade, as you would expect, but it's not a stellar transfer by any means. The movie is plagued with minor scratches and dirt throughout the 118 minutes. The image is soft at times and clarity never threatens to dazzle the viewer. Colors are accurate, but a little subdued. I briefly considered a 3/5 rating, but I think most of the presentation deserves the extra half point. Fans of the movie should buy it, but temper expectations.Audio Quality 4/5The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 is more than adequate, but this isn't the kind of movie that makes full use of sound. It consists of dialogue-driven scenes for the most part, although the surrounds do add depth in the wedding reception scenes. I thought I detected minor sync issues in a couple of places, but they were brief.Special Features 3/5The special features are all presented in standard definition and were included on the DVD version of the movie.Commentary with Director Mike Newell, Producer Duncan Kenworthy and Writer Richard Curtis.In the Making (7:45)The Wedding Planners (29:48) - A longer look at how the movie was made.Two Actors and a Director (5:41) - Explaining how Grant and MacDowell were chosen for the lead roles.Deleted Scenes (4:02) - Six brief scenes.Promotional Spots (3:26)Theatrical Trailer (2:08)Four Weddings and a Funeral is a lot of fun, and works well for fans of British humor. Grant and MacDowell play their roles well. The Blu-ray offers a reasonable upgrade and is worth adding to your collection if you're a fan of the movie or if you like romantic comedies. The price is very attractive at the moment and is readily available for under $12.Overall score 3.5/5"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"I have pretty much all of Hugh Grant's movies, so this one is another one in my collection. It is not my absolute favorite, considering all his others and Love Actually being my all time favorite movie ever I think! But this is definitely worth watching and owning if you like Hugh Grant. It's mostly a story of a group of friends and events in their life with a subtle focus on Charles (Hugh Grant) and Carrie (Andie MacDowel), who seem to keep meeting each other at these seemingly unrelated events, but also seem to be falling for each other. But there is a little twist in there that I'm not going to give away here. You must watch it! It is definitely a charming British film!"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"A very beautifully told tale of British marital angst that only occasionally falters.The performances are all very good - no faltering there. And the inclusion of Auden's poem &quot;Funeral Blues&quot; and the reading John Hannah (I think that is the actor's name) gives it are superb.The only real drawback to the story involves the development of Andie MacDowell's character. Her character is too unevenly drawn. A long --------- very long, excruciatingly long --------- courtship would be the only way to go with someone as flighty and mixed up as her character is in this movie.Other than that, it is a very clever and interesting film."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"If you like this movie, you'll love this screenplay with many lovely pictures.

The DVD specials aren't more spectacular than any others, but just the fact that you can skip from an embarassing moment with Hugh Grant to a depressed Kristen Scott Thomas is worth it enough.

The video portion of this Blu Ray can go from almost crystal clear (for a catalog title of this vintage) to flat and lifeless for a few moments and then right back to great or almost great.The colors are VERY good with lifelike skin tones and beautiful outdoor shots and other than a bit of distracting telecine wobble in the start of the first reel the image is stable. I was able to see a lot of fine detail overall and was generally very pleased with most of the video quality. Now, if you are the type who picks apart picture quality, this movie won't bother you nearly as much as titles like National Lampoons Vacation series transfers as MOST of it is rendered good and at times very good. When the quality dips, it is very temporary and never below what a standard DVD would give you, in most cases even at it's worst it outshines it's DVD counterpart. I would say after viewing this title in it's entirety, perhaps 85% of the film has some sort of dimensionality to it and even some 3-D like pop from time to time. Overall a very pleasant viewing experience.The soundtrack on this movie really stands out. The music, effects and dialogue are all very well produced in the lossless DTS 5.1 mix with lots of ambient effects in the surround channels, more than I had expected. As the picture quality isn't always the greatest, the soundtrack stands out even more as being quite good for something recorded back in 1994. I found nothing annoying about it either, like extra effects added to show off your surrounds and then they end up detracting from the presentation. A nice tasteful mix and it takes full advantage of the DTS HD format.For extras you get an Audio Commentary, Deleted Scenes, Two Featurettes and One Documentary which help round out the package. For the current bargain price of this disc it is well worth the upgrade to Blu Ray for fans of Four Weddings and a Funeral. I first time I saw this film as a VHS rental, later owned it on DVD and the Blu Ray version is the very best I've ever seen it look AND sound! Even Duckface would like it!"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"A surprise hit that was nominated for Best Picture in 1994, FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL is a marvelously performed romantic comedy. Hugh Grant is superb as Charlie, the suave young man who is always late for weddings, and is looking for the right girl to speak his own vows. Andie McDowell is the American who enters Charlie's life, but his refusal to make a commitment sends her into the hands of a much older man (Corin Redgrave). What makes this movie so delightful is its marvelous supporting cast: Simon Callow, Charlotte Coleman, John Hannah, James Fleet, and of course the sublime Kristin Scott Thomas as the acid-tongued but charming Fiona. Rowan Atkinson also has a scene-stealing hilarious moment as a nervous priest really screwing up the wedding ceremony at Wedding # 2. The movie is incredibly human and Hannah's recitation of a W.H. Auden poem at the funeral is extremely powerful. For romantic comedies, they don't get much better than this. Another high point: the guitar strumming couple who warble both CAN'T SMILE WITHOUT YOU and STAND BY YOUR MAN.

Why we are meant to care what happens to any of them, we are never told.The only character who is almost halfway likable is a condescending jerk (played by the normally very likable Simon Callow), and its his funeral in the title.The only reason I went to see this was that Rowan Atkinson is billed as one of its main players. He is only in two scenes, and is even less funny than the rest of the cast (\\"Oh, he said 'spiggot' instead of 'Spirit,' I think my sides are about to burst!\\") Screenwriter Richard Curtis, who also wrote for \\"Black Adder,\\" must have blackmailed him.I think Americans who like this movie, and others like it (the Curtis genre), think that seeing it makes them really sophisticated. The joke is on them, however. Just before dying, the jerk makes fun of some Americans for not knowing Oscar Wilde is dead. The American who is ignorant of things British is one of the most tired cliche's in British \\"comedy.\\" Many who laught at it, I'm sure, don't recognize a difference between types of Americans. We're all stupid, in their books. The ones who visit Britain as tourists or watch their movies and TV shows are the most visible to them. They like to take our money, as much as they seem to resent us.Don't get me wrong. There is a lot of British stuff I like. I dream of one day visiting the Sceptre'd Isle. The Curtis genre, however, occasionally mocks Americans while pandering to a certain type of American, while the characters, but for their accents alone, are indistinguishable from the most boring types of shallow, middle-class Americans.And seeing Hugh Grant in this movie caused me to wonder from under which rock he was found. The slime oozing off his body was quite obviously palpable to me. Why nobody else? Is this a hoax? Is everyone just pretending to like this guy for some reason? Even assuming he's good looking and all that, so what? There are lots of pretty boys, and some of them don't engage in marathon sessions of nodding and blinking. I think hundreds of actors could do just as well, if not better than him in most of his movies in I've seen. For a list of the few good movies he's been in, see my \\"Films with Hugh Grant that are Actually Worth Watching\\" in Listmania Lists.Even people who like this movie may agree that the worst thing about it is that it will probably remain the best known work of actress Charlotte Coleman, whose promising career was cut short by her untimely death.After ten years, the bad aftertaste of this movie lingers on."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"Maudlin, slushy mush.

Likewise, Grant's character's acceptance of this as perfectly normal behaviour? We are meant to go on finding these two promiscuous wretches cute. MacDowell then has the nerve to blame her husband for the failure of her marriage. Cringe.I also find it odd that a gay man would want to give a speech in church when the 'good' book has hardly been welcoming towards homosexuality. The film then gets terribly maudlin over the fact that this man believes his life is no more because he will never meet another fat, loud, hairy man again. Er....Now, before you say this review smacks of someone whose got out out of the wrong side of the bed this morning and hasn't had any lurve or sack action since we went decimal, I'd just like to say I have no bed and you can always pay for it.

Unfortunately, Four Weddings and a Funeral fell well short of those lofty expectations.The sad part is that the film does a great many things well. The movie has many funny moments and the ensemble cast is mostly exceptional, especially amongst Charles' highly eclectic group of friends. However, it suffers from one fatal flaw: the female lead is terrible.Andie MacDowell's Carrie has all the charisma of a piece of upholstery (and a cheap one, at that). A combination of a poor performance and a poorly fleshed out character arc combine to make her perhaps one of the least interesting cinematic romantic interests of all time. There is very little chemistry between she and Hugh Grant, nor is any indication really given of what attracts Charles to her outside of the fact that she owns a nice hat and is a demon in the sack. She has one good line after the first time she and Charles get busy, and that essentially ends her contribution to the film.While entertaining in parts, the lack of an even adequate female lead (both a function of the actress and the script) kills this highly overrated film.Also this particular iteration of the DVD is terrible. It is a dual-layered disc, with the widescreen edition on one side and the fullscreen on the other. However the \\"widescreen\\" edition is shown letterboxed... on my widescreen labtop it still displays at a 4:3 ratio with letterbox bars, unnecessarily shrinking the image. Also, someone at the studio apparently thought it would be a good idea to have English and French audio options, but subtitles available only in Spanish. If you are a fan of the film, you're probably better off going with the 2006 Deluxe Edition."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This 1994 film was a mad laugh and a sad one with the funeral. Sparks fly for Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell but they seem to have trouble getting together. Charles (Grant) almost walks down the aisle with the wrong woman until his brother saves the day-just before the final vow. After all.... marriage vows are 'till death do you part."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"I am an anti-Andi McDowell fan. I avoid her mvies and don't buy products she advertises. In fact I make faces at the television screen as she shows us her luscious locks. But I liked this movie despite her because it is funny, sweet, sad, and charming. I even moved to England to meet my own English man (so far, no luck). If they had only used a different American actress, I wouldn't be able to give this enough accolades."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This movie has become one of my favorites to watch on rainy evenings or whenever I need to revisit the fun, spirited relationships between the characters. Although the romance between Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell may have been the movie's chief drawing point, it isn't the reason this movie remains permanantly on top of my VCR waiting to be watched again. It is the funny, touching and true relationship between Hugh Grant and his university friends, now adults, as they rely more on each other than on their hapless romantic liasons. It is from these relationships that most of the movie's humor derives, and these relationships give the movie its fresh, hopeful and fun tone."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"We owned this on VHS & just had to add it to our DVD collection."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This is a really funny movie. I liked it years ago when I watched it the first time. I am glad I found it on Amazon because I have never seen it out in the stores. It is one of my husband's favorite movies, which is why I purchased it for him."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"I paid an acceptable price, the product was delivered on time and in good condition."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This movie wasn't as good as I remembered in my youth. It is one of the cute movies about a man who keeps meeting a mysterious woman at several weddings and a funeral. Are they in love or not? Are they just teasing each other?"},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This film passes one's time reasonably pleasantly. However, if one is looking for laughter, one should look elsewhere. The story line and development are thin; indeed, we basically do just attend four weddings and a funeral, watching the lead actor struggle with his desire to avoid commitment."},{"Title":"Four Weddings and a Funeral (Penguin Longman Reader Level 5)","review":"This is to replace my VHS copy. I regard this film as one of my top 10 comedies and want it on a more substantial product."},{"Title":"Bob Beattie's Learn to Ski","review":"This book has information about skiing in general. I bought this book to learn skiing techniques and I did not like it that much. I wanted more illustrations and helpful advise to help me better my technique and this book does not provide much of that."},{"Title":"The Heavens Are Falling: The Scientific Prediction of Catastrophes in Our Time","review":"This book, by one of the leading figures in the science of computer modeling, is must reading for anyone who wants the true facts behind the claims of those who use computers to model complex systems and make predictions based on those models. Karplus outlines, for the general reader, the benefits and snares of computer models and how they are used and misused in today's world by those who want to use prediction of disaster to influence public policy."},{"Title":"Rescue Manual for Parents: How to Successfully Survive the Teenagers Years","review":"I am still reading How to Successfully Survive the Teenage Years Rescue Manual, but it has some good advice for parents who are struggling with their teenager or for parents who just want to maintain or improve their relationship with their teen. I would recommend it for the parents of all teens or pre-teens."},{"Title":"Winning Market Leadership : Strategic Market Planning for Technology-Driven Businesses","review":"Messrs. Ryans, More, Barclay and Deutscher have delivered what will surely be very quickly seen as a classic in the field of technology marketing. The authors table a very comprehensive process for managing strategic planning in technology-intensive businesses. Great plans (and businesses) often come from great planning processes - these guys have delivered the absolute best! This is an important book. Please don't tell my competitors about it! Bravo! Excellent! Well done!"},{"Title":"Winning Market Leadership : Strategic Market Planning for Technology-Driven Businesses","review":"This is an excellent book. It holds a prominent place on my desktop for easy reference. Thank you."},{"Title":"People's Padre","review":"I am always interested (as a recent convert to the Catholic Church) in the stories of former Catholics. People's Padre is a well-written, thoroughly documented auto-biography. Ten years ago I would have read in this story a deserved expose of a wicked hierarchical system, and today I read in it the understandable grumblings of a sinner who was sinned against. Both sides are right, and both are wrong. Fr McLoughlin was a gifted administrator and politician, and proud of it. He transformed, almost single-handedly, the 1930s and 1940s social fabric of Phoenix Arizona by his work with the poor and with the health care system. Had he stayed humbly within the discipline of the Church, he might have shared the stage with Mother Teresa, but he found so much to dislike about obedience, and so much to (rightly) complain about, that he was unable to stay with the Church. He quit altogether, got married, and continued his work as a Protestant believer. He deserves appreciation. But his righteous indignation shines through to the point I'm not sure I'd like him as a next-door neighbor.This narrative would make terrific discussion material in any apologetics or RCIA class, and should probably be required reading. No one can dispute that the sexual sins of the Bishops and priests of the Church in the last fifty years are heinous, and that obedience to such monsters is submitting to abuse, but what of the sins of superiors who are simply high-handed or unreasonable? Protestants have no problem; they simply leave, join another church or start another church, without much fanfare. But in the Catholic Church, unity of teaching and purpose is a central dogma and this principle needs far more discussion than it probably gets. Obedience \\"in the Lord\\" is prized, and reading of any Saint, such as Teresa of Lisieux, or John of the Cross, or St Francis, or Jesus Himself, will show the value of such obedience to the soul and to the world.Fr McLoughlin, to his credit, gives praise to the Church in many areas. Many of the letters he reprints show a sincere compassion and wisdom from friends, colleagues, and superiors. While some of his conclusions about the Church are well-deserved indictments, others are borne of frustration, myopeia, unforgiveness, and the over-arching need to \\"just get things done\\" without interference.In short, a worthwhile read which should lead the reader to a prayerful assessment of the saints and sinners which comprise the Body of Christ on earth."}]`),L={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],R={key:0},M={key:1};function W(n,e,s,c,r,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",C,[(t(!0),a(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,f)=>(t(),p(m,{key:f,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(t(),a("span",M,"Loading...")):(t(),a("span",R,"See more"))],8,x)):b("",!0)])}const D=u(L,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-84fc0fbf"]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/43.md","filePath":"people/43.md"}'),q={name:"people/43.md"},G=Object.assign(q,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(t(),a("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{E as __pageData,G as default};
