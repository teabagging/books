Not only does the book have some great photos in it to please the eye, he tells how he took each shot and many times, gives extremely creative ideas that I'd never thought of before. As a result, I've gotten some really nice shots myself by trying the things he explains. I recommend this book, and any book, by Bryan Peterson!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is an excellent and quick read with lots of visual content representing the topics being discussed. My guess is that most of us are visual learners and this book caters to us.The book is clearly written by an artist which in this case is good. Being an IT person, I would have liked to see a few diagrams illustrating the concepts and ideas. I think many things like aperture, ISO, shutter speed, etc. could have easily been explained using diagrams instead of words. Perhaps in the next edition.This book has helped me connect the dots (as we say). It clearly explains the reason for selecting the various settings on the camera and the results to expect.This book was recommended to me and I will recommend it to others.To the author: Thank you for helping me get introduced and excited about photography. Although my true passion is video, I have learned a lot about the value of still shots."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book will make older photographers happy, rather than the younger digital generation photographers.That said, after I read through the book, I did learn a lot of things.

This book helped me understand both the technical and artistic aspects of photography well enough to move to the next level."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"You can find basic information about Aperture, shutter speed and Light in any general photography book or even in camera manual. But this book will cover those aspects which are not generally found. Book is full of amazing pictures, some scenarios are explained with more than 2 pictures taken with different settings. Some interesting topics include -1. Where to focus while taking story telling landscape pictures. Not very detailed but good information about depth-of-field/distance scale on lens.2. \\"Who cares?\\" aperture.3. How to compose shot in high contrast/difficult lighting situation, he used some funny terms (Sky brother, etc...)4. Macro photography, some amazing pictures are given in book.5. I also find chapter on Light very useful.6. Some nice techniques like 'Double exposure and sandwiching'.I agree with some of the reviewer that ISO is not discussed much in this book but not a big problem. Also this book covers only outdoor photography so you would be disappointed if you are looking for indoor photography. I am already using techniques in this book, nice book to own."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Not a bad book, but not worth 4 or 5 stars. The teaching always boils down to simple tips, and there isn't any real in-depth explanations on anything. Lots of reference to the author's Nikon gear, which is very annoying, since I don't know every single make of Nikon cameras back to the 1970's. Lots of glossed over technical explanations, sided with over-doses of simplistic discussions instead of explanations.Missing information is everywhere. I had to read the whole book before finding out why all kinds of shots say \\"I pointed my lens to the sky, adjusted the exposure until -2/3 showed, recomposed and took the shot\\". Never explained why he uses -2/3 or +2/3 until the very end, and then only says \\"do -2/3 digital, +2/3 film\\". Everytime or just when using the sky? Huh? What? Then again, sometimes he just uses the normal setting. Frustrating since it wouldn've taken 5 minutes to really explain this, and should have been at the beginning. Anyway, other two vital pieces of information missing 100% of the time is the ISO setting and whether or not film or digital cam was used on the discussion shot. All you get is lens/f/shutter on every shot. Very dumb since an entire section is devoted to the \\"holy trinity\\" for exposures being ISO/f/shutter. And, it's apparent that a lot of shots are film, and I use both medias and I'd like to know this stuff.There are better books."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I bought this book with an already full understanding of the basics of exposure, so I didn't need it for what the title claims it is, but I expected some additional insight into the nuance of exposure, and how to handle tricky lighting situations. It delivered. The book is not brilliantly written or well organized, but it's logical and coherent. I also lent it to a friend who was an SLR beginner and it was very helpful to him. Overall, a good, solid effort that does impart valuable knowledge to both the beginning and intermediate level photographer, though perhaps not much to offer those with advanced skills."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Understanding Exposure by Bryan Peterson is one of those books that when you first start to read it you say to yourself \\"I already know what\\", but if you can stay focused and actually read all of the words of this book (i.e., no skimming) then you'll discover many little nuggets of info that will help you to be more creative in your photography.The exercises and stories Bryan talks about cause me to have numerous \\"ah ha\\" moments where I feel like my mind and view of the world changes and my photography will get better in the process.Another thing I like about Bryan's books is that he shares his stock photo shots that have been successful and tells you how much money he has made on them. I find this valuable because I look at certain shots, like his cover picture, and say \\"wow that's nice\\" but I wouldn't expect it to be a $40,000 stock photo (in the 90's). His shots remind me that you can have a simple basic shot that is well taken and exposed and still make some good money with it. While the current stock photography market is exponentially harder now, and I don't think you are going to see $40k photos anymore, it does remind me that you don't need to travel to a national park or exotic location to make good money with a photo.I highly recommend getting this book. For those who think they know all of this stuff, I suggest that you keep reading and pay close attention. Don't let your mind wander and start skimming pages, because you will miss nuggets of useful information that will help make you a better photographer. While this book isn't first on my reading list, it is high on the list!Skill Level: Beginner to Advanced Value: Worth every penny Recommendation: Highly recommended. It is hard to go wrong with Bryan's books and this is no different. This was his first book that got it all started and he's got a winning formula for writing fantastic books. Learning to See Creatively should be read first, but this book is great.[...]"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have read some books and I think this is one of the best to learn photography concepts. It give all the basic information you need to understand each basic concept of photography.I bought a DSLR and several books (the bad of buy several books is that a lot of them repeat the same introductory concepts) but I recommend this like the first book to read :) easy to understand and with good quality contents."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I got this book hoping to learn more about how to improve the exposure of my photos and the book did that. The author shows explains the relationship between ISO, Aperture and Shutter speed and how they can be used in conjunction with each other to get the exposure you want. To a beginner photographer like me, that was a big help. He also worked to explain that there isn't just one right exposure for each photo, which I had not considered. It's been revised to include more information about digital SLR cameras which is what i have.I recommend this book to anyone who is a relative beginner in photography and is looking to better understand the factors that impact exposure."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have just started taking pictures. I have never used the manual mode on my camera before because I didn't understand exposure with shutter speed, ISO, and aperture. This author explains all of this in simple terms to help me understand.Now I use nothing but the manual mode when taking pictures. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about exposure."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is one of the very best photography books I have read. First Mr. Peterson explains basic things in a clear, easily understood way and uses effective illustrations to enhance his explanations. Second, He explains one element at a time and then shows you where that element fits into a greater whole. I found that I was already using much of what he covered, but when he explained how the different pieces fits together and how you can vary their relationships to one another to affect the end product; my separate pieces began to lock into place with one another and gave me a more powerful tool to work with. Once I began to grasp the larger view of exposure, I could see the variety of ways that a picture could be viewed and found I now understood what was technically necessary to capture the particular view that I wanted.Mr. Peterson defined what correct exposure is, and how you can know when you have it. He then explained that the correct exposure could be gained with several different combinations of aperatures and shutter speeds, and that the specific combinations were what allowed us creative exposures. Creative exposures change what the picture emphasizes. Exposures that were easy and pleasant to look at, but focused on motion rather than detail. Exposures that were in focus from the flowers at your feet to the castle at the foot of the mountains on the horizon, telling the story of the connection between that castle and the valley between it and the flowers close at hand. Exposures that emphasize shape with strong shadows, or that open up the shadows to reveal the details that would otherwise be hidden.He goes further, too, to explain about metering--the hows and whys--and about using exposure compensation. Again, these were things I was already doing; but doing by the seat of my pants rather than out of knowledge and intentional planning.I came away from this book feeling like I had been handed a whole new box of tools along with the skills to use them, a new way to look at and plan for the shots I was taking, and a restless urge to take my camera out and bring home the images that reflect how I see the things I am looking at."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Excellent!

It is written in such a way that is easy to understand yet highly informative!Bryan Petterson describes the relationship between ISO, Apperture and Shutter Speed beautiful! And as I am not yet finished with this book, and have so much better a grasp of the principles involved, I can't wait to finish and reread this book!

The most important thing when setting exposure. How to correctly measure incident light, how to work with the spot meter, how useful the sunny 16 rule can be. The author mostly relies only on the automatic metering system and that's the problem when the title says 'Exposure'. If you don't plan to use camera's manual mode to set the exposure by yourself then it could be the book for you."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"A MUST buy for any person beginning their photography. Save yourself the money & time and read this book before taking any course! The author will introduce you to the \\"main\\" areas of photography and really breaks it down very simply that anyone can pick it up.When I bought my first SLR, I honestly didn't know how to use it besides using the \\"P\\" function which made it a super expensive point & shoot camera!!! I picked up the book and started playing with my camera and I learned a lot... I knew nothing up to that point. The beauty of the author's writing style is that anyone can understand it, its not difficult to understand.Be warned that the author is not going to make you an expert, this is not a detailed technique or advanced photography book. This is an intro book and at that I don't think anything can match it, anyone that asks me to help them with picking a course gets the same answer: \\"save yourself the time & money and get understanding exposure, you will get a solid understanding of photography just from reading it\\". You can always take a course after but I found out that most of the courses were made so that you take other classes with the photographer, and whatever they are going to teach you you will learn by reading this book anyway. I recommend advanced photography classes that will address a certain topic such as: flash photography, portraits, weddings, landscape, etc... but if you see a general photography course, I'd say just buy the book.Hope this helps :)"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I recently came upon a digital camera that had full manual controls and didn't really understand what any of the functions did. I was pointed to this book as a beginners guide to photography. The book seems to make two assumptions : That 1) You don't know a lot about photography but 2) You know how to use your camera. With Camera Manual and book in hand I went through the book and began to understand how exposure works on a camera and roles ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed play. Some of the fanciest pictures became a lot simpler as he broke down how to produce such images.If you're new to photography this book is a good place to start. The topics range from the very basics of what your camera does to capture an image to how to use your camera, to more situational photography (landscapes at sunset, large landscapes, nature scenes, etc). I'm not even a competent photographer yet but my pictures are starting to get better. I still find myself coming back to the book often to take a look and reference what is in it.For those who have picked up a DSLR and don't have any idea how to use it - the contents of this book do apply to you as well. It's not 30 pages of how to load and select film, it really is mostly about how to correct expose a picture. It touches on composition mildly, but isn't a book about that. If you already know the roles of ISO, Aperture, and Shutterspeed and are looking for a guidebook about how to take more situational shots, this probably is not for you.The book construction itself is solid. It's not flimsy paper but not stiff either. Glossy pages like you might see in a photography art book.You might also get a chuckle out of the several somewhat shameless references to his 'beautiful' wife the author intersperses at various times throughout the book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is written in a \\"no nonsense\\" style and is extremely informative.Whether you are using a traditional or Digital SLR then this book will provide a very useful introduction for those wanting to leave the \\"auto\\" modes behind and get creative with all the features modern SLRs offer.Bryan Peterson writes clearly on how to read-the-light and seeing the creatively correct exposure.He deals with all the basics like the photographic triangle (apeture, shutter speed and ISO) and then drills into a moderate amount of depth in each area without getting overly technical, and thats the beauty of this book - its easy to read and easy to understand.What I found particularly useful is that relatively early on in the book he explains how light is the \\"heart\\" of the photographic triangle - and introduces the reader to \\"Six correct exposures vs One Creatively correct One\\".Keeping this important concept front and centre, he then adds to the subject by discussing techniques like panning, specular highlights etc.As one would expect in a book about Exposure, Peterson also covers lighting (front, back, side etc) in detail, and then puts a good deal of context around his examples.Using the principles in the book I was able to quite quickly put those into action with a Nikon DSLR - and get results! (In my experience most camera handbooks are just tech manuals, barely covering the knobs and dials, and more often than not they are poorly written).From my perspective this book is a must have for newbies to intermediate amateur photographers."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I'm new to photography, so this was a great book that explained the basic concepts while providing full page photographs to illustrate the difference in settings. Its nice to see two versions of the same photo, one with a certain setting and another without. It really helps you understand photography basics. This was exactly the type of book I was looking for."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I still continue to read this book. it is a great book for beginners. and the more you shoot the more the books makes even more sense.go get it now if you are new to photography!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The author takes all of the technical jargon, drop kicks it into a rubbish tin, then explains in plain and simple terms, what it is that you really need to know."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Bryan Peterson does an outstanding job of explaining one of the most challenging topics to a learning photographer. This book contains exactly what the camera user's manual does not cover -- how to use your camera settings in a broad range of photo situations. It does not get bogged down in camera technology, but focuses on how to use your camera to get great shots. I am very impressed with Bryan's book and will probably buy others. Also check out his website."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I went to our local library and found this book, took it home and as I read (I didn't want to put it down!)I finally began to understand the concept of exposure!

Definitely a 5-star book for an amateur photographer wanting to improve!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The line on the front of this books states \\"How to Shoot Great Photographs with a Film or Digital Camera\\" and after you have read this book from cover to cover you will completely be shooting great photos!

I did not think that was possible before reading this book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I had thought I was making the most out of my camera, but after reading this book MANY times over, my craft has improved tenfold.Sometimes things are hidden in plain sight, and the merit of this book is to point at them so clearly, you wonder why it didn't occur to you sooner.Unless you're a seasoned pro of course, buy this book and read it cover to cover and you'll be asking for more."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"After spending a few hours last night with this book, my camera and my camera manual, I have taken a giant leap forward in understanding photography and my camera. I moved the dial off auto and actually took a manual picture in low light with no flash, and it came out properly lit and in focus. WOW! I knew I needed some kind of book when I had no idea what most of the settings on my camera meant. I was debating whether to get this book or one of the more encyclopedic ones, and I'm so glad I got this one. It provides plenty of explanation on the essential topics without being overly verbose. I can't wait to spend a weekend with my camera and the new things I've learned just from the first few pages of the book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I expected a lot of this book, that was recommended by every photographer on every forum I visit.Maybe that's why I was a little disappointed at first reading : I already knew about f-stops, diafragma, shutter speed and their relation to each other, and I expected to get some more advanced knowledge on this subject.That is not why one should buy this book. It IS a good book, a great book, and it did offer me quite some good new insights in photography, about \\"seeing photographically\\", about \\"storytelling pictures\\" as the author calls it. He makes his point by showing some great pictures that prove his insights.For true beginners, this book should be THE eye-opener, a revelation, however. It teaches you all you need to know to get away from the dull \\"full auto\\" mode on your camera and make great pictures.I would certainly recommend it, even though my expectations were not in sync with reality....."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I received \\"Learning to See Creatively\\" as a gift.It helped me so much that I decided to buy this otherbook from Peterson.

The old tripod still applies, as well as a surprising number of creative technical tricks, as well described in this book.One asset of the D40 is the wiggle room for bracketing and other fun stuff, including changing ISO without waiting for a film roll to run out (as there IS no film). This present book fully covers all such old tricks, and is written by a very talented, knowledgeable and prolific professional photographer of landscape and portrait. The author is a true artist with the camera, and also a very good writer. He like me prefers natural or ambient light, and shows us how best to use it in the new technology.Okay, as mentioned in other reviews, he tends to use apian simile to illustrate technical points, but I find that more compelling and illuminating than distracting. He also loves his wife and is not afraid to show it, as she frequently appears in his startlingly beautiful photographs, and not just for the sake of saving on a model's release. To paraphrase James Joyce's famous evangelical parody: No greater love has man than this, than to lay out his wife for his friends, and for us his readers and students as well.I am grateful to Mr. Peterson for sharing so generously his art and his techniques in a clear and lucid manner, which reawakens within me all that I ever knew, and then some, much more. He rekindles within me that love of photography I thought died long ago, as eyes and mind dim, and as I got hit by the rising cost of film and lab fees. I was ready to hang up the camera forever and close in peace my camera eyes. Mr. Peterson challenges me to remember and to open my eyes once again.The title seems to indicate this extensive book deals with \\"nothing more\\" than exposure and how it works, as if he would send us forth with light meter in hand to \\"get a feel\\" for how light works under different circumstances. This book teaches so much more in nearly every aspect of taking a picture, including composition, depth of field, shutter speed and ISO. Peterson thus expands his definition of EXPOSURE to include all of these and more. Please read the ENTIRE title: \\"Understanding Exposure: HOW TO SHOOT GREAT PHOTOGRAPHS . . .\\" (emphasis added) and you understand the richness and comprehensive nature of this well-packed book. It is as if this talented and trained commercial photographer with experience in every aspect of photography wants to tell us all he knows, and so we find on nearly every page a side-box full of other information which might not have to do with exposure per se, but is in itself very informative.In short I strongly recommend this book for anyone returning after the first shock of the new technology, as a way to understand how to incorporate our old instincts within this brave new digital world, and I can also recommend it for the new photographer who is graduating beyond the point and shoot digital camera and wants to gain greater creative control.This book liberates all photographers to their creative vision, and opens new avenues to beauty, truth and art with light, nature, civilization and people. This can be a path to Zen and the Art of Photography, the Semiotics of Photography. And it can be a very wise guide to this new frontier.I wish I had gotten the lens with an aperture ring, as I always preferred to set the depth of field rather than shutter speed on my trusty old AL-1, and this book awakens hunger for that old method. I'll study my D40 manual to find the tricks and techniques which allow me to forget the camera and just take the best possible shot. One thing about DSLR, you don't have to shoot a roll to keep a shot, but can shoot till the SD card fills up, with no expense in deleting and re-shooting!This book is well worth the cost and should be read carefully and gratefully by anyone with any sort of SLR camera to learn to master every aspect of exposing those megapixels to well balanced and beautiful light."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I picked up this book after getting a new digital rebel xti in hopes of breaking out of the full auto mode. Heck I paid a lot of money for those extra features so I should know how to use them, right? Anyways, I am up to page 58 and I have learned so much already! I am out of the full auto mode and I don't plan on returning!! If you are lucky to browse through the book at a bookstore before buying, do so! You will see after reading only a few short pages what the rest of us are talking about here. The author does a great job!! All those buzz words like f-stop, aperture, etc. are explained in simple terms and make so much more sense to me now. Thanks to all the other reviewers for leaving their comments and leading me to this book. You really help out the rest of us!In short, look at all the other reviews; they are right on the money. Get the book and you will not be sorry you did. Then come back an leave your comments. I'm sure you will agree with the majority of us here, this book is excellent!!!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I've started getting into photography about a year ago and according to some pros' advices, they'd asked me to enjoy photography with passion instead of getting too technical with all the aperture, shutter speed, ISO and what nots. So I've done that, enjoying snapping away with all my might and of course, trying to train my eyes to see creatively so to speak. Now it has come to a point when I needed to get technical to learn how to operate my camera in order to take better pictures. I've been so confused with all my readings online and could never get my numbers right (of speed, aperture and it had came to a point when I had a mental block when I saw the word f-stop!) Then this book came to my rescue! What a great birthday gift, thanks to my friends! This is an easy-to-read book, and very easy to understand. Peterson explained things with good examples and analogies which helped me a lot in remembering how my camera works and how I could use that to help me get better results. A must read for beginners!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The other rave reviews here tell you what the book provides - I simply want to add that I have this book and his \\"Learning to See Creatively\\" and you just won't find better photography books for learning, and for referring back to.

You'd be well served by this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Bryan Peterson does a fantastic job of explaining what it takes to make a great photograph from a good one. One of the key emphasis of the book is to look for creatively correct exposures and the author illustrates the point very well with a number of photos taken at different settings. The book ends with some great pro advice on metering and filters. The strongest part about this book is that all that the author writes, you can see in various photos for yourself in the book. A very well written book that will make you start thinking like a photographer.Highly recommended for your collection of photography books."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book rates right up at the top of the ladder regarding understanding exposure.

It arrived, and it is inspiring and teaching me a few things. However, I can't give this book 5 or even 4 stars because it contains a number of things I find confusing, and a few that are plain wrong (check out his definition of 'specular highlight' and compare it to anyone else's, for example - I can only assume he meant to say 'bokeh' instead)."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I need to get out with the book, its a little big to travel with but its worth the buy."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The book provides a generic introduction to photography for what regards light.

It always seems that the people I ask about these things know a bit about each of them, but then fake it when a question stumps them such as: how do these variables interact and affect each other, especially during variable light conditions?I have now had \\"Understanding Exposure:...\\" for a week, and for the first time in my life I truly do understand these variables, and how they affect the photo when the shutter is finally pressed.Bryan's book is beautifully designed. It flows one through the concepts he presents in a logical and clear order. At one point, he instructs the reader to pick up the camera, then walks them through using/changing the exposure parameters to take his/her very first (including mine!) fully-manual photo. This exercise alone was very enlightening, and is typical of the kind of practical information contained in this great book.Additionally, his book contains many photographic examples, wonderful original photos (including photos of his beautiful wife and children), and humorous and encouraging writing. It is a joy to read, and after having done so, you will have a surprisingly strong grasp on the concepts and practical use of exposure methods. BRAVO!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I think that this book is the most exellent piece of paper i have read about photography. Ok i know that the book is not usefull for profesional photographers that they know what they do all time about the right exposure. But is this book for profesionals? I don't think so. For the rest of us (the serious amateurs users) the author keeps things simple but also goes in depth in the right points. He use only the camera's light meter for right exposure and for me this is the major advandage of the book. His tips and tricks are really useful and they had helped me to improve my photos.thalishttp://www.flickr.com/photos/thalis"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I really learned loads from this well written book. Bryan Peterson wrote the book in a manner that I (the beginner) could easily understand and digest. He also set in a few exercises that really helped me get over some question \\"humps'. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to get a better understanding of what settings to apply to thier camera to get the optimum results."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"A good overview of photography and proper techniques for achieving artistic exposures. I would recommend this book as required reading for all beginning photo students, and a good read for those needing a refresher course.It dose weigh more towards film photography, and less towards digital, but the film techniques do well for digital also. It did not address questions I have about digital. It seems that my digital camera does things that the author says digital cameras do not do."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you're new to digital photography and you want to go beyond using the auto mode, this book is very helpful and easy to understand. I have purchased several books on the subject and this is the book where it finally clicked. I went back to my other books after reading this one and I understood what they were trying to say. A nice pocket companion guide after reading this book is Derrick Story's Digital Photography Pocket Guide."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have read many books, articles and reviews on photography. Bryan's book is the best. It is not full of the tech-no jargon you see books (by some pretty famous photographers) who I believe get caught up in the \\"technical language\\" resulting in books that are difficult to follow and impossible to utilize in the field.Bryan, explains, shows examples and you can go outside your front door and try some of his techniques. The results are amazing. Buy this book with the realization you will carry it with you in your bag for reference.Walt Paholak"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book does an excellent job of discussing the various techniques a photographer can make use of to creatively control exposure. This book teaches you how to make a creative interpretation when capturing the image. This is in contrast to Photoshop and image-editing books that focus on how to edit the image post-capture to produce a creative interpretation.This is a well-written book, with plenty of color examples. It's not written in a complex manner at all, making it an excellent reference after you finish reading it from cover to cover.The techniques highlighted in this book will generally require you to adjust aperture and or shutter speed on your camera. For this reason, SLR and dSLR users will benefit the most. Point and shoot cameras sometimes lack the manual controls to creatively alter the exposure as outlined in this book. Of great interest to me was Mr. Peterson's chapter on metering. He provides simple rules that will assist you in metering the correct portion of the image for the result you want. Here again, it would be better if you had a fully adjustable camera to be able to experiment to the extent that Mr. Peterson encourages.The only criticism I had was that the chapter on filters left me wanting a bit more. Then again, not many digital cameras except dSLRs offer filter mounting capability.I'd recommend this book for anyone from the beginner to the advanced amateur."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Finally the book I have been looking for! I have read many photo books, most of which didn't offer pratical guidelines that were understandable. This book provided more advice and more useful information than any before. I would suggest it for the beginner and above."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"...and I mean a lot. He's quick to give helpful hints and tips with clear vivid analogies...but don't go and buy the book just yet. Those of you who are professionals or experienced amateurs will find this book lacking in very advanced techniques. It explains middle range basics (It won't tell you how to turn on the camera) on better exposures. Don't be surprised if at times you find the author almost appear to be bragging about his life and supposed success. However, it is still a good book for people that have little to no experience in taking their camera out of auto mode and getting better exposures. It's not the best but definitely really good. I think instead of writing separate books the author could have composed the whole series into one book because reading all his books you will often find yourself re-reading information from book to book. This is his main book, the one for which people recognize him. If you read any book of his this should be it, go and borrow his other ones from the library."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book is the best for learning how and what a proper exposure will do to perfect your photography. The book is well written, and the exercises teach one how to get the perfect exposure."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is an excellent and very helpful book, clearly written by a competent and intelligent writer --and a very good photographer. I'm glad I bought it, and would recommend it to others. (In contrast, for example, to \\"Adobe Photoshop for Photographers\\" by Martin Evening, which was apparently written by a Bulgarian and translated by a Chinese. Even for a person experienced with Photoshop, this book is totally incomprehensible --and utterly useless. Don't waste your money: the manual that comes with Photoshop is clearer, more precise, and CERTAINLY better written.)Many heartfelt thanks, therefore, to Bryan Peterson.

This book more then supplied that knowledge. It's very direct without ever being dry in it's presentation of the material and it contains a huge amount of photos taken by the author to show the concepts in practice. It enabled me to quickly move from taking pictures in the 'auto' mode with flash to manual mode without the flash resulting in better looking pictures from reading through the first chapter.I have yet to come across a better all around book for someone embarking on slr photography from using just a point and shoot camera previously. I can't speak for more experienced photographers, but for me this book has been the largest step to removing my training wheels with my camera so far."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is the best book on the basics of exposure.

The author makes extensive use of analogies that I found confusing at best, and simply absurd. I found the author consistently patronizing, and his writing style to be extremely long winded. I actually found the 2 pages on exposure setting in my camera's instruction manual to be considerably more informative and easier to understand.But, if exposure is a complete mystery to you, and the idea of 100 worker bees carrying buckets and trying to catch water from a variable flow faucet makes it easier to understand how a camera works, then by all means this is the book for you. Hence my 2 star rating."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The author is very easy to follow and offers excellent examples which makes it easy for the aspiring photographer to learn the basic concepts to turn their snapshots into photos."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Peterson does a terrific job explaining how to get the most from your camera. He describes the material in a concise and easy to understand manner. If you did nothing else but read the captions that accompany the photographs, you would still increase your knowledge of how to consistently get the best exposure.If you're the type of photographer who shoots exclusively in fully automatic mode, do yourself a favor and buy this book. It'll take you to the next level."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you're ready to move beyond point and shoot cameras and start taking some great photographs I highly recommend this book. I had a fair amount of experience with photography before I read this book but I still learned a lot of new things. It's easy to read and understand with lots of examples and explanations. Worth every penny...."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book demystifies the complexity in the relationship between aperture, shutter speed, digital or film ISO and takes you through several practical exercises that establish clear and simpler guidelines for your photography goals. \\"Choice\\" is the keyword in this book, as he wants you to understand the difference between a proper exposure and a creative exposure and the choices of lighting conditions you can make and how to use and measure them. This is a definite must-have for the serious hobbyist to pro photographer and you can't beat Amazon's price of $14.97. I highly recommend it. Because his written teaching style is so good, I am going to buy his other book \\"Learning to See Creatively\\" from Amazon, while their price is so low."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I have read and re-read this book and each time I learn something new.

The clincher was the fact that this book is used a textbook at UT Arlington for a course through Continuing Education.As of now, I am yet to regret the buy! I have nothing to complain."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am very new to the field of photography. This book has been by far one of the greatest investments I've made to my Photography education. It has provided me with a clear and simple understanding of how to shoot a picture. After reading this book I've learned never to simply pick up my camera and shoot. This book has taught me how to think before I shoot. Also I feel I have a great understanding of how to take a picture with the correct lens.

Great book!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book came recommended by a number of people as a great book to help you understand exposure, just as the title implies. However, it doesn't really help a photographer understand exposure, it just tells the photographer to use the program modes and viola, that's a \\"correct\\" exposure. There is no real discussion on what makes an exposure \\"correct\\" other than the electronics in the camera--aka what someone else decided is correct. This book does not really encourage experimentation with understanding what exposure will convey the artistic message you as the photographer are trying to convey. Also, many of the example photographs in the book need to be updated/modernized."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"The purchase of this book along with a light meter has improved my photography to the point that I am really kicking myself for not getting both much sooner. Don't delay, buy today."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If you're just starting or a pro this is a great book! I'm learning a lot."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Too many errors, a condescending (almost insulting) writing style, inconsistencies, and a lack of real information make this book hardly worth reading. It would be difficult to know about these problems without reading the book first so I hope this review will give some insight into these issues.The book is probably aimed at beginners yet those are the ones who can least afford to get bad information. Those who already know about exposure can see the errors for themselves but the beginners will read this and think this is the real goods. It is not.There are far better books from which to learn about exposure, among them: Ansel Adams \\"The Negative\\" and \\"The Camera\\" and Alain Briot's \\"Mastering Landscape Photography\\".Peterson's book is highly rated and my guess is the rave reviews are from those new to exposure, who don't know they are being shortchanged."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"Absolutely fantastic book to learn. His analogies are fantastic. He talks sense and most impotantly something you can use.This book will open new eyes for you.I highly recomend it to all the people like me who sometimes get poor shots in manual mode or who keep on thinking how to shoot fantastic pictures from common situations."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"for this book, I felt a review for this was quite necessary. I am a beginner when it comes to photography, (as far as years of experience) although going to several classes has made me realize I am in a slightly higher category. This book was a little disappointing in my opinion. I don't know what I was expecting but from all of the high ratings for this book I couldn't help but be disappointed. This really makes me wish I had gone to a local bookstore first and thumbed through the sections to determine which - if any - would be relevant for me. I didn't actually learn much until i got to nearly the end of the book in the sections that talk about metering off of the sky or reflections and when and how to adjust your exposures with those settings. The rest of the book was very basic and I guess it has a lot to do with what I've already read. I am not going to put in a shameless plug here and name other books, but most of all he has talked about can be learned in other non one-dimensional books. If this is an update, then for one, the images in the book need to be updated as well. I was not impressed by the content nor of the images. Not many pictures are in this book that make me feel like I want to go out and try to create/replicate an image like the ones illustrated. I understand the authors approach of not having only \\"one\\" exposure and the necessity to be creative, however, I think it was more beneficial for me to learn correct exposures before learning to let the creative side come out. Besides, if you don't know the correct exposures then I think you don't have the necessary know-how to know what to change to be creative. Were my expectations too high? I don't think so. Can this book be helpful for many others? Of course. I just wasn't for me. I will keep it and maybe read it again to try to uncover some things that I may not have picked up before but to be honest, I had a certain feeling of emptiness once I completed reading it. Hopefully your experience will be better than mine."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This is another one of those books that attempts to save the new photographer time and effort by coming up wth a set if \\"rules\\" about how to expose properly. \\"Aim your meter at the blue sky\\" Etc. Etc. Etc. Thirty five years ago as a newbie photographer I wasted several years of my life reading this sort of stuff in the photography magazines and the more I read the more confused I became.Eventually I bit the bullet and purchased Ansel Adams book on exposure. Alas, try as I might I was unable to summon up much enthusiasm for reading them as they were dryer than the desert he sometimes photographed. Happily I eventually stumbled upon Minor White's crystal clear explaination of the Zone System favored by Ansel Adams. One read and things began to get clearer. Two and I was well on the road to becoming a better photographer.So why did I buy this book? Because with the increasing sophistication of todays digital cameras many exposure techniques that once worked well for me now often seem to get me into trouble. Time and again I've used techniques that once served me well only to later discover in the lightroom that I'd made a bad situation only worse.Simply put, while the manual that came with my camera does a pretty good job of telling which button to push it literally saids nothing whatever about how the button changes things, or, worse yet perhaps, why you would desire to change them in the first place. What I need to know as a serious photographer is what pushing the button achieves and how it achieves it. To whit, when you have an in camera computer based exposure system that attempts to make exposure idiot proof and then try to use that meter in a more traditional way you can get yourself into a world of trouble! Simply put if the camera manufacturer doesn't tell you how their meter measures light, what sort of info it gathers, and how it uses that info to determine correct exposure you are up the proverbial creek badly in need of the proverbial missing paddle.If you are thinking of purchasing this book in an effort to best utilize your camera's exposure meter look elsewhere..."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I'm an average amateur in photography but I love to read about it and I readpretty much anything I can get my hands on.I got this book hoping to know more about exposure and paired it up with amanual 50mm lens to practice because I wanted the hole experience.The book fell short... It's way too technical, even to the point when itbecame boring for me to read because i could have well been written in japannesefor all I care, and then the easy to understand parts where the ones that onlysaid \\"check your light meter until it says your exposure is fine\\" :sMaybe for more experienced photographers this is THE BOOK, but for me it feltshort and I couldn't relate to the author like I have in other books like theones from Lee Frost for example."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I am very satisfied with this purchase. Amazon has great prices and the book was in excellent shape."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"If I had to sum up this book in one sentence I would describe it as \\"A map without any roads\\".The title is misleading because there is no real \\"How To\\" involved in this book. If the author's goal was to say \\"Hey! Look at my pictures and the setting I used to get them\\" then he has succeeded. The rest of the books are some sectioned off background information to help the reader to understand the images better.The reason this book gets a 2 instead of a 1 is because there are some really nice images in the book. I was going to give it a 3 but then I just remembered how the author was breaking his arm patting himself on the back when ever there was an image of his wife & kids involved instead of leaving them anonymous like the other subjects.As far as teaching, you would receive better information from the person working at the local camera shop."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"A great resource...

Besides getting Understanding Exposure, I also bought The Digital Photography I and II. In comparison, Understanding Exposure is outdated and slightly over-rated.1. Outdated. Some part of the books still refers film camera which I believe most readers, either wouldn't care or get confused. In today's digital world, why bother to have 8 pages (page 152 to 159) comparing digital and film (booked was first published in 2004 by someone who started shooting in the 1970s. no wonder). Wouldn't it be better to compare Digital Compact Camera vs DLSR instead?2. Too basic for those have already have some shooting experience. Half the book talk about aperture, shutter speed and ISO. Big aperture helps blur the background, slow shutter speed gives a sense of motion and high ISO can be use in low lighting conditions. If you already knew this, then you might not learn so much from this book.3. Compared to 'The Digital Photography Book', it doesn't give that many tips that will spur you into action immediately. Although after reading the book, you should know when to set aperture to f2.8 or f8 and shutter speed to 1/4 sec or 8 secs, it somewhat feels theoretical.4. Does not talk about equipments and use of flash which I think are key in getting better pictures. But to be fair, this book is about understanding 'Exposure' not 'Photography'.Having said the above, I did learn something from this book.

This is (to my way of thinking) the litmus test for anyone who wishes to show you what he or she can do.

When I got the book, I considered myself an \\"advanced amateur\\" photographer, but this just opened up a whole new world. I couldn't wait to get out and try some of the techniques. This gave me the \\"push\\" I needed to put my camera on manual for most of the time, and to feel confident that the pictures would come out as expected (most of the time, anyway!). Many of the author's images in this book are very inspiring - they make me wish I could go to the same place and see what kind of shot I could make of the same scene. In the past year I've read this book several more times, and whenever I feel like I'm in a photographic rut, I'll flip through this book, and it'll give me ideas that I can't wait to try out. Definitely a two-thumbs-up book. I must say that sometimes the style does seem a little \\"dumbed down\\" but the quality of the information way outweighs that little annoyance.

This book is awesome! Peterson does a really down-to-earth way of discribing aperture/shutter speed...etc...and the correct and best use of those in a very simple to understand way. The book is a joy to read. He gives great tips and tricks and even assingments you can do if you like to really see what he's talking about.

He explains the very basics, I guess that's good if you are just going into photography and don't know about stops, ISO, shutter speed, etc.He talks about the sensor of the camer and how it's at the center at everything - that and other hints on how to take pictures make this book very enlightening. He even tells you exactly what to do on certain days, it's excellent.One thing he could have talked a little more was composition and how to make a dull looking picture a very good one (composition). The discussion on filters was very useful in understanding how to solve the problem of differently exposed areas in your picture, I'd probably just buy this for that section.High highly recommended read, buy it!"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book gave me a good idea of how to use the combination of shutter speed and aperture. I highly recommend this book to people who would like to know how to use their camera's manual controls to take better pictures."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I really did learn a few concepts from this book, but I was disappointed overall. I was hoping for much more guidance based on the reviews this book has received on Amazon. If I had looked at the book in a store, I wouldn't have bought it. Also, the book assumes you have a camera that offers certain features.The book offers numerous examples with pictures and technical seetings of the camera when the picture was taken. The book teaches how to use the manual mode of the camera.I own Canon S2 IS which offers completely manual mode, if desired. I have spent significant amount of time using the teachings of the book to shoot some pictures in manual mode. Resulting pictures are better than camera's automatic modes sometimes and worse sometimes. However, the time taken for manual mode is alway more than the auto mode.Is your primary subject energetic fast moving children? Then, in my opinion, your best bet is one of your camer's automatic modes. If you are shooting landscapes or flowers, and if you are not in a big hurry, you should try manual mode of your camera and learn some good techniques offerred by this book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"There is a lot of good stuff out there, but I found this one to be one of the best books on exposure available anywhere. Peterson gives us all he knows and that is a lot."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book and I still enjoy referencing this book as well. Bryan Peterson does an excellent job of explaining the relationship of lighting with shutter speed, aperture, ISO and other factors. The accompanying examples are great, they help bring into focus (no pun intended) what he is writing about. I love the way he captions his photographs with the important data and what he was trying to accomplish by taking the pictureAnyone who is interested in learning more about photography this is the book to have in your library.To all those new to dSLR (and SLR's in general) Camera's, this book will help you get off the pre-programed icon modes on your camera's dail and over to M, S and A (or for Canon, M, Tv and Av; aka, Manual, Shutter Priority and Aperture Priority). That is where you really should be to get the most out of your camera.Get his book and take control of your camera instead of having your camera control you."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"I learned so much from this book. I have one of those digital SLR cameras that do everything for you, and yet I often have had trouble getting a good exposure consistently. This book helps you understand exposure well enough that you can even shoot pictures in the dreaded manual setting and get great results. The book is easy to read rather than dry like a textbook, and loaded with color photos which compare the results of taking the same picture with different exposure settings. If you know what aperature, shutter speed, and ISO are, but have always struggled to truly understand how they interrelate, or have been in a certain lighting situation and wondered which settings to use, this book will help you. If you have ever wanted to photograph a breathtaking scene before you, but have been disappointed by the results your camera gave on automatic settings, this book will help you. I can't say enough good things about this book."},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"This book taught me how exposure works. Now it's fun again to create digital images. I'm a novice at photography that is learning quickly with the help of this \\"easy read\\". Plain and simple language that I truly enjoy reading. Best book I've read on photography in years. Bryan explains the how-tos clearly and makes it fun to go out and do it! Thanks Bryan"},{"Title":"Understanding Exposure","review":"In February I bought my first DSLR camera and read The Canon EOS Digital Rebel XSi/450D Companion by Ben Long as a great introduction on the features and use of my camera. I learnt a great deal with this book and would recommend it but I was still relegated to shooting from the P (program) mode. Then in an Alleluia moment, I happened across this book by Bryan Peterson. In less than a month, and a few ages into his book, I was shooting in M (manual) mode and actually knew what I was doing. The pictures were amazing. I like the way he explains how to use the different aperture, shutter speed and ISO settings. Many books will almost encourage you to cram what aperture opening goes well with which Shutter speed at a particular ISO setting. Bryan Peterson will have none of that. With several clear and easy to understand examples he teaches you the effect of these settings and makes you learn how to use them to capture a well exposed picture without ever memorizing any sequences at all. To think that I came across this book accidently, still sends chills down my spine - I would still be shooting in P mode 8 months later. This book is a must have for any one starting out."},{"Title":"Debunking the Y2K Terrors & Tales","review":"Mr. Whitington's Debunking the Y2K Terrors &amp; Tales is welcome proof that you don't have to write a tome longer than War and Peace to make your point. It's also a book in which the author uses his brain and deductive reasoning skills. Methodically and calmly, Mr. Whitington serves his readers with doses of technical and common sense---both of which are in shockingly short supply concerning this timely subject. Yet, he goes beyond simply identifying what the scare stories are and why they're baseless. He invokes business and technical logic, other scarce commodities for which you can search long and hard when reading about Y2K.Of course our toasters will work in January 2000. Why in the world would so-called embedded chips in toasters have date functions in the first place? So I can set my watch by them as I butter my English muffin?Of course our cars will start in January 2000. Of course the elevators will keep working after the new millennium begins. The so-called embedded chips in these machines aren't date sensitive either. Why would they be?Another reviewer used &quot;shallow&quot; to describe Mr. Whitington's work. That's a bad choice of words, readers. The work isn't sold by the pound like some elongated, lugubrious books, but it is most certainly not shallow. It's as long as it takes for Mr. Whitington to do the job---to show in both technical and yet very readable ways that this Y2K hoopla is just that. Hoopla.Do yourself and your family a favor. Before you purchase a swimming pool in which to store water, yank your assets and other life's savings out of the bank or cut off your own head and run around in mindless circles, I heartily recommend you buy and read this book. You'll save yourself a lot of needless, worthless aggravation. You also won't be lining the pockets of Y2K shysters and other con artists all too willing to take your survivalist money and skip merrily to THEIR banks with YOUR money.Mr. Whitington, thanks for using your brain---and your writer's pen---to bathe this topic in badly-needed logic."},{"Title":"Debunking the Y2K Terrors & Tales","review":"I'm glad to see that Mr. Whitington has taken the time to research this matter so thuroughly. It is reassuring to see that not everyone is trying to get into our wallets using the Y2K scare. Thanks you for your straight-forward approach to this problem. I will avoid buying into all the scare tactics now."},{"Title":"Debunking the Y2K Terrors & Tales","review":"I bought this book in an effort to find convincing counter arguments to the standard Y2K scenarios. Unfortunately, this book does not deliver. Mr. Whitington's disappointingly shallow arguments reduce to this: Gloomy Y2K scenarios are impossible because,1. The people who predict them are all motivated by greed, hoping to sell more Y2K supplies. 2. The corporations and government agencies that provide critical services are all working on the problem and promise to have it fixed in time. 3. Vendor compliance reports and those of government agencies are reliable. 4. The people working on the problem are highly motivated to solve it in time. 5. The author doesn't personally know any programmers who are relocating to rural areas or taking any other extraordinary precautions. 6. Some of the statements that have been promulgated about Y2K are false.Consider, for example, his &quot;debunking&quot; of the possibility of bank runs. He merely points outs the Federal Reserve has printed $50 billion of contingency cash and that the FDIC says that it will insure any losses:&quot;There will undoubtedly be many people who pull their life savings out of the bank before New Years' Eve in 1999. The Federal Reserve has already anticipated this and instructed the U.S. Mint to print an additional fifty billion dollars in currency; other countries are following suite.&quot;&quot;If a bank or thrift institution should fail because of Year 2000 problems, insured deposits will be covered -- no ifs, ands, or buts.&quot; [Quoting the head of the FDIC]It never occurs to Mr. Whitington that his task is to argue that (given that total bank deposits exceed $3 trillion) the quantity of contingency cash is sufficient to meet any appreciably probable demand. He must explain how word of a run at one bank, won't spread the panic toothers. He must explain where, after an economic collapse triggered by massive bank failures, the FDIC will find the funds to insure losses.In attempting to debunk the idea that noncompliant computers can &quot;infect&quot; compliant ones, he errs by failing to understand the mode of infection. Mr. Whitington assumes at all re-corruption will result from date synchronization between computers, which he argues (correctly) does not in general occur. He fails to realize that it is the data being transferred that is corrupt. Corrupted transactions will have to be sorted out (uncorrupted) by human beings. Mr. Whitington fails to address the important question of whether there will be sufficient man power to uncorrupt corrupted transactions fast enough to prevent a slow down and consequent collapse of financial networks.Rather delving beneath the surface of the more catastrophic failures (e.g. banking or power), he instead devotes considerable space to knockingdown Y2K straw men. He unnecessarily assures us that cars, elevators, TV sets and other household appliances will not fail.In discussing the IRS he does not bother to mention the IRS' repeated failures in attempting to modernize its computers. Mr. Whitington shows no understanding IRS operations, arguing that the IRS cannot fail because its web site says that they're committed to solving the problem and because its failure is inconceivable:&quot;... do you really believe that the IRS will not be ready to take money from you on April 15th of the year 2000?&quot;According to Mr. Whitington, grocery store shelves cannot empty, because most grocers have converted to the Electronic Data Interchange standard, which uses a four-digit year. He does not explain why panic-driven demand cannot exceed a supply that has been reduced by increased ineffiencies in the supply system, which are due to the cumulative effect of glitches -- however slight -- in the financial, communication, transportation or electrical systems.Regarding the health care industry, there is no problem because vendors never lie:&quot;Since they are somewhat limited in their ability to perform live testing, the strategy that the healthcare industry has embraced is to carefully identify all at-risk components and track the vendor's compliance reports.&quot;Regarding water utilities, because they have developed a compliance checklist, &quot;it is unlikely that there will be any significant interruption of water supply&quot;. Even if this statement is true, it is not comforting. If, for example, &quot;unlikely&quot; means 10% probable, there is a 10% chance of a national calamity of unprecedented scale. This would warrant precisely the preparation measures that Mr. Whitington cautions against.According to the author there is no reason to have cash or gold, because&quot;If an apocalypse occurs of the magnitude that the Y2K shysters are predicting ... paper money would be worthless. Precious metals like gold and silver would carry little value as well.&quot;This appears to be another example of superficial thinking. Y2K scenarios describe varying degrees by which the economy will contract. There are no credible scenarios in which it disappears altogether. Mr. Whitington does not consider less apocalyptic scenarios in which, for example, unemployment merely rises to 50%. In such a case there would be no reason to expect the money economy to disappear. On the contrary, had there been a collapse of the banking system, one would expect cash to be king, as in the Great Depression. Were the government to attempt to solve its financial problems by printing excessive amounts of cash, one would expect, on the basis of over two thousand years of history, that the money economy would return to the traditional precious metals. The author discusses none of this, relying instead on unsupported assertions.Mr. Whitington should be commended for attempting to write the sort of book that we badly need. He aptly summarizes the major Y2K gloom predicitions.Nevertheless, this is an unthinking, poorly researched, and dangerously superficial treatment of an important issue. It appears to have been motivated primarily by anger at Y2K profiteers or jealously of them. I could not shake the impression that this ebook is just the author's own quick attempt to cash in on Y2K.Following the advice in this book might save you money, or it might get you and your family killed."},{"Title":"Debunking the Y2K Terrors & Tales","review":"This is an interesting and well-written book that conveys a lot of information aimed at the average reader. Instead of highly technical jargon describing computer workings, the book covers a variety of topics that the average person is curious about regarding what are likely scenarios for Y2K.He covers economic, social and technical topics in an interesting, informative manner. His view of the Y2K event seems to follow other authors in that the world will not end, people will not die...life will go on. This is the sane, reassuring message other non-alarmists give us.The book makes common sense, rational suggestions about things the average reader shoud/could do to minimize Y2K problems. The information presented is timely. The things to do are all &quot;do-able&quot; by any reader.I would recommend this book as a down-to-earth source of information for anyone having concerns about the Y2K. I especially appreciate the range of topics and the easily readible style.

The insightful content is a breath of fresh air amidst a world clouded in Y2K rumor and potentially harmful misinformation on this all-too-serious matter.

They offer their customers credit, and those customers ultimately never end up paying Ginger and Pickles back. They end up going bankrupt and closing the store.After the closing, the former customers of that shop end up going to the only other store in town that took advantage of the closing by raising their prices. Having to deal with this, and some of the other trade-men's unfriendly customer service policies, the animal populace rejoices when Sally Hen-penny decides to reopen Ginger and Pickles' old store. She only accepts cash, but has great prices.In the end, the customers are happy, however, the reality of how Ginger and Pickles were walked over is never addressed.

It is a short story but feels like it goes on forever. Overall the best part of the story is when Ginger and Pickles discuss their frustration on not eating the customers. Overall boring. It also mentions them selling snuff a few times. My children kept asking me what snuff was. That was the only part of the story that stood out to them. My nine year old didn't want me to finish the story and my four year old kept interrupting. Not worth keeping, we deleted it.

I felt this was a wonderful way to share my thoughts with them and to let them know the door is always open for them.I highly recommend this book to any parent. it's a wonderful exercise on relationships and all that went into raising the child as he/she was raised."},{"Title":"Making Peace With Your Adult Children: A Guide to Family Healing","review":"This is the best book yet written on a very difficult and divisive subject.

I thought it was way too long, so I put off reading it for a few months. Finally I picked it up and almost immidiately fell in love with the story. This series is one of the best fantasy series I've ever read!The main character is hilarious. I read so much (about a book a day) that not many stories surprize or delight me anymore. Not so with this novel. I was laughing out loud, again and again. I'm now twenty and this is still one of my favorite books.Fun enough for the kids, yet interesting and mature enough to not throw off the adults.And don't be thrown off by the overall rating. It's just look cause some numskull forgot to include his rating with the book description.Read this book! You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Applied Mythology","review":"Applied Mythology (2000) is an omnibus edition of the Mythology series, containing the first three volumes:Mythology 101,Mythology Abroad, andHigher Mythology.

The librarians are contemplating more space for up-to-date multimedia and computer equipment. The athletic department is also considering expansion.The Little People learn of the proposal and the Conservatives are shocked. There goes their neighborhood. Holl proposes that the Big Ones be asked for help in opposing this project, but the Conservative vote overwhelms the Progressive suggestion.Meanwhile, the student government is given a voice in the renovation decision.

The Inter-Hall Council votes in favor of Keith's proposal.Keith is having problems in his Sociology class. Marcy mentions her study group and Keith asks to join. Marcy tells him that she must clear his admittance with the group leader.Keith soon becomes impatient and follows Marcy to her next study group meeting. This and the following surveillance efforts are unsuccessful. Finally, he sneaks down to the lowest floor and then falls through a door into the Master's class.The Master tells him to seat himself, but Keith is too involved in observing the Little People to respond. Finally Keith joins the group and he fizzes with ecstasy in every class. He even learns a lot more about Sociology.Carl tells the study group about Keith's speech and the Elves start shunning him. But Keith -- now knowing about the Elves -- reconsiders his thinking on the renovation issue. At the next Inter-Hall Council meeting, he asks for -- and gets -- another vote, but the majority still favor demolishing the library.Keith soon learns that the Elves are impoverished and he starts planning ways to help them. He rounds up some surplus material for clothing, but finds the Master displeased with the charity. Yet the women in the class are very glad to take the material and soon produce some fantastic apparel.The Master makes his viewpoint very clear: the Elves do not need nor want charity.

Read and enjoy!-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"MOTHERS","review":"Claire Bretecher is a brilliant comic book artist with a wacky, off-color sense of humor. I don't know how this English translation holds up to the French original or whether it works as a paperback. I've only read the hard-back version. But if you don't speak French, this is your best chance at reading some of Bretecher's funniest work yet! Ostensibly writing about pregnancy -- which she jokes about with wickedly accurate precision -- she also lampoons political correctness, feminism, slackers, pretentiousness and much, much more. Be forewarned: lots of ribald jokes, naughty language & squiggly (usually) unflattering drawings of naked bodies. But really, it's just good, silly, off-color fun. Guaranteed to have you in stitches.

Themes include his memories of his father, the Second World War, and studies of the forgotten characters of the period, and ultimately Drake uses these images to paint a transition between his boyhood view of his father to his eventually becoming similar in many ways to his father.

'I found these to be a very quick read, entertaining, well written and memorable.I'm a big fan.I do not agree though where at times the author says that you don't have to read them in order. You do.Some people have also commented on this author's political stance.I wish so badly that stars and people in the public light would just keep quiet for there are more stars that i refuse to patronize now because they open their mouths. So i made a point NOT to read too much more about this author because i so much like the Ender/Puppet series. I love these books."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I have enjoyed the series up to this point, but it seemed as it had been losing steam with each subsequent book and this has been the worse so far. From the start with the whole business of Peter rescuing Achilles and bringing him to the Hegemon compound, it was just stretching it too far. Then the series seems to gofrom being a mainly sci-fi story to a military/political one. The problem is that Card is not a very good military writer and the plot at times seems like a cheap version of Tom Clancy. The whole military campaing and strategies seemed completely simplistic and outdated. But most disappointing is the lack of vision in regard to the technology being employed. The story takes place in a universe where the human race has conquered space travel and living in space is now commonplace, not only that but they are in the process of colonizing far away planets, yet the technology and therefore the strategies being used to fight the wars on earth seem to come straight out of a period somewhere between WWII and the present day. It is almost impossible to imagine that if our technology has evolved so much that space travel is now possible that we would not have better technology used on earth. Because of that lack of vision in regards to technology some of the strategies used in planning the wars seem straight out of WWII. Overall just an inferior book when compared to the earlier books in the series."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Like another reviewer, I have also read everything written by OSC. I even read his weekly editorials. I like this book. OSC is by far one of the best writers out there with regards to pacing, dialogue, and, especially, true perceptions about the human experience that resonate with his readers' own experiences. My only complaint, I guess, is that I want him to write more about Peter. I like Bean, I just am more interested in Peter. Actually, the real truth is that I would really like to see OSC start something completely new and fresh. The Ender series is great but I think you can only take a series so far and then it loses some of its appeal. Its hard to top a previous work that has already reached the pinnacle. Just an opinion."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I have read every novel and short story by OSC that I could lay my grubby hands on. OSC novels are a \\"must buy\\" for me. There have been some dissapointments, but over all he delivers the goods and Puppets has the goods: it's a page turner full of action, adventure and intrigue. It isn't terrible, but its weaknesses over power the strengths. I have two main gripes with Puppets...The whole novel seems rushed. OSC needs to take his time and write the book that all of us, his loyal fans, know he is capable of writing. I want an Ender and/or Bean sequel that is worthy of being placed on my shelf along side Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow and Speaker for the Dead. Not placed in a dusty box in my closet with Xenocide and Shadow of the Hegemon. At least this sequel made it's way into the dusty box. Children of the Mind was traded at a used bookstore. Afterall, it wasn't that bad."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Has anyone else noticed that as Card ages, his novels seem to become worse? Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon, and Shadow Puppets all fall far short of the intense characterizations found in Ender's Game, Songmaster, or even Lovelock. Card once plumbed the depth of human emotions to bring his work to life. His was a mysterious art with characters such as Ender and Ansset who were portrayed as gifted but unutterably tragic, and Card emerged his audience in a world where nothing need fully be explained because of his wonderful sense of subtley.Card loses that sense in his latest novels where he feels strangely compelled to spell everything out for his audience as if somehow they now lacked the intelligence to understand his work without a guide.Ok, enough of that.Down to Shadow Puppets. When Shadow of the Hegemon ended, I thought that perhaps Card could salvage this series. I didn't like the novel all that well, but I was intrigued by Card's portrayal of Achilles and his \\"love\\" for Petra. When I picked up Shadow Puppets, I was hoping to find this theme explored. Not to happen. Achilles is barely mentioned in the text. Instead one sees some ... about Bean and Petra's true love (Kinda happened fast compared to Kya-Kya's and Josif's blossoming love in Songmaster) that reads like a trashy romance novel without the sex. Of course, I expected Bean and Petra to be the focus of the novel, but to leave out the main villain almost alltogether was uncalled for. The lack of Achilles presence in the text allows the audience to forget how terrible and tragic (much more like Ender and Ansset that Bean is) he is.Of course, I was hoping something more was to be made of his relationship with Petra. She was his captive after all, and even a good dose of overplayed Stockholm Syndrome here would have been appreciated over Bean and Petra's forced love that comes at no explanation. Sigh...Someone rewrite this novel please. URK!!!Two new pet peeves of Card's new novels.1. Card's new portrayal of religion. While allusions to religion have always been made (Ender's Game, Lost Boys, etc), they have always remained in the background. Now Card overplays religion, in that his descriptions are HIGHLY elaborate in situations where a sentence or two would have conveyed a more powerful feeling. Ender's mother in this latter half of the series is the most annoying preacher of almost trite sounding morality. Sister Carlotta is a more acceptable (less annoying) source of lecture (and Card does lecture) as she is a nun.2. The portrayal of women. Not all women have babies on the mind. Not all women would place their children first. Not all women must rely on a man to be a person in their own right. Maybe the women in Card's universe do, but not so in the real world.GRR!!! Give me back the Old Orson Scott Card. He was the better writer!!!I would give this ... 0 stars if I could."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"That's what they might have as well titled this book, since for the most part, discussion of babies and related things eclipsed the international political struggles that have been this series's stable.I loved the original Ender's series, and I've liked the series following Bean thus far, but I'm deeply disappointed in this book. The characters just don't ring true any more; many are mere shadows of who they were in previous books, and it felt that Card was just using them as puppets to deliver his message.There were some worthwhile, enjoyable parts of the book, especially those involving Peter and his parents (who are smarter than we've given them credit for in previous books), and even the baby storyline could have been good, if it weren't so horribly overdone.In most of his other books, Card raises moral or philisophical questions, and gives us glimpses of people approaching them from both sides, before reaching a conclusion, at least giving opposing veiwpoints some space. In this book, however, he raised no questions, provided no insights; rather, he stated early in the book through a briefly-appearing character who was clearly a mouthpiece, that the purpose of a man's life is to make and raise babies with a woman. I would have much preferred he have examined the difficulty of being a parent without having it completely consume one's identity in the struggle to be a \\"perfect\\" parent; hopefully in the next book, we will see him make the transition from the idealization of parenthood to the reality. If that is indeed what he does, then this book will be worth reading, as an essential step in said philisophical development."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"The original Ender series, the one that followed the journey of Ender Wiggin, a child prodigy trained from his early years to lead a war against an alien invasion, was breathtaking. It was filled with action, psychodrama, speculative fiction, and imagination. At points in the later books, there was a tendency to spin off into pontification and meandering \\"philosophizing\\". By and large, the books were rich and captivating. I cared about Card's characters even after Ender had left them.\\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\", the first of the \\"Shadow\\" series showed some real promise. It was basically a book about the development of a minor character from \\"Ender's Game\\", Bean, a runt who also happened to be the smartest human being ever born. The first book follows Bean from his earliest moments as a street urchin in Rotterdam to his days with Ender at Battle School. He is a fully human character, even if the fact that he is also a genetic experiment renders him not quite so human in genotype.By the time we meet Bean in the seventh book, it is evident that the \\"genre\\" of child geniuses fighting with and against each other to rule the world, has a limited shelf life. Bean is still a wunderkind who is now afflicted with a self-abusive personality that is so petulant and repetitive I could barely stand to read the dialogue.Orson Scott Card's early books are among my absolute favorites. The Ender series is wonderful. The Worthing Saga rivals Philip K. Dick for its predictive social sci-fi. Pastwatch, a fairly recent publication, is also an exercise in creativity and [...] romance novel with Petra begging Bean to have babies with her, other dyads of power and ambition vying for control of the world. None of it seems real. It reminds me of a pulp novel from the 1930's. At over 450 pages, it feels like Card wrote with no editor and no revisions. The writing is sloppy and boring. He dwells on themes and relationships the way one would expect from John Irving, but not as well, for that's not Card's strong suit.This series is not indicative of Card's ability as a story teller. As a long time reader, I am not likely to give up on him, but if he continues to publish more Ender books, I won't read them. I just hope he moves on to something else sooner rather than later."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"The book's tolerable. Essentially, the problem with it boils down to shallowness: the characters are merely caricatures, the dialog is banal, and the plot has no depth. If I had actually bought this book instead of borrowing it from the library, I'd probably be more upset about it. As it is, it was just a waste of time reading it. I find this amazing since all the other Ender/Bean books of this era are excellent. I don't know what happened with this book, but don't bother reading it."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I found that Card's description of war and politics in Shadow Puppets was quite unbelievable. In fact, an invading bugger fleet is more believable. The whole scenario of China invading India just seems like it was done because someone had to be invading someone else for the world be in turmoil. The only motivation behind it seems to be: Achilles got them to do it. How the Chinese are ultimately dealt with seems like a deus ex machina to me: an old Battle School comrade suddenly shows up halfway through the story with an huge army. All in all, the political backdrop of this story is farfetched and quite boring to read about. If you're looking for a book with political intrigue, try Tom Clancy instead.Politics aside, the characterization in this book is extremely thin. Bean and Petra are just focused on having babies. Peter never actually does anything as Hegemon. Achilles is portrayed as the major villan, but really only has a small role in the plot. The characters of Shadow Puppets have no depth to them, and really aren't that intresting to read about."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Even at his worst, OSC can write a page turning story. You have to slog through some poor chapters, but he keeps you interested. The problem is while you are reading it, you know it is nowhere near as good as his other work. It is derivative of his older work that it feels like a rerun in spots. Sort of like reading the 18th Xanth book.I love OSC and have read all his work. This ranks pretty much near the bottom of his work. It does not focus enough on Achilles, the antagonist to Bean. Focuses too much on the other battle school graduates that ally with Ender. It does have some focus on Peter, which is good, but it should have had more focus on him. The interesting characters in the story are Peter and Achilles, but he spends his time with Bean and Petra, who are not very interesting.The problem with focusing on the misc other battle school graduates that Bean meets in his travel is that every one of them must prove they are smart. To do so, OSC must invent some sort of scenario that proves that they are smart. For me, the twists provided did not sound logical at all and were not believable. Apparently, the world of the future does not have bulldozers or radar or spam filters, but you can travel on a rocket ship to a different world.The other problem is OSC outtake on the political climate of the world. It is not explained at all. For example, the main reason the world is in turmoil is because for some reason China wants to rule the world. No reason is given.Is there some mad leader in China wanting to rule the world? No, apparently there is a committee that rules China and they have determined that World Domination is the way to go.The book lacks any depth. OSC has gotten into the bad habit of having all his characters think the same and talk the same. He explains there every emotion versus showing the emotion.The ending also could have been so much better. I have several problems in how the ending could even have occurred. If you think about it a little bit, it does not make sense.The book is a mixed bag. In the end, I didn't like the book that much, however, I anxiously await any sequel that could be forthcoming."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"This by far is the weaker book in the whole Ender/Bean saga, but this isn't due to Card losing his stuff or anything quite that dramatic. The fact of the matter is that this is the last two hundred or so pages of book 6. Before the story could move anymore (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER) Achilles had to be killed. I'm guessing that adding that to the sixth book would have made it longer than the publisher liked, and thus what was probably one hundred pages of story had to be fleshed out, and thus diluted. I just finished reading book 8 and let me tell you that this was a wholly necessary step in the story.As for the lack of science fiction, I can admit that it isn't totally traditional sci-fi at this point, but it's still got most of the characteristics. Anything in the future, after alien bug invasions, with colony worlds, and faster than light communication, well yeah that counts as sci-fi to me. I think the biggest problem is that Card is a total sci-fi guy, and when he tries his hand at romance it comes off like a Bollywood movie. And the babies thing, the emphasis on having tons of babies, is a natural reaction of the characters to the end of the birth control laws. That probably explains why there seems to be an ongoing breeding infatuation.Anyway, this book is good, but the others are great. But we need all in the series to make it work, so this one does it's job well enough. It can't live up to the intrigue of the others, but it makes the eigth book possible. And the eigth was really worth it. At least we can be thankful that they haven't become as whacked out as the last two Ender books."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Though you'll want to pick it up if you've been following the Bean series, Shadow Puppets really is sub-standard material. The book is essentially a string of sometimes only distantly related minor plot lines, each of which lacks any internal dynamic and is simply nudged forward each time it comes up. The Big Battle at the end only awkwardly ties them together and really provides no sense of closure. Now for the specifics (and spoilers)...Card usually appreciates the importance of maintaining a close link between the personal and the political; in Ender's Game, for example, Ender's predestined role and responsibilities feed and accentuate his personal tragedy, and we care about larger events in the Enderverse because he and the other protagonists are directly involved in and affected by them. In Shadow Puppets the Bean/Petra story is completely unrelated to anything else in the book, though it's of course complicated by the predictible dastardly schemes of Achilles. Meanwhile it's hard to care about Chinese oppression since we barely hear of it, much less see it; hard to care that they lose what they only won in the last book anyway; hard even to be particularly excited about the war against them since it pops up so late and so suddenly.On the whole the characters are pretty disappointing as well--in the case of Peter Wiggin 'disappointing' is too mild a word. Yes, the sick sadist of Ender's Game had to be domesticated to some degree, but now not only is his cruelty and ambition completely gone, so is his genius. One of the driving ideas of the series is that it concerns kids who are not 'just kids', but here Peter seems to be exactly that, just a kid. Meanwhile in place of another series hallmark, strange and terrible psychological conflict and paradox, you have simplistic, mechanical character trademarks; 'he'll kill you if you see him when he's weak,' etc. I've never really liked the Achilles character, but in this book he's not even a character anymore, just a plot mechanism that keeps the book moving; as a result his death is highly anti-climactic. Meanwhile Petra and Bean crying all the time becomes wearisome, and for the most part the dialogue, at its best sharp and witty in Card's work, has deteriorated to \\"cute.\\"And just forget the endless plot liberties, as when Alai suddenly appears at just the right time to drag Bean and Petra back into the Big Picture, and with unexpected but fortuitous plans to give the book some sort of central event, i.e. attack China. Or Achilles's shooting down an IF shuttle--whether or not Peter had been on it, the IF still would have traced the attack and Achilles's goose still would have been cooked. Why on earth would an evil genius make such a stupid move?But this is not a 1-star review; Shadow Puppets is a good read on the whole, and Card's trademark plot twists, secret codes, and political/military strategy bits are all satisfying and clever enough. I just wish more could be said to the book's credit."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"It was interesting reading other people's reviews. People had complaints that never crossed my mind. Personally, I thought it was excellent. It took me only two days from start to finish. First of all, I enjoyed watching Bean and Peter's progression. Bean ponders on how Ender was able to beat about any enemy. Peter is forced to be more humble as he's outsmarted there are apparently others who are a step ahead of him. Among them are his parents, and are two of the most interesting characters in the book. I have to say, though, Bean and Petra's romance may not be appealing to some. Petra does, for some strange reason, want to have children with Bean, despite his altered genes and she's only eighteen at most? Furthermore, she knows he's going to die young, but she doesn't worry about that. The reasoning behind them getting together seems kinda weird. All in all, it was extremely interesting and I loved the ending. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Well, this wasn't Ender's Game, as the other reviews point out. At times, it is too into the romance plot and I must admit that I didn't recognize some of the character traits in the characters.Despite this, I thought that the book was excellent. It isn't quite as action packed as... Ender's Game, but very geopolitical, which I find intersesting, and his view of the future is very neat. You can't look at this book as a action packed adventure, although it has that. Read it as a geopolitical thriller that tells continues the story of Ender's the somewhat modified army, and you should enjoy it. I look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"The Battle School Children keep growing up in the continuation of the Ender's Shadow series. Ender and Petra mature into adults and struggle with the ramifications of having children. Peter deals with reality as a politician, not just an essayist. Achilles returns and is working for Peter? As the time moves on, child geniuses are teen geniuses running the world that is in political turmoil. The book mostly focuses on Bean and Petra and their running away from Achilles, convinced he is going to murder Bean for wrongs he committed (All are Achilles killings are people who have made him vulnerable). We learn more about Bean's past and his inevitable, distressing future.Thing that impressed me most about the book was Orson Scott Card didn't pull any punches; no cheesy easy ways out and no infuriating extensions the series (there is another book coming, but has the potential to be a very good book with a real story to tell). If you can't get beyond genius children manipulating world politics, then the books won't be as interesting. Political machinations make this more than a horror book with the evil villain pursuing the virtuous couple. The USA isn't the focus of all the political force that is affecting the world, but merely a reactor to other more powerful countries (which is odd for an American writer to do). The villian, Achilles, has depth and deviousness in his character that makes him believable as well as understandably evil, and Bean, the hero, is a squirmy stubborn who has to be manipulated to realize his own humanity. An odd person to root for certainly and Card makes you care about him.A Good read with engaging characters and plot lines. If you haven't read any of the previous books, I suggest starting with Ender's Game or Ender Shadow (Ender's Game is best read before Ender's Shadow but is not necessary).Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"There are only so many words in my vocabulary to describe how excellent this book is. &quot;Fantastic&quot; is one of them. &quot;Incredible&quot; is another.Shadow Puppets, in my opinion, picks up the slack left by Shadow of the Hegemon. SotH was good, but it was all military this and strategy that, and I can't think like that. They wouldn't even give me a monitor, that's how unqualified for Battle School I am. So I was more than glad to get back to character development, one of Card's strongest talents, in my opion.NOt just main characters, either. We get into Wiggin parents who get so little focus in the other 6 Ender/Bean books, but I after I finished SP I couldn't picture them any other way.Card outdoes himself with almost every single book he writes. I laughed, cried, cried some more, and made the other people on the Metra wonder what was wrong with me. Only the very best can elicit emotions from strangers by creating characters so real it feels like they have alway been your best friend. OSC proves himself the best."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"This installment in the Enders series stands almost diametrically opposed to the original &quot;Ender's Game&quot; short story that started it all. &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; is seemingly filler in the series, and I would recommend that the interested reader skip this and continue on directly to the next book in the series, perhaps coming back to read this as a later novelty.The characterization in the book is shoddy. The book dedicates much of itself to the forced redemption of two of the major characters, and both fall woefully short of plausibility. The characterization of the major female characters is shallow enough to be insulting, reducing them to charicatures.The witty bantering is overdone and its novelty withers quickly. The plot jumps aren't enough to be jarring, but the pages and pages of Banter should have been replaced with more meat to the book.In all, I continue to think that Card is a good writer who writes one klinker in every bunch. Whether it's the fault of bad editors or not: skip this and be glad that the final book should be good."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"After so many years of being one of the biggest fans of Orson Scott Card's &quot;Ender Series&quot; I can't believe what a really awful book this is. It's condescending, insulting, and completely unbelieveable. It's really very sad that after I have enjoyed so many of his books that the very last one I read would be so very very BAD."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Ok...let's get something straight from the start, this is no Ender's Game. If you think that it will be don't read it. Each book that Orson Scott Card writes (with the exception of Ender's Shadow) takes him farther away from the same theme of Ender's Game. This is not necessarily a bad thing...its just the way it is.Basicly, this novel is a direct continuation of Shadow of the Hegemon. It was a fun and exciting and served to tie up most of the loose ends that Shadow of the Hegemon created...and then create another one.Loose ends tied up:How does the rest of the world deal with the new Chinese empire.What happens when Bean and Petra \\"hook-up.\\"What is Achilles final fate.The problem is that it was very easy to see how these three teasers would be resolved. The Chinese would get worked, Bean and Petra would indeed hook-up and Achilles would get killed. There was little tension as to if these things would happen. Just how. The how was fun though.There is one loose end that has not still been wrapped up from Shadow of the Hegemon:How does Peter gain credibility as Hegemon?This will need to be resolved in Shadow of the Giant (the next book.) I was hoping to see that in this book, but Card choose to show him go through a humbling phase as he prepares for him to emerge as the great leader that we all know he can be.One new loose end was created:Where are Bean and Petra's children that are still embryos?This will doubtlessly be the focus of Shadow of the Giant.The final question that we all want to know is: Will Bean die of his genetic condition or will he be saved? With the reintroduction of Volescu I am beginning to think that Bean might be saved.All in all, the book answered some of the questions that have been lingering in an unoriginal but entertaining fashion. There are still enough loose ends in the Enderverse to warrent at least one more volume."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"While it's hard to compete with Ender's Game (which I think Card did pretty well in Ender;s Shadow), Card manages to continue the story begun there with another exciting chapter of the political and military intrigue surrounding Ender's jeesh on their return to earth.After reading Speaker for the Dead and Xenocide, the reader is left to wonder what went on back on Earth after Ender left. The Shadow series does a good job of telling that story.If you read the other books in this series, you should like this one as well. Hopefully, the next one will continue a good story and not take the enormous step backwards that happened in the original series with Children of the Mind."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Shadow Puppets is another installment in the Ender's Game series by Orson Scott Card. It takes place after the battle with the Buggers and deals primarily with Bean, Peter Wiggin and some of Ender's other battle school cohorts. All now in positions of power either by their own finangling or by the sheer weight of being battle school graduates the children are all vying for power. You should know this is more of a political and intrigue styled book and is as much a departure from the original Ender's Game as Children of the Mind Xenocide, etc were. However, it is good work by Card and worth a read."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Where are the charachters from the first two books? Where did the relationship of Bean and Petra come from? Why is a teenage girl obsessed with child birth to the point of endangering her own life? Why is Card writing about a 14 year old boy having sex and getting a girl pregnant?It seems that either Card was forced to write a diminished story due to publishing pressures. Or he had to write about the joys of unrestricted reproduction to apease his mormon fans. Either way this was a horible book that was ruined for me as soon as Petra started nagging Bean to father her children. Card seems to have lost his way and I for one will not be buying his next offering."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Like Children of the Mind, the least of the original Ender series, Shadow Puppets marks a point where Mr. Card has either lost interest in his characters or inspiration to continue the series. The drop in quality since Shadow of the Hegemon is precipitous. While reading, I was surprised by how uninvolved I often felt.That's not to say the book doesn't have its fun moments. The scene featuring a depressed Peter Wiggin right before a potentially career-ending press conference is hilarious, and the climax is fairly exciting. Yet the rest of the book is crushed by an overemphasis on babymaking (sure Bean and Petra are exceptional, but they're still teenagers), and the spark that makes you race through Mr. Card's earlier works is curiously absent.Still, fans of the Ender and Bean novels might as well read this book. Though the series seems lifeless now, the story still isn't over. A future volume detailing Bean's demise may be worth waiting for."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Shadow Puppets picks up right after Shadow of the Hegemon ended. Achilles has been rescued by Peter Wiggen, the current Hegemon, from China. Bean protests, and begins to move around, constently moving to stay out of Achille's hands. Petra declares her love for him, and they are married. In the meantime, Peter and his family discover that Achilles is beginning to manipulate the Hegemon government, forcing Peter to run as well.Bean and Petra end up with Alai and his muslim forces, where they are planning an attack on China. Bean and Petra create several embryos to have a child, only to have the ones that were not implanted stolen by Achilles in an effort to lure Bean into his trap.I found this to be as likeable as the other books in the series. Card does a magnificent job of creating a political crisis and shifting alliences that seem to be very simple. Achilles is back and causing more trouble. SPOILERS: I really liked the fact that he was killed by Bean, but It makes me wonder about what will happen in the next book.I also liked the fact that we revisited Battle Station. In Ender's Game, it was a military acadamy, but in Shadow Puppets it is a way-station for colony ships.What I didn't like about the book were a couple things. The first was Peter. He's the Hegemon in the book, but around his parents, he acts like he's five years old. His parents are also pretty immature as well, cracking dirty jokes around and about him.Overall, a very good read."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Okay. This is my attempt at a spoiler-free review of the story. I'll probably let a few things slip, but hopefully not too many. Not that people above me haven't given away one of the main points of the story. NOOOO! NO PETRA/BEAN!!!Shadow Puppets seems almost like it's wrapping up everything from EG to SotH. We see old friends. Lots of old friends. Alai comes back with a startlingly major role after his obscurity during SotH. Ambul (and I would have never remembered who this guy was if I hadn't reread ES right before starting SP) has a few pages. He actually seems pretty cool. We get mentions of Dink Meeker (in England, planning for NATO) and Crazy Tom (also doing something in the UK where he can give info to Peter). I'm sorry, Crazy Tom fans, but he only gets this tiny little footnote. Han Tzu (Hot Soup) has a few pages. Virlomi comes back. Volescu (his first name is Constantine) plays an important part. We also see Dimak again, he's Underminister of Colonization or something like that (still working for Graff...). And Uphanad (the guy Bean stole the teacher password from) is in the story too. There's also another trip to Battle School.I didn't catch any mentions of how old anyone was, which made some parts a little strange. I keep thinking of Bean as this tiny little boy, so when he starts doing adult things, I have to wonder just how old he is.Yet despite the fact that the jeesh is older, this book is not at all like Speaker for the Dead and the later Ender books. It still has the lighthearted bantering, and even when Bean gets morbid, there still isn't adultery or aliens. Or computers posessing Val. This book seems to be geared once again to the younger audiences who just didn't get/like Speaker, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind.OSC has a great plan for the world. In an Amazon[.com] review once, somebody mentioned that OSC never made up any history of his own. Personally, I thought this was a bit harsh (who knows who could get angry for panning their country?) but pretty much true. Bean knows Machiavelli, Vauban, Caesar, Nietzsche, and Aquinas. In fact, the most futuristic person ever mentioned in the whole series is Saddam Hussein. Aside from events that actually happen in SotH, OSC doesn't talk much about details of world history beyond the New Warsaw Pact and America's decline. Now he talks about Israel being accepted by Muslims and a Fifth World War.Reading, I couldn't help but think that a lot of people were getting stupider. But, upon reflection, I noticed it was just Peter was just getting stupider, ruining everything, and tainting the entire book for me (in case you forgot, I really like Peter Wiggin). He got better toward the end, though, and seemed really human. And annoying.[QUOTE] \\"No,\\" said Mother. \\"You're getting up now (...)\\"(this is Peter) \\"OK, OK, leave the room so I can take my clothes off and get in the shower. Or is this just a subterfuge so you can see me naked again? You've never let me forget how you used to change my diapers, so aparently that was a very important stage in your life.\\"[/QUOTE]And then Mr. Wiggin dumps half a bucket of water on him. You know who Peter reminds me of? Draco Malfoy and Artemis Fowl. And since Peter is either blond or black haired, he has to look like one or the other, too. Does Peter always act like this? Or is it just around his folks?Really, we do see a dang lot of Mr. and Mrs. Wiggin. Theresa and John Paul (or Johnny P!). It was sort of annoying how Peter thought of his parents as \\"mother\\" and \\"father\\", but hey, I got over it. Because the two of them are both brilliant, like Battle School brats, but older. Reading about them, I don't feel bad that Petra and Crazy Tom and the rest are going to grow up, because if they grow up the the Wiggin parents, I'll still love 'em.The ending was a bit abrupt. I mean, we've been working up to this climax since the start of ES, and then it all ends really fast. All the wrong done in SotH is undone, though, and there's still another book, so Bean is off on a quest that you would have never anticipated from ES of SotH. It's almost like the change between The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings, only backwards, because in ES, SotH, and SP, Bean destroyed the Ring of Power, and now he's going to go fight an insignifigant little dragon. My prediction for the next book is that the goals of this novel will have very little do with the goals of all the other Bean books. But that's just me.Overall, SP was a good book. It lacks the majesty of Ender's Game, but is just what I expected for Bean's next book."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Don't have time to write a full review, but this book was amazing, and is OSC's writing at its best.

As usual, Card draws his characters in incredible detail. The relationship between Bean and Petra is very intimately and carefully shown and it is the highlight of this book. But unlike the vast majority of Card's other works this book just didn't &quot;grab&quot; me. It was a good story, and by no means will it turn me off to reading more of Card's works (or further books in this series), but somehow the book just didn't suck me in like most of his other books.

I started reading the new series with Ender's Shadow which was actually pretty good, but Shadow Puppets and Shadow of the Hegemon have been disappointments. The great thing about Ender's Game was that it was a book about kids, but you were able to suspend your disbelief that little kids were saving the world. Card fails to do that in these installments."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"This book is basically part two of Shadow of the Hegemon. These two books really can't be taken separately. Though good books, neither of them are quite as good as Ender's Shadow was.

If you really liked Ender's Shadow, then by all means pick up SotH and Shadow Puppets, but if you don't, you're not missing out on anything."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I enjoyed this sequel book. I've been an ardent fan of Card's since Ender's game.

He's a rarity in the genre in that his characters are the story, not the technology. And no one is writing characters much better than Card these days.This one gets a four, but only because it doesn't pack the same punch, either in character developement or in deftness of plot, as Ender's Game or Speaker for the Dead. This doesn't mean you shouldn't read it, and taken as a whole, the Shadow series is shaping up to be a little more mature and is strongly on course. Ender's series tended to ramble towards the end, but this series seems to stay strong.The moral issues are deftly addressed, but we're left to make our own conclusions. The peoples and cultures are well done and accurate, and they make the book very appealing to me as a person who loves to travel and to *feel* new places.The plot is interesting and involving, and the book is very easy to read. The pacing is never ponderous, and I had it finished in 2 days, in spite of my work schedule.All in all, Card's books are strongly recommended, especially in the light of all the terrible SciFi that you see on shelves today."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I have been a fan of Orson Scott Card for years and have ready everything that he has written. Unfortunately this book is a serious disappointment in both plot and, more pointedly, in dialogue. As the Battle School children are getting older they sound more and more like spoiled children. Card should focus on his \\"genius child\\" theme and avoid the children as they grow up, and should certainly avoid trying to write romance in any way shape or form. Of course, even with this book being a bomb and it looking like the entire series has fizzled out, I still would recommend reading this book if you have gotten this far in the series. You wont like it, but how could you avoid reading it?"},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Ok I actually have to say that I enjoyed this 7th book in the Ender's Series. Now I know a lot of people are compalaining and giving this book bad reviews but I think that they're looking at it in the wrong context. This book isn't for everyone. Just like Shadow of the Hegemon it's heavily concentrated in political/military matters more than sci-fi, in fact the only reason the book is even classified as such is because it's part of the Ender's Series. I happen to like that sort of stuff so these books were quite good to me. It really depends on the person. If you really liked Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind then you might not like these books as much. However if you have an open mind and just look at them for themselves then I think people wouldn't be so harsh on it.Now on to the book itself. Shadow Puppets continues the story of what happens on Earh after Ender. Peter is now Hegemon but with little power. Achilles is still at large, causing trouble. Bean and Petra develop a romance. A lot of political and strategic maneuvering with character interactions and developments. Overall I thought it was good book that continued the story arc.Finally and this is my own opinion, I wish too see more Peter!! In fact I think a whole book should be written with him as the main character. I find him far more interesting than Bean, who just doesn't appeal to me. The books would greatly improve if more time was spent on Peter but that's just me. Still I'll be reading the next book and the one after that(which I'll probably really like since I heard that Bean finally dies in the next book which therefore leaves room for more Peter)."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"In &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; Orson Scott Card throws off the secular trappings of his previous books to write a thinly veiled Mormon treatise. The result is not pleasant reading for the average S/F fan.Any reader who comes to &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; from the previous &quot;Shadow&quot; books knows that Card has been heading in this direction thruout the series. In &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; readers were treated to a chapter of Mrs. Wiggins ranting to Bean about the vital importance of having MANY babies for MANY pages &amp; of course &quot;Enders Shadow&quot; had it's ridiculous baby farm opening. But &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; is unrelenting in it's proselytising &amp; sermons.The primary &quot;plot&quot; of this tract involves Bean's &amp; Petra's romance. Never mind that they are 15 years old in this book, Petra is determined to combine her genetic material with Bean's &amp; bear him MANY children. Bean is resistant to the plan because he does not feel he is &quot;human&quot; as he is the result of a genetic manipulation. Petra contrives a meeting between Bean &amp; his &quot;creator&quot; who, during the course of a 15 page monologue, manages to convince Bean that the only thing that matters in this world is to become part of the Great Web of Life. Of course, the only acceptable way to enmesh oneself is by procreation, preferably MANY times! Ick.So, Bean consents to lab-created embryos in order to placate Petra. Only once the genetic material combines, Bean has a revelation: these microscopic bundles of sperm/egg are not embryos; they are BABIES &amp; must be treated as such. Ugh.Meanwhile, Peter Wiggins (erstwhile Hegemon &amp; ruler of the free world) has his own revelation. He may be the most powerful entity on the planet but he's still inferior to his parents, because they are his PARENTS &amp; so will always be due his utmost respect because, well, they're his PARENTS. Uh huh.That pretty much sums up this so-called science fiction novel. Just out of curiousity, because Mr. Card has long been a favorite author of mine, I re-read a fairly recent book of his after laughing my way thru this one. &quot;Pastwatch&quot; is not a part of the Ender or Shadow series, but it is an excellent book. There are many thought-provoking concepts about time as well as a very sobering look at the planetary ecology contained in this true science-fiction work. It is very hard for me to believe the same man wrote both books within a decade. Either someone is ghosting Card's work (not surprising considering his recent ouput) or the Council of Elders has had a little chat with him about his secular readership. Which ever the explanation is, do not pay for &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot;. Get it from your local library if you need to confirm what I have written. The best choice tho, is not to waste your time on this at all."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Shadow Puppets (2002) is the third SF novel in the Shadow subseries of the Ender-verse. It followsShadow of the Hegemon. The initial work in this subseries isEnder's Shadow.In the previous volume, Peter sent an email to Chamrajnagar saying that the International Fleet should protect Battle School graduates. Petra was abducted by Russian agents working for Achilles. Everyone else of Ender's jeesh -- except Ender and Bean -- was captured.Bean and his family leave their beach house, which was blown up shortly afterward. A Greek helicopter picked them up at the beach and took then to a safehouse. Graff and Carlotta come for Bean.In this novel, Julian Delphiki is growing taller and his brain is getting larger. Bean has a genetic defect that makes his body continue to grows. His larger brain increases his intelligence; he had been a very smart child and is developing into a supergenius. Now he is the Strategos of the Hegemony.Petra Arkanian was a member of Ender's jeesh. After the Bugger War, she returned to Armenia.Peter Wiggin is still a college student posting anonymous essays on the web. He has developed a strong reputation as Locke.Suriyawong was a member of Ender's army. After the Bugger War, Suri returned to Thailand. Now he is second-in-command of Hegemony forces.Han Tzu was a member of Ender's jeesh. After the Bugger War, Hot Soup returned to China.Alai was a member of Ender's jeesh. After the Bugger War, he returned to Syria.Virlomi is a Battle School graduate, but not a member of Ender's army. After the Bugger War, she returned to India.Ambul was a member of Bean's army. After the Bugger War, he returned to Thailand. Then he and his family moved to London.Achilles de Flandres had been a street bully in Rotterdam. He spent a few days at Battle School, but washed out.Hyram Graff is the former head of Battle School. Now he is Minister of Colonization.Anton was a geneticist who identified Anton's Key. He was convicted for illegal research and gene modification. His mind was conditioned with an aversion against biological science of any kind.Constantine Volescu is a mad genius specializing in human genetics. He had modified Bean and his sibling in vitro. When Bean escaped from his crib, Volescu destroyed all the other children.In this story, Bean is still growing. Now he is taller than Petra. Of course, the uncontrolled growth is going to kill him in a few years.Peter gets an email describing the transfer of Achilles to another prison. He has Suri lead the raiders to capture the man. When Bean and Petra realize that Achilles will be brought back to headquarters, they try to talk Peter out of the plan and then leave his service.Suri has no problems taking Achilles. He warns Virlomi as the group is flying back to the compound. Suri presents Achilles to the Hegemon and Peter gives Achilles a job as his assistant. He also monitors his computer usage and blocks all radio waves in and out of the compound.Graff offers to take Theresa and John Paul off Earth, but they refuse to go. Theresa ponders the things Graff had to say and concludes that Achilles will be a constant threat to Peter. She decides to kill the man.Theresa tries to steal a key to Achilles's room, but is caught in the act. Peter watches the video of her unsuccessful attempt and cannot figure out her motives. He asks his father and John Paul states that she was trying to kill Achilles. Peter becomes even more confused after their talk.Meanwhile, Bean and Petra are traveling together. Bean tries to talk Petra into splitting up, but Petra is determined to stay with Bean. She wants to marry him and have his children, but Bean doesn't want to have any children who inherit his genetic condition.Bean and Petra meet Ambul in Warsaw. Petra doesn't recognize him, but Bean is half expecting him. Ambul is asked to contact Alai and get him to meet with Bean and Petra.Then they contact Anton and discuss genes and marriage. Anton cannot think directly about the genetic condition named for him, but he can discuss the resulting condition. He says that Volescu probably has a harmless test for the genetic change. This convinces Bean to marry Petra and to have children by her.Volescu had been released from prison, so they learn his current base. Bean and Petra get married and travel to Rotterdam. They confront Volescu at his office and ask whether a nondestructive test exists to identify embryos with Anton's Key.Volescu confirms that such a test exists. Petra doesn't believe him, but she wants Beans's children even if they have Anton's Key. Bean lets Volescu surgically remove nine eggs from Petra and then fertilize them with Bean's sperm. They implant one embryo in Petra and have the others frozen.This tale gets even more complicated when the other embryos are stolen. Peter revives Locke and Demosthenes to warn of the Chinese menace. Virlomi starts an insurgency in India. Bean and Petra convince Alai to oppose China.The immediate crisis is solved, but tensions still run high. The next installment in this subseries isShadow of the Giant.Highly recommended for Card fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of international relations, political intrigue, and human stupidity.

Ender's Shadow was a worthy followup years later told from a different point of view. But the following three books in the \\"Shadow\\" series grew increasingly ridiculous and unexciting. Much of the book is in dialogue (either internal or external form) where the characters exhibit some self doubt, which could be compelling but here is just leaden. The author's anti-abortion political and religious beliefs are especially pronounced and blatant in this entry in the series, which some might find off-putting.But ultimately, it is the poor quality of the writing, and the increasingly ludicrous coincidences that propel the plot, that make this the worst entry in the Ender series that I have read."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I read all the other Ender books in the series so why not this one? The very first thing in the book is Achilles' rescue. I almost stopped reading right there. (It is taxing my limits not to swear or being vulgar right now) I thought that there might be a good explanation for it later on in the book. Nope! Not even close.Remember Peter the genius? Well, it's Peter the special ed student now. I have spend enough time on this book."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"The aftermath of the war which began after the formic wars is just the beginning. Like most large scale wars, peace is ephemeral. Now, the power shifts once again and the children from the battle school once again are at the center of the action.Bean and Petra, Peter, The Wiggins, Graff, Hot Soup, Virlomi and Alai all play roles in this novel. As usual, there are quite a few moral dilemmas as well as lots of strategy and tactics. The action sequences of the book, during the war are somewhat few and far between - although that was really the case for most of the novels in the series, minus Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.Card takes the opportunity to explore how the children will act as they get older. The problem with this is, that \\"older\\" here is still only 12 years old or so by my count and now we have children getting married and attempting to have babies. He also throws his argument in for anti-abortion propaganda, posing the question through one of the characters - is there any difference between killing twenty two 2 year-old toddlers or destroying 3 artificially inseminated embryos? The whole when does life begin question... at that point, I was tempted to put the book down.I don't think that this installment was as strong as the previous two, but it is still worth the read. It is good enough that I will be continue with the final book of the series, Shadow of the Giant."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Stop the Evil Genius.Bean and Peter Wiggin still have to work to counter the rather psychopathic tendencies of their classmate Achilles, while Bean and Petra have to decide what to do ethically about their possibilities for child rearing.The rest of the Battle School will also be busy with the global political situation destabilising.This book is definitely not as interesting as some of the others in the Ender Saga."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Although not the best of the Ender or Shadow series, Orson Scott Card does not disappoint. The portrayl of Bean and Petra growing up is good reading."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"In a previous review of Shadow of the Hegemon, I mentioned that Card's brilliance lies in his exploration of the complex thoughts and motivations of his characters. Ender's Game deeply explored Ender Wiggin's character, while Ender's Shadow delved deep into Bean's psyche. In Shadow of the Hegemon, this exploration was spread out across several characters and felt weaker, though still compelling.In Shadow Puppets, however, Card has almost completely abandoned the inner thoughts of his characters. Perhaps the most significant exploration of a character is the author's focus on Bean and his dilemma about having children. Much of this quandary is presented through external dialogue with Bean and Petra, instead of the more traditional internal dialogue technique that Card used so well in the past.Although the book still has a engaging plot, I felt like Shadow Puppets was lacking something important. I wanted to get inside the characters' heads and hearts more. Without more insight into the character's actions, Shadow Puppets felt flat and hollow when compared to Card's earlier books. My hope is that this is not a trend, and that Shadow of the Giant (which is next up on my reading list) proves richer in its character development than \\"Hegemon\\" or \\"Puppets.\\""},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"The spectacular Ender's Game and its very good to excellent sequels established Card as a major SF writer. With Ender's Shadow, he came close to matching the brilliance of the original story. Then came Shadow of the Hegemon, with its focus on Peter Wiggin and Achilles, and it seemed like all the power, originality, and dramatic tension faded away, leaving only a shadow to lay across your mind. This latest work is neither as good as Ender's Shadow nor as mundane as Hegemon, but rather somewhere in-between.Here we find Bean growing beyond the norm, symptomatic of his genetic flaw that will eventually kill him while still a young man. And growing in other ways, as his relationship with Petra finally flowers under her tenacious insistence. This is probably the best part of this novel, as we see sides of the two that have not been in great evidence in the prior works. And we get some small looks into the thoughts and characters of some of the other Battle School graduates, mainly Virlomi, Han Tzu and Alai, each of whom contribute some major items towards Peter and Bean winning their current battle with Achilles. The Wiggin parents emerge from obscurity and are revealed to be (unsurprisingly) very intelligent and (surprisingly) quite forceful. All good things...So where does this book fail? The main failure is Peter Wiggin himself. For a man who could sway world opinion with his exacting, careful logic as Locke and browbeat everyone into emotional frenzy as Demosthenes, Peter is depicted here as a remarkably stupid, arrogant, and emotional teenager. Achilles, the demon, remains almost totally offstage, providing little room for dramatic confrontations, and what ones there are come off as almost anti-climatic. And finally, the circumstance that draws Bean back into the struggle between Peter and Achilles was totally preventable, a very sad and uncharacteristic lack of foresight by both Bean and Petra. These items do much to kill any major excitement in this work, even though the major (world) battle could have formed a taught political and military thriller.Is this book readable? Certainly. Card is still an excellent writer. His prose, descriptions, and dialogue (especially the back-and-forth between Bean and Petra) are all well formed and his moral insights flow from the premise of the story. But this one just doesn't have the edge-of-the-seat tension, the incredible insight into human character that have been the hallmarks of his best work."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"As soon as Shadow Puppets entered stores I ran out and bought it. I'm a huge fan of Orson Scott Card and the Ender series. Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow were my all-time favourite books.But while Ender's Game was spectacular, Ender's Shadow great, and Shadow of the Hegemon good, I thought Shadow puppets was way below my expectations.Everything felt tired, boring, and predictable. As with the later books in the Ender series, It seemed as though there wasn't enough plot to stretch across the pages.Bean and Petra's characters seemed to change radically from Shadow of the Hegemon and Ender's Shadow with no explanation. I also was disapointed in the dialogue. People said things rather abruptly and for no reason. Bean and Petra's romance also seemed very awkward with no excitement at all.And where was Achilles? His great chapters with Petra made me forgive some of Shadow of the Hegemon's boring parts.But as a loyal fan, I still give it 3 stars because it kinda satisfied my longing for another Ender book. It's great for fans, but I wouldn't really recomned it."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I put a question mark next to the word conclusion in the title of this review because it's not clear if &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; is the final book in the entire 'Ender's Saga' ('Bean sub-saga'). A large number of issues are resolved in this book, but others are still left up in the air. At the present time, there is listing or information about any future episodes in this series. So, for the time being, I will assume this is the last book. If it is, despite seeming loose ends, it would make a satisfactory conclusion.&quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; should probably be the end, though. Much like the last portion of &quot;Xenocide&quot; and all of &quot;Children of the Mind&quot; in the original 'Ender's Quartet', Orson Scott Card seems to be running out of steam with these characters. Card still displays his gifts of representing human interactions, but &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; has less ability to stand on it's own. Unlike &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; and, to a slightly lesser degree, &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;, you absolutely have to have read the previous books in the series for &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; to have any true meaning. Whereas &quot;Ender's Shadow&quot; and &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot; were connected by similar characters, yet told different stories (much like &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;), &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; merely continues the storyline from &quot;...Hegemon&quot;.To summarize, Peter Wiggin has achieved his long sought after goal of becoming the Hegemon, but the title carries little power with it in the wake of a large Chinese invasion throughout southern Asia, and subsequent assumption of the position of Earth's premier military power. These actions were set in motion by the psychotic Achilles before his true nature came to light and he was placed under arrest by the Chinese government. Peter sees his only true way of thwarting the Chinese and restoring prestige to the office of the Hegemon is to rescue Achilles from prison and put him to work for the Hegemony. Think that, despite Achilles manipulative skills, he can control him, Peter mistakenly compromises his own security and drives away many of those who served him, including Bean and Petra.During their self-imposed exile from Hegemon, Bean and Petra try to find ways to undermine the Chinese and Achilles while also dealing with a burgeoning romance and Petra's desire to have children by Bean before he dies of his genetic disorder. While it is somewhat interesting to read about Bean and Petra's romance, it is still somewhat dry. It's not impossible to conceive of this happening, as they are both probably 16 years old at this point and far older in many other ways, given what their early years consisted of. Yet, there's not really any spark to the relationship. It seems to the reader as if they are having this romance because they feel that it's something that they should do, not because there is any passionate romantic feelings sparking between them. It can't carry near the same weight as the personal interactions and tender romance that took place in &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;. That example is just thrown in as a perfect representation of Card's ability to convey human emotion. It's not quite as well-crafted here. It's not bad, though, so the reader still has some emotional investment in these two.There are other elements of &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; that are quite interesting. For the first time in all seven of the &quot;Ender's&quot; novels, the reader gets a chance to truly see the personalities of Theresa and John Paul Wiggins, the parents of Peter, Ender and Valentine. A great deal of time is spent on Peter's reluctant interaction with his parents and his eventual acceptance of their advice as relevant and appreciated. They come across as so much more than the bland, inattentive parents that readers were first introduced to in &quot;Ender's Game&quot;. In addition, there are interactions with many other former Battle School students. Alai and Han Tzu are just a few of the names who play major roles in the events that shape this novel.On the whole &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; was a good read. If there are more books on the horizon, then all the better. However, if this is where the series ends, then so be it. It's not a bad way to go out."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"The genesis of the Bean/Achilles interaction was clear. Two telegenic, winning characters (to the other characters, not necessarily to the readers). One with a tragic physical flaw that is likely to kill him, the other with a tragic moral flaw, ditto.The problem is that the writing, especially in this book, doesn't rise to the level that Card seeks.Unless you enjoy endless conversations about minor issues, or five-page musings by minor characters, you are likely to find this book very slow moving indeed. This book resoves the Eastern crisis that Card set up in the last book. But it does it in almost a storybook fashion. After a drop by drop setup (Chinese water torture, maybe?), we are told of tremendous military manoevers that I really don't find convincing. Sure, maybe the Muslims can do all the things that Card has them do. But the denouement relies on all the things being UNDETECTED, it is never explained how that is possible. What happened to radar, satellite imagery, intelligence (in more ways than one)?The whole military plot relies on the Chinese being slightly stupider than a comic book villian and little weapons advancement beyond 1949. Very strange.The Bean/Achilles conflict reaches its resolution in this book as well, I will not say how. But by the time we finally get to it, it is difficult to care. In my opinion, this is due to Card's failure to make us feel anything except irritation when it comes to Achilles, however much we may like Bean. Shadow of the Hegemon gave Card the opportunity to make Achilles interesting, rather than just an almost hypnotically alluring (to the other characters) villian. It didn't work.We get to see more of Peter Wiggin in this book. But he comes across more as a sullen teenager, who (no fewer than twice!) has to be forcibly woken up by his parents than the titular ruler of the world. If you're hoping to see how Peter transforms himself and his job into what we see at the end of Ender's Game, well, don't hold your breath, but if this is what you care about, hold on to your bucks until the next book. For there will be one.A great present for the insatiable Card or Ender fan."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"...but I found that impossible. I am a big fan of Orson Scott Card's literature, especially the Ender and Shadow series, but &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; was a letdown.This book was too preachy-- Card's Mormon side definitely shows through, as both Bean and Anton are converted to the belief that the ultimate goal in life is to have many babies, and Petra is reduced to a subservient, loving wife who nevertheless lies to Bean. Also, you'll discover Card's views on abortion in this book.&quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; is a fine title for the book, as I got the feeling that Card was controlling his characters (the &quot;puppets&quot;) against their wills, forcing them into scenarios and decisions that go against their personalities and previous character developments. Even Alai, previously one of my favorite characters, undergoes major changes and isn't even recognizable. Bean is completely different, and not even all that likeable. Suriyawong (introduced in &quot;Shadow of the Hegemon&quot;) appears only in two chapters.Card relies too much on humorous banter that isn't even all that funny, and certainly isn't brilliant.If you must read this book, check it out from the library, but don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Overall I didn't think this book was as bad as other reviewers would claim, although my laundry list of complaints is as long as many others'- The \\"witty banter\\" between Bean and Petra, and between the Wiggins was, as others have mentioned, not witty- Peter is by far the most disappointing character in the series to date: instead of seeing the transition from Ender's tormentor to master statesman we are subjected to the tedious ranting of a spoiled brat teenager- Card rambles and preaches nonstop (but still better than Children of the Mind in this area)- Petra's obsession with having Bean's babies is so scary it's funny- Achilles becomes as unimposing as Peter- The story involving the missing embryos was an interesting subplot at first, but then it becomes THE plot for the majority of the book- The overall story is interesting but the plotting is very dull and predictable. Not once is there a surprise, and despite the \\"action\\" that occurs, never is there a suspenseful moment.And on and on. But I thought the story was better than Shadow of the Hegemon, which felt like the game of Risk on steroids. In Shadow Puppets, the characters are forced to make hard choices, success and failure were not always so clear, and a feeling of melancholy hung over the tale. Although the major characters in the book disappointed me more often than not, the minor characters played interesting roles. Virlomi's Wall of India was simple, yet powerful. Alai in particular was fascinating as the Caliph, a figure elegant and powerful, yet terribly constrained by duty and religion (he reminded me a bit of the young protagonist of Dune).After the disappointing end to the original post-Ender's Game trilogy, I had ceased to expect great things of this series, so perhaps that is why I was not as disappointed as others were with this book. I was encouraged by Card's return to focusing on the characters, even if his attempts at characterization were often flawed at best.I see that Card is churning out another book in the series: \\"Shadow of the Giant\\" is due to come out early next year. Part of me wishes that I had stopped at the original \\"Ender's Game\\", I should have known Card could never top that. Yet I keep going in the series, as I imagine many other readers have, seeing sparks of genius in his books and always hoping for more (despite the inevitable disappointment). Please, Mr. Card: hit one out of the park with your next book. The patience of your loyal readers is starting to die out."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"It's so difficult to explain what's kept me coming back to Orson Scott Card. Ender's Game, arguably his finest work, is much different from other books in the series, particularly in the way it approaches the relationships between the main characters. In Ender's Game, the primary focus was on the young Ender and his ultimately tragic relationships with the people around him. It's this, that I believe that drew so many to this series, a morality play built in the framework of excellent sci-fi.With his parallel series, he seemed to start off with the same formula - telling the story of Bean, whom Card developed into a deep and dynamic character with Ender's Shadow. Bean's survival, and indeed, how he thrived was a interesting and well concieved piece of work.Shadow of the Hegemon followed, and it took a much different direction than what many of us expected. More political in nature, it focused on Earth and its changing social and political movements after the Formic defeat. Different, but I still enjoyed it, and more importantly, it laid the groundwork for a deep and rich sequel.Sadly, this is not to be. Card's on autopilot, seemingly paid by the word, rather than the depth and enjoyability of his plot. The burgeoning romance with Petra is thrown together, with little to no build up, and the subplot involving Achilles and Bean's \\"children\\" is irritating at best. In fact, it's hard to even see why Achilles is in this book, other than the reconciliation of his conflict with Bean. Card should be shamed with how little he's put Achilles to use here - one of his most original and interesting characters ends up becoming an afterthought, and the final resolution between the him and Bean is one of the most anti-climactic in recent memory.The book throws characters into the mix seemingly at random, which acts to stymie the development of existing characters, save perhaps Mr and Mrs. Wiggin. Any other character development, however, is confusing and not well-thought out. The Bean of this book is nothing like the Bean of Ender's Game, or Ender's Shadow, or even Shadow of the Hegemon. It's just wrong - like the book was written by someone else.Adding this to the already tenuous grip on reality that this series began broaching with Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets doesn't inspire anything more than disappointment, and can even perhaps be called \\"laughably bad.\\"A promising series of books derailed."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"It seems that Orson Scott Card has two personae as a writer -- the pedantic bore, and the gripping plotter. At his best, his books are impossible to put down.But then there's Shadow Puppets. It seems that Card has lost his way in this series (as he did in the first 4-part Ender saga). While the base story line is interesting, the surrounding details are tedious.The plot is rich and complex -- Bean battles Achilles for control of the earth, after China has invaded India. How the two characters plot against each other is the best element of this book.But the sections which move the plot forward are interspersed with two dull elements. First, there is the witty banter between the main characters (Bean and Petra, Bean and his parents, etc.). Except that its not that witty, and it just goes on and on. Fictional characters' pointless sarcastic repartee has to be really part of the story, or it becomes dull. I thought it did here.Then there are the long rambling speeches, drilling Card's personal philosophy into you over and over. This is similar to the worst of Children of the mind -- nothing I hate more in my action sci-fi then rambling lecturing.Mercifully, this book is brief, so it's not too painful to skip the dull bits. It would have been far better to have been edited down a LOT ... but then we'd probably have a Bean novella on our hands.The Shadow series seems to really be running out of interesting ideas. Too bad. I thought the first two were much more consistent and interesting. If you're absolutely committed to Card, it's worth a quick read. Otherwise, skip it."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Shadow Puppets continues the story of Bean, a genetically engineered prodigy who navigates a gauntlet of political intrigue and personal danger while attempting to save the world from a sociopathic adversary. If you've read some of the reviews on this site, you probably already know that. It's probably also safe to say that if you enjoyed Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon, you won't be disappointed with this effort. That said, it's become very hard for me to overlook the grist of Card's personal beliefs, despite the entertaining quality of his stories.Before I continue, let me make it clear that I believe all individuals have the liberty to express their opinions, whether or not I agree with them. This is a book review, and as such, I am only bringing attention to the author's beliefs because they show up repeatedly in his writing and undermined the quality of my reading experience. If you happen to share Mr. Card's opinions, then you won't share any of the misgivings I experienced and are likely to enjoy the story immensely.The crux of my problem lies within some of Card's Mormon-centric views about family and homosexuality that, while not omnipresent throughout his work, form the basis for some \\"purpose of life\\" quandaries that motivate his characters' behavior. Before I continue, let's make it clear that this isn't a baseless accusation - googling the words Scott, Card, homosexuality, and family values yields a wealth of information, including articles he has written for the Latter-day Saints that include titles like \\"The Hypocrites of Homosexuality\\".You may have noticed touches of this sentiment sprinkled throughout the Ender's series - the instinctual drive toward getting married and starting a family that overwhelms many of the main characters (Valentine, Ender, Ender's children, Bean, etc.); the anger characters exhibit toward laws governing reproductive rights; the setting up of cynical characters like Ender and Bean (paper tigers) who receive spiritual wisdom and subsequent enlightenment from ancillary characters speaking in Card's voice.If you didn't notice these things and think I'm just speculating blindly, note following advice given to Bean by an old Russian scientist (who may or may not be gay) who laments that he pursued academic achievement over the will to procreate:\\"Even men who do not desire women, even women who do not desire men, this does not exempt them from the deepest desire of all, the desire to be an inextricable part of the human race...it's hard-wired into all of us. Not just sexual desire - that can be twisted any which way, and it often is...it's a deep hunger to find a person from that strange, terrifyingly other sex and make a life together...there's still a hunger for this. For actual marriage, two unlike creatures becoming, as best they can, one.\\"\\"[This is] The thing that makes us civilized or at least civilizable. And those who are cut off from it by their own desires, by those twists and bends that turn them in another way...those who are cut off because they think they want to be cut off, they are still hungry for it - hungrier than ever, especially if they deny it.\\"And you know what? In Card's written universe, these words are absolutely true. Inevitably, protagonists who want the happy ending must, must, must go forth, marry, and have progeny or else die alone and forgotten. And this truth makes it hard for me to continue reading his work."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"After reading Ender's Shadow, I had high hopes for this tangent series about Ender Wiggin's sidekick Bean. Unfortunately, the subsequent installments have been getting progressively worse. Now, after the dull and plodding Shadow of the Hegemon, we readers are being treated to a tedious and repetitive heap of self-righteous drivel.First of all, the somewhat forced \\"romance\\" between Petra and Bean just gets annoying after awhile. It is never mentioned why either of them suddenly loves the other, it's just sort of squeezed in there as a convienient plot device. The entire relationship is cold and without passion, and a little out of character to boot. If you ask me, Card needs to stay as far away from writing romance as he possibly can.The characters, while I'm at it, are barely recognizable. You would never guess that the lovelorn, sappy schoolgirl of this novel is supposed to be the tough, snarky Petra of Ender's Game. Or that Ender's weak-willed, slow-witted parents are actually political geniuses in disguise, ready to plot assinations any time the need for one pops up.And is it just me, or did Card do an annoying amount of preaching in this novel? After his umpteenth religious discourse, I was about ready to throw the book into the fireplace! He's trying to use this book as a platform for his LDS beliefs. As a fellow Mormon, I'm all for missionary work, but when I pick up a sci-fi novel, I want to see some sci-fi. If I want a sermon, I'll read something from Deseret BookIf you're a hardcore fan of the Ender/Bean series, then I suppose this book might be worth the money.

The authorial insertion character convinced me otherwise.Yes, the cameo character, the one who monologues for several pages midway through the book: \\"Oh, by the way, I'm only into men, but have decided that the entire purpose of humanity is reproduction, so am marrying a woman to make babies!\\" Umm... that's nice, dear, now give the mic back. Oh, wait, everyone in this book has taken an idiocy pill, so even when no one's off on a silly rant they've completely forgotten how to play spy games well and are running around in boneheaded circles.

The character who's clear thinking, logic, ability to appeal to the emotions of the people captivated the population with essays and arguments using the pseudonyms Locke and Demosthenes? No! This Peter Wiggin is extraordinarily self doubting, highly immature, and emotional. Strangely, after masterminding Locke and Demosthenes and always being a few steps ahead of everyone, he now can almost not make a move without help, consultation, an enormous amount of prodding, and a great deal of whining.For me, it was mostly a waste of time and money. I will be buying the next in the series shortly and hoping it is much better."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"First, on the book itself, I think the Shadow series really pales in comparison to the Ender books (I know I should judge it sorely on its own merits but frankly, I would have stopped at Ender's Shadow if it weren't for the promise of Card's earlier books) because the human element, faced with innocence by Ender et al, feels missing in this series or at least feels very artificial/manufactured.The scifi political aspect as well seems lacking in scope -- I know, he's talking about global impact so how's that lacking? I'm not sure but to say that it seems like those under the sway of new regimes are mostly unaffected (basically, I felt that things like the 'Wall of India' seemed like a throw in) and there is very little buy in for the reader to empathize with the struggle. That the technology in use feels very simple and dated (and very gimmicky) -- things like the ansible are never used -- are there no direct peer to peer communications like IMs... I mean I get random anonymous IM/texts spam now so wouldn't that make more sense than emails for timeliness? The technology available when Card wrote this book (2002) was already moving past simple email and it now seems almost anachronistic to use it heavily especially when he's already established an instant method of communications in earlier books.Power brokers that were and are still in place before Ender's victory are largely not integral to the plot. There is really a lack of the power struggle of the major powers beyond those of the three main characters (and a slight spoiler... the 'new leader' of a re-unified nation who seems to be done as an after thought at the last quarter of the book)... it's definitely a bit thin when I make a comparison to the Foundation politics, (I made this invariable comparison because in his forward to Ender's Game, Card points to Asimov's series as an inspiration and knew he didn't want to do a something similar, yet here is this series) because everything happens just in the nick of time or really without any margins for error but it doesn't have Asimov's reason why everything happens in a predicted manner.Specifically to the audio edition, I personally dislike the choices for two of the readers. The woman voice sounds too smug most of the time, but that's bearable compared to the person doing Peter's parts who sounds very old and constantly whiny... basically, it sounds like they got a Woody Allen impersonator reading these parts. While there is conflicted inner turmoil, to me, Scott wrote a lot of conviction into Peter's thoughts which does not come through with this particular voice actor.Anyway, I would only recommend this book as a continuation of the Ender universe but I feel that, as a stand alone series and a book, it isn't particularly engaging."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"As usual, the storyline continues to compel me to delve deeper into the series. I am a recorded books person and I like how the reading is handled by several narrators of both sexes. However, after having discussed the recorded version with several other people, we agree that the female narrator's contribution borders on grating. Her portion is read in an overly-exaggerated, lilting, feigning style that, frankly, seems to be an effort to over-dramatize every single scene read rather than present the story for the listener to interpret him or herself. This irritating style detracts from an otherwise nicely presented story with multiple voices which lends to keeping a recorded book from becoming monotonous. One other curious narration, while not annoying, is the choice of the voice for Bean. Bean, supposedly a teenager, has the voice of a 70 year old man. How nice it would have been to have his voice match his character as well as that of the voices of other male characters in the story. If you can get past the irritating, lilty female parts, the story is well worth your time. I can only hope that as I progress into the next books, the female narrator either changes her style or is replaced by a better voice actress."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"You know that effect when you see a movie or a read a book and then they follow up with like 20 more and it just turns into crap? Well it's hard to find media where it DOESN'T do that. Card writes GREAT stuff and I was not disappointed with this book after reading all of the previous Ender/Bean books. The story has become in depth and the adventure has evolved from in-space Battle School to Earth side war front. I didn't like Shadow of the Hegemon as much, I'm not sure why, maybe the politics through me off and bored me, but this one is a bit more mild on the politics. I like it that way ;) Good read, I'm continuing with Shadow of the Giant and the waiting for Ender in Exile =)"},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"The book is almost one massively long conversation, and yet I find myself entertained by the moral questions and complicated political dance weaved here. Bean's still my favorite character.It's easier to focus on the negative. While the characterization is decent, the action seems to fall very short. I understand Card was working with a lot of different characters, but the page proportion dedicated to favor the major of the minor characters. Peter Wiggin comes off more as a whiny teenager than a molder of nations. My other major nit is that Petra, by all previous accounts an interesting character, is relegated to worried woman status throughout the majority of the book. The reasons in the next book seem surprisingly stupid to me. I just would have expected better of Card. Heck, even Bean, boy genius, doesn't do all that much except not be killed.The book does fill in some gaps, but as a stand alone novel, I'd say it is one of the weaker of the Ender series. So, why does it get 4 stars?...quite simple, I'm taking it more as a whole series. As one giant story, the series will of course have some points that just have to be plowed through to understand the rest. It does its job as a gap holder and explainer of all things to come."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I began reading this series of books due to my teenage son.After reading \\"Ender's Game\\" I was hooked and have to say I think I've enjoyed Bean's story even more than Ender's."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I've enjoyed the \\"Ender\\" series since Analog first published it. I've progressed, along with Card's writing, from action-adventure to philosophy to interpersonal relationships. This book was a decent contribution to the series, in much the same way that \\"Heartfire\\" was a decent contribution to the \\"Alvin Maker\\" series. But like Heartfire, it didn't really advance the ball much. Some of the book was Tom Clancy light, and some of the further characterization seemed contradictory to previous installments (Peter continues his transformation from egomaniacal psychotic animal-torturer to just another rebellious teenager, getting bailed out by his parents). Where Card succeeds is with Bean and Petra, although my prurient and adolescent mind would have appreciated more explicit romance from the two."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"For Shadow Puppets, Card continues the storyline of where he left off in Shadow of the Hegemon. Achilles is back of course as a rival to Bean and Peter who attempts to wreak havoc between nations for his benefit.I felt I could not give this book a full five stars simply because some of the military scenes where the countries and their leaders (Battle School students) often leave the reader slightly confused as to what is going on.However, like all of Cards books, I have found it to be enjoyable no matter how big or small some of the flaws might be. Tor has occasionally let a few typos slip thru the cracks as well but that is not as big of a deal as the military operations are.That aside though, Shadow Puppets is exactly what the fans of the Ender's Shadow Series expect to get when they purchase this book.And that is a book that truly takes you into the fascinating aspects of war , politics, the traditional good versus evil, and kids that are wise beyond their years leading the charge while the adults must take a background seat to their Battle School Leaders."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Ender's Game and Speaker for the Dead are two of my most favorite books. This flimsy excuse for a book seemed like just another attempt by Card to cash in on the success of the rest of the franchise. I wonder if he realizes that while he may gain profits in the short term...in the long term it only serves to denigrate and hurt the whole series. I found the characters uninteresting as they seemed to really be puppets, acting out the desires of the author with no real sense of purpose or reason...other than thats where the author wanted to go. The plot was uninteresting and made me feel like I was watching a bad B (or C if there is such a thing) Sci-Fi movie.I am starting to wonder if William Shatner &quot;Shadow&quot; wrote this book. It's that bad. Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I thought this book nicely wrapped up the &quot;Shadow&quot; Series of the Ender books; Bean finds a reason in Petra to join the rest of the human race, Peter learns a harsh lesson from his own mistakes, Achilles finally gets his comeuppance, and the world is a little stabler place to live in. I did find that the post-Formic world was a little too much like our present world but Card himself states that the recent events in Afghanistan greatly affected his writing of this novel. So for the price of familiarity, we get to pick at Card's mind. Not too bad of a tradeoff.I do hope this was the last book of the entire series. Anything more and Card is milking it."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"In this latest chapter of the Ender's Game saga, we find Peter, Bean and many of the other battle school grads only a slight distance from where we left them in the last book. The plot of Shadow Puppets revolves around Peter's decision to liberate Achilles from his Chinese captors. Everything collapses, though, when it appears that Achilles was not actually a prisoner at all but instead his supposed imprisonment is part of a deliberate ruse that Peter has walked right into. In a few seconds, Peters world changes. He learns to trust his parents, realizes that he isn't always right and has to flee his Hegemony compound.The world is dividing itself into factions, Bean decides to have a child, and much more ... This book is a must read for anyone enthralled by the Ender saga!"},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I usually like Orson Scott Card's book but I was terribly offended by the book Shadow Puppets. Does he have anything nice or at least respectful to say about China? All he does in the book is either make China out as an insensitive tyrannical country on the whole or make fun of Chinese customs, such as those of respecting the elder and speaking humbly, even in a self-deprecating way. But Card really stretches it too far and it's done nothing but make me angry."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Card is a masterful writer- he can captivate, engage, entertain, and educate. He writes stuff that will make me laugh out loud or cry like a baby. This wasn't any of that. It had no depth. It reads more like a report on what everyone is up to now- like one of those spam Christmas letters you get from people you knew in college. Sure, it is nice to hear from them, but it doesn't really move you to call."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I think the Shadow books appeal to me because they delve into the other characters and really bring them to life from the Ender series. This is my favorite so far since it has a lot of focus on Petra who I find quite fascinating.

In itself the book does a decent job keeping us excited and guessing about characters and their futures. A must read for all &quot;Ender&quot; fans.Now again for the quotation marks. I know from speaking with many fans of this series that the immediate fascination ended with Ender's Game itself. THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE TRAVESTY! Perhaps I hold my allegiances too close, but I felt somewhat betrayed by Bean. While Ender was a reluctant hero, Bean is in many ways very arrogant.While I appreciate their relationship and all of Bean's accomplishments, it saddens me that so many readers have neglected to read through the original ENDER series. While it is true they have little of the strategic battles that made Ender's Game one of my favorite books of all time, they employ such compassion and psychology in a world that Ender chose for himself. Instead of returning home to the celebratory crowds (and Peter) Ender shuttles off to the world of their defeated enemies to colonize and create a new world. In this world visions of the past lead him to do something far nobler than any could imagine. Redemption and education persist and soon through his travel through time, he sacrifices all those who age in order to commit to a better world.All in all, don't miss the &quot;Shadow&quot; series for all the Earthly exploits we all wanted to hear more about, but PLEASE take the time to experience the ages of Ender's wisdom in creating a new world outside the one he left, and his absolute determination to improve the lives of not only those who hold him dear, but those who ultimately he was sent to destroy.Do yourself a favor, read carefully SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD, XENOCIDE, and CHILDREN OF THE MIND! OSC poured more thought provoking material through these three than the rest (however entertaining) combined."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"First off I'll say that there were a few good parts to this novel, but overall I found it to be a disappointment. Even if the rest of the book wound up being half decent, the whole premise which this particular story was based on was asinine. I couldn't believe the scenario Card used was the best he could come up with to have Achilles escape from China. Why would you try to make use of someone you know is a psychopathic killer, and who's connections probably have already been used up, when you already have working for you three other so called genius who have already beaten this guy? And then, even if you get this psycho to work for you the way you wanted him to, which is at best a long shot, you would still lose out because the other geniuses you already had working for you would leave. It just didn't make any sense. Also I thought the story line of using Achilles as the main villain had already run it's course in the last novel. By using him again here it seemed like Card ran out of ideas for an arch rival for Bean and rather than think of a new twist he just reused an old one. It also seemed that he just wrote this novel to set up future ones to come, which overall I don't have too much of a problem with, since there may be some promise in them, but it's a shame he couldn't have spent more time in properly working on the current one first."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Orson Scott Card is always best when writing about the trials and tribulations of children and now young adults. Overall, you can't put this on a par with Ender's Game -- but what other efforts rate that high? Shadow Puppets takes Bean into early adolecense in a world [distorted] by the Buggar war.Scott tries to pull a surprise ending - ok, but not his specialty. It's definitely worth the effort if you like Card's other works."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"We all expected Shadow Puppets to be great. You won't be let down. Shadow Puppets faithfully delivers a page turning story, continuing the adventures of the characters we love and the characters we love to hate. With unexpected surprises at every turn, Shadow Puppets continues the story of Bean, Petra, Peter, and even the beloved friend of Ender, Alai. Immediately at the beginning of the book trouble begins as Peter takes on a task beyond his control, forcing Petra and Bean into hiding, and therefore creating one of the main premises of the book. Fear, Love, Desperation, Elation, and Sorrow is all there. Every step of the way this book will lead you down a path that won't soon be forgotten. If you enjoyed Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon, this book is not one to miss."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"The book Shadow Puppets is about a boy in the future whose friends had saved Earth a few years earlier. In the present day, Bean, the main character, is working for the Hegemon, who is kind of like the President of the United Nations. For years, the Hegemon have been attacking China to keep them at bay because China was taking over the world. But, the Hegemon did know that the key to China&#65533;s success was they were being led by Achilles, the same bully that Bean had embarrassed as a child. The Hegemon captured Achilles and put him to work for the Hegemon. Achilles is known for betrayal, but the Hegemon did not heed the warning.Because the Hegemon had decided to use Achilles, Bean and another Battle School student Petra left the service to go into hiding. Bean has a medical ailment that makes him grow so tall that he eventually dies. It is also the same disease that makes him so smart. Petra wants to have Bean&#65533;s children, but he does not want them to die like he is. So, they go to a doctor that supposedly can just help create the children without medical ailments. Petra becomes pregnant, but on the way home, they are kidnapped and brought to the airport. From there, they are flown to Damascus. In Damascus, they find they were really not kidnapped. The real reason they were brought there was that they were neededat the headquarters of the Muslim League to meet a secretly elected Caliph. The Caliph is actually another Battle School student, Alai. He is planning an attack to stop China and return it to its boundaries. Bean and Petra help coordinate the attack.Back at the Hegemon compound, the Hegemon had lost control of Achilles. The Hegemon retreated to America, and hid there. Achilles was now in control of the Hegemony. The Hegemon held a press conference and explained the situation.I wont tell any more because that would be revealing the ending, which, is incredible, but this book I would recommend to adult-like minds and mature children because of the deep plot and fascinating storyline. This book shows off Orson Scott Card&#65533;s skill at recognizing emotions. The book goes in depth into the human psyche and presents characters with tough contemporary problems. There are many examples in the book where the book explains the troubles happening through the brains of the characters. The book also combines intuition with political and military strategy. So again, I recommend this book to mature readers because of the incredible plot and the in-depth knowledge of the author."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I am a huge fan of Orson Scott Card's Ender series &amp; was glad to get my hands on SHADOW PUPPETS.If you're expecting a rant against the mundaneness of this episode, you're not going to get it.

Achilles, if you recall from the previous books, was a genius. Mentally, however, he was very unstable. He wanted nothing more than the deaths of Peter, Bean, and Petra. Second on Achilles's list of things-to-do was to conquer all, starting with the Hegemony!Suriyawong, Virlomi, Hyrum Graff, and Volescu appear as secondary characters. They were not just for show or used as \\"fillers\\" though. Each had vital roles in the book and possibly in the next. (My hope springs eternal.)***** If you have not read the previous books, I highly recommend that you begin at the beginning, with ENDER'S GAME. Not only because all in this series is fantastic, but also because you when previous characters or events are mentioned, you would totally understand the reference and feel more a part of Card's vast universe. This author does not insult the intelligence of his readers; therefore, he will not go into deep detail on past events. He just mentions a person or event and carries on with the current story. I love that in an author!Orson Scott Card made a fan of me with ENDER'S GAME. Of course, since I enjoyed it so much, I handed it over to my husband and the \\"Ender's Bug\\" (as I call it) bit him too. Card quickly made his way from my list of \\"Good Authors\\", to my list of \\"Favorite Authors\\", and currently resides on my \\"Elite List\\" which contains only four names (and one of them are deceased).

First, the books makes peter seem to be a teenager who makes a lot of mistakes, unlike his brother or his sister, which doesn't flow with any other of the books. The book basically makes the the wiggins parents, as very smart people. Those of us, who could were or are the cream of the crop, know that our parents weren't that smart, and never will be. It's as if, Card, is trying to justify his own existence, as father of peter, very smart, but from the reading he is dull witted. The very last point that I wish to make, is that the book is full of mormon/religious notes, as if the older card gets, to closer to god he gets. In the earlier books, he was cryptic in his views of god and religion. In this book, where he thinks the readers are (people), come out cold. In my opinion, your better off reading Ender's Game again. Shadows puppets is just another attempt of the corporation to make more money off of a great series. Sorry Orson, I know you can do better!"},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"This book continues the story from Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon, focusing on Achilles du Flandres' battle with Peter Wiggin, Bean, and Petra for control of the world. Although Card occassionally stops telling the story to inject moralistic diatribes about monogamous love, it's an exciting, fast-paced tale with good characters and geopolitical intrigue. The only real problem is that Peter Wiggin's dark side, which was so heavily featured in Ender's Game, is virtually absent, and while he is depicted as conceited, he is a less morally complex and troubling character than he could have been. Definitely a good read."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"awesome. the book is right in line with Card's series, Ender's Game. i was hooked & couldn't put it down. i recommend the entire series to anyone who wants a book that keeps you hooked till the end & keeps you coming back for more."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"SHADOW PUPPETS is one of things that you either REALLY like it or you REALLY don't. You can see that from the other reviews. The numbers are one, two, four, five. No three stars. If you need some explaining, here it is:Shadow Puppets is about Bean and Petra all the way. Some people might find it kind of disturbing that two people of such different ages get married and so on.Petra talks a little bit too much about forcing Bean into having kids. Some people probably think that part is a little weird.Peter is the Hegemon, trying to find world peace. People might find that because China, Thailand, and many Asian and Middle Eastern countries have to do with this that the book is racist. Look, being Swedish, I don't think it is a problem. But if it was about Sweden being allies with a mass-murderer I would have been a little disappointed. It matters what view you have on the counties at hand.But, as usual, OSC writes a great understanding of young geniuses. I think that his writing abilites, intelecual strengths, and vocabulary make this book and all the others awesome.Also, Peter shows a soft spot in this book, which is a little refreshing. His new personality proves that he might actually be human.And, as someone else mentioned, Bean gives Achilles some of his own medicine.

But let me back up a bit, this is STILL a great book. I bought it and could not put it down. Though I can't put my finger on it exactly, this book was missing some of Card's magic. Something seemed to be missing. Probably because we've already seen everything up Achilles' sleeve and this didn't bring out anything new.I loved the further character development of Bean and those in his life. As always, there were the ethical delimnas he struggled with (though it was nice to have him not struggle with the last bit of action he had to perform at the end of the book) while trying to save the world and protect those he loves. The ending was very good. And of course, this is all opened up to a sequel.Great book, highly recommended. I'm looking forward to the next release when we follow the further adventures of Julian."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I have long been a fan of Orson Scott Card's Ender series, and have enjoyed most of the other books in it considerably. \\"Shadow Puppets\\" left me with very mixed feelings. Card's trademark moral dilemmas and political and military intrigues are all present in force, as are some long forgotten characters (most notably Ender's friend Alai). Neverthless, I was unimpressed and unconvinced by a number of Card's characterizations. Petra Arkanian, declared in \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" to have such an agressive personality thst many wondered whether she weren't really a boy, comes across in \\"Puppets\\" comes across as an extremely emotional young woman who wants nothing better than to start a family (the phrase \\"make babies\\" is repeated ad nauseum). Peter Wiggin comes across as an average and dependent young man, hardly the ruthless Hegemon or even the cruel young man that, in the original books of the Ender series, he is made out to be. It almost seems as though Card feels that he must redeem Peter, even though he spent the best part of \\"Children of the Mind\\" doing just that. Even the monster Achilles, so crucial to the series since \\"Ender's Shadow,\\" seems but a pale shadow of his former self.Worse yet, Card places serious limitations on Peter Wiggin's power, and leaves a dangerously large amount of power in the hands of a man who could hardly, for political reasons, ever become amenable to Peter's will. If Peter Wiggin is really to unite the world \\"all in one lump,\\" as \\"Ender's Game\\" declares, he seems poorly equipped for the task.Ultimately, it is the stories of Bean and Virlomi thst make the novel somehwat believable and a pleasure to read, for in them the genius so characteristic of Card's heroes is present in force. In spite of its flaws and some inconsistency with the rest of the Ender series, \\"Shadow Puppets\\" is a good book, and I can only hope that the next book in the series will retain its strengths and discard its weaknesses."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"There are so many things in life that can be captured in a new and way by a good writer and storyteller - and this book has its gems."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"\\"Shadow Puppets\\" is a very dissappointing addition to the Ender series.I was very excited when \\"Ender's Shadow\\" came out and thought it was a great read. Very accessible to all levels of reades, exciting and fun. It really got back into the feel of Battle School and the brilliant kids. It took a very different track from \\"Speaker...\\" and \\"Xenocide\\" but it fit into the series perfectly. \\"Shadow of the Hedgemon\\" was somewhat flat by comparison, but sorta kept to the story-line and was entirely readable.\\"Shadow Puppets\\" is really quite bad. It felt like OSC was preaching that everyone should get married and have as many children as possible to fight the heathen Chinese. (Even the one implied gay character got married and had children.) I felt this book didn't remain true to the story or the characters. Achilles has been relegated to the sidelines and has only a bit part. What little character the Wiggin parents have in this book is drastically different from the other books in the series. Bean is depicted as almost bumbling and confused most of the time. And Petra is no longer strong-willed and independent, she is portrayed as a subservient wife.It's almost as if someone else wrote this book and OSC just put his name on it."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"\\"Shadow Puppets\\" could have almost been named \\"The Shadow of Achilles\\". Bean's nemesis from the first two \\"Shadow\\" novels is almost absent from the book - putting in only three small appearances in the text. However, his presence falls over every other characters' thoughts and actions to the point of paranoia.Beginning with a raid by Peter Wiggin, the new Hegemon, to remove him from his Chinese custodians, Achilles finds himself as the new Assistant to the Hegemon, an action that immediately alienates virtually everyone - including Bean and Petra - from Peter. From there, we follow even more of the Battle School kids from \\"Ender's Game\\" through a world that is becoming more paranoid, more frightened and more ready to fall apart - all while Peter's access to what few resources he has as Hegemon are being systematically stripped away by a man he thought he could use to his advantage.\\"Shadow Puppets\\" focuses on even more of the other supporting characters of \\"Ender's Game\\" - Alai, Han Tzu (Hot Soup), and Virlomi - and brings the Middle East into the mix of Asian politics that Card set up in \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\". The Battle Schoolers have evolved from pawns in the previous books to major figures in their respective countries and will undoubtedly be the ones, in his final \\"Shadow\\" book, that run the world once it is united by the someday-great Hegemon Peter Wiggin.Bean and Petra are, of course, also of major focus in the book and their relationship hits a critical point as Bean tries to come to terms with his impending mortality. Both characters begin to accept their humanity more which, of course, raises the stakes against Achilles. Likewise, the memory of Ender (who is, of course, headed off to the colonies) colors everyone's pereceptions and actions, almost much as Achilles' actions do.If I had any one fault with the book, it is that it feels a little 'fit in' between \\"Shadow of the Hegemon\\" and the final book, which is yet to be written. Some of the hurdles the characters must jump through feel a little forced and Achilles has definitely passed his prime as a villian, but these are minor quibbles. \\"Shadow Puppets\\" is definitely a solid novel that continues to juggle humanity, politics and personal natures quite well. Card is continuing to show that he can work with shades of gray in characters that are doing their best for the common good. If you've read the other two novels in Card's \\"Shadow\\" series, there's no reason to stop now. If not, go back and pick up \\"Ender's Game\\" or \\"Ender's Shadow\\" - or both."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Ender's Shadow was a brilliant book. Shadow of the Hegemon was good, but not at par with any of the other Ender books. Shadow Puppets is nothing less than a complete let-down. It is a pity that Card has allowed his job to fall that low, and I hope that he will not make this mistake again. I only give it one star because I cannot give none.I really cannot find one reason to make me propose this book to other readers, even Ender fans, except \\"if you are dying from curiosity to see what life holds for Bean\\". Oh, and possibly the brilliance of two secondary characters, Virlomi and Alai.On the contrary, I can find many reasons why to avoid it. Let's start:* The characters are completely off, compared to the other novels. Peter, the Hegemon, is reduced to a clever teenager who, however, can't do anything without the support of either Bean or, from all people, his parents. Where is the brilliant Demosthenes / Locke who shook the world while his brother was saving it from the Buggers? Where is the extremely interesting clash between brilliance of the mind & sickness of the soul that was the essence of Peter's character in Ender's Game?Petra has become a snivelling housewife, and that was to me, as a woman, one of the major disappointments in the book. She has lost her edge, and is almost unrecognisable.As for Peter's parents, they are definitely not the same people that we've met in Ender's Game or even in the two previous Shadow books. So suddenly they are nearly as geniuses as their son?And finally, Bean : where is the tough, sharp as a knife and immensely clever boy who could outdo even Ender? Who won the respect even of Graff, and definitely of all of us? Now he is suddenly only interested in getting rid of Achilles and becoming a father?* The book is preaching. Preaching on the benefits of marriage, preaching on the blessings of parenthood, preaching, preaching... And I say this despite being pregnant myself, when theoretically I should be in a position to better appreciate Card's philosophy. And I do, but from agreeing on whether it is good to have children to accepting this as the focal point of the whole book there is too big a gap.* There are other inconcistencies in the book. Reading it, you come to expect that Alai should be Hegemon, Alai the gentle, clever, respected, deeply human Muslim Chalif. But we happen to know that Peter is and will continue being Hegemon, and with no war between religions : a war between a friend as beloved as Alai and a brother as feared and hated as Peter would have been mentioned by either Ender or Valentine in some point of their story. Yet where else could the story lead? To a meak submission of the Muslims to the Christians for fear of the Chinese? No way.And Achilles, the master of duplicity, buys so easily into Suri's friendship that he allows his trust to actually lead him to his death?* Finally, in general I found the book too flat. I missed terribly the contrasts and the clashes of the Ender series, in Xenocide for example. I missed the portrayal of interesting people, of misplaced loyalties (remember the people of Path?), of arrogant leaders, of love misunderstood and happiness lost and found, of death and rebirth. There is no such richness in this book.All in all, a dissappointment, and a bitter one at that, because in my mind Orson Scott Card was never an author who would make a book simply for money, or because pressed by his publishers, and I feel this book is nothing more than that. Even if you are a devoted fan, don't read it. And if you are not, don't start your acquaintance with Card with this book. Try the Ender series, if you are more sci-fi oriented, or even the Alvin Maker series if you prefer fantasy."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Card has long advocated the idea that the heroes of the story need to be moral heroes for the reader to identify with them, which makes sense. But in the recent novels, Card seems to require that the heroes are not just moral, but that they are all good Mormons at heart, even though none of them are in fact (except Theresa). Specifically, the earlier installment presented us with a nun believing that the great goal in life is to get married and have lots of children - which we could buy because she was already established as an eccentric and highly unusual nun. But the same idea has spread throughout the main cast of Shadow Puppets, including not just the battle school grads from Thailand and Armenia, but even a gay convict. (Indeed, at least half the world might potentially be offended by this novel, with its combined polemic against gays, Muslims, and Chinese.) Not only has the line between good guys and bad been painted as vastly as possible - each character might as well wear a white or black cowboy hat - but with the character's motivations appearing so arbitrary, the plot their choices drive also becomes contrived. This is compounded by the impression that all these super-genius characters appear to have been taking stupid pills since the last installment; their actions are decidedly non-genius. Without spoiling the plot, Bean and Petra make some extremely questionable judgment calls in their newfound quest to ignore the war and instead start having children, leading them into a new crisis which was blatantly obvious from a mile away, even without superhuman intelligence. Arch-rivals Peter and Achilles, also supposed geniuses, also suddenly have very little to prove it. The novel begins with Peter bringing Achilles to become his \\"assistant\\" at the Hegemony, a move laden with promise for schemes within schemes as these two grandmasters vie both to use and eliminate each other along the way to capturing world power. Instead, it turns out neither of them has any plan at all, with Peter suddenly fleeing when everyone freaks out that Achilles anticipated being rescued. Meanwhile, Achilles does nothing more than gain shadow power by being buddies with everyone - it's a wonder Elizabeth Bennet didn't displace William Pitt - and subsequently try to seize the office of the Hegemon, which has been depicted at length as an almost powerless institution, and certainly a huge step further away from world dominion than when Achilles had the Chinese Empire under his thumb. Secondary characters also get left out to dry with unfortunate consistency. Suriyawong is set up early in the novel as if the expansion of his role from the previous novel will continue here, but then we never hear anything more than passing references to him again. Virlomi is likewise expanded into the most interesting she has been in the series, yet she feels totally disconnected because the plot ends up requiring her never to communicate with any of the other characters (coded emails notwithstanding). And Han Tsu is suddenly rolled out late in the novel to bare his perspective on working for the enemy.Shadow Puppets brought too much to a conclusion for what is supposed to remain of the series. Suffice it to say that Bean, Petra, and Achilles have their future roles pretty tightly nailed down. Peter has inadvertently become the most interesting character, because he is the only one left whose motivation and choices as the story continues to progress are still enigmatic and conflicted. However, his rise to bring the entire Earth under his government, the only real pre-existing constraint on this series based on the earlier Ender novels, has never seemed as incidental or as unbelievable as at the hasty conclusion of Puppets.Despite these let-downs, Puppets continues the Ender's Game / Shadow tradition of gripping adventure, devious schemes, and intriguing strategies."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Well, let me begin with some praise first. I felt the first four books in the Enders Saga series were extremely interesting and well written. I very much enjoyed hearing of Enders life and the story just got better and better with every book.Then came along Enders Shadow. With this book I felt that Card did an interesting thing artistically by rewritting the first book but through another characters perspective. This I felt was quite unique and quite a good read.However, by the end of the sixth book I found Beans story to be drawn out...and by the 7th redundent. I felt that there was really no reason to have a 7th book. The plot could have ended by the end of the sixth.Now I wont lie, if Card publishes an eighth novel, I will read it. But...really, at that point, it can no longer be treated as part of Enders Saga...it will have become its own series.All in all, I felt the 7th book was ok. You cant give it a half a star, so I bumped up my rating to 3 (In honor of Ender)."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I have read the whole ender series, but with a strange sequence which may have affected the way I view the different books in the series. The first book I have read was the Shadow of the Hegemon, thanks to a tourist that had left it in the library of a hotel in Skiathos island. This book got me hooked, but it confused me also as I didn't know if I should start reading the next books or the previous ones.The general pattern in the whole series is:The beginning book is Ender's Game. Then we have two subcategories, one the Shadow series (which, with the exception of the first book, take place on earth and are more within military strategy) and one the Ender series (which take place in space and are more into new sci-fi ideas). Shadow series probably can be read from everyone, while I guess that the Ender series (especially from Speaker for the Dead onwards) would be read mainly from sci-fi fans.Below are my comments for the books of the series, in the order I have read them and a marking (10 is the highest mark):Shadow of the Hegemon: The first book I have read, and which I could not leave from my hands. I finished it in 2 days. It was fast paced action, very smart plot and after reading it I believed that Orson Scot Card (OSC) has invented/re-invented a new genre of literature. That of military strategy and adventure combined with brilliance/mind games and hidden portions of romance. Such books always existed but this seemed to be THE book. It was like the way Dan Brown re-invented books with trivials and puzzles, together with fast paced adventure. I strongly recommend it to everybody that likes such type of books. (mark: 10)Shadow puppets: The sequel to the above. I found it interesting but somehow boring as the above story developed little and the focus was on the characters (maybe too much focus so that it seemed to me that it was slightly mumbling jumbling. Strategy, brilliance and adventure seemed to be very low here. I would not recommend it for anybody to read it in isolate, unfortunately you have to read it if you want to go to the next book. I really believe that OSC made a mistake here (deliberately or not) as this book should have been told in 50-60 pages and be included in the previous or the next book. (mark: 6 but you will read it because you will want to read Shadow of the Giant)Shadow of the Giant: (see below)Ender's game: A really great book to read, probably the best of the series, however, as I had read its sequels first, when I reached the 80% of this book, I had predicted the end. However, it's at the highest standards of sci-fi, military strategy, adventure, brilliant mind games and very good depth in the human aspect of the characters. In comparison to the shadow series, it is more \\"space\\" sci-fi, while shadow series have much lesser sci-fi elements and are more down to earth. (mark: 10)Speaker for the dead: Another great book, but different style. Less adventure, more human aspect, more maturity. Brilliance yes, but not military, sci-fi yes (some great ideas) but not spaceship style. (Mark: 9)Xenocide: A good sequel of the previous novel. In certain points more brilliant, in other sections more boring, however is again a very good sci-fi book. The only flaw in these series (Speker for the dead, Xenocide, Children of the mind) is the idea behind one of the alien species described which I found outrageously extreme, however if you ignore it becomes first class reading. (Mark: 9)Children of the mind: I think that OSC has wrapped up his case pretty badly in that one. It's a fair book except the fact that I felt that OSC mumbles jumbles for one third of the novel not having decided how to end it. In other critiques I have found it described as nice approach to moral dilemmas, however, moral dilemma is when you describe it once and make your choice, while here the dilemma is repeated and repeated... I felt like I was watching a movie worth 10 oscars and the end did not worth to be included even in a cheap video movie. And again, many open ends at the end (for possible sequels). (Mark: 7 but you will read it as you will be hooked from the previous ones).Ender's shadow: Having read Enders Game and Shadow of the Hegemon, I found this book probably the best of the series, which of course is my subjective preference. I could characterize it as probably the best book I have read ever! Not to repeat myself, it has all that Shadow of the Hegemon and Ender's Game have, and even more...(Mark: the absolute 10).Shadow of the Giant: When I read shadow puppets, I said, \\"that's it, OSC has lost either his talent or his appetite for good writing...\\", so I was pretty unwilling to read it. Fortunately I decided to, as it proved to be a good one, were I believe that OSC has nicely wrapped up his story, with two small flaws.* The one is described below (its end needed to be slightly more complete) and,* The other is the fact that although he describes certain smart battles, he does not focus enough on them as it seems that he is in a hurry to wrap all things up. It had all elements to become a masterpiece but it ended up being a good to read book (Mark: 9)In general, both series have three categories of good stuff:1) Some great sci-fi ideas (battle room, battle games, fantasy game, ansible, aia, Jane, in/out travel, raman varelse etc)2) Great military strategy, mind games etc combined with adventure3) In certain books, depth of characters, moral dilemmas etcAnd two main bad stuff:1) Mumbling jumbling in certain books which was completely unnecessary (either OSC wanted just to produce and sell another title - see shadow puppets- or he could not decide how the story will continue-see last book of Ender series).2) One of the alien species described in the Ender series was so too outrageous even for sci-fi that made it look ridiculous. The idea behind it was brilliant in sci-fi terms, but he could try a different living organism...Finally, OSC has left open ends in both series (probably for next sequels), however I believe that there are two things missing. a) the story of the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, told in a metaphorical manner so it means much for humanity. b) In ancient theatre, a story should end in a way that brings \\"katharsis\\" to the story, and the souls of the readers. I believe that the end of the shadow of the giant may be smart for commercial purposes but it was very unfair to the reader as it did not bring full \\"katharsis\\"."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Uncle Orson has managed to perpetuate Bean's gripping, heartfelt saga on Earth in Shadow Puppets, the third installment in Bean's tale. The book picks up directly after Shadow of the Hegemon, with China in control of most of the world, and Peter, Bean, and Petra attempting to pick up the pieces and fight back.Card's stories draw their strength from his intensely personal and truly human depictions of his characters. Some readers were disappointed by the lack of hard sci-fi action (or even any action at all) in Shadow of the Hegemon. Unfortunately, Shadow Puppets continues the tradition of a relatively non-action oriented plot. However, this really is not a bad thing. The characters are so real, their problems and emotions so true, and Card's moral insights and tricky intellectual situations so enticing, that Shadow Puppets has a soul that most sci-fi books cannot hold a candle to.Bean's search for truth and God, in the midst of global war and his impending mortality, struck a chord with me. His love for Petra and desire to have a family with her provide the moral and emotional backbone for the novel. His struggles, his triumphs, and his failures are masterfully told by Card. For me, Bean and Petra have certainly been some of the more human characters I have come across in my reading.Peter Wiggin also plays a significantly more pronounced role in Shadow Puppets. Card fleshes out Peter in an intriguing manner--the young Hegemon is revealed as doubting, unsure, often arrogant, and generally humanly flawed. Personally, it was a rather refreshing break from the demi-god child-leaders who bestride Card's world. I really enjoyed Peter's anti-hero character, and was cheering for him the whole time.The only real let-down in the book is Achilles. After striking so much fear into the hearts of mankind in the first two novels, displaying voracious intelligence, and nearly seducing Petra, I was ready to see him come face-to-face with Bean in a grand climax. Unfortunately, Shadow Puppets slightly drops the ball here. Achilles is agonizingly downplayed, to the point of obscurity. He shows up rarely, and becomes almost the cardboard nemesis that the Buggers were in previous books.Still, Shadow Puppets is a great, well-told story of real characters with real emotions in gripping situations. Card's story-telling is masterful, and his world is superbly crafted."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Shadow Puppets is the third book in the parallel series to Ender's Game. It is a book about the struggles of the Battle School Graduates to maintain world order and stop Achilles from conquering the world. Petra and Bean have come out of hiding and plan on having a kid without Anton's key. Except Achilles has stolen the embryos. This book is about how Bean, Petra, Peter and the rest of Ender's Dragon Army take their places in world government. In my opinion this book is not as good and Ender's Game or Ender's Shadow. It is much slower paced and did not hold me as tight as the previous books. It is still full of Card's moral dilemmas and ethical problems. It is a nice addition to the series and any hardcore fan of the series would have to read it. This book is for the slightly more advance readers and juggles several plots at once. A reader who enjoys higher thinking about ethics and morality would probably enjoy this book if he or she has read the preceding books."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Shadow Puppets is the most recent novel set in the Ender universe (series began with Ender's Game) and is the third novel that features Bean as the protagonist. While the Ender Quartet was complete, Card wrote Ender's Shadow as a parallel novel that focuses on smallest boy in Battle School: Bean. Shadow Puppets is the sequel to Shadow of the Hegemon.Shadow Puppets follows Bean, a Battle School graduate and one of the heroes of the Formic War that saved the planet from the Buggers. In Shadow of the Hegemon we watched as all of the remaining Battle School graduates were kidnapped except for Bean who managed to escape. Behind it all was Achilles, a murderer who Bean knew before Battle School. Achilles had started several wars but by the end of Shadow of the Hegemon he was in a Chinese prison. Shadow Puppets has Achilles rescued by the Hegemon as Peter Wiggin believes he can learn from Achilles. Bean and Petra decide that it is time to leave the Hegemony and begin a life on the run. They know that Achilles cannot be trusted and that their lives are in jeopardy. Bean also has to deal with the fact that he knows that he will die soon. What caused Bean to be so small as a young child and so intelligent also means that he is growing at an alarming rate and will grow so large that his organs will not be able to cope and will just shut down.I enjoyed this trip back into the Ender Universe, and these are familiar characters that I enjoyed reading about. However, to be perfectly honest and fair, I also thought this was the weakest of the three Shadow novels (as well as the weakest of the 7 in the Ender Universe). I'm not entirely sure what it was, but the novel wasn't as interesting as the last too, nor was there as much tension. By this point I simply expect everyone to survive and for Peter to regain control over the Hegemony. Orson Scott Card is a good writer, but this one is not one of his best. It isn't quite a let down, but it isn't a thrill."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Orson Scott Card has written both good and bad novels. Picking up a new Card novel is always a risky proposition. Which Card will show up? _Shadow Puppets_ lurks in the gray middle-ground between Good Card and Bad Card, but thankfully it's shaded more towards the Good side of the spectrum._Shadow Puppets_ is the third in a series of novels that are roughly parallel to Card's original Ender story. _Ender's Shadow_ tells the story of Bean, a major character in _Ender's Game_. _Shadow of the Hegemon_ takes place after _Ender's Game_. Ender has left Earth permanently and Bean and the rest of the Battle School cadets have taken positions of prominence in Earth's post-war government. _Shadow Puppets_ is a direct sequel to _..Hegemon_. Bean's nemesis, Achilles, is a global bully who delights in war and terror. Achilles wants revenge and manipulates his friends and enemies to get it.Meanwhile Bean's intriguing story continues. In _...Hegemon_ we learn that Bean is a genetically modified human. He is super-intelligent and will grow taller and taller until he dies at a young age. Bean falls in love with Petra, another former Battle Schooler. They decide to have children, but Bean doesn't want to curse his children with a lifestyle identical to his own. Consequently, much of the novel is spent trying to find a way to free his progeny of the burden.The novel is written in Card's typical straightforward style. It is easily readable and will appeal to teenage readers. If you've read and enjoyed the previous Ender novels (and particularly the two immediately preceding this one) you will want to purchase _Shadow Puppets_."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"For more than two decades, Orson Scott Card has been drawing high critical praise for his twofold genius in weaving consistently clever futurist tales for young adults and infusing them with a deeply felt but gracefully expressed sense of morality. No argument from this reader: both traits are solid gold in the fevered and flashy universe of science fiction.But last month's release of SHADOW PUPPETS --- a continuation of the Hugo and Nebula award-winning ENDER'S EARTH saga, whose genetically enhanced super-kids have enthralled readers since the late '70s --- brings to light another key strength that die-hard fans might not even notice anymore. It's Card's uncanny ability to craft a seamlessly integrated sequel that can still be enjoyed by someone who just happened to pick it at random off the shelf; someone who may know the author's name from other collections or contexts but who didn't necessarily read either the inaugural ENDER'S GAME a generation ago or ENDER'S SHADOW, the immediate precursor to this volume.Believe it or not, this is a big issue in contemporary sci-fi and fantasy writing, and Card is among the surprisingly few writers who've successfully grappled with it. Just think: how many times have you delved into a good story only to find the characters are suddenly speaking \\"insider\\" language and are motivated by issues that remain vague or totally mysterious when you most needed to be in the loop? Or perhaps you've eagerly picked up the sequel to a favorite novel but gave up after plowing through so much what-came-before that the plot bogged down to a crawl.Yes, it's all about imaginative counterpoint, and SHADOW PUPPETS more than repays the occasional mental acrobatics required to keep up with the wild, weird and poignant adventures of another generation of super-kids. Julian (\\"Bean\\"), Petra, Peter, and the complex \\"baddie\\" Achilles, dance around a cluster of colorful supporting characters who all trace their creative lineage back to the first Battle School tales that launched the series. This time, instead of going to war against multi-limbed insectoid space aliens, Card's key characters (true to habit, they were bit players in previous episodes) are caught up in a maze of Earth-bound international political espionage and shifting balances of power. Saving Planet Earth was a stellar piece of cake compared to sorting out its post-crisis governmental messes!But within all the global intrigue and alliance-making that sets the grand structure of SHADOW PUPPETS, Card gives his characters fascinating personalities and emergent personal lives that gravitate toward some very \\"old-fashioned\\" values --- mending parent-child relationships, family building, future planning for an uncertain world, private spirituality, public religion. While never overbearing, Card's steadfast Mormon faith comes through in this centuries-hence technically sophisticated world, where God has become an absence that each figure, in his or her way, tries to fill.And we are given some moving glimpses of that fulfillment, one of them being a beautifully drawn portrait of a young Muslim man suddenly chosen to restore the ancient Caliphate. Card's competent understanding and deep respect for Islam is a definite bonus in these reactionary post 9/11 times. For anyone feeling that science-fiction has tended to starve out spirituality, the minor but poignant character of Alai is almost worth the book's cover price on its own.So where is the ENDER'S EARTH saga headed? Without giving too much away, the plotline that's sure to rebound from SHADOW PUPPETS into Card's next series title involves the continuing relationship between Julian and Petra in their ongoing quest to start a \\"normal\\" family and reverse a potentially fatal genetic trait that has resulted in Julian growing to gigantic height. As with the half-dozen or so previous volumes, however, one can be pleasantly certain of encountering more fast-paced action, smart and terse dialogue, supple imagery, cynical world-wise (or world-weary) characters, and mature, probing reflections on the true meaning of life in an intentional universe ..."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I couldn't believe what I was reading halfway through the book. I had been a late-comer to the Ender series, but once on board I read the previous 6 vols. in order, even enjoying how the tapestry was vast enough to fit in not just some truly alien seeming species, but also some pretty uniquely gifted and neurotic, in many different ways, humans. Fascinating men and women (even if many of them were physically children) of various races, using their gifts for good or to combat the evil that also occurred.Initially this story seemed to continue the battle of wills between gifted immature geniuses/war veterans ... but halfway through all action stops as a former genetic scientist (implied to be gay) reveals his wife and natural children to Bean, urging him to procreate as well, and I realized that the creativity and inventive mind of Card had been erased by his increasingly conservative politics. It's a shame that his books are permanently ruined for me (even the earlier ones), but I won't be reading him ever again.

It was probably my favorite of the books about Bean, after Ender's Shadow. I'm a sucker for a good love story, but this book includes so much more. The action throughout the book made it very fast-paced and there were surprises around every corner. I liked that this book contained a little less of the military aspect and more of the characters' personal lives. Once again we see Bean, Petra, and Peter dealing with the aftermath of the Formic War on Earth. We also meet our meet our favorite villain, once again trying to ruin and end our protagonists' lives. Only this time, he is working a little closer to home and getting even more personal about it. As always, the characterization that Orson Scott Card has perfected only increases your affection and understanding for the characters that you have already come to know and love. Each chapter keeps you wanting more, and all you want to do is read. Shadow Puppets incorporates love, passion, anger, fear, betrayal, joy, and manipulation all in one book, and allows you to understand every emotion the exact way it is felt by the characters in the book. You feel empathetic, rather than sympathetic, as if you were going through the events right beside them. I was pleasantly surprised, as well as extremely happy, by the ending of the book. There was no other way I really would have wanted it to end, and it tied up a few loose ends in the process. It is not every day that a book, let alone an entire series, can be so enjoyable to read.

I was wrong, however; \`Shadow Puppets' was an impressive improvement over its predecessor, and though it's no match for the original Ender novels, it returns to an important trait that made \`Ender's Game' and \`Ender's Shadow' terrific books - that is, concentrating on the characters rather than international intrigue and military operation. The lead characters in the novel, as you might expect from reading the previous books, are Bean, Petra Arkanian, Hegemon Peter Wiggin and evil genius Achilles De Flanders.

Peter Wiggins, the Hegemon and Ender's brother, wages a small-scale battle against the Chinese who have swallowed India and IndoChina and are now preparing for their next conquest. When he decides to rescue the brilliant murderer, Achilles, from the Chinese, though, Peter throws his own forces into confusion. Bean, the one child/man who most closely resembles Ender, together with his friend Petra, flee from both Peter and Achilles--they of all people know that Achilles hates most those who rescue him.While Bean and Petra flee through Europe and the middle east, their feelings for one another, together with their hormonal attraction, escalate. Bean fears to bring into the world anyone cursed with the strange mutation that gives him both his genius and the continued growth that will kill him before thirty, yet even he cannot resist the power of a determined woman. And Petra is fully determined to marry Bean and bear his children, no matter what the cost to herself.Although the Chinese seem dominant, with Europe and America cowed and Russia unwilling to rekindle the ancient rivalry, battle school graduates work to begin a resistance movement within India, and hope to strike back into China itself. Yet, with the Hegemon distracted and perhaps destroyed by Achilles, can the world find a force behind which oppostion can combine?Orson Scott Card is one of best Science Fiction writers ever, and SHADOW PUPPETS demonstrates the power of his writing. Although Bean's story is clearly secondary to the upcoming global battle, I was still compelled through the narative, unable to put the book down until I'd finished every page. The romance between Bean and Petra felt real, and Peter the Hegemon's gradual maturing was certainly gratifying.Fans of the post-Ender series will definitely want to read this one. China finally faces a unified opposition that threatens to give it a run for the money. Yet Card also plants the seeds for future trouble.

I really don't care if his character lives or dies. I don't feel there's anything particularly redeeming about him.5. It's hard to believe that Achilles is really capable of accumulating all this power.6. I'd say this book is about as good as Children of the Mind, except that I liked Peter's storyline in CotM much better than any storyline in this book.7. To calibrate you on what kind of book I like, I'd rank the books in the Ender series in this order: Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Shadow of the Hegemon, Ender's Shadow, Children of the Mind, Shadow Puppets."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"After the third or fourth installment of a story, things can get kind of stale.

Bean's saga has yet to disappoint and he remains a compelling character."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Ok, I read this book a year ago so I've forgotten a lot, and I don't have tones of time to back up my five-star rating but let me just say that this has got to be one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read because it lets you into the mind of Orson Scott Card. It seems like every paragraph is dripping with amazing insights and analysis that just blows you away. Things you've sort of thought about but never truly thought through completely. Well, Card has some amazing commentary on what seems like an endless array of topics. I just loved it.I've seen some people complain about Card being too &quot;preachy&quot; in this book. Well, I honestly don't think so. He isn't preaching he's analyzing, and his analysis is 100% on the mark time after time. It's so cool to think through things in the way he does.The story itself is non-stop action, more so than I remember from a lot of other Ender books, sacrificing perhaps a bit of characterization, but not a bit of insightfulness. I think Card's strongest talent is his ability to make not only cool but also valid analysis of how the world really works and why things are the way they are. This is what makes this books so awesome. I recommend it to anyone who likes to truly think about the world around them. Card should be a philosopher as far as I'm concerned. :-) ok, that's enough babbling ..."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Mediocre Sci-Fi at best, but intellectually stimulating.

Shadow Puppets is the continuing story of Bean's life on earth and the effects that the Anton's key has on him. This is better than all the others by far. If you read one book this year, make it Shadow Puppets!"},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"This is the third novel in Card's SHADOW SERIES that started with ENDER'S SHADOW and continued with SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON.

It's an absorbing and thoughtful book well worth your time and money. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"While Ender's Game was an excellent book in itself, I think its most important role was to pave the way for Card's next Ender book, Speaker for the Dead. Speaker was one of the most moving, powerful, thought-provoking storys I have ever read. In short, Shadow of the Hegemon and it's latest sequel, Shadow Puppets, are anything but. They are good reads in themselves, especially for Card's devoted fans. But the character cry out to be made into something more. Ender's Shadow left Card a million opportunities to write another Speaker. But instead he wrote a story about world politics. I mean, I'm sure there are some out there who care deeply about that stuff-but let's face it-most of us don't. Although Shadow Puppets is exciting and fast-paced, it wants to be something more, something better. You get the sense that the author is tired of these characters and their situation, and just wants to finish the series. The hurried romance between Bean and Petra, Achilles' rapid fading from his formorly prominent position in the book-all point to a desire by the author to finish the books and write something really important to him. Readers can only hope Card will see the boundless possibilities in this series before it's to late."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Shadow Puppets is a really great book. This is my favorite book in the series of Bean, with the other two books being Ender's Shadow and Shadow of the Hegemon. Shadow Puppets is the first thing I have ever read that has made POLITICS INTERESTING! That is Really Good! I read this book for most of the day of September second, the last day of my summer break. If I'm spending my last day of freedom before going back to school :( reading a book, then that has to be a REALLY GOOD BOOK! I can't really write a summary for this book without giving away stuff, so I won't try. I'll just say it has more of Peter, Bean, Petra, and Peter's parents. Also some other kids from Battle School. Achilles, Bean's enemy, is also talked about a lot, but he's not actually in a lot of the scenes. But he IS in some! This book starts where Shadow of the Hegemon ends, and if you are a fan of this series, you definitely have to read this book.

(Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind) Although I found them to slightly decline in quality, in the end, I had very few complaints about them.I enjoyed Ender's shadow a lot. It helps us get into the fantastic mind of Bean, one of the most interesting characters in the book. Shadow of the Hegemon was more on the militaristic side, and not much character development of bean, but it kept you reading it, in order to find out what happened.Now. For this one. Shadow Puppets, as I've already said, I was expecting a little bit more. I was hoping that my slight dissapointment in Shadow of the Hegemon could be brought back with Shadow Puppets, but it was only mediocre. The book starts off fast paced, and i found the beginning of the book to be pretty interesting... im liking it. Once Petra and Bean left, however, the entire novel was devoted to babies. Petra's babies. The middle section of the book, in my opinion, was the lowest in all the Bean series. It was an interesting concept for, say, one-two chapters. However when you drag it on for 3,4,5 chapters it starts getting old. I would have liked to see some more development of Bean in action, instead of seeing him sit around wallowing in self pity. Once we met Alai, however, the book starts to get better, and the ending is great. (Once again returning to the babies.) My final verdict is: Read this book, if only to be able to read the next two books that come out. And cross your fingers that Card will be able to go back to his standard of Speaker for the Dead and Ender's Game/Shadow.3 1/2 Stars."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"This book is excruicatingly bad. All the characters speak with the same exact style of voice. A half-formal, half-scarcastic (but never genuinely funny) monotone. Card's earlier works in the Ender series were great, with characters you can care about. Here, it feels like we're at a dinner party with George Lucas and Orson Scott Card talking about their past triumphs, revisiting them, and in the end ruining them through boredom and pretentiousness. I can't believe how much yapping there is about stupid political situations. It could have worked if they didn't sound utterly made up, with a \\"And then the main characters were 100% right and guessed all the right answers\\" tacked on at the end.And the audiobook version: The characters speak as if everything they say is super-important and must be said in a whiny whisper. Chapters are separated by the cheesiest music I have every heard this side of an elevator."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"This novel continues the story of Bean and Petra's struggle against the evil genius Achilles, last seen in Chinese custody. When Achille usurps the office of Hegemon, Bean, Petra, and Peter Wiggin must all go into hiding, where Peter experiences a taste of humility and a renewed relationship with his parents and Bean and Petra fall in love and decide to start a family. These human aspects of the plot are its strongest elements and raise this story above the level of its predeccessor.The weakest point in any of the Bean novels is always the political dimension. I've never been convinced by Orson Scott Card's take on geopolitics. In his worldview, everybody seems to be waiting for a messiah, whether it's the united Muslims and their new caliph or the western world and the office of the Hegemon. The manner in which the character Virlomi incites wide-scale civil disobediance among rural Indians against Chinese occupation by dropping stones seemed particularly silly.Still, I enjoyed the resolution of the Achille storyline and am intrigued by the plot threads that Card hasn't resolved yet--Bean's terminal giantism, his relationship with Petra, and the fate of their missing embryos."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"This book is a sequel to Shadow of the Hegemon, which in turn is a sequel to Ender's Shadow. When Peter Wiggin, Hegemon and younger brother of Ender Wiggin, decides to rescue Achilles from the Chinese, he thinks he can control the psychopathic killer. Finding himself alone after Bean, Petra and others go into hiding to protect themselves from Achilles, Peter must learn to rely upon his parents to avoid becoming Achilles' next victim. Meanwhile, a new power is emerging in the Islamic world to counter the threat from the Chinese. Bean and Petra find themselves seeking protection in Damascus, where they provide a contact for the Hegemon to assist the Islamic plans to reverse the Chinese aggressions.This story continues to explore the unsettled geo-politics of the Earth following Ender Wiggins decisive defeat of the alien threat that had temporarily united all of humanity. However, this story also provides a deeply intimate story of Bean and Petra, as they're relationship matures and they begin to dream of having a family. The characters in this book are more fully developed than in the preceding two, and their motives become more complicated as they struggle to balance their desire to live normal lives with the impact of outside events on their lives. This may be the most compelling book in the Ender series so far."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"There is not a book in the \\"Shadow\\" series by Card that is a disappointment, even if this is the closest he's come. I will admit that the amount of \\"movie\\" action he includes in this book is higher than some of his other novels,but one tends to forget that action was a prime piece of the appeal of \\"Ender's Game\\". I think hardcore Sci-Fi fans are just uncomfortable with action that takes place in less incredible environments. Somehow null-gravity laser battles in a space station are of more value than terrestrial warfare. I believe that Card's treatment of the material in this book is comparable to that of any of the other books in the series.To those who criticize Card for his stance on social issues, I ask that you please find a better target for your rage, because this novel does not exist to preach the Mormon faith or Right-Wing politics. The reviewer that criticizes THIS book for Card's statements on a political web site has completely missed the point of a book review. In the end, politics are not the driving force behind this work. This is a novel that survives on the creativity and innovative characterization that Card used to write every other book in this amazing series."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"It seems to me that Roger Ebert is on to something - he will give a film a high rating if he enjoyed it, even if he cannot intellectually justify it. I find that the Shadow series of Orson Scott Card to be in this category. While reading the books, I've enjoyed them immensely, racing throught them at breakneck speed. It is only upon reflection afterwards that I notice that the Shadow subseries lacks the scope and ambition of the Books 1-4 of the Ender series. Card's inventiveness shines in the earlier books - 2 extraordinary extraterrestrial races (three if you count Jane), a new religion, speculation on the nature of the soul, etc. What do we get in Shadow Puppets? A continuation of the Achille vs. Bean battle and unification of the Muslim world.The general story picks up where we left off in Shadow of the Hedgemon - Peter is &quot;ruling&quot; as Hedgemon (with about as much power as the general secretary of the U.N.). China has invaded and occupied India and Southest Asia. Achille is rescued from captivity in China by Peter, causing Bean and Petra to flee from the Hedgemony and seek a life on the lam, while trying to determine if they can have children who will not be afflicted with Bean's genetic mutation. Meanwhile, world opinion comes around to fear of the rapidly expanding China, setting the stage for a world war.Card saves his best writing for the commando raids and military actions both strategic and tactical. The detail is less than, say, Tom Clancy, but very interesting and well-paced. Unfortunately, characterisations are sacrificed. When I consider Speaker for the Dead with its detailed and varied characters, I am disappointed with the development of Peter, Bean, and Petra. We do get to meet the parental Wiggins, and that is a special treat of this book - I wish we could have had more of them.This review sounds negative, so let me reiterate: the criticisms I have of the book were only noticed on reflection. While in the midst of the story, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and recommend it. If you have not read the previous books in the series, you will not be able to start here - go back and read at least Ender's Game, Ender's Shadow, and Shadow of the Hedgemon. Incidentally, for my money, Speaker for the Dead is the jewel of the Ender series, and one of my top 5 favourite books of all time."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Of all the things out there to read, this is not the worst. However, compared the others in the series, it's certainly at the lesser end of the scale.I loved getting to know Peter and his parents better. Seeing Peter grow as a leader was enjoyable considering that the picture of Peter ruling the world in the Ender books is depressing given his role as tormentor and psychopath. Conversely, this transformation could irritate some readers who feel that the Peter of Shadow Puppets betrays the original character.I liked the military campaign subplot. This facet of Card's books contines to shine.I hated the Petra and Bean subplot. It felt contrived and like an excuse to epouse the generally religious believe that life begins at conception. Card was previously able to keep most of his religious beliefs out of the science fiction series. (Also, if the phrase &quot;making babies&quot; appeared one more time in the book, I think I would have stopped reading any chapter containing their names.)Irritatingly, the ending of the book seemed rushed and several subplots were left unresolved.Ultimately, the book is worth reading if you're a fan of the Ender series, but don't expect Ender's Game all over again or you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"After reading this final book, I cannot help but feel manipulated for being a fan of the series. The book doesn't teach us anything new. Other than Bean, no character grows, and he's only growing physically.From the previous novels, especially the Ender-focused books, I have come to expect much from Peter. Was he really the monster that Ender thought he was? Was he really just as smart as Ender, but more brutal? Was he capable of uniting Earth under the Hegemony? The answer is no. And that answer is hugely disappointing. I was fully prepared to hate and admire him at the same time, yet all I feel after reading about him is disappointment. If only Ender had come back to Earth; he would've spared us the last 2 novels.This novel serves as a good filler/epilogue reading. In other words, don't expect to see any definite answers because there aren't any. You might learn more about semi-background characters (Ender's parents are very nicely written here, to my immense delight) but many lose ends are left untied. Personally, I was waiting for further confirmation regarding Sister Carlotta. However, the only references to her are when Bean feels guilty/depressed/self-pity about losing her and Poke. Many many times throughout the book.When you find yourself being smarter than the supposedly \\"smartest person in the world\\", you tend to expect less from him. I used to love reading these books and being overwhelmed by the intelligence of these little kids, so I was surprised to find out that they can be extremely stupid at times. However, this doesn't mean that I have stopped being a fan of the series. This may not have been the strongest book in the series, but it was still nice to come back to read about all the precious characters.If you're a fan of the series, I recommend reading the book. It is not too long, doesn't get overly boring, and lets you revisit Battle School, if only for a very brief moment. It's like standing outside your old school: Just bringing back the memories is good enough."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"As a long-time fan of Card's Ender-and-Bean series, I was hugely disappointed by the latest installment. Much like the steady decline of quality in the Ender quartet, this continuation in Bean's saga is flimsy in comparison to the orignal book - Ender's Shadow. While it is a good deal more interesting than its predescesor, Shadow of the Hegemon, I am devoutly glad that I found this book at the library rather than buying it.There is nothing wrong with the plot of this book, and parts of it are actually enjoyable. However, Card's tendency to spiral into preachyness is almost sickening at times. The man's strict Mormon beliefs are stronger than ever in this book. It wouldn't be so bad if the main character, Bean, was given more of the narration. Instead, it seems as if Card only lets us into his head when he wants to lecture. It's disappointing to see such a strong and interesting character washed away by the author's moralizing. I only wish that Mr. Card had kept in mind the fact that not everyone has strong religious faith, and many do not enjoy being preached to.While Shadow Puppets had some interesting insights into minor characters (it was a pleasure to finally get to know Mrs. and Mr. Wiggin, parents of Ender, Peter and Valentine), it managed to render it's most important character as one-dimensional as possible. Bean is nothing of the charming, razor-smart kid we met in Ender's Shadow. He is pushed out of the limelight in favor of Peter and Petra, as well as several unimportant characters who may have better off left in the background.I am giving this book three stars because it was inded a step above the last one, and it did have some bright points. However, I would recommend Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow to anyone who has not read them above this novel. And for those who have read the first books in the series... why not reread them? They are scads more enjoyable than this book."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Like most people who are regular readers of O.S. Card's work, I read this book and immediatly sized it up against all his previous works. It's not exactly the way to go about reviewing a book, but in the case of a series such as this, it is somewhat inevitable that comparisons will be made against all the previous books.I found Shadow Puppets to be quick paced, action-packed, and full of surprises that I wasn't expecting to see in any work done by O.S.C. It took me by surprise to see what he did with the relationship between Petra and Bean and i'm not sure that some of their responses held true to their character. I personally did not like this part of the book because I think it betrayed some of the integrity that Bean and Petra had before and replaced it with a somewhat out-of-character adolescent romance. Not to say that their relationship totally ruined the book (completly untrue!) but for me, it was an irratating portion of the book that I thought could have been handled in a better way.Let me assure you that the positives far outweigh the negatives in this book though. If you are considering reading this book, you have more than likely read the previous 6 in this series and are wondering if you should go ahead and fork over the money to buy it now or wait till it comes to your local library or the shelves at half price books. If you have read all the books in this series, than you have probably already bought it or are about to no matter what the reviews say. If not, than I say it's a good investment and you should get it. It took me 3 hours to read and kept me up until 2 a.m. on a school night just to complete it because I didn't want to put it down. It was worth being sleepy the rest of the day just to have read this book."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"At first I was stunned at how brief this book was (compared to Speaker for the Dead, for example). Upon reading it in a day and a half I realized that all Card is doing now is cranking out product that his legions of fans will buy automatically without thinking. I was once one of those fans, when Card was an &quot;automatic buy&quot;.About SHADOW PUPPETS: There's hardly a &quot;there&quot; there. Despite the heavy &quot;portentiousness&quot; of the writing (you can tell Card is writing &quot;literature&quot;), the plot seems contrived and the characterization thin and the novel is over all too soon. Card, by now, is a multi-millionaire and a movie of ENDER'S GAME is coming out soon; but right now, with this unexceptional book, it just seems that Card is abusing his fans by cranking out a book based on characters that should have been put to rest long ago.I know this review will offend Card's followers, but I'm not writing these words to offend anyone. (And I know I won't persuade a single Card reader.) This is just my opinion, the opinion of a former true-beliver. (I've even read his Mormon books.) My advice to Mr. Card would be to write a decade of stand-alone novels such as PASTWATCH or A PLANET CALLED TREASON or HART'S HOPE. If he did, he might get people like me back. But I don't think he will. There's too much gold in them thar hills and Card was never one to turn away from a gold mine. (Perhaps no one would. But Card's weathly enough now to do anything he wants. And I want the old Card back. Not the new one. Not the superstar. I want the hungry writer of Analog stories of old.)"},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I introduced myself to the Ender series as a teenager nearly a decade ago and throughout my high school years Card was by far my favorite storyteller. In my mind, Ender's Game is a classic and ranks alongside works such as the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Although I haven't revisited Ender's Game since I first read it (and for the sake of nostalgia, probably never will), these last few books certainly don't show a great deal of TLC on the part of Card. In one sense, my assessment's unfair. Card put decades of thought into developing Ender's Game and it's a solid, inspiring work. He's been churning these last ones out in a year's time. I assume he's written the more recent for his fans, whom I believe he genuinely relates to, and I guess he's simply trying to satisfy their appetite to know what happened from the mind that created this whole fictional universe. But Shadow Puppets is, in my humble opinion, a laundry list of events with fairly lackluster prose and pretty weak character development (for what I remember as the best of Card, at least). There was a mystery to the world (it was a far more exciting place when the details were murky) of Ender's Game, but the post-Formic War planet Earth is too much like the one we have in the here and now and I just can't swallow any longer the premise that adolescents would be running the world, at least not in such great number...I read this book as soon as it arrived at my door here in Scotland. And when I put it down, I couldn't help be get a lump in my throat as I remembered fondly those final chapters of Ender's Game. Now that was a heck of a book."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Early on while reading \\"Shadow Puppets,\\" the 7th volume in the Ender series (even if Ender never actually appears within its pages), I started thinking that Orson Scott Card had written what would have been called, in the old days, a potboiler. But in contemporary terms it might be closer to the mark to think that Uncle Orson has started putting Geoffrey, Emily, and Zina through college. I also assumed that following up on \\"Ender's Shadow\\" and \\"Shadow of the Hegemon,\\" this latest novel would complete the \\"Bean Trilogy\\" and resolve the conflict between Bean and Achilles. However, this is something that \\"Shadow Puppets\\" does and does not do.Certainly that is one of the threads of the this novel, as is the mortality of Bean's existence, his relationship with Petra, and Peter's efforts as Hegemon to stave off further Chinese incursions around the globe. But although we keep return to Bean and Petra I never really get the feeling they are the true focus of the story. There are are a lot more players this time around in Uncle Orson's story, and actually the ones I found most interesting where John Paul and Theresa Wiggin, who finally prove to us once and for all where their three mega-children got their talents and abilities. Card worries in his afterward that he was making too many previous minor characters (i.e., battle school veterans) more prominent in this story, but I actually found that to be one of the better things about \\"Shadow Puppets\\"; I especially liked Virlomi's simple but effective way of creating a spirit of resistance in India.Ultimately, I found \\"Shadow Puppets\\" intriguing as a critique of contemporary geopolitical tensions and an optimistic look at the \\"future.\\" Card finished writing this novel during the war in Afghanistan and his thoughts on what Islam might look like in the future and the honorable way to fight a war are quite interesting. This underscores Card's strength as a writer, that even when it seems he is telling a story in which not much happens, he still offers food for thought. There is a lot in here about families and familial relationships, albeit mostly in the context of something else, but still there for the consideration. The books ends with a bang, if you will, instead of a whimper, but it is not a big bang, which is certainly in keeping with Card's tendency toward underplayed conclusions: the ending is never the big moment you have been awaiting, but rather with how you live with the aftermath of the big moment once it is done. Granted, this is the least of the novels in the Ender series, and a minor effort from Card all things considered. But we are still talking Uncle Orson here, and even in his lesser works he never totally disappoints his readers."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"The Ender's Shadow series was off to such a great start. Ender's Shadow was excellent. Shadow of the Hegemon was even better, introducing political intrigue. Shadow Puppets then came along, and while better than most novels out there... was NOTHING compared to the other books in the Ender series.The story's major flaw is the change in the characters. Rather than being the young struggling geniuses, the novel is about a lovestruck Bean and Petra. This scenario is hard to adjust to when one is so used to Bean being a 6 year old midget but it is a requirement to manage the novel.The love story ultimately causes the story to drag as Bean and Petra fight over the situation of whether or not they should... have babies. The drivel that these conversations offer is quite boring and is the reason the novel can't live up to its predecessors.Where the novel does stand strong is in the growing political turmoil. Bean and Petra reunite with an old friend and help slow down Achilles expansive nature. The strategy of the groups military actions and the reintroduction of old characters helps to save the novel and ultimately lets the story be remembered in a positive light.I just hope that in the coming Shadow of the Giant, Orson Scott Card reduces the love elements and continues with the political elements and the climax of Bean's medical condition."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Both this latest installment along with its &quot;Shadow&quot; predecessors has much wanting. I've read and re-read Ender's Game easily a dozen times, and the later books focusing on Andrew Wiggin several times as well. This series that follows Bean as a young angst-ridden superhuman is sadly lacking in the easy charm of the earlier books. The characters are put in postions or act in ways solely to serve the necessities of the plot, and aren't believable in any way. When the plot calls for any of the Superkids to become dumb suddenly, they do. The entire &quot;let have some babies&quot; sub-plot had to be the worst idea Bean ever had (not to mention preachy on Card's part considering his Mormon beliefs - not everyone HAS to have kids). In any case that twist served only as a contrivance to force a final showdown between the Hero and his Nemesis. And and nemeses go, Achilles is pitiful. OOH, he's scary. Watch out. He is a punk kid. In fact, all the former members of Ender's jeesh are punk kids. Genuises, surely. But they're kids. In the context of Battle School and the Formic Wars, a bunch of kids saving the world works brilliantly. But back on Mother Earth they would be treated like smart-ass children again. They wouldn't be leading armies in the field or setting national policies. The reason the other Ender books worked is that he was an adult, we believe that he can be wise, and so do the characters in the books. The only realistic portrayal of the circumstance was that of Han Tzu who was frustrated because no one would listen to him. I found myself in a permanent state of disbelief regarding the overly simplistic portrayal to the &quot;geo-polictial&quot; conflicts.In my mind the question of what happened on Earth while Ender and Valentine were traveling through space was always synonomous with what happened to Peter. How did he change, how did he mature, how did he become the leader and statesman that he did? How did he keep Earth united? All these questions are a footnote in this expansion of the Enderverse. Peter becomes merely one of several boy/girl geniuses, and not even the smartest of the bunch. And while I enjoyed learning more about John Paul and Teresa, their development comes at the direct expense of Peter, who comes off as not really that smart after all.One last beef. The non-stop &quot;witty&quot; banter, especially that between Petra and Bean was unbelievably tedious. I skimmed entire pages and missed not one iota of important information. They repeated themselves, their motivations, their objectives, endlessly. Instead of coming up with a way to defeat their enemy they 1.ran away, giving him a more secure position and 2.gave their enemy huge leverage against them. In the end, all they came up with a clever e-mail. Nice job Bean &amp; Petra. Ender would be proud.I'm not reading the next one."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Like many of the other reviewers here, I find this series has steadily declined since the excellent &quot;Ender's Shadow.&quot; In both &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Ender's Shadow,&quot; Card managed to blend action, philosophy, heroism, and moral dilemma in powerful, yet subtle ways. He made us really care about Ender and Bean, and he kept the tension perfectly balanced. Unfortunately, all of the subtlety seems to have disappeared, along with much of the action. I finished &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; not only caring much less about the characters than I had before, but downright irritated with them. And I had a headache after being hit non-stop with the Sledgehammer of Morality. This series has become too tedious for me...I won't be buying any further editions."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"There's a passable story in this book, but it's swamped by pages of didactic musings about human beings' innate urge to procreate, along with many, many statements that life begins at conception. I'm happily pregnant right now, so you'd think I'd be sympathetic to this sort of thing, but it is dull, dull, dull.The characters, too, are flat and disappointing, with no resemblance to the characters with the same names that appeared in Ender's Game. A few of the side characters (Virlomi, Han Tzu) are allowed to be interesting since they neither have to wave the flag of procreation nor fill in the gaps in Peter's transformation into a responsible leader. (Lots of history is rehashed here but you never hear about Peter torturing small animals.)When Card finally turns his attention to political and military strategy things do pick up. Unfortunately that's by far the smallest part of the book. I found the two earlier books in this set of sequels to Ender's Game to be okay but not great; this one is not even up to that standard. Unfortunately the ending is a clear setup for yet another sequel focused on Bean's babies. Re-read Ender's Game instead."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"SHADOW PUPPETS isn't exactly disappointing, but it certainly does not pack the emotional impact of Card's previous efforts. Bean and Petra are the central characters in this installment but the \\"shadow\\" of Achilles is never far behind. We see the denouement of the conflict between Bean and Achilles started in Ender's Shadow, but there's a certain emotional detachment about the whole process. Card seems on auto pilot here. This is clearly a bridge novel that will eventually bring us to the full realization of Peter's hegemonyAnd this is definitely not a book to be read if you have not read the previous novels. One would be hopelessly out of the loop to make sense of it all without prior knowledge gained in the previous works."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"With Ender's Game being among my favorite books alongside its three sequels (Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind), I went into the Bean series with high hopes, and have had them continually dashed by repetitive stories.Shadow Puppets is not a long book, but Card seemed to have trouble keeping the narrative flowing smoothly. \\"Bean saw that he had grown a lot, and that made him sad.\\" Card makes Bean's size his primary character trait. Granted, physical size is one of the main themes of series, but his descriptions are long, repetitive, and boring.Card also has a habit for bringing in characters and discarding them without a moment's notice. Ex-battleschoolers from around the world are brought in, but I never really care what they're doing. They're not developed, not special. If they die, get hurt, or betray the cause, I couldn't care less.Additionally, Bean's romance with Petra seems forced and unnatural. A certain youthful awkwardness is fine, but Petra's motivation for her undying love for Bean, want for his child, and nonchalance of his impending doom is not explained. Why does she want this child so much? Why does she love this cold, heartless person?And where is Peter? Ender's scheming older brother was by far the most interesting character in the previous book, (though that suffered, to a lesser degree, from many of of the same problems this one does) and he barely appears in this book.If you haven't already, pick up the \\"Lusitania\\" trilogy after you finish Ender's Game. Don't waste your time. If anything, read Ender's Shadow, which is a reasonably interesting parallel novel to Ender's Game. Beyond that, however, Card has given us an overblown yet cold melodrama."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"In this novel the author, Orson Scott Card, focuses on secondary characters from ENDER'S GAME.Peter Wiggin (a.k.a. the Hegemon, among other alias names), Julian Delphiki (a.k.a. \\"Bean\\"), and Petra Arkanian must deal with Achilles de Flandres. Achilles, if you recall from the previous books, was a genius. Mentally, however, he was very unstable. He wanted nothing more than the deaths of Peter, Bean, and Petra. Second on Achilles's list of things-to-do was to conquer all, starting with the Hegemony!Suriyawong, Virlomi, Hyrum Graff, and Volescu appear as secondary characters. They were not just for show or used as \\"fillers\\" though. Each had vital roles in the book and possibly in the next. (My hope springs eternal.)***** If you have not read the previous books, I highly recommend that you begin at the beginning, with ENDER'S GAME. Not only because all in this series is fantastic, but also because you when previous characters or events are mentioned, you would totally understand the reference and feel more a part of Card's vast universe. This author does not insult the intelligence of his readers; therefore, he will not go into deep detail on past events. He just mentions a person or event and carries on with the current story. I love that in an author!Orson Scott Card made a fan of me with ENDER'S GAME. Of course, since I enjoyed it so much, I handed it over to my husband and the \\"Ender's Bug\\" (as I call it) bit him too. Card quickly made his way from my list of \\"Good Authors\\", to my list of \\"Favorite Authors\\", and currently resides on my \\"Elite List\\" which contains only four names (and one of them are deceased).

However, I find it lacking of the magic that made the others popular. This doesn't make this a terrible book, but the cat-and-mouse game gets pretty old, to the point where it's predictable.I also found it hard to read as a standalone, unlike the other books, the lingo and the people requires familiarity of the series.Nonetheless, this is an excellent addition to the rest of the series, and if you had been following the series, this one actually provides a pretty satisfactory ending - one that was somewhat surprising since there's another book coming.

Granted that they are not sci fi thrillers like Enders Game, but afterwards many a person was left wondering what happened on earth, and these books tell you of the tragadies and triumphs that befall the beloved home planet."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"I have read the whole ender series, but with a strange sequence which may have affected the way I view the different books in the series. The first book I have read was the Shadow of the Hegemon, thanks to a tourist that had left it in the library of a hotel in Skiathos island. This book got me hooked, but it confused me also as I didn't know if I should start reading the next books or the previous ones.The general pattern in the whole series is:The beginning book is Ender's Game. Then we have two subcategories, one the Shadow series (which, with the exception of the first book, take place on earth and are more within military strategy) and one the Ender series (which take place in space and are more into new sci-fi ideas). Shadow series probably can be read from everyone, while I guess that the Ender series (especially from Speaker for the Dead onwards) would be read mainly from sci-fi fans.Below are my comments for the books of the series, in the order I have read them and a marking (10 is the highest mark):Shadow of the Hegemon: The first book I have read, and which I could not leave from my hands. I finished it in 2 days. It was fast paced action, very smart plot and after reading it I believed that Orson Scot Card (OSC) has invented/re-invented a new genre of literature. That of military strategy and adventure combined with brilliance/mind games and hidden portions of romance. Such books always existed but this seemed to be THE book. It was like the way Dan Brown re-invented books with trivials and puzzles, together with fast paced adventure. I strongly recommend it to everybody that likes such type of books. (mark: 10)Shadow puppets: The sequel to the above. I found it interesting but somehow boring as the above story developed little and the focus was on the characters (maybe too much focus so that it seemed to me that it was slightly mumbling jumbling. Strategy, brilliance and adventure seemed to be very low here. I would not recommend it for anybody to read it in isolate, unfortunately you have to read it if you want to go to the next book. I really believe that OSC made a mistake here (deliberately or not) as this book should have been told in 50-60 pages and be included in the previous or the next book. (mark: 6 but you will read it because you will want to read Shadow of the Giant)Shadow of the Giant: (see below)Ender's game: A really great book to read, probably the best of the series, however, as I had read its sequels first, when I reached the 80% of this book, I had predicted the end. However, it's at the highest standards of sci-fi, military strategy, adventure, brilliant mind games and very good depth in the human aspect of the characters. In comparison to the shadow series, it is more \\"space\\" sci-fi, while shadow series have much lesser sci-fi elements and are more down to earth. (mark: 10)Speaker for the dead: Another great book, but different style. Less adventure, more human aspect, more maturity. Brilliance yes, but not military, sci-fi yes (some great ideas) but not spaceship style. (Mark: 9)Xenocide: A good sequel of the previous novel. In certain points more brilliant, in other sections more boring, however is again a very good sci-fi book. The only flaw in these series (Speker for the dead, Xenocide, Children of the mind) is the idea behind one of the alien species described which I found outrageously extreme, however if you ignore it becomes first class reading. (Mark: 9)Children of the mind: I think that OSC has wrapped up his case pretty badly in that one. It's a fair book except the fact that I felt that OSC mumbles jumbles for one third of the novel not having decided how to end it. In other critiques I have found it described as nice approach to moral dilemmas, however, moral dilemma is when you describe it once and make your choice, while here the dilemma is repeated and repeated... I felt like I was watching a movie worth 10 oscars and the end did not worth to be included even in a cheap video movie. And again, many open ends at the end (for possible sequels). (Mark: 7 but you will read it as you will be hooked from the previous ones).Ender's shadow: Having read Enders Game and Shadow of the Hegemon, I found this book probably the best of the series, which of course is my subjective preference. I could characterize it as probably the best book I have read ever! Not to repeat myself, it has all that Shadow of the Hegemon and Ender's Game have, and even more...(Mark: the absolute 10).Shadow of the Giant: When I read shadow puppets, I said, \\"that's it, OSC has lost either his talent or his appetite for good writing...\\", so I was pretty unwilling to read it. Fortunately I decided to, as it proved to be a good one, were I believe that OSC has nicely wrapped up his story, with two small flaws.* The one is described below (its end needed to be slightly more complete) and,* The other is the fact that although he describes certain smart battles, he does not focus enough on them as it seems that he is in a hurry to wrap all things up. It had all elements to become a masterpiece but it ended up being a good to read book (Mark: 9)In general, both series have three categories of good stuff:1) Some great sci-fi ideas (battle room, battle games, fantasy game, ansible, aia, Jane, in/out travel, raman varelse etc)2) Great military strategy, mind games etc combined with adventure3) In certain books, depth of characters, moral dilemmas etcAnd two main bad stuff:1) Mumbling jumbling in certain books which was completely unnecessary (either OSC wanted just to produce and sell another title - see shadow puppets- or he could not decide how the story will continue-see last book of Ender series).2) One of the alien species described in the Ender series was so too outrageous even for sci-fi that made it look ridiculous. The idea behind it was brilliant in sci-fi terms, but he could try a different living organism...Finally, OSC has left open ends in both series (probably for next sequels), however I believe that there are two things missing. a) the story of the Hive Queen and the Hegemon, told in a metaphorical manner so it means much for humanity. b) In ancient theatre, a story should end in a way that brings \\"katharsis\\" to the story, and the souls of the readers. I believe that the end of the shadow of the giant may be smart for commercial purposes but it was very unfair to the reader as it did not bring full \\"katharsis\\"."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Bean faces the world in a more personal way than ever before.

Bean, once the smallest member of Ender Wiggin's world-saving jeesh, is rapidly growing -- not just into a man, but into a giant. When Ender's brother plots to free Achilles (the murderous genius who has schemed against Bean since they were children in the streets of Rotterdam), Bean and Petra Arkanian go into hiding, knowing that Peter Wiggin will never be able to control the evil genius they call \\"The Beast.\\"Much of Card's fiction is a combination of a compelling character study and a serious political drama, but this contrast is much more pronounced in the \\"Shadow\\" series than in anything else he has written. I suspect this is because the \\"Shadow\\" series is not as far removed from our real-world present day as much of his other work. This doesn't stop it from being well-planned, well-researched and extremely logical -- yet still surprising. (Where else in contemporary American fiction will you find a Muslim army portrayed as the good guys?)With presumably one volume to go in this series, it feels as though poor Bean is headed for a tragic, heroic end. \\"Shadow Puppets\\" leaves one major plot thread dangling, and it's not at all the one you would suspect if you've read the first two novels. I am very much looking forward to the conclusion of Bean's adventures."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"A good read. A little too heavy on the issue of growing up and having babies."},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"Ender Wiggins led the victory over the Formics, but his brother Peter is named the Hegemon, leader of the waning worldwide government, a victim of its own success. Peter learns that the Chinese are afraid and weary of his rival Achilles, who has helped them expand their boundaries. They incarcerate the dangerous Achilles, but Peter rescues his enemy only to realize rather quickly that his foe is crazier, deadlier, and more devious than he imagined. Achilles takes power from Peter.Peter's strongest ally Bean leaves to start a family with Petra before he dies, which is sooner than later. Bean and Petra agree that their children will not carry Anton's Key in their genes, as that is what is causing Bean's premature death. However, Achilles has his own plans for these unborn offsprings that include speeding up the deaths of the parents.SHADOW PUPPETS is an interesting side installment in the Ender's Earth series though the title character is not the prime player as this novel focuses on Peter, Bean, and Petra. The story line is loaded with action and philosophy with Orson Scott Card contemplating the relationships between parents and children, among siblings, friends, and lovers, and amidst major religions. Though at times pontificating over the need of servicing one's community, the latest entry in this popular series proves the author still holds four aces when it comes to engaging the reader.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Shadow Puppets (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Ender's Shadow)","review":"First: I agree with Lise Alper (see below).Second: And wish to add that I am deeply disappointed in Mr. Card's politico-religious preachings in this book: they are nothing short of racist and prejudiced stereotypes.I've read EG, ES, SOTH, and I am appalled at the degree to which Card *thinks* he understands the world, just because he has read a few inane, popular \\"current events\\" books (\\"What Went Wrong?\\")written by colonialist-thinking so-called Middle Eastern Scholars (Bernard Lewis), all in the aftermath of the xenophobia post 9/11 too.Excuse me, who died and appointed Mr. Card grand editorializer of world events? It's really sad, what with his \\"war-watch\\" columns on his website and all. It's all so fascist really, when you stop to think about it: it's advocacy for war, and for \\"strong nations\\" (monolithic, cultural stereotypes abound here) leading the weaker ones.Anyways, I'm really glad to see I am not the only one sensing these ideological politico-religious sermons in this book.I am deeply disappointed.

He makes the correct assumption that they will rinse to become the world's superpower, but China taking over India? The Chinese have no interest in other countries that they do not feel are their own people. Taiwan, yes. Tibet, yes. Not India, a nation who is projected to surpass the population of China (by the time the story takes place in Shadow Puppets).Ultimately, I felt like the true antagonist with not Achilles, but China itself. It was mentioned in the book that other than Hans Tzu, there were 80 other Battle School graduates in China, and yet they still get whipped by an unthinkable 'unified' Muslim force.The Chinese should not have been the focus; Achilles was the true bad guy. His death (which other people in this post argue wasn't exciting enough) was overshadowed by the 'evil' Chinese portrayed by Orson Scott Card."},{"Title":"Julia","review":"From the very beginning, I idenified with Julia. This story was different from so many others on the subject because it dealt with love through submission. The first half of the book is good; the last half confused me a little. A third person, Laura, is introduced into their relationship, and Julia has no problem with this. I guess I'm old fashioned, but jealousy runs through my veins and I could never be as accepting as she. Also, why is it that most D/s novels feature relationships like this, not completely committed? Well, besides that, I liked the book. It is very erotic, and if you are into dominance and submission, you will enjoy it.

Half a century and five editions later, this is still a standard, authoritative reference work necessary for scholars and interested non-experts alike.Under the editorship of Margaret Drabble, author and biographer (known for 'The Witch of Exmoor' and the more recently published 'The Peppered Moth'), this volume remains faithful to Harvey's intention of placing English literature in its widest possible context while exploring the deep classical and continental connections that underpin much of the history.How can literature be divorced from cultural context? Surely it cannot be -- hence the newest entries into the edition include topics that read as if they were taken from today's best-seller shelf:- Anglo-Indian Literature- Simon Armitage- Kate Atkinson- Louis de Bernieres- Censorship- Ben Elton- Gay and lesbian literature- Hypertext- A. L. Kennedy- Lad's literature- Literature of science- New Criticism- New Irish Playwrights- Carol Shields- Travel writingThis sample listing of the latest entries is representative of the more established categories, in that the entries (encyclopedic in character) include Authors, Subjects, Titles, Events, Characters and Critical Theory. The entries are unsigned (an ever-controversial practice in reference works such as this) -- well over a hundred contributors assisted in this volume, including the likes of Matthew Sweet, Salman Rushdie, Ceridwen Lloyd-Morgan, Katherine Duncan-Jones, and Brian Vickers.This volume serves the general reader well in that one may follow cross-reference trails through the text. Take, for instance, Aaron the Moor -- the reader will be directed to Titus Andronicus, to which one is directed to Shakespeare, and from there a host of other cross-references historical and modern. Under the entry of Gabriel Josipovici, one is led back the entries of Rabelais and Bellow, influences as well as objects of Josipovici's study.The appendices are new features of this edition. The first appendix is a Chronology that lists the chronology of the production of English literature from c.1000 to 1999 side by side with major historical events in Britain and beyond, and the significant events in the lives of literary figures. Appendix 2 lists the Poets Laureate in chronological order, from 1619 (when the office unofficially began) to the present -- surprisingly, there have only been 21 (19 official). Appendix 3 lists major literary award winners: Nobel Prize, Pulitzer Prize, Library Association Carnegie Medalists, and Booker-McConnell Prize for Fiction. Obviously not all of these are British authors, but it helps to place British literature in the wider world context of the twentieth century (as all of these prizes are twentieth-century creations).In addition to the encyclopedic entries, there are major essays scattered through the text. These include the following topics:- Biography- Black British Literature- Children's Literature- Detective Fiction- Fantasy Fiction- Ghost Stories- Gothic Fiction- Historical Fiction- Metre- Modernism- Post-Colonial Literature- Romanticism- Science Fiction- Spy Fiction- Structuralism and Post-StructuralismThese essays include history and current development of the genre or topic, as well as bibliographic information for further research, which (regrettably) the smaller encyclopedic entries rarely have.This is a terrific, one-volume reference that should serve well anyone with a need for quick and ready reference material. It should find a welcome home on the shelf of any avid reader, fan of literature and modern fiction, history, religion, or any devoted Anglophile."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to English Literature","review":"This is one book I turn to over and over again.

You almost imagine having to blow the dust off it before you can begin! But it is so much more rich and diverse than this and should not be avoided by those made nervous by it's title; it is not the untouchable work it sounds like it may be.If literature is a love of yours, whether by author or genre, then you will find this brilliantly informative.

The majority of their Companion books are superb, remarkably concise yet thorough works of scholarship. The English Companion is an unfortunate and surprising exception.The entry for 'New Criticism' is an efficient example of the book's shortcomings. For one thing, there's a laundry list of authors, dates, and books but very little is said of the IDEAS that characterize New Criticism. The entries are generally hamstringed by a focus on the sociopolitical and historical aspects of writers and works. The effort is laudable but inappropriate and uneconomical for a reference work. In its most extreme form, the historical emphasis goes into bizarre detail about an author's upbringing -- is it really necessary that we know where an author went to grade school and when? Entries love to entertain tales of writers' deaths and and of their insignificant travellings. I often felt as though I were reading minibiographies.One will also notice, in the case of 'New Criticism', the absence of any mention of the 'organic'. This is ridiculous and indicative of the book's lack of attention to concepts as such. There is a non-cross-referenced mention of 'organic' under Coleridge, yet even there it is only mentioned as one of his ideas, not in terms of what the theory tried to say. I would compare it to someone's asking, 'What does X mean?' This book's reply: 'X was one of so-and-so's ideas'. Too often, the response ends there. Literary theory entries are usually on the thin side, though the deconstruction essay is solid. However, even in the longest lit theory essays there is more of an emphasis on people and movements -- far less on ideas.Along with the lack of depth (or conceptual emphasis), there's little sense of the overall significance of ideas, works or characters (ironic given the attempts at a social-historical approach): Caliban is mentioned in the Tempest entry, and even gets his own paragraph elsewhere, but there's nothing about his character as it's been re-elaborated and re-invented by a long tradition of English writers (Auden, Browning, Joyce, and Wilde for starters). There's nothing about Caliban's portrayal in that tradition, nor mention of Caliban's mirror, etc. Under 'hubris' (which is found, in turn, under a terse account of 'the Poetics'), there's nothing about Icarus, nor is there anything about hubris as a specific theme in so many works.Speaking of hubris, it's baffling to me that Drabble's entry is longer than either Hill's or Heaney's. The general editor would have been better off focusing more of her energy on other writers: that expansive babbling space could have been put to stronger use had a more thorough background been given on either of those poets, among others.Readers seeking to understand why an author alludes in his work to a character or poet will be little helped by nebulous terms like 'icily poised' or 'sensuously textured', which are more suggestive of gastronomic, rather than literary, criticism. To my mind a reference's primary function should be to offer a quick source of the 'essentials' of a book or of a writer's ideas, an understanding of which would illuminate one's reading of the alluding work. While I appreciate that entries shy away from 'this or that' critiques or strict (canonical) interpretations, giving lists of facts does an injustice to the works themselves and to the way these works have been interpreted by others. (Believe it or not, people CAN come to their own conclusions even after being introduced to an opinion.)The book's scope is appropriate to literature, as literature tends to allude to so many disparate disciplines. But if one were truly trying to give an encyclopedic account of literature, the book would have to be much bigger. In this case, specialization suffers. I would have preferred a much more focused account of 'literature' as such; I'd then supplement this with other references focused, for example, on English history. One gets the sense that too many entries end up attenuated in this book.On the positive side the plot summaries are strong and more nuanced, though many entries are badly written (full of odd, obscuring, convoluted syntax). Again, good editorship would have recognized this.The book primarily succeeds as an enervated survey. Nevertheless, readers will occasionally happen upon some interesting, well-summarized topics.I'm going to check out the Cambridgean counterpart to the Oxford Companion, and I'm hoping it will give a more in-depth account of ideas and themes. The other Oxford Companions are, however, truly amazing works and deserve a close look."},{"Title":"The Oxford Companion to English Literature","review":"I teach English literature, so this book is invaluable to me, but also for anyone who watches movies based on nineteenth-century.

Interesting to the very end."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Nevada Barr's previous work, &quot;Liberty Falling&quot;, was not my favorite in the Anna Pigeon series. In my review of that book, I wondered if Barr was going to prove unable to meet the high standard of her previous excellent work.In &quot;Deep South&quot;, Nevada Barr returns to the tip-top of my list of mystery writers with whose works I want to spend time! The story is well plotted, with many lines of suspense--all of which come together in a surprising and completely whole conclusion. Add to the structural elegance of the novel the wonderful snapshots of the deep south: the good old boys, race and sexism, and the cloying sense of gentility masking a deep-seated moral decay. Then, wrap plot and social comments together with a woman as central character--who is real and human and smart and strong. And finally, add some beautiful descriptive prose. There you have it! five stars for Nevada.And by the way, that prose style deserves some of the reader's attention: as in her other novels, Barr has scenes that live on in our imaginations. Surviving a wild fire, crawling through a damp cave--these are images that stay with us after the book is finished. In &quot;Deep South&quot;, the memorable scene for me is Anna's walk through the dank, dark Southern woods without a flashlight or the moon to guide her. Sitting by a February fire in Northern Michigan, I could feel the moss and warm, damp ferns--and I was afraid."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Nevada Barr's descriptions of the people in Mississippi, at least those chirpy citizens &quot;caught in that &quot;teased-hair, fried-food time warp&quot; was vivid indeed. Anna the main character is discovering she is seeing all and sundry through her own '60's warp. Mainly through old black and white photos engrained in her memory of the civil right abuses, we all cringe at when shown on television or in a history book. Besides solving a murder, can Anna &quot;dewarp&quot; enough to solve what looks like a KKK murder?"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Nevada Barr mysteries are always enjoyable and this book is no exception. Anna takes a promotion and goes to the Natchez Trace in Mississippi. When she gets there she encounters work discrimination, harassment, alligators, predjudice, murder and love. Anna Pigeon is a great character and Nevada Barr brings her to life. This book is a great one to sit down and relax with."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"This was my second Nevada Barr book - the first I read was Hidden Truth, which I found entertaining and well written. I enjoyed this book up until the last 50 pages or so. I got the feeling that the writer was struggling with a suitable/plausible ending to an otherwise enjoyable story. It dragged on a bit and the final who-done-it & more so - why - felt weak and far fetched for such a big story.I did enjoy the info and data on the NPS, racism and sexism in the south, and the strength of the character. But perhaps the end could have included more info about topics such as did the people behind the alligator incident ever get prosecuted?"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Other reviews have done a fine job describing the book; I'll just add these few thoughts after reading this, my first Anna Pigeon book. I'm going to use this series to fill the niche formerly occupied by the great Tony Hillerman; great, that is, until his books started to go Downhillerman, turning into little more than rehashed novellas stretched to novel length through such clever tricks as extra-large fonts and margins and triple spacing between lines. This book has the same sense of atmosphere and place that made Hillerman's best books such great reads, coupled with a rich cast and pace that's both leisurely and frantic by turns. My one minor complaint with this book is the flip side of the same coin...the mystery boils down to something that is quite familiar--and obvious--to longtime Hillerman readers. Still, Barr gets there by different twists and turns, and Pigeon is such an interesting character that you don't mind much, even if you guess the end in the early going."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I gather from the jacket and some of the text that this is part of an ongoing series of books dealing with the adventures of a female forest ranger/police officer. This one's adventure consists of a job transition from the Western United States to something about as far a different environment as possible. That is, modern day Mississippi.As a stand-alone book, it's pretty good. There are two major areas of narration, the transition to a new part of the country, and a nasty murder to solve practically out of the gate. As murder mysteries go, it's OK. We find a body, track down acquaintances, and then get to figure out suspects and motive. As a murder mystery is usually a murder mystery, I always try to add what I learn about the world surrounding it as part of making it interesting. In this case, it's the world of Civil War enactors. We get just a glimpse of their world, but it's covered in much more detail, and much more interestingly in Elmore Leonards' \\"Tishomingo Blues\\".The other area is the transition. I would have liked to have seen a longer novel where this area is explored. We do get some conflicts, especially because she's a woman. But they get into the murder right away, where and this part is left at the wayside. I would imagine that the topic will be explored in more depth in \\"the further adventures\\", which would get the SERIES a four-star rating. But as this detail is lacking in this particular book, I hold it to three stars."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"The setting is the strong suit of this book. It was myfirst by this author and the reason I read it was because Ilive in Mississippi. She does some excellent descriptionsof the Trace and surrounding countryside. Some of the characters were a little unbelievable, though. My bigcomplaint is the pacing. This book really drags sometimes.Very slow beginning, nothing really happened in the first 60 pages, except the heroine moving and getting settled in Mississippi. It's not a page turner andvery easily put down. Overall, it isn't a gripping plot and a little far-fetched in the end."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Deep South is an intelligent book about life in Mississippi to an outsider, the new Park Ranger. The past haunts many of today's situations, and it is Anne Pidgeon's job to side step or fully confront many of them. Racism, sexual harrassment, and non-traditional employment is just a few of the traditions she is trying to cut through. Plenty of action, and a sound, well thought out book that flows well through the ending."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Excellent read Hard to put down-yet I was sad as I progressed in that, I would discover the answer to &quot;Who done it&quot; but I also would end this voyage into this wonderful place Barr had created-I often stopped reading in order to enjoy-in my mind-the visions and characters she had created for a few minutes longer"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"A winner. I had just travelled through the deep south when I finally picked up the newest Nevada Barr.

In fact read them all."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"This is the first novel that I have read by Nevada Barr, but I plan to &quot;go back&quot; and read the rest in this series because I really enjoyed the Anna Pigeon character. Also, the book had vivid descriptions of the area and persons surrounding the Natchez Trace which added much to the tale.Anna has just assumed a management forest service job on the Natchez Trace. She is the first woman in such a position in this area of the &quot;Deep South,&quot; and is subject to significant animosity on several fronts, especially from her two long-timer subordinates. Unfortunately, within days a local girl is found murdered in her jurisdiction, under peculiar circumstances. Along with her charming counterpart in the Sherrif's office, Anna dives into the investigation, although she has little understanding of the relationships and dynamics among the locals.This is not the most suspenseful page-turner that I have read, although the mystery remains well-concealed until the end. It is, however, a very pleasant read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"In Deep South, National Park Service ranger Anna Pigeon transfers to the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi. This is a bit of a culture shock to Anna, particularly when she discovers a strangled teenage girl with a KKK hood on the Trace. What did Anna get herself into?Author Nevada Barr continues her tale of the life and times of Anna Pigeon. This chapter in the Anna Pigeon saga was about average, but still entertaining. I now envision Ranger Pigeon as a creature of the open vistas of the West, so the narrow Trace, a job that involves a lot of vehicle time, and kudzu everywhere is a bit of a disconnect for me.BUT, as I've written before, if you want to understand the psyche of Anna Pigeon, and grow with her, then you need to read all of the books in this series, in order of their publication.Watch out for alligators, Ranger Pigeon!"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"For vacation, I picked up quite a few books that had beach and or southern themes. Out of the many I've read, Nevada Barr's Deep South is the best one so far.Anna Pigeon is a National Park Service ranger who transfers to the Natchez Trace as part of a promotion. Ranger Pigeon isn't even officially on duty when events start happening at a furious pace. The worst is that a local teenaged girl is found murdered after her prom. Anna is faced with a variety of obstacles that include nasty alligators, racism, sexism, disgruntled colleagues, a bunch of teenagers reluctant to tell the truth and southerners who dislike Yankees. Pigeon must also become acclimated to her new home, The Natchez Trace National Park, a lush, beautiful but forbidding place that doesn't give up her secrets very readily.One aspect of Barr's books that is most enjoyable is the education she gives us on the National Park Service and the parks that play key roles in her novels. The Natchez Trace is actually 444 miles, and is rich in both Native American and Civil War history. I have never visited this area, but Deep South has certainly peaked my interest.Barr's characters are also so believable. All of them are flawed in some way or another. None of them is a true hero. But most of them look into their souls and try to do the right thing. The plot was very good and Deep South ended with a bang.I've only read one other Barr novel, but I need to start seeking out her other books. She certainly has found her own niche in the mystery genre."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"This summer I discovered Anna Pigeon. In my opinion - and I only have one book of the series to read, this was the best.

A great one - and so much action!"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"and was not able to put this book down and anytime I did it called to me.

I'm delighted to see Anna back in the wilderness parks which are her specialty. New characters, a very complicated mystery, and a lot of background: if you're already a fan of Anna Pigeon, you'll love this, and if you haven't met her before, this is a good place to start. Barr captures the ambience of Mississippi perfectly, and I hope Anna stays at the Trace for a few more books. I, for one, look forward to seeing more of Rangers Stillwell, Dinkins and Thigpen, Sheriff Davidson, and of course Taco and Piedmont."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"First, I buy every Nevada Barr book in hard cover, full price, asap.Second, this one was dull and had all the mystery in the last 25 pages. One of those endings that have all the motives, clues, and details just before the wrapup last chapter. I felt that I had been needlessly buried in Mississippi mud for far too long.Third, I will undoubtedly purchase the next Barr book the minute it is published because I am hopeful that Anna's next posting will be better."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"It would appear that there is a general consensus from Nevada Barr fans that they like this book and feel it is consistent with her other novels. This being the first Nevada Barr book I have read, I can only provide prospective of an avid mystery fan.Nevada Barr clearly does a good job of putting you in the setting. You can visualize the Natchez Trace Park and the surrounding area. It is apparent that she spent the time working there and she translates her experience well.That being said, the amount of detail about the area becomes exhaustive. I found myself skimming thru pages (not paragraphs) that went into the description of the area. This made the book move slow.As far as the mystery itself, it almost plays an incidental part in the novel. The solution itself is pretty weak and only plays a key part in the last 30 pages or so. The book revolves mainly around the life and surroundings of park ranger, Anna Pigeon. This approach to the book made it very easy to put down, and I would hardly call it a page turner. The sign of a good mystery is a book that keeps you guessing and has you eager to get the next page to find out what will happen next or what clue will surface. This lacked that.If you want a book that puts you in the middle of Mississippi, with a mystery on the side then this is for you. However, if you are looking for a solid mystery book then I would suggest you move on."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I loved this book. I never saw the ending coming. It kept me on the edge. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Who better to write about the south but someone who has been there and also worked the very same job in the very same location. Nevada returns to the Mississippi Deep South, having been a ranger on the same Natchez Trace she writes about. She sets the stage for both the reader and the story by proceeding slowly and explaining some of the things that make the area as well as the job special. Newly promoted District Ranger Anna Pigeon knows her job and knows her limitations. Nevada spends some quality writing time showing the reader around the area and explaining many of the things that make the south so special and also frustrating to newly arrived Yankees.Anna Pigeon faces the challenges of not only her new job but the firm male prejudices of her two southern, somewhat lazy park rangers and many of the local folk. Anna is the new show in town and faces many challenges both good and bad.The death of a teenage girl and the attack of an aligator on her that almost cost the life of her dog are just a couple of the things she faces in her first few days.Is there anyone she can trust? Is there anybody she can count on for help? Will the \\"good ole boy\\" way of life make her give up and go home? The clock is ticking away as Anna faces southern pride, fear, and a Deep South that she doesn't understand.This is a good book well writen by Nevada Barr that is sensitive to her subject matter and her readers. The only thing I felt it could use was either more suspense or more \\"on the edge\\" of your chair action."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Anna Pigeon is on the move again - with cat Piedmont and dog Taco in tow. Her new assignment is in the Deep South of the Natchez Trace in Mississippi. Before she can even get to her new digs, she's given bad directions by a junior ranger and ends up in the Mississippi mud. Once she finds her way to ranger central, she finds herself up against bible-thumping campers, Confederate soldier re-enactors, and employees that embody the southern Bubba spirit. All the men seem to have a layer of fat and a condescending attitude towards the lady ranger. But there's no time to dwell on the obvious, because in her first day/night she encounters boys who have abandoned a drunk and blacked out teenage girl. Another drunken girl, Danni, in the woods turns out to be the victim of a heinous crime - she's got a sheet with eyeholes cut out over her head and a noose around her neck. Is it redneck villians? Disgruntled boyfriends? A black-on-white crime? Nothing is slow as molasses as Anna fights off a gator who bites off one dog's leg, as she meets the victim's psycho mother, as she is endangered by the Bubbas who don't want to work for a lady ranger, and when she finds out about the local homosexual lover's point. There's the handsome and sexy policeman...but there's also his wife on her doorstep. Throw in the story of Grant's soldiers who disappeared during the Civil War, and a horrific attack on Anna, and you've got another Nevada Barr page-turner that will keep you up all night!"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"This book enthralled me and kept me coming back for more.Maybe it was the fact that it is set in the most \\"southern\\" part of the south. Being from the south myself I am both fascinated and angered by the attitudes and ideas that are still fostered in this part of the nation to this day. Seeing it all through the eyes of a newcomer provided desires ranging from the need to pitch the book across the room to a near sadness that there are people that still think and feel in such a bigoted and hateful way.The mystery is excellent! Twisting and turning so that, just when you think you have the murder pegged, a wrench is thrown in the works and you have to start figuring it out again.I would highly recommend this book. It is in a wonderful series. (It was the first Nevada Barr book I had read and prompted me to start the series.) It can be read in or out of sequence with the rest of the series, as it does not rely on foundations of past books.A must read for any mystery fan and/or seeker of \\"The Real South\\""},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I've enjoyed every Nevada Barr mystery I've read, which is all of them except for &quot;Blind Descent.&quot; &quot;Deep South&quot; is no exception. In fact, it's one of my favorite entries in the Anna Pigeon series, even though I've never been farther south than Virginia and am a native of California who's always lived there. I've enjoyed the other novels immensely with their predominant western venues, but one of the joys of reading about Anna Pigeon's adventures in law enforcement as a U.S. National Park Ranger is the vicarious experience of traveling and experiencing new places. Nevada Barr is excellent at making the reader feel as if he or she were actually there.In &quot;Deep South,&quot; we readers get to have an experience of the southern portion of the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi. Some interesting characters are introduced -- people who make Anna's professional life interesting, positively and negatively, as she has assumed a management position in a completely unfamiliar park venue and a part of the country that is utterly new to her.The plot is specific to the place and reveals much about local residents who live in towns and cities adjacent to the Trace. If I have a complaint at all, it's that Anna is subject once again to great injury and this time I found it upsetting. I had to put the book down and tell myself, &quot;This is fiction. Anna Pigeon is not a real human being.&quot; I came to realize is that I wish she were a real human being.One of the best parts of this book is the introduction of a new character who looks to be a promising love interest for Anna, someone she actually deserves who deserves her, too. We shall see in forthcoming books what happens in this regard as Anna progresses through her 40s.Read &quot;Deep South&quot; and you'll feel the heat and humidity, experience aspects good and bad of Southern culture and politics, and learn the obvious truth that racism there, while firmly entrenched and prevalent, isn't universal.Nevada Barr writes this novel very convincingly as she ought to -- her most recent post as a ranger with the National Park Service was on the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi and even though she's now working as a novelist, she still lives in that state."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"What a difference a year makes!When we last saw Anna Pigeon, she was way up north in New York helping to solve a murder mystery at the Statue of Liberty. Now, here she is way down south in Mississippi doing what she does best, solving another murder mystery.Anna Pigeon has a new job and a new place to hang her hat, the Natchez Trace Parkway. Being the new district ranger is one thing, but being a woman and being a yankee makes her new job all the more difficult. (Personally, I think the other rangers were all just a little nervous because it seems whatever park Anna goes to, be it Mesa Verde, Isle Royale, Guadalupe Mountain, or Carlsbad, someone always winds up dead!) To make matters worse, a young girl is found dead in the park with a white sheet over her head, and a noose around her neck. Unraveling this mystery is going be as difficult as untangling the Kudzu vines that grow throughout the park!An excellent book! Full of beautiful imagery and descriptions of the deep south. I just hope that Anna licks her wounds and returns to action real soon!"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I have read half a dozen of the Anna Pigeon books in the past year or so. I find that Barr's greatest talent is description of the places where the books take place and, presumably where she has worked. Last year, a few weeks after I had the pleasure of my first visit to Mesa Verde in more than 30 years, I read the book set in that park. It was like being back. I kept thinking \\"yeah, I was at that place\\" and \\"yeah, it really is that spectacular\\".However, I am reviewing this book which is set on the Natchez Trace. I had never thought of northern Mississippi as exactly scenic, although my parents used to make a point of driving the Trace as often as they could on their way from Texas to visit us in Tennessee. In this book, Barr's description of the beauty of a velvet spring night on the Trace is beautiful. Downright lyrical. My hat's off to the lady for that bit of writing.Aside from Barr's ability to evoke the beauty of a place and make me think I might want to go there, I think her skills as a mystery writer are just fair to middling. I must admit that she is good at not telegraphing the identity of the villain. However, I am getting tired of the \\"Perils of Pauline\\" act. Her formula seems to be to almost get her character killed shortly after the beginning of the book. This is usually before the character figures out that something bad may be going on. Then, near the end, she does it again. More often than not, the second near death experience is due to some incredible stupidity on Anna's part. A real police officer who was that careless that often in dangerous situations would long since be dead. Such, of course, is fiction. Mark Twain was quoted as saying something like \\"Truth is stranger than fiction because fiction has to make sense.\\" Well, not always. If you let the law of averages catch up with your main character, then you have to either invent a new character or stop writing.Some of the political correctness is getting old. In every second or third book, she creates a lesbian character or two who are candidates for sainthood. Of course, this is customary for homosexual characters, male and female, in other parts of the entertainment media including Hollywood. All that sweetness and light makes me yearn for the character Sharon Stone played in \\"Basic Instinct\\". Speaking of sweetness and light, the only female character I have so far seen who is up to her ears in the evil and the murder is in Barr's recent book set in Yosemite. In the rest of those of her books that I have read, the bad guys are exactly that -- guys. No Lady Macbeths here.All in all, the Anna Pigeon books are a pretty good read, especially the parts about the scenery, and contain enough meat to keep me occupied. I just picked up a paperback at the used book store that I think is set in Carlsbad Caverns. It will help to while away the flying hours on my next business trip. I loved Carlsbad. However, the idea of getting off the beaten path, crawling through narrow cracks, and maybe getting trapped gives me the creeps. Claustrophobia city."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Just a short review. While I usually enjoy the Anna Pigeon novels, I've got to say that this one was slightly more of a misfire than not. The mystery itself -- the brutal murder of a Mississippi girl on the Natchez Trace National Parkway -- is interesting, but the big problem with the book is that its resolution felt rushed and disappointing, as if Ms. Barr was more interested in the story of Anna's personal life than the raison d'etre of her mystery series. Still, it is an Anna Pigeon novel, and Barr's titular heroine is as endearing as ever, and that more than makes up for the book's shortcomings.Deep South isn't the best of the series, but it is an entertaining enough read to occupy a lazy afternoon with."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"This book was great. I loved trying to figure out the crime, and also, about reading about Mississippi. Now, I need to order another one!"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"This was a great book. Portrayed in the South, Anna is new to the South with lots to learn. In her typical style she accidently stumbles on a murder and the whole book revolves around her solving the mystery in her courageous fumbling style. She battles teenagers, men that don't like women in positions of power, gators and manages to just hedge a little romance too. Again portrays her smartness, persistence, but vulnerability. You will love this one."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"\\"Deep South\\" and \\"Hunting Season\\" are both set in Natchez Trace National Parkway. This is one of those units of the National Park system that nobody ever thinks of, but it takes up a 450-miles stretch from southwestern border of Mississippi through the northeastern border and up to Nashville. Because it's a strip of parkway, it is far more a part of the community than many other national parks.As a result, the fact that Anna is a \\"ranger\\" in a \\"national park\\" seems beside the point in this book. She is a Yankee law enforcement officer who finds herself in an unfamiliar world. Some of this world consists of Yankee stereotypes of the South: good old boys, racists, pickup trucks and football. Other characters emerge as real people.Anna arrived in this park with a promotion to management. Her introduction to management is a nightmare; one of her two rangers is a real nightmare, a lazy, sexist, hostile, lawsuit-prone loser. His forms of resistance are so well drawn that they must be based on some people in Nevada Barr's own past as a ranger.The murder victim is a high school student on prom night. As a result, much of the plot involves talking to the victim's friends. Ranger Pigeon, like Nevada Barr, has no kids. The world of high school is therefore mystifying to Ranger Pigeon - and to Nevada Barr. As a result, some parts of the school world are not drawn very convincingly.The ending of this book left me cold, with a number of loose ends summarized very drily. It reminded me of those movies with text at the end saying things like, \\"Joe ended up as a real estate agent in Wichita, while Mary went back to college in Texas.\\" Stretching this out a little would have left me with a more satisfied feeling at the end.That said, this is a good entry in the Anna Pigeon series, even one of the better ones. If you have enjoyed any of the other books in the series, you certainly want to read this one."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I confess to being a sporadic Nevada Barr fan. I've loved some of her earlier books, but have not enjoyed her last few. As a native Mississippian who has always loved the pastoral beauty and sense of history of the Natchez Trace, I had high hopes for her latest title. Happily, I was not disappointed. She has captured both the beauty and complexity of Mississippi and her people in a way few authors have."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Attitude not miles counts when measuring the distance between Colorado's Mesa Verde National Park and the Port Gibson District of the Natchez Trace Parkway. Federal Park law enforcement official Anna Pigeon learns that lesson when she accepts a promotion transfer to the South. However, Anna soon learns that the &quot;ole boy&quot; network still thrives in the South, especially when she concludes that her all male deputies resent working for a mere female. Their sexism reaches dangerous proportions when they refuse to provide Anna back up during a potentially emergency situation.Anna's sense of oppression fully surfaces when someone kills a teenage white girl following the prom. The victim was stomped to death. A white sheet with slits cut out for the eyes covered her face. A rope hung loosely around her neck. Someone made it look like the work of the KKK. As she begins her investigation into the racially charged crime, Anna learns how deep hatred flows in the hearts and souls of some bigots.Surprisingly, DEEP SOUTH has a literary feel that counterbalances the repulsive almost overwhelming loathing that is the creed of some of the characters. This juxtaposition adds chilling drama to a well-designed mystery. Anna's adjustment to her new home augments the tense story line by her battle with racism and sexism. Nevada Barr condemns the rural south for its deep-rooted prejudices, even as the author applauds the fact that discrimination is more in the open than the de facto segregation of most of the rest of the country. The openness and honest feelings allows Anna to deal with anything thrown her way. The social commentary cleverly wraps inside an excellent police procedural without slowing down the main plot.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Set in Mississippi, this is a great fun book.

Her plotting is also excellent and I'll look forward to reading more of her works.I found this book in a discount bin and decided to give it a shot.

Barr does a good job of combining the mystery genre elements with realistic characters and well-crafted writing. She delivers a book with rare entertainment value. I had trouble putting Deep South down to go to sleep.One of the best things about Deep South is the way in which it delivers the comfort points of a cozy while still bringing home the realities of the death and pain involved. Too much of the time the victims in a mystery novel are nothing more than excuses to explore the world of the detective. Barr makes us feel the death of Danni Posey, and gives us the feeling that the (emotional and physical) stakes are truly high for Anna. I also like that Barr does not shrink from tackling some of the tough non-murder related elements of Anna and her new life in Mississippi.Recommended for all mystery fans. I will be reading further in this series."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I found this the most engrossing of the Anna Pidgeon mysteries, almost Literature in the scope of its concerns. There's more depth of characterization here and a totally convincing atmosphere of nature's thick menace to match the hostility of the good ol' employees under her new supervision. The author's fulsome nature description should be expected since Mississippi is Barr's home, but the fuller characterization may stem from the fact that Anna is running out of time for a solid love interest, as well as due to the extreme violence to which she is subjected. Only one of these terrible episodes is necessary to the plot, the other is gratuitous and features animal cruelty. My only complaint is that the conclusion is rushed and its tension drooping (or limp from the heat? :-)Barr has a light touch but is not frivolous with her heroine or with death (unlike, for example, some of Sharyn McCrumb's Appalachian Scots stories). Barr is good at letting you build up a picture of the suspects (and she subtly make everyone so), then have Anna yank you into something else with a tiny new fact, and then do it again. That should keep you on your toes! This story has everything: prejudice, murder, kids, alligators, Civil War, crazies, punks, a cat and dog, and several cases of maybe-its-love."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"This time Anna is assigned to the Natchez Trace national park as a ranger-in-charge. But it's the first time the park has had a female ranger-in-charge and Anna finds her two fellow-rangers scheming to make her job hell. And to make it worse a young girl is murdereed in the park and Anna must find the killer.One thing I've always found that sets Ms. Barr's mysteries apart from others is her writing. Her prose is lyrical. It simply flows. Her characterization is very good along with her dialogue. The plots may be a little unformed but all in all this whole series is good and consistent. I recommend any of the mysteries in this series."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"All of Nevada Barr's books are extremely atmospheric (I still feel claustrophobic when I think about the Lechugilla Cave in &quot;Blind Descent&quot;) and &quot;Deep South&quot; is no exception. Barr's descriptions of April in the southern end of the Natchez Trace are alternately lovely as she describes the spring beauty of the landscape, and cloying as she writes about the pervasive, encompassing growth. This is a terrific mystery story, expertly told with clues and red herrings woven skillfully throughout the text.I feel compelled to respond to the previous reviewer who wrote of &quot;slogging&quot; through yet another Anna Pigeon mystery. Life is too short to slog through books written about characters or by writers you already know you don't like. Anna does have numerous friends, male and female, but even if she didn't, why does it matter that she has a close friendship with her older sister? I only wish I was as close with my sister. And so what if she likes to drink? There are far worse personal habits then a glass or two of wine in the evening. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the Nevada Barr books, Anna is an intelligent, tough and compassionate character. I personally would have picked fellow district ranger Steve Stilwell over Sheriff Paul Davidson, but hey, no one's perfect. I also liked the peace/piece joke on page 276 as well as the bit where Taco is described as a &quot;tourist.&quot;"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"In this book, Nevada Barr makes up for the lack of atmosphere in her previous book, Liberty Falling. Using nature as a backdrop is what Barr does best. She evokes a real sense of the swampy atmosphere of the Natchez Trace and uses a lot of humor to describe Anna Pigeon's reactions to this new locale. Anna has taken on an administrative position in the park service for the first time and a lot of the book is dedicated to her discomfort over her new role. She also has a lot of interesting interactions with her new co-workers who strive to upset this lady carpetbagger who has descended on them. I applaud this return to the outdoor venue and I enjoyed every page. To me, this is one of the best books of this series."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"\\"Deep South\\" is Nevada Barr at her best. The lush imagery, the pervasive humid heat, quirky characters wrap around this story like the ever-present kudzu. Anna Pigeon may say she feels most at home in the high deserts of the southwest, but she has a strong feel for the south. Her affectionate, good-humored descriptions of teenage girls in Mississippi are priceless. Try as she might, she's too much in the know to be a yankee!The story has a good pace and never lags. Her characters are sharply drawn (as usual, a few too many). Anna's predicaments are well imagined and briskly carried out. You will be amazed at Anna's recuperative powers that surpass the toughest of the hard-core detectives. I hereby nominate \\"Deep South\\" for my Scariest-Scene-of-the-Year Award: the alligator in the carport. I was hyperventilating and muttering to myself.I withheld the fifth star because the motivation was a little confusing. Maybe she had one twist and turn too many. If you haven't read Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon series, \\"Deep South\\" is a good place to begin."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I have read all of Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon series, and have yet to be disappointed. Ms. Barr's novels are always fresh and fun. Anna Pigeon being a park ranger opens the world to this series. Some series get stale because the hero doesn't have the opportunity to change and grow because of the environment. Not so with Anna Pigeon, Ms. Barr does an excellent job of taking you places that the average person does not think about or understand. The author does a wonderful job of explaining these great places in America. This book is no exception. Ms. Barr has a great mystery in this book, with lots of \\"red herrings\\". Reveling the killer and why only in the last few pages. Caught me off guard. All the ends tied up making perfect sense to the reader and plot. Not withstanding a very good mystery, what makes Ms. Barr's stories so fun too is her descriptions of the environment and people. The author beautifully describes the nature of this part of America. I felt that I was there experiencing right along with Anna. The Anna Pigeon series is a very fun read. I always look forward to the next installment. Wondering where Nevada Barr is going to take me next. I know that it will be a fun experience. Read them all, I think you will enjoy yourself and wish that you had started earlier."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I've read all of the Anna Pigeon mysteries by Nevada Barr and this one takes the cake. Anna makes her first permanent move to a new park, the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi, a far cry from her dry yet beautiful Mesa Verde home. From the first chapter in the book where she gets lost due to the bogus directions of a bitter new coworker, I could tell this book would be different from the rest -- a little less comfortable, a little more edgy. The South is a world of it's own and Anna is thrown into it all alone. Her subordinates are cagey, fat-assed, greasy-food-loving couch potatoes. The park is hot, steamy, dark and full of fast-growing kudzu vines. Even the land itself seems to sink in upon itself as if nothing is certain. No one can be trusted. Having just finished Blind Descent (a previous Anna novel) and reading about the death of a long-time friend Frieda, I thought I was safe for a while from having to endure really emotional content. Wrong, totally wrong. Anna comes up against even more heart-pounding and soul-wrenching events in this book as well. What's next? Killing off the cat? Geesh, give a lady a break. If anyone needs it, it's Anna. She's beaten and pummelled, left with a handicapable dog, and a possibly divorced love interest. Too bad we don't get to read about her taking a trip to Aruba with said love interest and thereby repairing both body and soul. Nope. If I have one complaint about this novel is that there wasn't more. What happens with the new love? At least he's better than previous love-interest Frederick. Will we see this new love again or are we going to be following Anna off on adventure after adventure in other parks? The yet-to-be published Hunting Season will be the one to watch."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Nevada Barr does not disappoint in this, her latest Anna Pigeon adventure. She doesn't just tell you about the deep south, she takes you there. Her descriptions bring not only the landscape to life, but the characters as well. This is one of those books you wish would never end."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Nevada Barr's Deep South was a great read. The characters were compelling, the story was intriguing, and her style was first class. I love her unique way with words to describe events, objects, and people so vividly.I also enjoyed the depth of her assessment of the culture of the deep south. As a native, I found it fascinating to read her outsider's interpretations of our culture, and I was amazed that she was fair and insightful. That's seldom the case. She didn't jump at stereotypes, but did a fair analysis and presentation of the good and the bad. That's worth reading!Her characters had depth and were realistic. It was one of our book club's favorite reads over several years."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I read her book Burning and liked it. I think in comparison this book wasn't as appealing to me. I find the characters in this book interesting. I felt the plot was resolved a little too efficiently. I commend her in including difficult topics in her stories. It makes them interesting to read and relevant. I would recommend this book to people who like police type mysteries."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Well written, very exciting, loved the history of the Natchez Trace area.

The writing makes you see the park through the eyes of someone who loves and respects the land. Ranger Anna, lives for all the different parks she works in.

I can visit all of the parks through Nevada Barr, if I dont' get there on my own."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I was entranced with Nevada Barr's DEEP SOUTH. Talk about sense of place....In each book, Anna Pigeon is working at a different National Park. Here, she's in the Natchez Trace in Mississippi, and one can feel the heat and see the flora and fauna. The story almost disappears into the locale, but the murder of a high school girl is still the focal point of the story. Don't try to read this in the summertime, unless your air conditioner really works well."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Too much time wasted on nature descriptions and too little on building suspense. Also, I've read several Anna Pigeon novels now and find her a very depressing character. She hates people and has absolutely no sense of humor. Plus, there are no women in the book besides Pigeon. She's a loner which makes her a difficult character to like. I don't know...it's just not for me."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Nevada Barr has successfully added yet another chapter to the ever increasing canon of prejudice towards the South. The descriptions of the landscape are the only worthwhile part of this bigoted travesty; apparently, her perspective of Natchez never adjusted from the watchtower she occupied as a park ranger there. I did not read her last book -- set in New York -- but did it have any descriptions of &quot;plunger justice,&quot; or is that now considered socially acceptable. I suggest Ms Barr stay with what she understands and write a book on botany."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I'm a very fast reader, easily starting and finishing a book within a day or two. I bought this book, along with another Anna Pidgeon book, back in June, and have been trying since then to get any further than the third chapter in either book. I pick up the books, start them, plug through the first chapter, make myself get through the second, and by the third chapter both books are being laid back down. Over Christmas I found myself with no book to read, so out of desperate boredom, I picked up Deep South, again, and was determined to finish it.I did finish the book, and I know I'll never read another book written by Nevada Barr. This is an author who literally writes her stories to death. Every sentence takes the long way around, and so often by the time I finished reading a paragraph I'd have to just go back and read it again, forcing myself to hold onto that long winding train of thought.Descriptive writing is good, it's a talent, but there's a definite line at which you cross over into utter tediousness. There were also small inconsistencies, which immediately lowered my expectations of this writer, for example, when describing the hood over the body's head, Ms. Barr writes about only the nose and part of a cheek being visible. Then, a few paragraphs later she writes \\"...and she hoped there was a head under there!\\"...well, if the nose and a cheek were visible then it's obvious there WAS indeed a head under that hood! Slip ups like that, slight as they may be, cause me to lose respect for the writing.Anyway...sometimes a sentence, or a paragraph, can be presented simply and directly and have far more effect than a sentence or paragraph that is overstocked, crammed jammed full of descriptions and qualifiers and adjectives and nouns and pronouns and verbs and adverbs and...well, you get the point.As I said before, this author literally writes her stories to death."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I've recently finished listening to the Recorded Books (unabridged) version of this work with narration by Barbara Rosenblat. She does a fine job transfering the dialect from the printed page to the human ear, not an easy task. I am not one very much attracted to works of fiction, largely because I find it difficult to imagine an individual really going through the experiences reported. This is what I felt in the story by Navada Barr. While she paints some interesting pictures of life in Mississippi, it seemed to me to be a bit unrealistic that Anna would get into so much trouble is such a short time frame. To have to deal with a murder, troublesome teens, a possible love affair and old civil war fans in the first week on the job seemed a bit much for me. As skilled as she may have been at her former post in Colorado, it is hard to imagine that the National Park Service would toss her into this new position without some kind of orientation to those things expected of her.I am sure Barr has great ability in using descriptive language but perhaps should use that talent in travel books, not mystery novels."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I love mysteries, series mysteries, Female leads, nature, animals..yet once again I was reminded why I hate the Nevada Barr series as I slogged thru &quot;Deep South&quot;!What a drag...stereotypes, cliches...and a thoroughly unlikeable character in Anna Pigeon. The line about her &quot;bureaucratic clock&quot; ticking was one of the few funny parts of the book ...but it essentially reminds us what a government worker Anna is...I had the feeling she is truly just putting in her time. Reading this book is about as boring as reading bureaucratic handbooks!I strongly disliked the plot too...too many suspects, red herrings, and the final &quot;motive&quot; in the last chapter did not ring true...when the corpse is a young teenage girl, I would expect a more serious plot/motive...there was no real motive here...I also despised the gratuitous maiming of the dog...and the fact that the culprit in that maiming was named, yet apparently nothing was being done about his crime.Anna's battle with the wine bottle was distasteful; very other little info is given about her other than her obsession with wine. We have no idea what sort of food, music, movies, she likes.....I agree with other reviewers that Anna has NO friends, no other woman character except for her phone conversations with her sister...she doesn't like much...and frankly I don't like HER or these books!"},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"She started the story and based it across the border in the beautiful country of North Carolina. She must have seen the Phoenix here and decided to turn it into an exclusive spa. With the help of a few friends, her hard labor proved to be dynamite. The Phonenix, contrary to the one located on Gay Street, is an upscale spa for the rich and famous. The scene of five murders, this time the characters are all interrelated, which is uncovered in the final chapter. It was all rather convoluted, being the artistic endeavors of thirteen prominent writers, each for one chapter. This is the result of a project to copy the serial novels of the Thirties in which Agatha Cristie was involved. In 'Agatha,' the movie, she was incognito \\"shadowing\\" her nemesis in a steam room in England about the same time she was writing such (living a dream). Our Phoenix building downtown has been renovated into high priced condos for strange folks who moved here and think it is novel to live on the main street of this town. No Spa there, however, you have to go to Powell to the Fitness Center to find the hot tub and steam room.The Phoenix in this story in segments is a place of myster with drugs, adoptions, murders all involved until the Chapter 13 which explains all in detail to the survivors who are all family, interrelated in a weird way. \\"A family, rising phoenixlike from the ashes.\\" Caroline thanked God for bringint this man into her life; Tennessee congressman Doug Blessing with some secrets of his own. She hadd not \\"forced her way to freedom\\" because of an anticipated \\"need for Doug's more delicate plumbing.\\" This written by a mystery writer as opposed to a romance novelist who would be more explicit. Just a slightly different way of phrasing, which I always used in the book reviews I gave to the literary club -- it was fun to confuse those who weren't napping. The Phoenix had a mud room with its own secret stash.Some of the gathering of strong personalities include the beautiful made model (Adonis), the kinky actress, the green-haired rock star who went through N.A., the detective Toscana who sometimes acted like God (\\"and Toscana saw that it was good.\\"), Dante, t he masseur, and Geoff, the assitant pastry chef. The sociopathic personality responsible for the deaths had no conscience, and was evil with no sense of honor. Knowledge was her weapon. A person can only ask, to be granted a wish for anything.Led by Nevada Barr based this confusing story showing how a character can be killed in a spa. I review another book wherin the pivotal chatacter was killed in the steam room of the notel spa shortly before his scheduled assignation with the main person. So, this premise is nothing new, nor the format. What is different is t he freedom of each of these authors to develop their own characters and circumstances leading to the next sequence of unusual, never-thought-of-before things a client could do at this exclusive Phoenix Spa. This serial format started in 1931 with 'The Floating Admiral' which was serialized in England.

She's accepted a supervisory position, and that makes being her new park's first female ranger all the more difficult - a fact brought home when a practical joke (so-called) played by one of her new subordinates gets her dangerously lost before she even arrives. Her first night in her new home, a rented NPS house, is interrupted by a camper's noise complaint that leads her to track down a frightened, drunken teenaged girl, a refugee from the local high school's prom. The next morning, the county sheriff comes looking for another young girl who went missing after the same prom; and a second search of the surrounding woods turns up that girl's murdered body. So begins the sort of murder mystery that a ranger wouldn't normally be called upon to solve. For Anna that difficult task is complicated, repeatedly, by hostility and lack of support from her staff. This hostility and lack of support more than once places her in danger, and it comes close to costing her the life of a beloved pet. Ultimately it could cost her own life, too, as this taut thriller moves toward its climax; and as Anna's attraction to the county sheriff, an Episcopal priest whose religious side baffles her, grows ever stronger.This is my first Anna Pigeon novel, and I'm hooked. A strong female protagonist who's complicated and conflicted, other characters also well drawn, an intriguing setting and a decent plot - I need to catch up on the earlier books in this series, for sure.--Reviewed by Nina M.

Unlike many series, the change of locale to different national parks and Anna's quirky personality make each book hard to put down. Without too many references to past books in the series, it keeps readers like myself who read the books in order (just a teensy bit OCD!) engaged, while not making a first-time reader feel like they're lost.I love her plot twists. And her portrayal of Anna's personal situation during different decades - the 20's, 30's, 40's and now pushing the 50's in this book, are easy for a woman of a certain age to relate to.I can hardly wait to finish one and start the next.

It is set on the Natchez Trace, just down the road a bit from where I live, and the scenic route down to Natchez. With the recent great flood of 2011, Highway 61 was cut for some period of time, and this was an alternate route from Vicksburg to Natchez, taking Highway 27 from Vicksburg to the intersection with the Trace.Anna Pigeon has started a new job as District Ranger on the south end of the Natchez Trace, from Interstate 20 down to Natchez. On her first official day on the job, she discovers the body of a murder victim. It had been prom night at Clinton High School, and one girl never made it back home. The main part of the novel investigates possible suspects and motives. At the same time Anna is dealing with internal personel problems in the ranger district. You can guess at some of the motives, and there are some clues along the way.

Punchy from lack of sleep, it doesn't take Anna long to find trouble in the form of a drunken teenage girl. She takes the girl in and returns her to her parents, thinking all is quiet until another teen girl turns up missing, and then dead. 16-year-old Danielle Posey is found in the woods with her head bashed in, wearing a KKK-style hood.

Anna pieces prom night clues together while musing introspectively about everything around her. When she finally pieces it all together, she finds herself in harm's way and winds up fighting for her life.Like the other Anna Pigeon mysteries, this one sort of ambles along through Anna's mind, all the while drawing us into a complex cast of characters, compelling intrigue, and a touch of danger. This is a nice piece of the ongoing tale of Ranger Anna Pigeon as her life takes a new turn, but would serve just as well standing alone.

When the book opens, Anna is on her way to the Natchez Trace Parkway, which runs from Jackson to Natchez, Mississippi. There, she will assume the reins of district ranger in a land still fraught will male chauvinism and general distrust of females.Nothing daunted (but secretly afraid of the very different flora and fauna--eg, gigantic spiders), Anna makes her way to her new job, along with her complaining cat Piedmont, and her dog Taco, a golden retriever in previous books who has suddenly morphed into a black lab (Barr's editor apparently doesn't know the difference). No matter. Once on the Trace, Anna is hit full force with two disgruntled male subordinates who refuse to accept her authority, a handsome sheriff who makes her hard heart flutter, a group of Civil War buffs who stage re-enactments in Anna's territory--and a murder.Barely able to unload her Rambler (which has mysteriously morphed from her much-loved Honda--another editorial boo boo) of her worldly possessions, Anna finds herself immersed in the particularly nasty murder of Danielle Posey, a popular high school senior, whose beaten body is found in the wilderness tied to a tree and draped in a crudely makeshift Ku Klux Klan hood. Anna is thrown into the tangled web of the murdered girl's life and a mystery as thick as the fast-growing kudzu that blankets the region.There are plenty of suspects from which to choose, from the high school's star quarterback, who was Danielle's prom date, to a mysterious and possibly mythical lover, to Danielle's own brother, an avowed racist who would love nothing better than to create an issue where none exists. The deeper the mystery, the more suspects. Anna struggles to make sense of the murder while also trying to settle in to her new cottage, her new life, her hostile office--and an alligator in her carport.There is not a false step in this intriguing, fast-paced mystery. The thicker the plot, the more the reader is rooting for Anna to solve the case. I did not guess the murderer OR the motive until Anna did. It all made sense when the pieces were put together, but I had no clue beforehand, and that's the best kind of mystery.As always, Barr's description of Anna's habitat is mesmerizing. In this case, since Barr herself was (and possibly still is) a ranger on the Natchez Trace, the descriptions are particularly evocative. I found myself smelling the hot, sultry, lazy Mississippi air along with Anna, and reaching for the air-conditioner for relief along with her. Anna Pigeon remains a thoroughly likeable and all-too-human heroine, and I look forward to reading the next in the series."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"I've read all of Nevada Barr's books and couldn't put this one down.

I picked it up expecting another superficial portrayal of the South--little factual information, cookie cutter stereotyped characters. I was pleasantly surprised. Barr shows an indepth knowledge of the location and environment she has chosen as the setting for her latest novel. I was amused by the culture shock Anna suffered--which one would expect from someone arriving in southern Mississippi from Mesa Verde! Barr's local characters all sound like people I may have met in my daily life in Mississippi. Men skeptical of working women, girls preoccupied with sex and beauty pageants, young men for whom a football scholarship is a ticket to a better life--these are real people. My one complaint about Barr's characters is the lack of development other than the heroine. I have read two of her novels and noticed the same in Liberty Falling. Also, the lack of any significant female character other than Pigeon makes the story seem somewhat artifical.Overall, an entertaining story in a setting that I found interesting."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"Having lived in in the south all my life & in Mississippi for a space of years, I found Nevada Barr's insight into the mentality of the south amazingly accurate ...having read many of her books I had made the mistake of *assuming* that she was from the southwest due to the accuracies there ... I was surprised to read that she is from Mississippi .. This book with it treatment of the racial situation twisted throughout the murder investigation with Ms Barr's other typical twists & turns to keep you guessing made this, for me, one of her best so far .. I bought my last two books by her based on her name alone ... immediately after finishing this one I ordered 5 more ... In my opinion she is one of the finest writers of this genre around today."},{"Title":"Deep South","review":"As a mystery writer whose works take place almost entirely in the American Southwest, I admire the geographic diversity of Nevada Barr's series. Anna Pigeon has solved murders along the Great Lakes, in the western forests, in New York City, and in several other regions. In DEEP SOUTH, one can guess where Anna is now assigned. She's in Mississippi, and she has finally accepted a promotion. She also finds a dead prom queen. We know she will struggle to solve this homicide. The mystery is first-rate, and Ms. Barr continues with her excellent character development. Her scenic descriptions shine, as does her descriptions of contemporary life in Mississippi. Terrific book all around."},{"Title":"The Systems Thinking Approach to Strategic Planning and Management","review":"As a person who is responsible for corporate planning for my company, I found this book extremely helpful in putting ideas and thoughts into structure, and thus able to approach strategic planning and management in a more systematic manner.

Part Two looks at the art by region where you see the similarities and contrasts of tribes within a geographically relevant part Africa. This is a hard book to put down...every time."},{"Title":"Art of Africa","review":"Over the past 16 years or so, I have become an avid African arts enthusiasts, especially when it comes to establishing meaningful research and reference material.There remains very little doubt that \\"art\\" of this nature attracts a cult following with an insatiable quest for books displaying beautiful and glaring photographic images. Certainly, there is not much interest about the religious and cultural aspects that was the motive behind the creation of the relics in the first place. Tragically, this continues to cause incorrect perceptions that may never be untangled.I would categorize Jacques Kerchache's ART OF AFRICA as more of a comprehensive \\"general dictionary\\" of black African tribal art.What I enjoy most about this book is the way it provides a descriptive summary about the ethnic groups cited within each chapter includes;1... Info about \\"where\\" and \\"how\\" they lived.2... Significant traditions and core values (as points of interest).3... There are also several older and smaller black & white photos of the people themselves.This book was an obvious reference standard when published.

Henry Adams has multiple scores to settle, on behalf of John Adams and John Quincy Adams (his great-grandfather and grandfather, respectively), with John Randolph of Roanoke (who never had a kind word for either of the Adams presidents). The reader would be strongly advised to read both the introduction by Robert McColley, as well as the notes on the text (located at the end of the book) which deals with specific matters of interpretation in the book.Adams uses this book to savage Randolph at every opportunity. The bulk of the book follows Randolph in his congressional career up through 1806, when he broke with the Jefferson administration over the administration's attempt to pay France two million dollars to secure Western Florida from Spain. Up until 1806, as Adams puts it, Randolph was the \\"spoiled child of his party and recognised mouthpiece of the administration.\\" (p. 118) Randolph was in the thick of things up to that point, including the Louisiana Purchase, the approval of which he helped shephard through the House of Representatives. He was also given the responsibility for the February 1805 impeachment of Samuel Chase, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. At that point in history, the question of the Executive Branch's authority over the Judicial Branch was far from settled. A successful prosecution of Justice Chase might well have changed the history of Executive-Judicial relations, but Randolph botched the job thoroughly. Adams can barely contain his glee when describing how unequal to the task Randolph was.The bungled Chase impeachment increasingly made Randolph an embarrassment to the Jefferson administration. Randolph's political prospects were damaged beyond repair after 1806, and from that point on, as he became increasingly erratic, was on the periphery of the American political scene. He quarrelled, at one point or another, with every administration from Jefferson to Andrew Jackson. Adams devotes only 70 pages to Randolph's life from 1806 until his death in 1833. It is evident at this point that Adams is more interested in directing criticism at Jefferson and his successors in the Virginia Dynasty than he is at studying the life of Randolph.Adams does make good points in his book, especially regarding the notions of states' rights. Coventional wisdom holds that Randolph was one the early advocates of the states' rights philosophy that John C. Calhoun subsequently embraced, but Adams argues persuasively that actions such as the Louisiana Purchase and the protection by the federal government of slavery (such as the Fugitive Slave Act) were in themselves encroachments on the rights of individual states and helped further the centralization of government in the United States. Far from being a traditional states' rights advocate, Adams contends, Randolph did a great deal to undermine the notion of states' rights as it existed in 1789.Despite the rather venomous nature of the book, it is none the less a wonderful piece of literature that is worth reading. Adams' skills as a writer are evident throughout. The three stars represents a dual rating: 5 stars for the quality of the writing, 1 star for the utter lack of objectivity...although what could the reader seriously expect anyway?"},{"Title":"John Randolph (American statesmen)","review":"John Randolph was a Jeffersonian Republican and a Virginian to the manor born. He was a virulent political opponent of John Adams and John Quincy Adams. The author of this biography was Henry Adams, great-grandson and grandson of the two Massachusetts presidents. The Adamses and the Randolphs could hardly have been more dissimilar in politics, religion, and every other important influence upon one's outlook on life. In sum, Henry Adams is not an unbiased biographer of John Randolph. Henry Adams skewers this Virginia eccentric and Randolph made it easy.[ADDENDUM: I need to revise my estimation of Henry Adams's potential bias. See the Garry Wills book (link below) for a discussion of Henry Adams attitude toward his presidential ancestors and John Randolph, pages 105-116. Henry did NOT share political views with either John and John Quincy. He also especially personally did not like or admire John Qunicy.]Do these differences and biases make Henry Adams an unreliable biographer of John Randolph? I do not really know because frankly John Randolph is such a minor character in American history that books about him are obscure in the extreme. Adams was a respected writer and historian, but that does not bar him from bias. (See, e.g.History of the United States of America During the Administrations of Thomas Jefferson (Library of America)) From what I have gathered elsewhere, Randolph was an impulsive, outrageously outspoken, heavy-drinking man who may not have been entirely sane.But really, who cares if Adams is entirely objective or not? I became interested in John Randolph because he keeps popping up in early 19th century American history. He was briefly an important Republican Congressional leader, but if his name is remembered at all, it really remembered because of his eccentricities of drink, manner, politics, and language.When I learned that the great Henry Adams had penned a biography, the lure was irresistible. John Randolph was rara avis - an odd duck. The fact that Adams had a viewpoint, OK, an axe or two to grind, only makes the book more delicious. Henry Adams could write and his writing is anchored in historical fact. He also gives the reader the flavor and feel of times whether he is entirely fair to Randolph or not. Better than most historians of this era, Adams succinctly lays out the fears of despotism that motivated the early Jeffersonians. He also sees his great-grandfather John's use of the Alien and Sedition laws as putting the republic in \`real danger'.I found John Randolph considerably easier sledding than his far better knowThe Education of Henry Adams: A Centennial Version. For more on Adams see Garry Wills'Henry Adams and the Making of America. His John Randolph is a short, but fascinating slice of American history."},{"Title":"Short Description of Gods, Goddesses and Ritual Objects of Buddhism and Hinduism in Nepal","review":"This was a great introduction into the different types of Buddhism (north and south) and ritual objects associated with the various practices.

Deities vary from Shiva's Nataraja to Goddess Tara. Have a feeling that this will not be the first or last copy I own.

For instance, on page 71, there is a picture of the James M.E. (Methodist Episcopal) Church, on the corner of Haines Street and Belfield Avenue from 1890. This became the site of the famed Holy Rosary Italian Catholic Church in 1927.I especially love the older, pre-Industrial Age pictures, when streets were unpaved and Germantown had yet to be really developed.The Images of America series from Arcadia Publishing is a pictorial history of America's neighborhoods. The Germantown book is definitely worth buying and proudly displaying on your shelf."},{"Title":"Georges Braque A Life","review":"With the back matter of three short appendices, lengthy notes, lengthy bibliography, and index starting on page 280, this makes the text less than 300 pages. Danchev's biography on this early modernist artist relates his influence on contemporary artists and on modern art as well as influences on him mostly through Braque's relationships with others. The treatment is not a probing psychological study, nor an aesthetic critique and evaluation; but rather concentrates on aspects of Braque's everyday life--his friendships, his trips, his habits. Braque's long and fertile relationship with Picasso was central to Braque's creativity. Danchev also spends time on Braque's marriage to Marcelle Vorvanne, giving her a mini-biography of her own. Another important relationship for Braque was with Jean Paulhan, one of the editors of \\"Nouvelle Revue Francaise,\\" who \\"became [the artist's] greatest tribune and celebrant.\\" Paulhan wrote about Braque's painting, \\"[I]t is without doubt that his work is at all times strangely complete and sufficient...[with the ultimate] feeling of a delay enjoyed, and an obligation fulfilled.\\" Such observations from others in Braque's life are not only illuminating and stimulating in themselves, but accrue to cast light on the complexities and enigma of Braque--as with any historically significant artist--and his paintings; several of which are shown in color plates. Danchev has written other biographies and is a professor in the School of Politics at the U. of Nottingham."},{"Title":"Georges Braque A Life","review":"It is remarkable how few books have been written on Braque. I find him a charming character, based on what I read about him in Richardson's superb bio of Picasso, but I don't like Danchev's style in this bio, and have the feeling that his research was incomplete and too superficial when he wrote it. The organization is lacking, and this appears to derive from a lack of depth on Danchev's part. He rambles most of the time, and needed a disciplined editor. The book doesn't have good reproductions of some important paintings, and one of the color plates, of the ceiling at the Louvre, was taken at an angle that IMO detracts from its presentation. Danchev emphasizes trivia and major themes are lost in the junkpile of his notes, which this book appears to be. In a bio of Braque, I consider it essential to make a strong point about his seminal paintings that initiated first analytic, and then synthetic cubism. Similarly, it is important to tell how he used techniques he learned as a first-rate house painter to impart an original stamp to synthetic cubism, and how Picasso learned these techniques from Braque. I shall confess that I haven't read through the entire book, because I find it painful to read, and don't have much patience for Danchev. Shouldn't there be pictures of Braque dancing, playing music, and especially, boxing?! Braque really deserves a good bio. Will he or she who writes the first be written off as \\"completement braque?\\""},{"Title":"Georges Braque A Life","review":"I purchased this book after purchasing Danchev's new biography of Cezanne. I found both unreadable. He strings multiple phrases together with semi-colons, in EVERY paragraph. It is hard to follow from the beginning of one sentence to the end.

The author covers not only &quot;familiar&quot; - i.e., formal - kimono, but also work clothes, folk clothing, and the modest beauty of stripes and ikat. Illustrations throughout the book are well annotated and informative.My two favorite chapters are those on kimono in the Heian (9th-11th centuries) and Genroku (1688-1704) periods, with their wealth of history and beauty. The chapter on the Heian era covers, among other things, seasonal color combinations, with color depictions of how the layers would look. The Genroku chapter covers kosode, with commented (black and white) illustrations from pattern books of the time.For those interested in wearing modern kimono, the chapter &quot;The Structure of Kimono&quot; includes information on several different aspects of what a kimono, obi and their accessories can mean according to how they're worn. For instance, how the V-shape formed by the collar differs according to age, or what an obijime placed slightly lower than usual can signify. It also includes charts on kimono formality (a wonderful resource) and descriptions - as always, accompanied by illustrations - of the different kimono and obi types."},{"Title":"Kimono: Fashioning Culture","review":"The kimono is the national dress of Japan and is instantly recognisable as Japanese wherever you see it. However, the kimono that we see today is essentially the end of a long evolution of dress over a thousand years and what is worn now is essentially a fossilised costume.This book gives you an illuminating look at the history of the kimono in Japan - how even the word &quot;kimono&quot; didn't exist before last century, when the Japanese became aware that there were &quot;other&quot; forms of dress. We are also given insights into the dress of the lower class and rural people of Japan. They are often forgotten in kimono discussion, yet they developed a dress style that was both practical and indigenous, though it is dying in the modern age. There is even an extensive section devoted to the aristocratic 10th century kimono styles and colour combinations.Lastly this book gives you insight into how the modern kimono is worn. There is a wealth of meaning in dress design and how it is worn that mostly passes non-Japanese by and for a kimono to be worn with style requires a lot of social knowledge that not many other books will spell out for you like this.This book is highly recommended if you have an interest in Japanese costume, history or fabrics. It gives a fascinating account of how dress mirrors history and social changes. However, if you are looking for lots of colour photos of kimono and their designs this book will probably disappoint you as all the illustrations are in black and white."},{"Title":"Kimono: Fashioning Culture","review":"This is a very good guide to the history of the kimono and its importance in Japanese society.

She also did terrific book research.One of the intriguing parts of the book is the revelation of the fashion art of woodblock print (ukiyo-e) artists.

It was therefore an interesting exercise to read the original version of Dorothy's story--the first book, published in 1899, of what came to be a very lengthy series--and compare it with the film version. There are some substantial differences between the two. In the film version, Dorothy's journey to Oz is an unreal episode, an elaborate dream experienced after being hit on the head. Her dream world and her real life, meanwhile, were symmetrical insofar as some of the principal characters from Kansas were translated into characters in Oz. There is no such symmetry in Baum's version. The witch-like Miss Gulch and humbuggy Professor Marvel, the farm hands Hickory, Huck, and Zeke do not appear in the book. Further, Dorothy's house really is transported to Oz in the cyclone, and when she returns to Kansas Dorothy does so bodily: that is, she travels from Oz and does not merely wake from a dream. Smaller differences between the book and film versions are numerous.On the whole, I think that the movie tells a tighter, more interesting story than does the book. The Wicked Witch of the West--whose demise in the book is strangely anticlimactic--plays a much bigger role in the film. This holds the story together nicely just as does the symmetry between Dorothy's real and unreal worlds. The movie also omits a good many of the less interesting episodes included in the book, such as Dorothy's adventures among the Dainty China people. What the book has to offer, in turn, is more on the characters' back stories, in particular those of the Tin Woodman and, of all creatures, the Flying Monkeys--much maligned, misunderstood beasts that they are. Who would have guessed their sad plight from the Monkeys' nightmare-inducing depiction in the movie?While some of Baum's book could have been excised without losing anything, and though the movie tells an arguably better story, Baum's writing is pleasant and his characters well-developed and interesting. It's not surprising that the book has inspired so much affection over the years.Debra Hamel -- author of Trying Neaira: The True Story of a Courtesan's Scandalous Life in ancient Greece (Yale University Press, 2003)"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The Wizard of Oz is a well-made children's literature and very American fairy tale.Oz's answer to Dorothy and her companion is quite a right one.To win \\"hearts\\", \\"brains\\" and \\"courage\\" and \\"returning to home\\" they should make efforts and do something worthwhile. Unlike European fairy tales use of magic power is quite restrained or limited. Even Dorothy wearing her magic boots and hat, the writer made her unaware of the effect. Power, strength or ability you need to make a living is not something automatically confered upon from the witch nor wizard. Through a number of adventures they eventually earn rights to claim what they desire.The storyline and the moral of the story quite fit the founding principles of America and presented to the child in such a charming manner. The movie in 1939 based on this story is also impressive and can be recommendable."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The well written, enduring children's tale of OZ deserves a place in our cultural history.The oft told tale of OZ is known to all of us... mostly through the 1939 Technicolor film masterpiece. Dorthy like Christian in PILGRIM'S PROGRESS travels through space and time on a trip of revelation. Perhaps Oz' odyssey is a continuation of the trip in PILGRIM'S PROGRESS long before Baum.The two tales diverge towards radically different destinations relevant to both secular and Christian readers. The 1939 movie differs from the book for reasons of brevity and perhaps fear: The porcelain church broken by the Lion and deemed unimportant by Dorthy does not appear in the movie. Indeed the porcelain society with its frailty and weakness is excluded perhaps for brevity...too abstract.The Wizard is a projection in the movie, but a series of hallucinations specific to the fears of each character in the book. Baum's OZ is a bogus God. The green hue of the Emerald City is a figment of Dorthy's imagination created by green eyeglasses in the book but a real city in the movie. Is capitalism and prosperity merely an illusion created by paper wealth? This book had populist roots as well.The heaven of PILGRIM'S PROGRESS becomes the humble Kansas earth of Dorthy's childhood...Dorthy's destination.OZ is a circular land which has at its centre the Emerald City surrounded by desert. Jerusalem of yore was often portrayed as the centre of a circular world surrounded by a desert. The Emerald City becomes a bogus Jerusalem, colored by shaded eyeglasses,in a tale which many have identified as an occult PILGRIM'S PROGRESS loaded with dark symbolism.It is likely that the screenwriters of 1939 saw the corrosive anti-God symbolism of Baum's book and wisely took heed to erase it. The real question readers should ask is why this tale was written at all. L. Frank Baum was an ardent racist who advocated,in two editorials, the genocide of Native Americans. Baum's descendants later apologized on National Public Radio for the thoughts of Baum.Shortly after Baum's outbursts, the massacre at Wounded Knee occurred. The army murdered native american children at Wounded Knee and honestly documented the horrible act. The dark question posed by this book is why a mind which so callously disregarded the lives of minority children would want to speak to other children in a fantasy?It is as if a NAZI war criminal would find it necessary to write children's books after the War. Should you honor Baum's thoughts by buying this book? Judged in the context of history this book should be avoided by secular as well as Christian parents.Baum's book is worthy of historical and psychological analysis but belongs in the libraries of academics. THE WIZARD OF OZ does not belong in your child's library. Sorry for the negatvity... but while I recognize the value of this book I can not give credibility to the author.Ephesians 5:11...

That happened to Auntie Em because she was a pretty, young wife but the sun and wind took the sparkle from her eyes and the red from her cheeks. When Dorothy came to live with Auntie Em and Uncle Henry, the only thing that kept her from turning somber was her dog Toto. Toto gave her laughter.When a cyclone came, Dorothy was in the house with Toto and got whisked away. She fell onto her bed and fell asleep. When the house landed with a thump, Dorothy awoke. She opened the door to a beautiful and colorful land. There were Munchkins, the little natives, and the good Witch of the North. They told her that her house had fallen onto the Wicked Witch of the East and killed her.Because Dorothy wanted to get back to Kansas, she asked if they knew how she could get back. The good Witch of the North told her to go see the Great Wizard of Oz. To get to Oz, you follow the Yellow Brick Path. First the good Witch gave Dorothy a Kiss that protected her from Evil and Dorothy took the Silver Shoes that the Wicked Witch of the East left behind.On her journey, Dorothy met the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion. The Scarecrow wanted a brain because his head was stuffed with straw. The Tin Man wanted a heart because he was in love with a Munchkin girl and she could marry him as soon as he had wood for a house. But the old woman she lived with traded two sheep to the Wicked Witch of the East to prevent the marriage. The Wicked Witch enchanted the ax, so each time he cut, the ax would chop through his body and each time the Tin Man went to a tinsmith that would repair his body... until he was all tin and didn't have a heart. The Cowardly Lion was supposed to be King of the Forest, but was a coward. The Cowardly Lion needed courage to be the true King. So all of them continued on the journey to Oz.When the group arrived at Oz, the gatekeeper let them in because the Kiss of the good Witch and the Silver Shoes. Then they put on some green spectacles to protect their eyes from the brightness. Each one saw the great Oz, but each saw him differently. Each time he told one to destroy the Wicked Witch of the West.So Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion set off to find the Witch. As soon as they stepped onto her land, the Wicked Witch sent wolves, crows, bees, and Winged Monkeys after them. Do you think Dorothy destroyed the Witch? You should read The Wizard of Oz to find out. It was a well-written book that was intriguing and had fun characters."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I was a reasonably big fan of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" when I was a kid. I'd seen the Judy Garland film, the \\"Return to Oz\\" film, my parents had taken me to a theatre production, and there used to be a cartoon series about Dorothy and her friends that I quite liked. Here in Australia, though, you don't see an awful lot of the Wizard of Oz books, and I missed out on all that as a kid. I managed to find a copy just recently of the the original story, and I really liked it. It's really a shame I couldn't find it earlier.Dorothy is a girl who lives with her aunt and her uncle in the countryside of Kansas. In the midst of a \\"cyclone\\", Dorothy, her dog Toto, and her whole house are swept away to the Land of Oz, a beautiful but strange world full of all sorts of interesting creatures, good and bad witches, and a very famous wizard. Dorothy tries to find her way home, and on the way makes many new friends, like the Scarecrow, \\"Tin Woodsman\\" and the cowardly lion. Will she ever make it home?It's rather different to the movie, I found. For one, the journey Dorothy and her friends go on takes many days, whereas the in the Judy Garland film it seems to all take place much shorter. The magic shoes Dorothy picks up in Oz are silver here, and not ruby red like in the film. There are also a lot of other creatures and things in the book, like the queen of the mice, the Hammerheads, and the Dainty China people. Though the world of Oz seems pretty big in the film, it feels a lot bigger to me in the book. Oz has a nice atmosphere too, I thought. It's very cosy and familiar, and kind of evokes a kind of America the way that say C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien evokes a kind of Britain, if that makes any sense. North, south, east, west... in Oz's every direction there's a new land to explore. You never know who you might meet, or how they'll do things there. I quite like how laid back everyone is in Oz. The way the Munchkins and the people of the Emerald City speak, for instance.I enjoyed finding out things about my favorite characters too, like how the Tinman became made of tin and how the flying monkeys became slave to the wicked witch of the west, which is all described here. That reminds me, there is a little bit of fairy tale violence here, but nothing worse than you might find in \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\".All in all, a great read, I thought. Whimsical, colourful and fun. I do hope I can get my hands on some of the follow up books. Good thing there's amazon!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The movie based on this book has so eclipsed the novel in the mind of the general public that it's difficult to review the book on its own.The book isn't a musical, obviously, and it has spectacles and scenes which could never have been brought to the screen at the time it was published. Also, the land of Oz has more of a culture and political atmosphere than the film makes note of.That being said, this book is a wild ride through the imagination of Frank L. Baum, with elements from our world transformed in bizarre ways that could never have been anticipated. The entire idea of a talking scarecrow is brilliantly imaginative, if you think about it, as is the cowardly talking lion, the winged monkeys, and the magical field of flowers which puts the adventurers to sleep.Oz is a wonderland unlike any other, and children will delight in the magical surprises that lurk around every bend in the yellow brick road. The special magic of this extensive series is that despite the magic suffusing every nook and cranny of Oz, there are familiar objects and creature from our world that keep us grounded.However, the older you are, the less you will enjoy this book, because it has some pretty serious flaws by modern standards.The language has become quite dated, and the goody-goody dialogue can be jarring to someone who has grown used to a more modern approach. If this book were released today, I don't believe it would ever enjoy the type of success that it did then.Luckily, this book is written for the children, who can generally forgive the fact that characters talk a little strangely (as long as it's consistent, which it is), and the sometimes clunky plot turns.For a child, the focus will be on the King of Mice, or the terrible Kalidah, just two of the magical creatures that escaped the screenplay for the movie. Baum's flights of fancy are so eccentric that children will be fascinated by the wonders they encounter."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This is a wonderful book by the famous author, L.

Dorothy must follow the Yellow Brick Road to get to the City of Emeralds to ask the great and powerful Wizard of Oz to help her get back to Kansas. On the way she meets three new friends who come with her to Oz in need of something. The Scarecrow wants some brains, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion wants some courage. They travel a long way and meet many dangers including the Kalidahs, the Deadly Poppy Field, the Wicked Witch of the West's Castle, and the Hammerheads. But they find ways to get across these obstacles. Their wishes get granted; in a funny way that is. Dorothy doesn't get her wish granted by the Wizard, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, grants her wish with Dorothy's silver shoes.

This version, by far, is the best. The reader actually travels to the Emerald City and beyond as its author L. Frank Baum intended. Mr. Baum put up the money himself to publish the first edition of &quot;The Wizard of Oz,&quot; because no established company would touch a &quot;modern&quot; American fairy tale. As a result, few books were actually produced, but rarely has an author had such control over his finished product. Here's your chance to own a reproduced copy of his original vision! Books of Wonder has done an outstanding job with the whole Oz series, and the love and care shows on every page.

Anyway, it's about a girl named Dorothy from the great Kansas prairies. One afternoon (or earlier than that), her house (with her inside it) is blown to the Land of Oz by a sudden cyclone. There, she finds strange people and surroundings. Strangely, all the people think she is a sorceress. She also meets the Witch of the North, who tells her to go to the Emerald City in the center of the city to ask Oz, the terrible wizard, to help her get back to Kansas (which is what she wants than to stay in Oz).

I found that the book and the movie that we've all seen are very different. The book tells of many more events that were never added into the movie, possibly due to the violence that occurs in the book. One of the violent acts was when the tin man chopped off the mountain lions head. You don't usually see that kind of violence in Shirley. Another event happened when forty or so wolves were killed. I think that if the movie were to be made exactly how the book was wrote that it would be an interesting movie. The Wizard of Oz was a very exciting book to read because I've seen the movie a million times growing up and it kept me in suspense the whole time. The book was always telling about things that I did'nt expect to happen.

Frank Baum's classic novel as a simple children's story, but it has a deeper significance. Baum lived in the Great Plains of the American West during the Populist uprising of the 1890s, and the characters and events of the Wizard of Oz are based upon what he observed. For example, Dorothy represents the innocent midwesterner who must contend with the wild nature of the West (the Wicked Witch of the West) and the deceptive idea that all solutions can be found with money (following the path of gold, or the Yellow Brick Road). The Scarecrow represents American farmers, the Tin Woodsman represents American workers (his transformation from human to tin man represents industrial accidents), and the Cowardly Lion represents Populist presidential candidate William Jennings Bryan (a great orator but a pacifist, hence the cowardly lion). Following the path of gold leads Dorothy and her companions to the Emerald City, which represents Washington, DC, and the corrupt influence that money has on the city. The Wizard is the President of the U.S.--a weak and powerless humbug who nevertheless manages to convince the inocent Dorothy that it is he and not the moneyed special interests that control the land. Anyway, there is much more, but in the end Dorothy conquers nature (the Witch of the West), and with the help of the Silver Slippers (the Populist Party's Free Silver issue), finally finds her way home to truth and happiness. A wonderful book when read in the proper context."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I believe one of the reviews earlier said it best when its writer explained the true context of the entire novel. The novel was not really meant to be a fairy tale for young children, instead it was a Populist book on the issue of bimetalism and argrarian discontent with Industrial Tycoons and Robber Barons. The movie really did a horrible job with this book, changing the &quot;silver slippers&quot; into ruby slippers to show off the impressive Technicolor. The book however is a classic, for its subtle references to politcal issues and the immagination of the mind. The oddity of the book; however, lies in the fact that Baum portrays the Farmer (the scarecrow), the eastern laborers (the tin man) and Bryan (the Lion) as characters who really had what they needed all along, slashing the idea that agrarians really had something to complain about."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"See the item photo to the right?

There may be other, better illustrated editions, but this one gets the job done and gets it done very nicely if you want to re-read or remember something we should remember from our youth--the book, not the movie!!

Yes, you heard me the original shoes were silver and not \\"ruby\\".So, I checked it out to see why the change and the reason is:In the original 1900 book edition of 'The Wizard of Oz', the slippers of the Wicked Witch of the East were silver in color. But in the beloved 1939 film version, they were ruby red. According to those involved in the making of the film, a silver color washed out in comparison to the beautiful, riotously rich colors of the dream sequences in the enchanted, magical land of Oz. In the search for a more photogenic alternative. ruby red came out the winner.What I liked about reading the original story as the author wrote it is that he really went into detail about the characters and the land and story. Like who the Tin Man really was prior to becoming the Tin Man. He was a man who had fallen in love. A witch put a curse on his axe and every time that he would go out to chop wood, he chopped off a limp until he was nothing more then a Tin Man.The illustrations that Mr. Sieben did were great.

But for someone familiar with and fond of the movie (and aren't we all?) this is quite a disappointment. Generally, I find the book version to be superior to the movie, so, given how much I love the movie version of this story, it was with great anticipation that I finally got around to reading it. Unfortunately, this is one of those rare occasions in which the movie is vastly superior to the book. The book is written in a style not too different from the fairie tales of Hans Christian Anderson (definitely more his than the Brothers Grimm); that is to say, it's very straightforward, with little or nothing in the way of style to embellish the basic story. The dialogue is bland, the plot without nuance or embellishment, the characters only a little better than wooden and one-dimensional. Which is okay for a book that is intended purely as a children's story, but given the humor, nuance, and characterization found in the movie which was based on this story, I'd expected more; I'd expected it to be one of those \\"children's stories\\" that was still entertaining to an adult.

I think this would be a great book for young readers because young readers tend to have more imagination then older readers, and also might be able to picture the story more vividly. I also thought this story was a good page turner. In this book Dorothy is swept with her home in a cyclone. When Dorothy lands she finds herself in a strange land.There is filled with munchkins, flying monkeys, hammer heads, witches, a wizard, a talking lion, a tin man, and much more. In the story there are several conflicts that Dorothy and her comrades face. One of the conflicts that they face is when Dorothy and her comrades must travel to the beautiful Emerald City to find Oz the great and the terrible.When she and her comrades get there, their plan is to ask the great Oz to fulfill the greatest wishes.

At the height of the anniversary comes this lively audio book.I feel that this 'radio theatre' adaptation did the book justice. Monterey Soundworks did a great job of transfering Baum's fantasy world to an audio book, giving listeners a new interpretation to the story, yet retaining some of MGM's inescapable influence.The cast is wonderful, bringing new life to the characters, though the Cowardly Lion and Wicked Witch characterizations sound similar to the MGM Bert Lahr and Margaret Hamilton interpretations. In a world where the Judy Garland movie overshadows the original book, it is virtually impossible to not think of at least some of the MGM characters while listening to this adaptation.The adaptation also includes many adventures in the book that are not found in the MGM film, such as the journey through the Dainty China Country, the Hammerheads, the Field Mice, etc. Other differences are that the color of Munchkin clothing is blue, an indication of that country's favorite color. The Wicked Witch of the West is melted not by setting the Scarecrow on fire, but after tripping Dorothy to get the silver shoes and making Dorothy angry (the 'Ruby Slippers' are an MGM creation). Glinda has a british accent, as does the witch of the North.Listening made me realize just how much more to the original 'Wonderful Wizard' book there is, and that MGM cut out a huge chunk of adventures that kids can now enjoy listening to here.I recommend this audio adaptation to any teacher, parent, or child who enjoys reading (or hearing) the magic of Baum's tale. It will transport you 'Over that Rainbow' to the world as Baum originally wrote it."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"It took me 29 years to finally make it to Oz, and I can't wait to go back again!Of course, I'd seen the movie many times.

If you're getting through life only seeing the movie and singing the songs, pick up the book sometime!I want to live in Oz!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I have to admit, until this year I didn't care much for the Wizard of Oz. It was my wife's favorite movie (and she even has checks with Oz scenes on them), but it never was \\"fantasy\\" enough for me. I had been an avid modern fantasy/sci-fi reader until this year when I started reading classics like the Hobbit, the Chronicles of Narnia, and ultimately I picked up the Wizard of Oz.This book is a wonderful read and I fully intend to finish the entire series. There is something so pure and simple about Baum's tale that I find myself entranced and wanting more. This book enchanted me, and immersed me in a world I wished I could visit. I love feeling amazed when I read a book, and this book amazed me.The only thing I didn't care for in this edition is the time spent by Eloise McGraw in the forward addressing the writing style and prose of Baum. For those of you concerned that this is not the Grapes of Wrath, well...is isn't. It also is everything I need in 2006 and the world is heavy with war and hatred: a fantasy tale that takes me away from my troubles and sets me sailing into Oz. I am very glad this isn't classic literature...very glad. I hope you understand that statement as a comment of praise for Baum."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"In this classic, Baum describes the tale of poor Dorothy, who is hurled by a cyclone away from her uncle and aunt in Kansas into a strange and magical world of wizards and witches. Fortunately Dorothy has the help of several companions that she meets in this new world - a stuffed scarecrow who wants brains, a tin woodsman who wants a heart, and a cowardly lion who wants courage. Together with Dorothy - who wants a return trip to Kansas - they travel to the emerald city where Oz is wizard, to ask him to make their wishes come true. Their journey is fraught with adventures, and when they finally meet Oz they discover a terrible truth, that leads them into even more challenges and adventures. The magical fantasy of this tale has pleased readers of all ages for a century, and it's not hard to see why. Baum spins a wonderfully enchanting tale that includes wicked witches, flying monkeys, talking mice, and other fantastic creatures.Is this book more than just a fantasy thrill? Some literary critics have proposed that Baum - a strong believer in individualism and self-confidence - is working with themes about self-esteem and self-reliance. This is quite plausible, especially considering that the brains, heart and courage sought by the scarecrow, woodsman and lion are abilities that they clearly already possess - they just need to recognize them and use them. And Dorothy herself discovers that when the wizard can't help her, she must and can rely on herself. Other literary critics have claimed that &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; needs to be read as an elaborate political allegory where the various characters represent various social classes and financial structures - a not impossible suggestion, but one that's somewhat difficult to defend. Ultimately, however, &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is best enjoyed as a wonderful story. That doesn't mean it is any less of a contribution to English literature, because when appreciated as a brilliant story, you're sure to come back to it again and again, as are your children and grandchildren. It's precisely this universal appeal that makes &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; a true classic."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"It is unfortunate that most people know The Wizard of Oz only by the movie. To be perfectly honest, I found the movie bland compared to the book. For those who have read the book, many don't know that there was thirteen other Oz books written by L. Frank Baum. People who have read the first fourteen probably don't know that five other authors wrote more Oz books after Baum's death, making a total of forty books in the original series. The Wizard of Oz is a wonderful book for anyone no matter what age you are. Just remember to forget every thing you saw in the movie. Most people are surprise when the story doesn't end where the movie ends. When you,re finished the book try the other books in the series. I think you would enjoy them all."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"It's amazing how little people know about this book. I've seen only one review note that this story is an economic parable, not just a fable for children, and the reviewer who mentioned it made it sound like this was a wacky, unrealistic modern interpretation of a simple children's tale.Not so!Baum wrote this story as an analogy for the bimetallic standard, an issue that people actually cared about around the turn of the century but now hardly know ever existed, since we don't back our money with anything anymore. But there was a time, and The Wizzard of Oz (short for ounce, as in an ounce of gold, as in the issue of price-ratios) was written during that period, when the hottest issue on the political plate was that of the bimetallic standard--how and if it should be used. Baum, incidentally, was an enthusiastic political participant, was, in fact, probably present during William Jennings Bryan's famous &quot;cross of gold&quot; speech.But no one knows this anymore. The film is much to blame. Replacing the SILVER shoes of the wicked witch of the east(ern financial establishment) with ruby slippers is inexcusable, even if people don't know or care about these issues now. The silver shoes (silver standard) on the yellow brick road (gold standard) is a vital immage. Ah well.

She has added her name as an author to \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\\" which was written long before she was ever born. So, what has she done to deserve the co-author credit for a book that sold millions worldwide before she ever heard of it? The \\"Great and Powerful\\" Suzi of Oz has judged that L. Frank Baum didn't know what he was doing and thus his great novel needed to be condensed and adapted by her for modern audiences. The original, best-selling Oz needed Suzi to save it.Tell us Suzi, Who died an made you Wizard?This is an outrage made possible because the copyright for \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" has expired and so anyone can do anything they like with the text. Yes, by law it is now in the public domain. Anyone, anywhere can publish it.I have many fine editions of the original novel published by divergent companies that loved the story so much they wanted to keep making it available to more and more children as well as the child in all of us. The Suzi Alexander version, however, seems to be written not by someone who loves the the original but instead by a person who thinks she can make a better version than the one who sold all these millions of copies before she got her hands on it.May the children of the world throw a bucket of water on her and watch Suzi's wickedness melt away.As a child who carefully memorized every single word of the original, I find the Dalmatian Press, Suzi Alexander, altered and condensed work to be nothing less than an abomination.Keep your hands off our priceless treasures! These silver shoes do NOT belong to you!Don't be fooled by the cover. It may say \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\\" but the Dalmatian Press, Suzi Alexander version is NOT the original novel that L. Frank Baum wrote. It is not good enough to be used in fireplaces or in landfills. Suzi should attempt to write her own terrible books rather than messing with our established American classics.Suzi, If you had enough heart to love the original, you'd have had the courage to bring it to us unblemished, but sadly you haven't got a brain and you can never go home again."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"THE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ,L. Frank Baum's 1899 copyright,Kindle edition, 2012-01-09One summer day in 1937, my sister and I took a trip to Oz. Unlike Dorothy, we didn't have a cyclone, we had to roller skate a mile to the library. I was ten, my sister seven. The effort was worth it. We discovered L. Frank Baum's many Oz books and spent hours at a time in Oz. It is one of my most cherished memories from childhood.Alan Pearce's Kindle Edition of Baum's original 1899 book is beautifully done, and very faithful to the book. It's also a real eye-opener when compared with the MGM movie. Baum had four people greet Dorothy, three Munchkin men and the Witch of the North. MGM's myriad Munchkins were little people gathered from all over the world. Dorothy's \\"ruby slippers\\" in the movie were silver in the book. Admitedly, these are nit-picking examples, simply to show how MGM messed up the book. Only someone who has seen the movie, and now reads the book, will notice the major differences.This is the most beautiful e-book I have ever seen! If you decide to read it, please do it justice. Black and white will kill the many original illustrations. They really need a larger color image than given by an ipod or cell phone.

Kindle Edition."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The Wizard of Oz is one of my all-time favorite movies, and I still have to say that I like the book better. Why? The book has more weird stuff in it than the movie does; probably because of theatrical limitations like time, budget, and technological contraints. For instance, the Wicked Witch of the West in the book has only one eye. Nowadays computer graphics could make that possible in a film, but back in the day, most movies couldn't pull off effects like that.The book and the movie deviate from each other quite a bit, but both include essentially the same story. I'm glad the movie didn't try to copy the book directly, and changed some parts to not only fit the limits it had, but to make the whole story more movie-esque - like really jazzing up Munchkin Land and making it smaller than the book implied it was. (Dorothy is of the same height as the Munchkins in the book.)One thing in the book that I thought was really cool was that the Wizard of Oz shows himself in multiple forms, not just the big head. He's even a lady at one point. Also I like the hammer-head guys at the end of the book. L. Frank Baum really showed me his creative abilities there.On a side note, there are some violent scenes in the book, particularly involving multiple beheadings at a time.I really think that if you only see the movie and don't read the book, you're missing out. This book contains the REAL Tinman, and the REAL Scarecrow. The ones from the movie are just copies. Darn good copies, but still copies. Oh, the things a good book from a good author can inspire!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This story all started when a farm girl from Kansas named Dorothy Gale, and her little dog Toto got sucked into a tornado and landed in a fairyland named Oz.

Each one wanting a different wish. On the way to the wizard they come across multiple things. And when they finally got to Emerald city the wizard told them that they must first kill the wicked witch of the west if they want him to make there wishes come true. Eventually they succeed in doing that along with multiple hard things to do. After all that they find out that the wizard is a &quot;humbug&quot; and he grants everyone's wishes.

Well they found her and Dorothy got back home along with her dog Toto, and she had what she needed all along in order for her to return home. Personally in my opinion I enjoyed the book better then the movie. I would recommend this book to anyone with a good imagination, because I kept imagining the story as I read it. The book has some drawings in it wich makes imagining things a lot easier, it has drawings of the main characters, villains, and some of the scenes in the book such as there journey on the yellow brick road.

Frank Baum says a rather extraordinary thing. Discussing the purpose of the old fairytales by Grimm and Andersen, Baum tells us that such tales existed both to entertain children and provide a moral by means of \\"horrible and blood-curdling\\" incident. True enough, but Baum goes on to say that his book falls outside this typical definition of a fairytale, telling us that: \\"the story of the Wizard of Oz was written solely to pleasure children of today. It aspires to being a modernized fairytale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out.\\"Reading The Wizard of Oz for the first time made me wonder if Baum was even aware of what he'd written, or if perhaps someone else had written this introduction (someone who hadn't read the book), for The Wizard of Oz is positively jam-packed full of beheadings, monsters, witches, deaths and other terrors, all focused on a character that embodies the quintessential childhood fear: that of being lost and unable to return home. Indeed, with his description of Uncle Henry in the very first chapter, Baum writes: \\"He worked hard from morning till night and did not know what joy was. He was gray, from his long beard to his rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\\" Not quite the cheerful fairytale Baum promises, is it?But of course, this isn't a bad thing. If we want to enjoy the light, then there has to be some shadows, and throughout Baum's story there is a perfect blend of happiness and pain, wonderment and horror as Dorothy Gale traverses the Land of Oz in her attempts to get home to Kansas. I just find it rather bemusing that the author was apparently wholly unaware of this!Inevitably, one can't help but compare Baum's original story with the movie-version, and it's interesting to compare the areas in which the two differ. There's still a little girl called Dorothy who lives with her Uncle Henry, Aunt Em and her dog Toto, and she's still caught up in a cyclone that whisks her away to the Land of Oz. On waking up, she finds that her house has landed on the Wicked Witch of the East, much to the delight of the diminutive Munchkins, who have been slaves under her rule. Rewarded with the Witch's Silver Shoes (*not* Ruby Slippers, which were an innovation of the movie in order to make the most of Technicolor), Dorothy is told to follow the yellow brick road to the Emerald City and the Wizard of Oz, a mysterious figure who holds the best hope of getting her home again.And of course there are the familiar and beloved figures of the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion, stalwart friends to Dorothy on her journey, and all desiring some internal quality (a brain, a heart and courage, respectively), completely unaware that they already have these traits in abundance. There's also the surprising Wizard of Oz, the evil Wicked Witch of the West (not as prevalent here as she was in the movie) and the good witches of the North and South (who in the movie are combined into the singular character of Glinda).But there are plenty of things of Baum's creation that the movie left out, such as a community of talking field mice and their Queen, a city of tiny china people, and a whole range of other bizarre inhabitants that would have been entirely impossible for the movie to recreate. The book also gives us more background into certain people and places. For example, I was delighted to find that the book gives us background on the Tin Woodman, detailing how exactly he came to be made of tin, which is a rather poignant tale of lost love. And as it turns out, there is a lot more to those creepy flying monkeys and the Emerald City than the movie shows us.In the movie, marvels are introduced one after the other in quick succession, making Oz a rather abstract and random place, much akin to Lewis Carroll's Wonderland in the \\"Alice\\" stories, (which makes a sort-of sense considering the film presents Oz as a dream that takes place in a concussed Dorothy's mind), but the literary Oz has some semblance of order and symmetry to it. The country is divided by color and direction, with the yellow-clad Winkies in the west, the red-clad Quadlings in the south, the blue-clad Munchkins in the east, and of course the green inhabitants of the Emerald City.Apologies if this review has ended up more like a comparison piece between the film and the book, but having been brought up with fond memories of the film, and approaching the book for the first time in adulthood, it was rather inevitable that the two would be held up against one another. In any case, reading the original story served to convince me that both the book and the film are necessary to appreciate each one, and any childhood would be all the richer for having been exposed to both!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"you have got to read this book i love it absolutly loveit it is great trust me you would love it you have just got to read it most people dont really think about reading this book its all about Harry Potter dont get me wrong i like harry potter but everyone knows about them nobody knows about this book that is why im posting it on the internet so please please reade it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THanks by"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"this book is over looked because of the movie. the writing is beautiful.

Somebody must have forgotten to tell that to Frank L. Baum! With The Wizard of Oz, Baum single-handedly challenges the greatest works of British fantasy without blinking.At first glance, one can see the influence of Lewis Carroll's masterpiece, Alice in Wonderland, on The Wizard of Oz. But what separates The Wizard of Oz from all other fairy tales before this time, is that this fairy tale is uniquely American both in mood and setting. The characters in The Wizard of Oz are as enchanting as anything the Grimms wrote about. There's Dorothy, Toto the dog, The Scarecrow who wants a brain, the Tin Man without a heart, The Cowardly Lion, the Wicked Witch of the West, and of course, The Mighty Wizard of Oz who rules Emerald City.When the story begins, a fierce cyclone descends on Dorothy's house in rural Kansas and transports her to the magical Land of Oz. No sooner than she arrives in Oz, Dorothy discovers that her house has fallen on and killed The Wicked Witch of the East. By so doing, Dorothy has freed the people of Oz from the tyranny of one of two evil witches. Even so, Dorothy wants to return to Kansas and is instructed by The Good Witch of the North that only the Wonderful Wizard of Oz can send her home. Thus, Dorothy embarks on the Yellow Brick road to seek the wizard and along the way encounters many strange and wonderful creatures. Little does she know that her quest is ill-fated, for an unexpected surprise awaits her at journey's end.What truly distinguishes The Wizard of Oz from preexisting fairy tales, is that Baum intentionally sought to create a contemporary American fairy tale that discarded all of the terrifying and gruesome aspects of the fairy tales of European tradition. Baum succeeded beyond his wildest imaginations and created an unforgettable classic that went on to spawn a number of popular sequels.Anyone who loves traditional fairy tales and hasn't yet read this book should grab themselves a copy of The Wizard of Oz. A wonderful tale of enchantment and excitement awaits. All you have to do is to follow Dorothy on her magical adventure and travel the Yellow Brick Road!"},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The Oz books were a huge part of my childhood. I never really got into other series that other kids my age liked: Hardy Boys, Box Car Children, Encyclopedia Brown. For some reason, I always preferred the more fantastic stories, which probably heavily influenced my later choices in fantasy and science fiction.My wife never read the Oz books, and so I talked her into reading them with me. We have no children, but we both still enjoy children's books, and have a collection that we look forward to one day sharing with our children. \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" tops that list, for both of us now, with a few caveats.It is obvious on reading the books that they are from a different world and a different time. I'm not talking about some fictional land somewhere over the rainbow; I'm talking about a time when children were not supposed to be protected from any nastiness or unpleasantness. Anyone who has read the original versions of Grimm's Fairy Tales knows what I'm talking about: beheadings, wars, violence, betrayal, abuse, etc. Some of these are found without apology in the land of Oz, which may shock people whose only other introduction to the world was through Judy Garland. The Tin Woodman is constantly chopping the head off of something, (to protect Dorothy, of course), not to mention the Scarecrow breaking the necks several dozen nefarious crows. Many other differences from the musical are discovered when reading the books: The Cowardly Lion isn't really cowardly, the Tin Woodman has always had a heart, and the Scarecrow is without a doubt the cleverest one in the bunch. I've never understood why the movie ignored these facts, or why the MGM's wizard didn't do as the great Oz in the books, and just give the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Lion exactly what they asked for: brains, a heart, and courage. This is to say nothing of the annoying fact the \\"Good Witch\\" in the movie knew the whole entire time Dorothy could have gone home whenever she wanted.People who feel children should be protected and shielded at all cost to the \\"uglier\\" side of make-believe would do well to stay away from Oz. But individuals who feel a little fantasy, a little humour, and a small pinch of moral make for a fun story enjoyable by kids of all ages should enjoy Oz."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"The Wizard of Oz is a story about a girl named Dorothy. She lives in Kansas where there are lots of tornados. She also has a dog named Toto who lives on a farm with her and her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and the workers that help Aunt Em and Uncle Henry on the farm. The next-door neighbor hates Toto because he gets in her crops and chases her ugly cat. She comes out with a rake and tries to catch Toto and poke him with the rake.Dorothy loves to sing and is always doing something she's not supposed to do. Dorothy also goes places that are completely unknown to her. Toto is black and very small. She spends most of the time with Toto because she doesn't have any friends in Kansas.I relate to Dorothy because she's very outgoing and is always in mischief just like me. Dorothy is a neat person and I really want to meet someone like her some day.Dorothy is a very normal person and she isn't very wild like some characters in books. I like that. I like normal, not weird and not wild."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I know there are many people who are in love with the movie and don't get me wrong, it's an amazing script. I have personal attatchments with it because I played the wicked witch of the west in a school production of the musical and I am very partial to the her character. The witch in the book is no where near as interesting as the movie. However, I love some of the extra twists in the book that the movie doesn't include. Such as: the green tinted specticals that Dorothy and her friends have to put on in entering Oz, the queen of the mice, the winged monkeys' story, and Dorothy's experiances in the witch's castle. I also think that this book has its limitations. The charqacters are mostly rather shallow and the writing is simple, in the way that most books for young children are. Instead the authers spends his time writing histories for most of the characters, even the winged monkeys, and adding creative twists. Did you know that the ruby slippers were really silver?I would say that this is definately a children's book but that if you're a big fan of the movie, it's worth reading. If you were ever in the musical, it's a lot of fun to look up the background of even small parts like aunt Em and discover things about her that you didn't know before."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"I am studying economics and i bought this book because it has some economic backround.I like quality of it and the price was unbeatable.

Dorothy gets whisked away into a strange land where most of it is pleasant, but the other half of this strange land is dark and creepy. Dorothy must follow the Yellow Brick Road to get to the City of Emeralds to ask the great and powerful Wizard of Oz to help her get back to Kansas. On the way she meets three new friends who come with her to Oz in need of something. The Scarecrow wants some brains, the Tin Woodman wants a heart, and the Cowardly Lion wants some courage. They travel a long way and meet many dangers including the Kalidahs, the Deadly Poppy Field, the Wicked Witch of the West's Castle, and the Hammerheads. But they find ways to get across these obstacles. Their wishes get granted; in a funny way that is. Dorothy doesn't get her wish granted by the Wizard, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, grants her wish with Dorothy's silver shoes.

America has, unfortunately, produced fewer true &quot;fairy tales&quot; than Europe. And though Americans could enjoy the old stories, simple and universal as they are, we needed new ones with the distinctive qualities of our land. &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, American tall tales, and the comic book creations of the 1950s and 60s are what we have produced to fill the gap. When I first read this book at 7 years old, I was disappointed it was so different from the movie, which I loved then, but as I've grown older I've found the book to be superior, because it depicts Oz as less of a benign candyland. Despite this the book (and its sequels even more so) is seriously flawed. These are flaws of imagination: like the works of Roal Dahl many of the people who read the Oz books see them as unbridedly imaginative. They arent. C.S. Lewis built a cousin-world to Oz with much more imagination and style in his far better Narnia books. Read them instead."},{"Title":"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Lrs Large Print Heritage Series)","review":"This is an edition of The Wizard of Oz with two long critical essays by the editor.

The Bambuti become so real for us in part because of Turnbull's narative skill, but more, I think, because they themselves are so real, such wonderful humans. This, we want to believe, is what our species is really like, the way we were meant to be.Like all gathering- hunting people, the Bambuti are on intimate terms with mother nature. For them this means their beloved forest, which is a benign, nurturing, and protective mother. People who live outside the forest are scared to go near it. But the the Bambuti who are its children are completely happy there.What makes this book such a joy to read is that besides being so lovable, the Bambuti are very funny. Their humor is infectious and irresistable.Forever after reading The Forest People, everytime you think about the people you met there, and you will think about them, you can't help smiling.What could be better, especially the way the world is now, than to find a book that makes you really feel good about being a human, proud and happy to be living on the same planet as these wonderful people."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"Colin Turnbull romanticizing of the Mbuti pygmies in &quot;The Forest People&quot; is allowable given the period in which it was written. In some ways, the book really tells us more about the ethnographer than the people he studied. Turnbull found the Mbuti way of life to have a simple, spiritual quality that he admired greatly.... part of this admiration stemmed from his own background in an elitist British social and academic system. Turnbull was simply &quot;in love&quot; with the Mbuti.Anthropology has (hopefully) advanced to the point where its practitioners allow themselves a greater recognition of their possible biases. Even so, who is to say that an understanding of the ethnographer is not more important than the study group.The book reads pleasantly, if not scientifically."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"This ethnography of the Mbuti Pygmy of Africa's Ituri forest is, as Dr. Burton puts it, a successful failure. One cannot deny that it is a fabulously romantic piece, and a refreshing look at a people that have suffered from exploitation and the image of being hopelessly primitive. The late Dr. Turnbull uses reflexivity and a particularly observant eye to capturehis subjects in time and offer up this portrait to his readers. However, it is this same romanticism that makes the account just a bit too novel-like and not all that satisfying from a modern anthropological point of view. The reader cannot help feeling that Turnbull's idyllic forest world in which Pygmys are good guys and Bantu villagers are bad guys is somehow retrogressive. The goal of modern ethnography is to recognize the anthropologist's effect on the target society, and to incorporate that into the book, while at the same time drawing back from their world and asking, will this society read this book and say, &quot;hmmm, that's surely us&quot;? In that sense, Turnbull fails, but as an exciting piece, the book's appeal is undeniable."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"I personally didn't like this novel just because it was purely almost all observations, which I don't find interesting to READ (versus see for myself)...

Turnbull (1924-1994) was an anthropologist who spent several years with the Pygmies, beginning in 1951. He came from a wealthy English family, but he found life among the Pygmies to be so satisfying that he had to resist strong urges to remain with them.Instead of using the standard scholarly format for anthropology books, Turnbull described these people in a series of stories. These stories included descriptions of the important cultural components of the Pygmy way of life, and introduced us to the personalities of various individuals in the band.They were hunter-gatherers, and they enjoyed an exceedingly low tech way of life in their tropical rainforest home. They had little need for clothing, blankets, or warm shelters. They hunted with nets, spears, and bows and arrows. They did not garden or herd animals. Consequently, they had an abundance of leisure time. They loved singing, dancing, storytelling, and visiting kinfolk. They would laugh until they were too weak to stand, then sit down and laugh.In 2500 BC, Egyptian explorers discovered the Pygmies. Their report to the Pharaoh described \\"a people of the trees, a tiny people who sing and dance to their god, a dance such as had never been seen before.\\" When Turnbull arrived 4,500 years later, he found a similar scenario. They had a way of life that worked, and it was quite enjoyable. Yes, daily life included normal personality conflicts, but their society did not suffer from chiefs, priests, thieves, chauvinists, inequality, or individualism.The hunting way of life required cooperation, so the Pygmies were highly skilled at conflict resolution. One of their proverbs proclaimed that \\"a noisy camp is a hungry camp.\\" Disputes promptly led to active discussion by the group. Shunning and ridicule were common tools, and annoying offenders were sometimes beaten.Everything about the forest was sacred to the Pygmies. \\"They were a people who had found in the forest something that made their life more than just worth living, something that made it, with all its hardships and problems and tragedies, a wonderful thing full of joy and happiness and free of care.\\"In another book, Turnbull mentioned Father Longo, a Catholic missionary who refused to preach to the Pygmies, because they had no word for evil. \\"In order to convert them, then, he would first have to teach them the concept of evil, and that he was not prepared to do.\\"Moke, a wise elder, said: \\"The forest is a father and mother to us, and like a father or mother it gives us everything we need -- food, clothing, shelter, warmth, and affection. Normally everything goes well, because the forest is good to its children, but when things go wrong, there must be a reason.\\"Alas, sometimes the forest fell asleep, and failed to take care of the Pygmies, leading to illness, death, or bad hunting. Army ants might move in, or a leopard might snatch a child. When these problems occurred, the Pygmies would sing to the forest, to wake it up and make it happy. They sometimes performed the molimo ceremony, during which animal noises were made using a long hollow wooden instrument.And when the forest was happy, they would sing and dance to share their happiness with it. They lived in a heavenly place, in constant direct contact with everything they held to be sacred. They had absolute reverence for the forest, their ancient home, and they were some of its many children.The Pygmies enjoyed at least 4,500 years of relative stability, and this was made possible by their primitive technology. If they had become farmers or herders, their journey would have been far more destructive and turbulent. They would have seriously damaged themselves and their sacred forest.Change has been increasing in Pygmy country, requiring them to adjust the way they live. Maybe 400 years ago, Bantu people moved into the forest and began slash-and-burn farming. They had been herders from the grasslands of East Africa, but they were driven off their home by other tribes. Their cattle died in the jungle, so they traded food with the Pygmies for meat.In the 1880's, the Congo became a colony of Belgium. Since then efforts have been made to \\"liberate\\" the unfortunate Pygmies and convert them into hard-working tax-paying farmers. This plan has not enjoyed great success. At one farm, 29 Pygmies died of sunstroke in a single day. They thrive in the cool shade of their ancient forest, and they harbor an intense hatred of miserable backbreaking field work -- what could be more idiotic?In the twentieth century, the Ituri has been ravaged by road-builders, loggers, miners, ivory poachers, bushmeat hunters, missionaries, and a bloody parade of trigger-happy rebels, terrorists, goon squads, psychopaths, and freedom fighters. There have been numerous armed conflicts. The Second Congo War began in 1998, and resulted in 5.4 million deaths, mostly from disease and starvation. Many displaced people were driven into the Ituri Forest. Pygmies were hunted down and eaten like game animals.Much deforestation has been caused by the continuous expansion of slash-and-burn farming. Jungle soils are rapidly depleted by agriculture, and the Congo's birthrate is one of the world's highest. Almost half of the population is younger than 15.When The Forest People was published, it soon became popular. Turnbull thought that the book had impact \\"because the near-Utopia described rang true, and showed that certain voids in the lives of many of us could indeed be filled.\\"Ah yes, the voids in our lives. How often do we sing and dance to keep our forest happy? Turnbull has given us a precious gift -- a taste of what a healthy and joyful life could be like, living in harmony with the land, singing and dancing in a balanced ecosystem, century after century after century. His book offers us a brief enchanting escape from our world of madness, and a beautiful vision of what life could be like for our descendants.Richard Adrian ReeseAuthor of What Is Sustainable"},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"This is great example of how an ethnography should be written.

However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....After we re-typeset and designed your book, the page numbers change so the old index and table of contents no longer work. Therefore, we usually remove them. Since many of our books only sell a couple of copies, manually creating a new index and table of contents could add more than a hundred dollars to the cover price....Our OCR software can't distinguish between an illustration and a smudge or library stamp so it ignores everything except type. We would really like to manually scan and add the illustrations. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies....We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book. We would really like to manually scan each page and buy multiple copies of each original. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies.....\\"General Books LLC are flooding Amazon with these low quality publications (450,000+ listed under General Books LLC) and, unfortunately, many of them have the reviews associated with the original or with better quality imprints associated with them. The product description is totally misleading for the buyer that's not aware of this publisher. Also, if you do the \\"Look Inside\\" thing and check, you will see that the version displayed is actually another publishers edition and in fact is nothing like the General Books LLC version (which is rubbish, believe me). IMHO this is unethical marketing.A general rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another book, and they've used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first)."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"I first read The Forest People when I was in college. I took an anthropology course, and I was absolutely enchanted by this book.First of all, do not fear that this book is written by an anthropologist using dry and boring langauge and tried everything to stay objective thus being an impassion observer. This is not a book filled with statistics and boring observations and theories.No, Turnbull described the life of the Mbuti pygmies with such color, exuberance, detail and a healthy dash of humour that you cannot help but just being entranced by this book. You will learn of their daily lives, their hissy fits with each other, their methods of punishment, their relationship with the &quot;negro&quot; villagers whom they think are animals because they do not understand the forest. You will see their marriage rites, the rituals of the Molimo and the celebration of the Elima, when young pygmy girls are first &quot;blessed&quot; by menstrual blood.You will see the pygmies as individuals each with his or her own personality....Kenge the author's best friend, Moke an elderly and respected member of the Mbuti, Cephu the &quot;bad hunter&quot;, beautiful Kidaya of the elima, who , Kondabate the pygmy belle who filed her teeth like a shark's, flirtatious Akidinimba with her infamously huge bosoms, &quot;ugly&quot; Aberi, Kamaikan, Kelemoke and even Amina, the daughter of a sub-chief from a nearby village. You will get to know them and feel as if you have known them all your lives.The Forest People is one of the best books EVER written on anthropology. You can't help but think about how life, as simple as it seems for the pyymies, is still fill with both joy and tribulations. I have read this book many times and every time it still have not lost its magic on me.This book was written in the 1960s. Turnbull have since passed away. I cannot help but think about what happaned to all these wonderful people we meet in the book today. Did Kenge have any children since? Did Kondabate ever had a child? Did Akidinimba stayed married?I just wish that there's a sequel to this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"Colin Turnbull, the late English born Anthropologist and writer was the first to be able to study the pygmies of Africa first hand. The first to be accepted and befriended by these mysterious and beautiful people of the African Congo. In The Forest People Turnbull recalls his experience of living hidden within the forest with a family group of pygmies. He tells us the wearisome struggle that the pygmies battle for to protect thier culture and home. Turnbull also looks deeply into thier way of life and uncovers for us a world of playfullness and enchanting spiritualism. He teaches us the vital part that the rainforest itself plays in the pygmy's existance and also the holiness of all nature. This book was a delight to read and opened my eyes to the pure world that we live on but that is rarely seen."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"Shame on the publisher.I bought this book for an anthropology course.

I felt like a little too much had been edited out in some spots and the author was a little over sentamental at times. For my purposes i would have liked a little more of a scientific approach to some things, but it does make a very good story overall."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"This is an account first published in 1961, of a year (1956) spent by the author, anthropologist Colin Turnbull, among a clan of pygmies of the Ituri Forest in northwestern Belgian Congo (later Zaire, now DR of Congo).I found it a fascinating read. It's fashionable, and all too easy, to pooh-pooh the work of anthropologists living amongst primitive tribes, but the author's done something that none of us have, and for that, and for the obvious love and respect that he felt for the pygmies with whom he lived, the work is worthy of respect.What stands out most, for me, in the account is the essential common humanity of the pygmies. In their petty jealousies, rivalries, flirtations - in their practical joking, on each other and on the African villagers who view them as property, as much as the romanticised, spiritual world of the forest, I saw \\"us\\" reflected clearly.Some of the aspects that will stay with me:- The double-edged relationship with the African negro \\"villagers\\", for whom the pygmies are a kind of property - one that supplies them with a less than reliable source of meat, honey and other forest foods, and occasionally labour - and who compel the pygmies to observe their initiation, marriage and funeral rites. The pygmies on the other hand receive some food from the villagers' plots, and steal more without compunction, and disappear into the forest for months when the whim takes them.- The spiritual forest rites, especially the men's kumamolimo, with its mysterious voice of the forest the molimo. Actually an instrument like an Australian aboriginal didgeridoo, normally made from a hollowed out tree. Turnbull is \\"put out\\" by the sacrilege of his clan using a 15-foot metal pipe for this purpose, which they proceed to demonstrate at first by blowing a \\"long, raucous rasberry\\", but is told quite firmly \\"What does it matter what a molimo is made of? This one makes a great sound, and besides, it does not rot like wood.\\"- The author explained that the first Turnbull was a borderland Scot who turned the head of a charging bull and saved the King - so the pygmies named him Eba-mu-nyama - literally, \\"His father killed an animal\\".- A well-meaning European's attempts to convince some pygmy clans to settle and farm cleared land on the edge of the forest - where they died at a high rate from exposure to the sun.- The tears of a mother when Turnbull showed her daughter, crippled by hip dysplasia, how to walk using crutches.All in all a fascinating account of a world that was then, and still is under threat. I've written this in the present tense - hopefully that's not entirely in vain."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"This was a fantastic book. I had to read it for my Ethnology class and fell in love with the MaButi Pygmies.

I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"I enjoyed reading this book from beginning to end. I really didn't want to put the book down. Before I read this book, I never heard of the Bambuti people or of the Ituri forest. I really felt as if I was living with them while reading the book. It was surely an eye opener for me. I wonder what has happened to Kenge, Manyalibo, Ausu, etc. It's really amazing how the Bambuti love their forest so much and that's all they need to get by. This book showed a lot of hardships and tragedies but yet the Bambuti people stressed how important their life is, with happiness and joy."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"The Forest People (Touchstone Book)The Forest Peopleby Colin M. TurnbullMy rating: 5 of 5 starsI just finished a wonderful book, Colin Turnbull's The Forest People. Turnbull lived \`a while' (pygmies don't measure time with a watch or a calendar) with African pygmies to understand their life, culture, and beliefs. As he relays events of his visit, he doesn't lecture, or present the material as an ethnography. It's more like a biography of a tribe. As such, I get to wander through their lives, see what they do, how they do it, what's important to them, without any judgment or conclusions other than my own.One point that became clear early on is that pygmies have no leaders. How can that be, you might ask? Doesn't somehow just assume that mantle? Well, until I read this book, I would have agreed whole-heartedly, but that doesn't seem to happen. A tribe member might demand everyone go hunting with him (it takes a large group to capture/kill the forest animals) and people may go, or they may not. Whatever they feel like. When they move to a new camp, houses and furniture must be built. People may start full of energy and ambition, promising to help neighbors and build big houses with multiple rooms. And then the builders dwindle away as some other adventure grabs their attention. They might finish, maybe not. Often, they'll use some of their neighbor's roof leaves, or even his house until their own house is built.Most surprisingly, I have yet to discover if they have a belief in a god. They don't pray for help, for food or safety, for anything. If life doesn't seem quite right, the closest they get to wishing it was better is to return to the forest where life is always good, to a camp surrounded by the depths of the jungle, where outsiders are afraid to go. But the forest isn't their god, it's merely where life is always good.Hmmm. I have to ponder this..."},{"Title":"Forest People","review":"This is one of my favorite books, and is most definitely one of the best anthropology books I've ever had the pleasure to read.

The indicators include: Price level, P/E ratio, Price/Book Value, Price/Cash Flow, Price/Sales. Whenever the S&P; 500 trades under its 15 year moving average on these indicators, it is a good time to buy.They show that between 1977 and 2001 an investor using any of these indicators (P, P/E, P/B, P/CF, P/S) to invest in the S&P; 500 whenever it traded lower than its 15 year moving average would have beaten an investor doing dollar cost averaging with monthly investments over the same period. One condition is that the market timer would invest $200 every month he had a buy signal, and not invest anything when he did not. Meanwhile, the dollar-cost-averager would invest $100 on a monthly basis. Over the entire period, the market timer gets to invest only $20,000 in the S&P; 500 ($200 times 100 months). Meanwhile, the dollar cost averager invests $30,000 in the S&P; 500 ($100 times 300 months). In each case, the market timer comes out ahead and ends up with more money in 2001.The authors attempt to make a case that the market timer superior results (regardless of the indicator used) is due to buying into the market when it is low. But, the success of the market timer is due to his accelerated equity investment schedule. By early 1985, the market timer has made his full investment of $20,000 in equities. By the same date, the dollar cost averager has invested only $10,000. The dollar cost averager much slower investment schedule will never allow him to catch up to the market timer. The dollar-cost-averager average holding period of his stock portfolio is only 12.5 years compared to 21.5 years for the market timer. This is why the market timer wins.The above example is repeated five times (once for each indicator) with the exact same flaw. The accelerated equity investment schedule follows an identical pattern regardless of the indicator used. What these guys did is called backtesting. The authors looked at various moving averages such as 5, 10, and 15 years. And, devised different investment rules until they came up with a combination of a moving average and a rule that would beat income averaging. They did it, but ran into a methodological flaw (the frontloading of the investment) they were not even aware off.Additionally, this investment strategy is most unrealistic. Who could stomach investing twice as much as his regular investment schedule just when the market is experiencing a severe Bear market (that is what it takes for the market to go south of its 15 year moving average).This strategy is not market timing. Following this strategy you would have been locked out of making any additional equity investments since 1985. Also, the authors do not have a \\"sell signal\\" spelled out because it would kill their strategy. The stock market only rarely goes south of its 15 year moving average (regardless of the indicatory used) and quickly goes back up north of it. Thus, with a sell signal you would never hold your S&P; 500 holdings for long. Yet, the authors stress that their strategy does not show superior returns until 15 to 20 years out. The lack of a sell signal would have left you fully exposed on your S&P; 500 holdings invested prior to 1985 to the crash of 1987, the downturn of 1989, and the severe Bear Market of 1999 to 2002.The authors give great credit to the investing principles developed by Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing. Some of these principles include only buying companies who sell for less than their working capital and whose earnings yield is twice higher than their bond yield. The only problem is that you could not find any stock meeting these criteria since 1950s. These principles have become outdated as markets have become more efficient.The authors strategy is almost as outdated as Benjamin Graham value investing principles. The difference is that Graham wrote his book 30 years before his investing guidelines became obsolete. Meanwhile, the authors wrote their book 18 years after their strategy was outdated in 1985.They actually belittle the sound concepts of asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing. They pretend that asset allocation has no merit because no one knows the future returns from equities and bonds. However, we can construct a directionally correct asset allocation for different risk levels by inputting the respective equities and bonds returns historical mean, standard deviation, and correlation with each other. On portfolio rebalancing, they suggest it is worthless since two investors who would have started the prior century with a 50/50 split, the one not rebalancing his portfolio to a 50/50 position yearly would have ended up far richer at the end of the century than the other one who did rebalance his portfolio yearly. But, the investor who let his allocation drift from 50/50 to 99/1 (equity/bonds) incurred a far greater risk. The authors ignored all that. Asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing are far more important to your capital preservation than their unusable market timing proposition."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"The stupendous collapse of the NASDAQ is still fresh in many people's minds. This book offers a way to systematically avoid such euphoria in the future.Simply put, they advocate buying only when key indicators (such as price to earnings or price to book ratios) fall below their 15-year moving average. When such indicators are higher than their 15-year moving average, stay on the sidelines with Treasuries. Ample evidence is supplied to show how this approach would have netted a hypothetical investor much more than conventional dollar-cost-averaging over the past 100 years.However, some big flaws lurk in the margins that are not addressed. By utilizing a 15-year moving average, they have effectively reduced the number of unique supportive data samples to 7. There are only seven 15-year windows within a 100 year period. It is true that they utilize a moving average, thus generating an infinite number of 15-year averages, but the point is that the 15-year average of the years 1970-1984 is not fundamentally independent from the 15-year average of the years 1971-1985 because they share 14 years worth of data. Only the windows 1945-1969 and 1970-1984 are actually unique 15-year data windows. So the question is, do you trust an experiment based on only a tiny few data points?The other larger and more substantial flaw is that the strategy proposed by the authors is stained by the same flaw as every other simple and mechanical investment strategy: it uses a strategy perfected through data mining. That is, their ultimate strategy recommendation was selected from a field of nominated strategies and the assumption is made that what worked best in the past will work for the future. This is a classic academic's assumption flaw that has been repeatedly highlighted by the failure of other back-tested strategies such as the once popular \\"Dogs of the Dow\\" strategy. Many simple mechanical investment strategies have been invented over the decades and none has ever stood the test of time. I do not see a reason why this strategy will be different.That said, this book is useful for the nuggets of healthy skepticism that everyone should adopt towards any investing endeavor."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"In 1929 an investor owning a basket of stocks representing the S&P; 500 Index would have seen a return of 84%...in twenty years. Making the same investment just two years later would have produced an 818% move. Timing is important. Investing for the 'long run' is no excuse for buying stocks when they are expensive. Stein and DeMuth make the case that an investment may be a bargain when its current price is lower than its long-term average. This is simply due to the fact that points of data tend to follow their own laws of gravity and \\"regress\\" to long-term averages after periods of sharp out/under performance. Let's define long-term as a fifteen year period. Let's also invest in the market using indexed securities and specifically one key market index, the S&P; 500 Index, because of the singular unpredictability of individual stocks.Here are some conclusions: By almost all historical measure today's stock market is still overvalued. The index average of the S&P; 500 and S&P; 500 dividend yield appear to be the most reliable indicators of whether the market is over or undervalued. Own bonds and avoid stocks when they are expensive relative to their long-term averages. The always touted benefits of dollar cost averaging, and mechanical portfolio rebalancing to a preconceived percentage allocation, miss the point. Investments can be timed.The difficulty in all this is that the authors' findings point to the \\"general direction\\" of the market over \\"long periods of time\\". Investors will need the patience of Job and a steely discipline to be in or out of the market for multi-year periods. Meanwhile, experience shows us that much money is also made and lost in the margins, in the short-term. Using the data, investors would have begun moving out of the market in the mid to late 1980's thus avoiding the sharp break in the market in 1987 and the extended bear market that began in 2000. But investors would have also missed the spectacular blow-off gains in the 1990's. Investors would be smart to use this book as a guide for adjusting their allocation to a variety of asset classes and use long-term trends to temper short-term emotion."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Ben Stein is a \\"celebrity\\" of sorts, and his name is associated with money, hosting the TV game show Win Ben Stein's Money. It is only natural for him to write an investment book. I don't know why Stein and his co-author decided to promote this particular investment strategy. Nevertheless, I think this book would familiarize novice investors with some essential terms and concepts, so it might be a good introductory lesson in investing.For a system to use for real investing, I would recommend perusing the columns of Paul Merriman and Mark Hulbert on the CBSMarketWatch website. They have tracked the performance of a simple moving average market timing system. It is about as good as buy and hold, but with less risk, because it takes you out of the market in severe downturns. You have to religiously follow it, of course, even when all your emotions are telling you the opposite. This is a problem with any trading system, of course.Another system followed by Hulbert is seasonal investing -- only being in the market at certain times of the year when gains are most likely.With a little effort, one can find better market timing systems -- the information is free on the web. However, I've read Stein's books for basic knowledge. I refuse to follow his ideas slavishly, and I wouldn't recommend anyone else do so, either."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"I had previously read, and definitely recommend, a book by the same authors \\"Yes, You Can Still Retire Comfortably!\\". It was straightforward, practical, to the point. And in that book, they referred many times to this earlier book of theirs. I thought ... wow! ... if these guys can make market timing as simple as they made retirement planning, the world is a wonderful place.I was wrong. Simple? Yes. Totally simple. But, let me save you the time. While making a convincing case, they \\"prove\\" that only a fool (and I do not mean that with a capital F) would have bought stocks since about 1984. If you believe that, buy this book.In short ... buy their retirement book. Skip this one."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Stein and DeMuth succeed impressively in their primary aim, which is to prove that there are better times than others to invest in the stock market, and that a market timer who pays attention to the signals they describe can achieve significantly higher returns than a steady investor who buys in regardless of price. To determine whether the market is over- or under-priced, they rely upon valuation methods that will please the heart of a classically trained economist or business school student: price, P/E ratio, dividend rate, and price-to-book, comparing today's figures to the 15-year moving average. Examining the performance of the S&amp;P 500 over the past century, they convincingly prove that a strategy of doubling up investments in \\"buy\\" (under-valued) years and avoiding investing in over-valued years delivers superior performance to a buy-and-hold (or dollar cost averaging) strategy.Although what Stein and DeMuth have proven seems like common sense from one angle (buy heavily when prices are low), it is not what most of Wall Street and the financial press urges investors to do. Nor is it emotionally easy to follow this advice, since it means buying at times such as the middle of the Great Depression, when the popularity of stock market investing is at its lowest ebb, and it means avoiding buying when the market is zooming to the moon, and it seems as though every neighbor of yours is making a fortune in Internet and telecom stocks (the late Nineties). Stein and DeMuth do a great job describing these situations, to provide the internal fortitude needed to follow a buy low strategy.The debate over this book arises over how applicable it is to the average individual investor (its target audience). All the research conducted by Stein and DeMuth concerns the S&amp;P 500, and they freely admit that the conclusions they draw do not necessarily apply to other indices, markets, or individual stocks. Furthermore, they look at 20-year results, so the final verdicts for the last 20 years (including the bull market of the \`90s) are not in yet.However, Stein and DeMuth cite many others studies that are aligned with their general strategy of buying under-valued stocks, and summarize the superior results that these other studies report. Because of this, and the book's sharp wit and hard-hitting style, this book is a great introduction to value investing and the fundamental methods of valuing stocks. The boom and bust of the late Nineties and early 2000s prove that far too many investors (and professionals) don't pay enough attention to stock market valuation.This book won't tell you how to make a quick fortune. It won't tell you how to identify the next Microsoft or Dell Computer. But it does tell you how to identify better times to invest in stocks, and can help you avoid huge losses from investing in bubbles. Because of the strength of the book's advice, which recent history proves is so often ignored, and the fact that it is a short and entertaining read, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Although the book's title leads one to believe that this book is about market timing, it is not. It is basically the buy and hold approach with a few twists. This book will not help the average investor time the market, since buy and sell signals may not occur for years. In the interim their portfolios can get decimated.The premise of the book and statistical tables provided in the book are all very interesting, and are food for thought. And the writing style is easy to read. But in the end the value to this approach to today's investor is dubious.The authors use a 15-year moving average with monthly prices of the S&amp;P 500 Index (pg. 27) going back 100 years to generate buy and sell signals. The last buy signal according to this chart was given in late 1984 to early 1985 with the S&amp;P near 325. So investors would have been invested for the last 18 years.They would have had to sit through the debacle of October 1987, and the drops in 1990, 1994, and the terrible markets during the past three years. The S&amp;P 500 Index peaked at 1527.46 on March 4, 2000, and dropped to 776.76 on October 9, 2002. Thus, investors would still be holding their investments using Stein and DeMuth's approach. As of June 26, 2003 the S&amp;P was at 986. If you looked at their S&amp;P chart with the 15-year moving average, you would see that a sell signal would not occur until the S&amp;P drops below 800. Having such a slow moving average does not allow an investor to take profits at market highs. Moreover, who in the right mind wants to give back a large percentage of the profits.The authors main thesis is that by using specific fundamental data - metrics - as they call them, either individually or with better results in combination, the investor can be long the market during uptrends and in cash or equivalents during down trends.They provide statistical information on using fundamental analysis measurements - arrayed from high to low values-to ascertain whether the stock market is overvalued and undervalued. The measurements presented in this book include:Dividend yieldP/E ratioTobin's Q (measure of fundamental value)Price-to-sales ratioPrice-to-cashflow ratioBond yieldsEach of the measurements mentioned above is discussed in a separate chapter showing the performance of investing with that strategy from 1902 - 2001, when the measurement was at a high and low reading. Performance of each metric is shown for 5-, 10-, 1-5 and 20-year periods from each year. Typcially when the market is undervalued according to that metric, the performance in those just mentioned time periods is superior to the years when the market is designated as overvalued.Also, included was a comparison of lump-sum investing vs. dollar-cost averaging. Most of these measurements are shown in monthly line chart with a 15-YEAR moving average imposed on them. Interestingly the buy and sell signals - crosses above and below the moving average- of all these measurements are infrequent and occur around the same time.Overall this book should be of interest to value investors with very long time horizons. It has no value for investors who want to time the market."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"According to the backward looking evidence presented in this book - the answer is an unqualified yes. All you have to do is live to be 200 years old so that you can take advantage of the optimal buying opportunities that occasionally present themselves.Seriously, I bought this book because I enjoy Stein's humor, and there wasn't enough of it in evidence here. The techniques the authors advocate could have been expressed in a 15 page brochure and are basically useless to the typical investor with a 20 year accumulation period.Want to buy this book?

It says not to base your buys on fads and chat rooms or day trading gambles, but to use the basics of earnings, dividends, book value, sales,and long term price trendsto find out whether stocks are cheap or expensive, and what your prospects are for major long term gains based on historical criteria, not on guesswork.If I had known this stuff I would never have gotten caught in the bursting of the bubble in 2000 and with it, I will never get caught with my pants down again.If I had to recommend only one book to long term investors, it would be Yes, You Can Time The Market. I think the people who gave it bad reviews must be day traders looking for the next bubble. This book is not for them. Yes, You Can Time The Market is for serious investors who want to make money without taking insane risks. get it and grow rich slowly but surely."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"A good primer on analysis, moving averages, and cheap vs. expensive. There is a major hole in this book: When is it time to sell? You will find no analysis. Ben and Phil only make the case for when to enter a position in a S&P500; index fund, and when to avoid adding to the position. When the indicator suggests stocks are high, buy t-bills until the indicator changes.If you use one of the timing indicators to put money in, what about taking it out, thereby avoiding a \\"reversion to the mean\\"? If you are only timing an entry and not an exit, you aren't timing... So in my opinion, NO you can't time the market (not by reading this book)."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Great book! Finally someone has written a book that blows away the fog surrounding the sophisticated world of wall street and investing. Value, P/E's, dividends and profits really do matter.

However, in a nutshell, the authors recommend holding onto stocks/funds for 30 years. Unfortunately, I'm only 30 but even now at my tender age with all my investment years ahead of me, I wasn't convinced this is a book I want to trust for the next 30 years.The gains they talk about are hardly convincing. For example, using their approach would have gained 818% in thirty years HOWEVER had you simply done dollar cost averaging, etc you would have gained anywhere from 600-750%. It just depends on the years they were covering. I literally thought to myself...why go through 30 years of this if it will only result in that much difference. Their findings are interesting but not convincing or revolutionary enough to make me change my present investment approach...and I would be very surprised if anybody will be that affected by this book."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"The authors not only completely fail to recognize the roll that randomness plays on their poorly conceived \\"strategy\\", they also profess to being able to eliminate the single biggest risk of investing in the stock market. If their secret really worked, why sell it to anyone? Why not invest everything they have, make a killing, and retire to a country of their own? The worst part is that this pair has access to DFA funds. That's a shame. It gives them credibility when none is deserved. I guess Ben wants to win all the money back (from other peoples' wallets) that he lost in his last game show . . ."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Finally, a stock market book that cuts through all the hype and the jive sales talk and gives serious advice to serious investors.

Beware, though, this book is not for the short term, it's for the long term investor. This book explains the factors used to time the market and how to use them and best of all, shows you where to see the signals (p.163). Complete, easy to read and use and understand. I had a lot of market books that I threw out, without reading, but I saved this one, because of the few passages that I read that sounded very intelligent. Now I have just finished reading the whole book and I am glad I saved it. This is a must read if you intend to invest in the market."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Although Ben Stein is a very smart man he has several incorrect statistics in this book... Most of his ideas won't work in real life investing.. I hope readers take this book for what it is.. A joke! Or at best, entertainment. Do not use this book as an investment guide...."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"This exceptional book is a must-own for anyone who is serious about investing. I would still give the book 5 stars if all it did was prove its thesis in a highly readable fashion that, indeed, the market can be timed. Or, if all it did was show you why it's not smart to put your money into index funds or to buy stocks willy-nilly at any time of year. The book does all of that -- i.e., tell you why and how the market can be timed and prove it in succinct clear prose -- but it does more: while Stein and DeMuth guide you effortlessly through the trees, you feel like you're seeing the forest (and you are). You'll come away from this book knowing how and why to invest your money today, while understanding the entire market from the beginning of the 20th Century. I can only think that Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth had a large staff of folks to compile a colossal amount of information -- essential information for any serious investor -- and then the two of them distilled it all down and made it easy to consume. As I said, this information alone would make the book worth 5 stars (and indeed makes it a steal at its current price), but it's worthy of 5 stars \\"plus\\" because of the presentation. A few weeks ago, The Wall Street Journal reviewed four new books on investing, this one being one of them. Of the four, the Journal liked this book best. It's really a great piece of work."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"This is not a book for traders, but for long-term investors. With wit and wisdom, Stein and Demuth prove their point: long-term investors must pay attention to market cycles. If you buy when the market is high, you are all but guaranteed to wind up under water. You could be buying the best company in the world--it does not matter. Pay too much, and you'll be burned.The investors of the 90s forgot about market-timing.Wall Street told them it didn't matter, and they followed that advice-- to their eternal regret. As another reviewer has pointed out, Wall Street's salesmen want to sell stocks now. Caveat emptor if you pay too much.Maggie Mahar's &quot;Bull! A History of the Boom, 1982-1999: What Drove the Breackneck Market and What Every Investor Needs to Know About Financial Cycles&quot; fleshes out the story and gives investors some sound advice on what to do next. Read both books."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"When I saw the cover of this book, with Ben Stein and his co-author lounging by the pool, bags of gold coins and gold ingots at their side, I thought it would be a send-up of investing books. Oops.In spite of the kicky title and irreverent writing style, this is a genuine attempt to educate investors. It's full of rather conservative, long-term advice. Look for undervalued stocks. Don't jump in and out of the market. Diversify. When Stein and DeMuth talk about Market Timing, it is not a reference to day trading, rather to buying stocks when they are cheap. Buy low, in other words.Their thinking on dollar cost averaging is refreshingly sensible. Instead of the Bob Brinker style of investing a fixed amount every month (or year or whatever) regardless of cost per unit, you should wait until the stock is cheap, then buy as much as you can. This assumes the investor has a brain, and enough discipline not to mess it up, which seems to be Brinker's fear.Anyway, there isn't much new here. It's solid investing advice, breezily presented, so if you need a refresher, or are new to investing, this isn't a bad book to start with."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"The authors provide a lot of sophisticated-sounding analysis to substantiate their \\"novel\\" approach to market timing. As evidenced by some of the reviews on this site, this approach succeeds in garnering the authors their share of believers.However, their analysis is in reality quite unsophisticated. Scratch beneath the surface and you will come across profound breakdowns in logic and a host of invalid analytical techniques. Some of the book's most egregious failings are detailed by reviewer Gaetan Lion.

Their method of analysis is completely invalid; the market timer should not have the ability to double up on his investments if the regular investor cannot. If you can only save $1000 per month, how can you be investing $2,000? The answer, of course, is by borrowing money. Once you factor in the cost of borrowing that extra money into the authors' scenario, the entire market timing system collapses.It's also astonishing that the authors point out but gloss over the fact that their system would have kept your money out of the market for the past 20 years. Despite the bear market of '00-'02, the past two decades have been one great time to be in stocks."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Thanks for co-authoring a serious and well researched treatise on investing.

I found it so interesting and incredibly straight forward that it seemed to take no time to finish. I don't see how anybody could deny that you CAN time the market (in the long run). It contains an incredible amount of good advice. I've cracked the covers of many investment advice books and I simply have not found another so straight forward and easy to comprehend."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"The strategy recommended in this book is as easy as buying shares of an exchange-traded fund (ETF). The hard part, I imagine, would be waiting. The &quot;indicators&quot; described by this book highlight the most recent good times to buy:- summer to fall 2002- march to april 2003- now.Just by looking at the recent history of the S&P; 500 since these &quot;buy points,&quot; one would conclude that this advice is 2 for 2. Will the market turn upwards once again after the summer of 2004, where the p/e ratio is below its 15-year moving average (inflation adjusted)? If so, this book will turn out to be that much more valuable.Definitely a supplement to the &quot;Random Walk&quot; school of investment advice, and worth getting."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Although their premise is sound (buy low) and they quote numerous valid studies, there are serious flaws and bias in their results. Part of it is due to overlapping periods in their tests. The different methods used to demonstrate buying low all have their greatest impact once out 10 and 15 years. They even admit with a 5 year time frame their timing methods don't have much difference over regular periodic investing (DCA).It begs the question, does todays P/E (or P/S, P/CF, Div Yield, etc.) really have predictive power on the price in 10 or 15 years? Another important thing is that in the research papers they quoted, these measures were originally tested on individual stocks and in this book they are being applied to a market index (SP500). They are not the same thing and it is no small difference.If you look carefully at their results, using price alone is about as profitable as using the combinations of criteria they present. It's a very long term system. I think a 15 year moving average is extreme by anyone's standard. Unless your a youngster, (under 40) there might not be enough time to reap the benefits of this system before retirement. And I'll bet if you shortened the time frame considerably the profits would go up exponentially and you would still miss the worst market meltdowns."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"They are making a case for value investing in the book with a 15 years or longer horizon. If you are a trader or a stock picker or have a shorter time horizon, skip this book. You won't find anything you like in there.I found much of the advices sound for the investment public. If you don't have time to manage your portfolio and/or 401K, and you don't feel like dollar cost averaging down in a sliding market or up into a bubble, use the 4 indicators for measuring the relative state of the market to fine tune your investment directions and entry is not a bad idea."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Stein and DeMuth have grabbed the stock market by the neck and, through brute statistical analysis, forced it to reveal its secret inner clockworks.

But no one does all the time and the average person will do far better indexing. The evidence is overwhelming. But this idea of market timing will not die even after a terrible bear market such as the one we have been in. Unfortunately, when it comes to money, most never learn their lesson. Coming out of this bear market, many will be initially successful but over the long haul most will lag the S&amp;P 500. This gets back to the idea that everybody can be a winner in the market and can beat the averages. Even though I believe in stock selection indexing is probably the way to go for those monies we will have to have in the future."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"A lot of common sound investing strategy. The authors test various pricing metrics agains 100 years of stock/market pricing data and show you the results over 5, 10, 20 years.They show you how to use p/e, price to book, price to cash flow, price to moving average, as measures to tell if the S&amp;P 500 is overvalued or undervalued. In years when it's undervalued, buy. When overvalued, keep your cash and wait, but hold long term. (Peter Lynches books tell you the same stuff but with more fluff and junk.) This book is packed with usefull tidbits and historical data that you just can't find easily on it's own.It's the same stuff that you'd learn in an MBA program, that the street professionals don't want to tell you. They want to sell you stocks today because they need commissions today. They'll use whatever metric says yes or make one up, to justify you buying an over priced stock.If you read this book, you'll know more than 90% of the slobs packing $$$ every month into their 401Ks without a clue on what they're buying. They're buying on faith only..... People that buy on faith and hope get crushed by the market at some point when things get priced back on fundamentals.Make no mistake, the finanacial markets are buyer beware. As IPO crazed people, day-traders, and holders of ENRON found out.... Don't be a victim, learn before investing."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth make a strong and easy to understand case for the power of price and the consideration of value in making investment decisions. I am sure that more people are willing to listen to these arguments today than were willing to them in the fevered investment climate of a few years ago. However, I wonder if they will forget the next time the fever hits. Those that forget will simply make more opportunities for capital gains than those that remember and stay disciplined.While the authors say they are using \\"technical\\" analysis to illustrate the principles they are espousing they are not really technical analysts in the voodoo sense you will see hyped in the financial media. They are not telling us that we should buy or sell simply because a pattern type appears in a chart. They do use graphs to illustrate their points, they aren't saying that there are points of resistance or breakthroughs or momentum or whatever.What they do tell us is that there are times when stocks are a good buy and times when they are not a good buy and they give us several methods to consider. There are: 1) Today's price versus the 15 year historical average price. 2) A very helpful and instructive consideration of the P/E ratio that sets aside much of the hype that has been used to try and keep selling overpriced equities. (If P/E is what you want to use, use the discussion in this book rather than anything someone trying to sell you something will tell you.) 3) Dividend Yields (remember dividends?) and why they are important. 4) Fundamental Value where the authors use Tobin's Q for years it is available and other proxies for that when it is not.It may sound as if this is a very dry book and technical book. It is not. It is well illustrated and written in a very helpful and instructive way with real insight into what those whose jobs depend you selling you on buying equities are trying to do to you.The \\"market timing\\" they are talking about here has NOTHING to do with the market timing of day traders. Their argument is that dollar cost averaging is better for the equities sellers than it is for you. There are indeed times that are better to buy equities than others. Stein and DeMuth offer some tools for better seeing when times are better and when it is worse. They also try to provide reasons why we should discipline ourselves to not buy when the herd of independent minds is in its most heated frenzy as it was in the late 90s.Here are just two of the many comments that had me saying, \\"Amen!\\"From page 90: \\"No one knows what future earnings will be. Just because someone is willing to make up a number when asked does not mean it will come true. It is difficult enough trying to get a company's board of directors to tell us what last year's earnings were with any reliability.\\"From page 110: \\"In the short run, the stock market is a high school popularity contest where true value is overlooked.\\"After showing us each of the measures they find compelling they show us how to combine them in ways that augment their value. They also take the time to show us the limits of their method and urge us that misusing what they say here can be lead to disaster. I find this interesting because it is using other methods precisely as prescribed that has lead to disaster for so many.So, what Stein and DeMuth are basically urging us to do is to stop smoking the weed peddled by those trying to sell equities under all conditions and to do some financial exercises to better understand what we are doing with our hard earned and precious funds that we manage to set aside after our living expenses, taxes, and relatives. Here they have given us a nice guide to generating some financial health.They also offer general investment cautions beyond their method along with a helpful and short reading list for further study and consideration. They also have a helpful website that provides some free resources to help with the kinds of analysis the book discusses.All in all I think this book is a much needed call to financial sanity and will help investors a lot more than nearly all of what they get told in the hype of the daily financial media.Thanks Ben Stein and Phil DeMuth for this very readable guide to better investing."},{"Title":"Yes, You Can Time the Market!","review":"Finally, at last, a book about the financial market that combines great advice with true wit and common sense.

As he faces his last days and prepares to write his obituary he reflects on his accomplishments and failures as a parent, minister, and politician. However, the book is more than a \\"fictional memoir\\"- it is a history lesson. Spanning decades beginning in the post-Civil War era through the aftermath of the Civil Rights Movement, Lester writes about the plight and elicits the viewpoint of a humble black man with a strong spiritual center struggling to survive in the racist South. It is his soft tread, strong fortification, and faith in God that keep him sane and alive.As a child, he is the son of sharecroppers and is subjected to destitute conditions as his family deals with infanticide and poverty. He loses his mother to depression, his father to alcoholism, and his older brother to restlessness. He is \\"called by God\\" at a young age and becomes a self-ordained country preacher and primary caretaker to his younger siblings. He, by default, became the voice of his flock and caregiver to all, often being the diplomat when dealing with family squabbles, local politicians, and life-threatening racial situations. Lester creates a flawed character in that Rev. Smith is not a perfect father, husband, or brother and the scenes dealing with his faults are depicted with warm sincerity and sensitivity.In the aftermath of the Civil Rights movement, his type of survival skills were frowned upon by the younger, more outspoken generation. He and others like him were labeled \\"Uncle Tom\\" and called cow-towers. They were scorned by the youth, ignored by the masses, and symbolically placed on shelf to be intentionally forgotten. They did not admire the kind of strength, control, and resolve it took for Rev Smith and others like him to humble themselves in the face of adversity.Despite the slow start, I really enjoyed the book and the history lessons experienced during Rev. Smith's life journey. There were many moments that tapped the emotions - some passages were painful, frustrating, and sorrowful. Lester captures the essence of the eras with splendor - for a black man coming of age in the Jim Crow South, nothing was given and life was not easy and this novel cuts to the core of the sentiment.Reviewed by PhyllisAPOOO BookClub, The Nubian Circle Book Club"},{"Title":"Do Lord Remember Me","review":"Have you ever wondered if your life made a difference? Have you ever feared death? These are the two main themes of Julius Lester's DO LORD REMEMBER ME, a compelling novel in which the main character Reverend Joshua Smith reflects over his life and prepares for his death. As he struggles to gather enough clarity to prepare his own obituary, he reminisces over his experiences as a child, parent, husband, spiritual leader, and political leader. He is reminded of his strength as he fights to maintain his dignity in spite of his rapidly declining health.Reverend Smith's life encompassed several historic social eras in United States history. As a child he grew up around former slaves who had been freed as a result of the Civil War. He received his call to ministry at a very young age, and as a religious leader, he often found himself amid negotiations to help protect the best interests of blacks while keeping them safe (and alive) through the Jim Crow era. He was highly respected by both blacks and whites in the community and a much sought after evangelist. However, the strength of his legacy was weakened as a result of the Civil Rights Era. His willingness to sacrifice his own dignity for the greater good was then looked upon as weakness, and some relegated him to the position of an Uncle Tom. He also notes the strained relationship he shares with his sons and acknowledges some of the mistakes he made in their upbringing.DO LORD REMEMBER ME is a story about a man caught between eras. He is a man of strength and courage even in his weakest moments. As he struggles to prepare his written legacy, I was taken on a journey through history as well as a deeply personal exploration of the main character's life. Julius Lester has done a wonderful job creating characters I could empathize with, at times bringing me to the brink of tears. Reverend Joshua Smith is a character I will not soon forget, and I can only hope that when my time comes I can prepare for death with the same strength and dignity he illustrated.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Do Lord Remember Me","review":"He knows he is dying, but no longer fears Death. He writes his obit, but struggles with his memories and his writing hand as the stroke has debilitated him, but he accepts the late evening of his life with death near. Reverend Joshua Smith, Sr. looks back to morning in Jim Crow Mississippi as the seventh child but did his time begin in 1897 or 1900? He thinks back with affection of his afternoon of fifty-six years with his wife Myra and their children as they worshipped the Lord. Civil Rights led him to hope for his people but Joshua drifts from Afternoon to a Night that no longer frightens him. Joshua with the Lord, his family, and a cigar to guide him no longer fears that ugly monster Death. Evening is calling in Nashville and Reverend Joshua Smith Sr. works on his obituary trying to give himself the solace he gave to thousands as the Singing Evangelist for this is the last day of his life.This reprint of a 1980s classic homage touches readers as Joshua has lived a fill life helping Southern Blacks cope with the changes in society while bringing the Lord to the flock. This passionate reverence to Reverend Smith is also a terrific look at the metamorphosis of the Deep South. DO LORD REMEMBER ME is superb biographical \\"fiction\\" as readers understand how Julius Lester rightfully lionizes his father Joshua by looking back at his life and impending death; clearly the son pays his deepest regard to his father (and his mother) in a fantastic thank you that will touch the souls of readers.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Do Lord Remember Me","review":"Julius Lester tells his father's story with a passion usually reserved for romance, and with an absolute lack of sentimentality.

The chapters are set up so that each character (or pair of characters) gets her own chapter that tells her story. These stories are disjointed and almost totally separate from the broader plot of the Elm Creek Quilters. It's as if each character got her own &quot;spinoff&quot; short story. Each of these detours is forgotten once someone else's story is told. Each of these plots is resolved as an afterthought at the end of the book.This novel had lots of potential. The lead characters are so real and likeable. It makes every quilter wish she had friends like these (or thankful she does have them!).

In this one there were many instances where the names of the characters got mixed up and even though you still know what is going on it's extremly annoying. This is actually the reason why I gave three instead of four stars."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"I felt that this book lacked some of the charm that her other books had. Maybe that is because it had some really deep issues in it which brought up sad memories for me. It made me cry in the end. I have since read 2 other books in this series and I am not disappointed. Jennifer's writing is always real and my rating is strickly personal."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"I'm not a quilter, but I believe that a good book should appeal to me nevertheless. &quot;Round Robin&quot; seemed good on the cover but dissapointed me completely. I was expecting a story about real women and their lives, and instead I found this silly plot and unrealistic heroes. The dialogues were unbelievable and the whole book gave me an overall feeling of soap opera. The book might be great for soap opera fans, but I just wish the cover would make this more explicit... I'm sorry I wasted my money and time on such a book."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"I am not a quilter, so a lot of the terms in this book were beyond me. I also did not read the first book in the series. The idea behind the book is a good one. They way six or seven women stitch their lives into a quilt, but there is just too much happening for one small quilting bee- potential infidelity, graduate school drop-out, marital breakdown, incapacitating strokes, misfit teenagers! Come on. I do like the way the various stories are woven together, though, but I too felt the ending was a bit weak."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"I was looking forward to reading this, but it just didn't live up to my expectations. The book is very poorly edited, which caused me no end of distraction. It has the feel of a religious Harlequin romance novel, although religion never really shows up. I felt preached at. I wanted to know what happened to the characters, but felt like I was having to slog through the poor writing and editing to f ind out."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"Can I give a review on a book I haven't actually finished? I just can't bear to pick it up to read. Her 1st book, The Quilter's Apprentice, was lackluster and poorly editted; but I made it through. I only have this book because Amazon had a 2-for-1 special. I hoped for improvement, but I'm extremely disappointed. It's so boring, it's making me angry! I doubt I'll finish it."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"Being a quilter myself, I was curious if this would be a good read. To my delight, it was one of the best books I ever read. I loved the way the author full described the quilting process. The relationships of the women are intense. I felt as if I knew them. I was so happy that this was a well-written book also. The author's use of language and description made it a pleasure to follow. I felt so connected to Sarah and her mother Carol. I highly reccomend this book to everyone! Thank you Jennifer Chiaverini."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"Reading Round Robin, or any of the other quilting books by Jennifer Chiaverini, is the literary equivalent to being wrapped in a warm, broken star quilt on a cold winter's night.&quot;It was an act of courage to take the scraps life provided and stitch them together, wrestling the chaos into order, taking what had been cast off and creating something from it, something useful, beautiful, and strong, something whose true value was known only to the heart of the woman who made it.&quot;Agnes thinks these words as she appliques the center block of the round robin quilt she and the other members of the Elm Creek Quilters are making for their quilt camp.In a round robin quilt, one woman makes the center block, and then others make the boarders to complement the center square. This book follows the journey of a group of friends as they work to complete a quilt for their mentor, Sylvia, to hang at the main entrance to the quilting camp they have developed together. Each of these women face everyday hardships along the way - dealing with their teenage sons, meeting a new half-sister, choosing the course of their career, and dealing with their estranged mothers. These experiences help guide their choices in their quilts, with them each choosing colors and patterns that represent their individual journeys as women. The book guides us through their experiences, and how both their lives and art become richer as a result of them.In the meantime, Sylvia is attempting to make a quilt of her own. To do so will require courage, strength, and perhaps a bit of love that she has been missing.This book is a wonderful follow-up to the Quilter's Apprentice. It makes the reader feel a part of this warm and caring group of friends, and experience their journeys. There is no need to quilt to enjoy these books - just a need to be able to appreciate the joy that comes through women's lives."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"I came across these books (I bought the Sampler- the first three books) while looking for something to read on vacation. These books are exactly what I have been looking for. I loved getting to know each of the Tangled Web quilters. Their stories were rich and varied. What a wonderful group to be a part of and I am part of their group each time I pick up the book.This is not just a book for \\"crafty\\" women. It's a book for mothers, sisters, daughters, friends, and anyone who has (or has not) ever picked up a needle. Also, there is nothing objectionable in this book - no crude language, no violence, no sex - a very pleasant read. (You can share it with your grandmother!)I have to warn you though - this book will spark another interest besides reading! When can we find time to learn to quilt and can we get together at Elm Creek?"},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"In her second book, Chiaverini picks up the story of Sarah McClure, Sylvia Compton and the Elm Creek Quilters. The Elm Creek Quilters have decided to make a round robin quilt for Sylvia. A round robin quilt is pieced together by several people; one person makes the center and each person in turn adds a border. A new story unveils with each person who works on the quilt and each border added reflects the conflict that person faced. I particularly enjoyed this book because we got a chance to meet the other members of the Elm Creek Quilters who were only briefly introduced in the first book (The Quilter's Apprentice). I would have given this book 5 stars except that the ending was a bit flimsy."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"Elm Creek Quilts novels have me hooked. I can't wait to start the next one each time to find out what is happening in the lives of the women in the story. I feel like I know each one of them and the details of guilds and stitch groups are so true to life. I can see my own life in the stories. It has renewed my enthusiasm for quilting again and to make sure I document each one. The history of the quilts and quiltmakers is the interesting part. How fun to hear about each quilter's life as they worked on the round robin quilt."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"This is really a worthwhile series to read ... very entertaining.

After everything is up and running well, their camp Elm Creek Quilts is advertised on national television, where Sara's mother Carol sees the showing, and the next thing Sara knows, her mother is there at the camp, like it or not. The two women have never ever gotten along at all, and now Sara really feels betrayed by Sylvia, who said she invited Carol in the first place.All of the ladies in this book have their issues they are wrestling with other than Sara. Diane is fighting a big issue with her son Matt, who loves skateboarding, and after skating a in \\"No skateboarding zone,\\" gets hauled in by the police. After this happens, Tim, Diane's husband tries to find a way to make skateboarding possible, and comes up with an idea of building a large skateboard ramp on their private property. This goes over very poorly with a few people, especially Mary Beth next door, whom Diane has never gotten along with at all. Mary Beth calls in the proper authorities and there is a heap of trouble to follow. Diane takes this case to court where the decision will hopefully be reversed to allow the ramp to stay up.Bonnie, the owner of Grandma's Attic is having her own share of problems. After going on to the internet and finding out that her husband Craig is having a secret affair with Terri, she almost loses it. Of course she confronts him later with it getting him to own up to his dreaded secret.Judy,is happily married to her husband Steve, and has a beautiful little daughter Emily. Her mother Tuyet reveals a letter to her that she has received from Emily's biological father, and when Judy receives this letter herself after her mom decides to forward it on, she is in for a big surprise that she has this unknown sister through him, Kirsten, and Kirsten says in the letter that she would like for them to meet. When they do, it is not really an all around happy event, as the other sister Sharon, wants no part of this union.Sylvia has not been feeling her very best an has been having little twinges until she does have a full-blown stroke here in the book. This unfortunate event, from which Sylvia will recover from, brings Carol and Sara together at long last.And last but not least are Gwen and her daughter Summer, who is graduating with a bachelor degree.

He never forgave her affair that she had with Jerry, the bookstore owner's nephew, and as she looks back, she knows this is why she and Sara always had so many problems with each other. So when the two finally come together, it is a very happy time.The Round Robin quilt that was chosen this time, is a quilt that is passed around to each quilter, where each person adds their own block to it before adding the center piece. The blocks all represent the moods of everyone's life at this time, the controversies, and celebrations at the same time all interwoven together."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"this book is so good . the whole series is just great reading, I just hope more people will follow the examples of the charaters and start quilting and making friends.

The group has just formed the quilting camp and Sarah and the others decide to make Sylvia a Round Robin quilt. As each character takes a turn with the quilt, we learn some background and get up to date on their current lives. Each has their own challenges that they are working through, from teenage children, husbands who are struggling with their identity, unknown relations, and a difficult relationship with a mother. An old flame appears in Sylvia's life as she has challenges with her health. The women begin to come together to support each other through their ups and downs. I liked the change in point of view between the different characters and thought the author really started to get the series flowing with this one. I found the quilting descriptions fascinating. An enjoyable, easy to read book."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"The 2nd in the series of the Elm Creek Quilts collection, Round Robin comes after the first book, The Quilter's Apprentice. While this story was just as charming as the first, I was disappointed to find that there wasn't as much quilt lore or instruction in this novel. It was more just a work of fiction than the half fiction/ half quilting fun I had discovered in The Quilter's Apprentice.Instead of focusing mostly on Sylvie and Sarah, this time the novel stretched to cover the trials and tribulations of the whole Elm Creek Quilter's Guild. It takes place two years after the first book and the Elm Creek Quilter's Retreat that is located on Sylvie's historic estate has grown into a big success. So big that they were even featured in a television show on unique backwoods places.However, due to a careless comment she made on the show, Sarah ends up hurting her mother yet again. There's has been a relationship full of trouble and arguments. Seeking to repair that, Sylvie invites Sarah's mother Carol to come and stay at the retreat and learn to quilt, hoping that in the process she and Sarah will learn to respect each other again. This proves tougher than she thinks as the two cannot stop arguing or saying the wrong things to each other. Sarah also finds herself growing further apart from her husband as well. Feeling isolated she has to find a way to deal with her emotions alone.Meanwhile Diane is trying to figure out how to make her son behave. Recently arrested for skateboarding in a no-skateboard area, she realizes that he's not acting out because he wants to, there's literally no legal area to skateboard in town. She and her husband construct a ramp in the backyard, but nosy neighbors report them and the city forces them to take it down. Problems ensue as a result.Judy, who has known all her life that her biological father didn't want contact with her, receives a surprising letter from him. Upon opening it however, she discovers its from her half-sister who is very eager to meet her. She has to decide whether to open old hurts for a chance to meet new family.Gwen and Summer, while they rarely have problems between themselves come to an argument that threatens to break them apart. Gwen has high aspiration for her daughter and wants her to go on to graduate school. Summer on the other hand, has different plans for her life. But she doesn't want to disappoint Gwen.Bonnie, previously thinking her life was happy, finds that her husband has been emotionally cheating on her over the Internet. She also discovers that it could take another step further into a physical relationship. She wants to save her marriage, but isn't sure how to do it.These ladies, with the help of each other, face their problems and try to find the best solution for themselves. Throughout it they have one common goal that ties them together, a round robin quilt that is a surprise for Sylvia. The quilt is really the only bit of quilting information that is done in this novel. It explains how one is made but doesn't really go into detail on the intricacies of it. This was somewhat disappointing to me but not enough for me to not enjoy the story. After all, there are several more books in the series and more quilting lore is probably encased in those stories.The writing in this book is once again done in the third person. Since there wasn't as much quilting information in this book the terminology was definitely much easier to understand. It was easy to connect to the characters and you could care about them. I even felt myself tear up at a few points in the story. Overall I was pleased with the novel.Round RobinCopyright 2000247 pages"},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"I enjoyed the Quilter's Apprentice so much that I decided to continue onto the next book in the series. Round Robin was just as good if not better than the first! I loved getting into the background stories of some of the Elm Creek Quilters and getting snippets of what is going on in their lives outside of quilt camp. The stories in this book made all the women seem so real and like they are your neighbors! You also get a look into Sarah's past relationship with her mother and struggling to move forward. I could so relate to Sarah's marriage and the bumps in the road that come up.

However, the themes with the supporting cast was rather contrived, especially the skateboarding issue and Judy's unknown family situation.The skilled author has used voice most effectively throughout allowing the reader to \\"hear\\" from each character.

I think that it is a good lesson on how art imitates life.It is all brought to a head at the end when Sylvia suffers a stroke.

A very odd mixture of the contemporary American woman novel combined with the tech-jam-packed novels of such as Stephen Baxter, this book may not be for everyone. However, I must state that I have never seen anything quite like it before. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"I started reading Chiaverini's books with her Runaway Quilt book which I enjoyed immensely - this one was almost as good, but seemed quite different. It is about a group of women and their family, it is about everyday life, and how we deal with it. It is fascinating to read the complications which they go through, and they are not always sympathetic characters.This is all based around their desire to make a round robin quilt to hang in the entrance hall of Elm Creek Manor for the summer camp quilters to see on their arrival. They decide to make it as a surprise for Sylvia, the owner of Elm Creek Manor and the quilting camp owner. She has a team of quilters who help her, and these are their stories, Judy, Sarah, Summer, and friends. They have to deal with teenage angst, their future, their past and resolution is not always easy.It reminded me very much of Amy Tan's Joy Luck club - a story abotu women and their families and the problems they have, especially between generations and aspirations with the mother and daugther stories very often being revealed but not to each other.The unfortunate thing, and the reason I did not give this a five, was I felt the outcome of the novel was just too pat. It seemed everything was resolved, not by the women and their efforts, but by Sylvia. It was not satisfying to me. All to soon and too suddenly their was a conclusion. In fact it made me think this had been written for film rather than book. It played out nicely for visual effect, and an easy conclusion.Anyway, it was well worth reading and I will continue with the series but I much preferred the Runaway Quilt to this."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"In the first book of the series, Quilter's Apprentice, the Elm Creek quilt camp is established. In this second book of the series, author Chiaverini takes us deeper into the lives of the Elm Creek Quilters. We read about a mother and daughter who don't get along, a woman whose father deserted her mother before she was born, a mother having trouble with her teenage son, a quilter whose husband is considering adultery, and others. Quilters will probably enjoy this book on several levels, but even a non-quilter such as myself can appreciate reading about the talents of others and will enjoy the friendship and support that the women in this book give to one another."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"The small peaceful town of Waterford in Pennsylvania hosts the Elm Creek Quilters, a group of eight women dedicated to passing on their quilting skills to any interested person. The octet runs a quilting camp inside the Elm Creek Manor. The group makes it on national TV, starring in a segment of America's Back Roads.Two participants, Sarah and Sylvia happen to be two generations apart, but have found a love and support neither one previously knew. Sylvia has known a life of pain and sorrow and desperately wants to spare Sarah from any suffering. She invites Sarah's estrange mother to the manor in hope of reconciling the two estranged family members. Though Sarah fails to open up, the seven other members adopt Carol. Their kindness alienates Sarah until a tragedy makes her realize how fragile and precious a strong relationship is.The characters of ROUND ROBIN are memorable folks who enrich the story line in many ways. Jennifer Chiaverini has shown in a simple but beautiful plot that people need the support of loved ones to survive a crisis. The tale focuses on the human condition and offers up the hope that, no matter how bleak the situation is; good times are near as long as good friends stand by you. Similar in tone to Jan Karon, this novel is a spiritually uplifting reading experience that serves as the sequel to the wonderful THE QUILTER'S APPRENTICE.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"Jennifer Chiaverini scores again with this beautiful follow-up to A Quilter's Apprentice. Elm Creek Quilts has successfully established its series of weeklong quilting retreats, and the quilters have settled into the pattern of teaching assignments, but in this book personal relationships are starting to unravel. Sylvia is determined to reunite Sarah and her mother. Sarah's husband Matt begins to regret what he sees as his and Sarah's dependency on Sylvia. Quilters from all over are coming to Elm Creek to escape and renew, while the Elm Creek Quilters are facing a multitude of personal problems.

Jennifer has a real talent for capturing the feelings that we quilters share about our work and our families. The story is similar to How To Make An American Quilt, in that it shares a little vignette about each of the lead characters and their lives.I recommend this book highly to anyone who wants to read about quilters and their special connection to each other."},{"Title":"Round Robin (Elm Creek Quilts Series #2)","review":"It's a metaphor that may be old, may be even trite, but in this simply lovely story, sequel to &quot;The Quilter's Apprentice,&quot; it works. In this novel, we meet all our old friends, women of various ages and circumstances, who make up the Elm Creek Quilters, formed at the end of the last book.As a surprise for matriarch Sylvia, whose mansion now houses a quilt camp for paying guests, her fellow Elm Creek Quilters decide to gift her with a round robin--a quilt of many designs and colors, each design personal to the woman who creates and sews it. As each woman works on her design, we are allowed into her most private life, and we see--instead of the fairly one-dimensional people we met in the last book--gifted, creative people with richly interwoven lives, just like the quilt. We are privy to their secrets, their sorrows and their joys as each of their quilt sections is created to mirror their most personal selves.In the end, the quilt is a varied collection of interweaving but highly individual sections that--when sewn together--make an exquisite and unbreakable whole. Just like the women themselves and their strong and unbreakable friendship.Like the creation of a quilt itself (which I have never done, but want to do more than ever, courtesy of this book and its predecessor), the story is told quietly, slowly, and in a methodical rhythm that should be boring--but is decidedly not. If you are looking for a fast-paced, hard-hitting story, this is not your book. But if you like a truly &quot;good&quot; book, in every sense of the word, with good old-fashioned values set in a 21st-century world, this is a treasure.I am so glad to have discovered Jennifer Chiaverini and her joy of quilting, and I am so glad to be given the chance to share it with her, even though my quilting talents are nil.

While each member of this group work on a round robin quilt for Sylvia, each member of the group's past or present is explored. While some of the women's lives and dillemmas are more interesting than others, this book continues to delve into the past realtionshup between Sylvia and her sister in law, Agnes Emberly who is also a quilter.This was a good read which was reminiscent of How to Make an American Quilt by Whitney Otto. In Round Robin, the author presents her readers with wonderful characters who I now feel are like friends.

From damaged mother-child relationships, abandonment, dreams lost, angry teenagers, financial difficulties and shifting marital roles these women rely on each other for humor and support. This is wonderful story of the nurturing friendships women fashion throughout their lives. These ties are tested and tugged and strained and still manage to survive and sustain, enriching not only the friends but their families as well. I only wish this was a bit longer and the stories more complete. But this is part of a series and there is sure to be more to come.

There is enough background given that reading the first book isn't a necessity. But, having read both books, this one was like returning to Waterford, Pennsylvania to greet old friends.This book takes us deeper into the craft of quilting, and into the lives of the quilters. We learn the background on several family disputes and watch as the tangled threads straighten out and become a part of stronger, more fulfilling lives.We also watch as two very important and lovely quilts pass from hand to hand, with each quilter adding her own intricate and personal design, until they become the pride and joy of the Elm Creek Quilters.This is a book to wile away a quiet evening, a book that's hard to put down and one which, at least for me, will be hard to forget."},{"Title":"Oxford Latin Course: Part II Teacher's Book (Part 2)","review":"The excellent Oxford First Latin Course is not enough for self study without the Teacher's Book series, which offers essential commentary and keys to exercises."},{"Title":"Pugs (KW Dog)","review":"This book is not about Pugs; it is a book about general dog care with several photographs of Pugs so that it could be sold as a book on Pugs.

The general section (the vast majority of the book) is reasonably well done.

I would strongly recommend it to novice and expert alike, especially for those learning VoiceXML for the first time, or working with it day to day.Grounded in hours of human-computer experiments, and a multi-disciplinary approach to user interface design - this book is a rare combination of a careful ear for human language and dialogue, extensive engineering experience, and pragmatic knowledge of the strengths and limitations of current voice recognition technology.The second edition has brought it bang up-to-date. It cuts through the hype that has always surrounded each successive generation of voice technology - focussing always on the building of robust useable interfaces which work with the user rather than against them."},{"Title":"How to Build a Speech Recognition Application: Second Edition: A Style Guide for Telephony Dialogues","review":"This book is so well organized and articulated it's bound to be of value to anyone doing ASR application development. My own experience in voice response runs from end-user representative to application designer and I found every chapter enlightening. In this second edition of Bruce and David's ASR style guide, I believe the end users will find the new sections on voice portals and managing your voice talent of particular interest. And all users should take particular note of the expanded discussions of usability testing and performance reporting.I found the first version of How to Build a Speech Recognition Application so useful that I actually took the time to compared the new edition, page for page, with the original. That was a relatively easy task, because the authors retained the original section numbering wherever possible. My comparison showed that the original guidelines have been substantially updated, based on continuing research and the hands-on experiences of both the authors and other acknowledged experts. In addition, I believe the new sections and expanded discussions of critical design considerations are going to prove valuable to both novice and seasoned developers.In short, developing effective telephony dialogues is a complex, rapidly evolving and downright expensive task. Given that reality, every development team ought to have at least one copy of this landmark style guide."},{"Title":"Harry Callahan","review":"Harry Callahan was the most influential and important figure in photography throughout the last half of the 20th century. This edition of his work shows chronologically how Callahan's approach to the medium evolved and changed, while his vision remained ever faithful to modernity. The book begins in Detroit, where Callahan worked for Chrysler while pursuing photography as a serious hobby. It was also during this time that he married Eleanor Knapp, who would later become the subject for many of his strongest images. The accompanying essay by Sarah Greenough is succinctly written, blending biographical information to the photographs Callahan took throughout his long, photographic journey (Callahan died in 1999). Callahan's outlook on photography changed dramatically after having met Ansel Adams, at a photography workshop in Detroit. Taking some of Adams' philosophy and refining it, Callahan created his own style of photographing/printing, made apparent by such images as \`Weeds in Snow' and \`Detroit, 1942'. In these images and throughout the rest of his life, Callahan easily turned the simplest subject matter into monumental works of photographic art. The book provides powerful examples of this, in both black &amp; white and color. After leaving his job to pursue photography full time, Callahan moved to Chicago and taught at the Institute of Design. Continuing the experimentation he began in Detroit, Callahan worked and refined his style during his Chicago years, utilizing double exposure, collage, close-ups, and the use of positive and negative space. The book then turns to Callahan's New England period. It was during this time that Callahan taught at the Rhode Island School of Design, in Providence. The book captures this period vividly, with images of varying contrast and mood. Here we see Callahan's ability at adapting to his environment by producing increasingly poetic images of nature, as well as urban and suburban street scenes. In his later work from 1972-1992, the photographs in \\"Harry Callahan\\" document the photographer's travels in other countries, with an increased attention on color. It remains clear by the images shown in his later years, that Callahan continued to explore photography by constantly challenging himself and the medium. Where most photographers are known for one particular style or body of work (Cartier-Bresson's \`decisive moment' or Robert Frank's publication of The Americans), Callahan is known for many different styles and bodies of work. The photographs in \\"Harry Callahan\\" prove this with each turn of the page. Callahan was a photographic artist in the truest sense, if we choose to believe an artists' goal is not only to create but to constantly evolve. Callahan was, continues to be, and always will be an influence to those photographers who seek not only perfection in the creation of their photographic art, but also change."},{"Title":"Harry Callahan","review":"A well balanced selection of HC's best images, though a few things are missingI would have liked to have seen in this book.The essay is excellent, engaging, well planned and rational,bringing Callahan personally to the reader.A must for any modern photography library."},{"Title":"Meet Me at the top","review":"Sarina Russo's book is about leadership and much more. Russo takes us on a fascinating journey of discovery, daunting challenges and achievements against the odds. Her attitude is characterized by the absence of anger and a healthy, passionate, and relentlessly positive outlook on life. This is commendable considering the extreme suffering she endured throughout her youth and early adulthood, from parents and employers alike. Sarina is a living proof that failure can be rich in lessons for those who are mission driven, creative and who never give up building allies and trust, even among adversaries. This book should be a compulsory reading for executives, educators, business and high-school students. It provides an inspiring role model for current and emerging generations of leaders, and everyone frustrated and unfairly treated, who may wish to give up her or his dream. The stories that have propelled many books to The New York Times list of bestsellers pale in comparison with the authentic, credible and humane journey of Sarina Russo. Easy to read for everyone, rich in content and anecdotes, Meet Me At The Top is bound to reach the top of the charts here in North America as it did in Australia."},{"Title":"Meet Me at the top","review":"This book speaks louder and stronger than any motivational book I have read. It was an eye opener for me. I hope to re-read it again to absorb all the lessons in it. Sarina Russo is truly an inspiration for all women fighting for equal rights and justice. I have a very small suggestion. The author could actually be a guiding star for millions of helpless students and women whose life might improve through an online counseling portal."},{"Title":"Meet Me at the top","review":"This book gives us an insight in the way a leader think an act. Following the chronological events of Miss Russo life we can see that those qualities, that are so much looked for these days, are not limited to over confident specialist. They seems to come first right from the heart and the soul. Growth is assured by a very high dedication to principals that must be deeply encrusted in the person. Miss Russo is a model of that determination, backup by a clear sense of what she should and can do. Events, knowledge, money are important but at least it is refreshing to see that work, help, family and friendship can still be a way to realized dreams.The book is not an how-to, nor it is a lecture on business and management principles. It is a story, a very good one, it must be read."},{"Title":"Meet Me at the top","review":"My parents gave me this book hoping I could find a leader to guide me. I am sorry to say this wasn't the book. From the first chapter where she compares herself to the President elect Bill Clinton is comical to dull chapters that tell pointless stories about herself. This is self-indulgent and the reader is better off seeking a mentor somewhere-else. Five stars for narcissism, zero stars for entertainment or usefulness."},{"Title":"Meet Me at the top","review":"Sarina has combined revealing personal stories with classic entrepreneur methods to create a guidebook for people who want to achieve more in life, through business. The book is well balanced and unique because it mentions areas not normally covered in this genre: relationships, heroes, self rewards. For overall comprehensiveness,I consider it the best book in my business library."},{"Title":"Meet Me at the top","review":"This book reinforces everything I learned in both the Boy Scouts and in the military about how to succeed.

They are titled boys who vow to defend the country, live bravely, and never marry, unless they must. If they must, then they will absalutely not fall in love.Griffin Abernathy, one of the members, finds that before he goes off to war, he must break the vow of non marriage, or face dire consequences from his father. Therefore, he marries a young woman under a similiar pressure from her mother, one who he is sure he will never love. Unfortunately, Alyssa puts a severe test to this vow, but he escapes to war before he can fall completely for her.Two years later, Griffin returns home, scarred by the horrors of what he has seen to find his bride a woman he can easily love, too easily. He is sure that she deserves better than him, and is shamed by his vow to not love her. Readers will have to wait and find out if he will allow his wife's healing love to touch his heart or not.***** This is a magical story that evokes visions of THE FOUR FEATHERS .

I really wanted to like this book, but I could just about finish it. Why? I expected these men--of the Free Fellows League to be older. The heroine is in her second season, so I assume she is about 19. None of these characters worked for me. They all seemed to be self-involved and only concerned for the now. He gets wounded and comes back from the war--and whine, whine, depression. The author could have done so much more with these characters.At the start of this book the friends are at school and make this pledge-to form the Free Fellows League complete with rules. Talk about not growing up--just about the entire last half of the book is about why our hero can't love his wife because of some dumb rules he made up as a teenager. And also because he \\"isn't good enough for her\\". I realize that the reader has to take into consideration the timeframe of this book, but enough already. Too much angst, whining and boredom."},{"Title":"Barely a Bride","review":"The first in a new series that revolves around a few titled gentlemen (the Free Fellows League) who have all taken an oath to put off marrying as long as possible, not fall in love and to never, ever be at the beck and call of any woman, &quot;Barely a Bride&quot; proved to be a surprisingly enjoyable read. I cannot tell you why -- the storyline was a rather plain one with few frills (no jealous ex-mistresses vowing revenge, no murder/spy subplot, no secondary romantic subplot) and with no unexpected twists -- but I found myself being rather charmed with this simple little romance novel and have no problem with recommending it as a worthwhile read.Griffin Abernathy (the seventeenth Viscount Abernathy) needs to find a wife as soon as possible: he's about to the posted to the Peninsula, however when his father (the Earl of Weymouth) discovers that his only son and heir is about to risk life and limb (and the family name), he issues an ultimatum -- get married at once and try to beget an heir or give up the commission. And so Griffin has taken to haunting London's drawing rooms in hope of finding a lady he can tolerate being married to. And he thinks he's found just the lady when he spies the Season's reigning Incomparable, Lady Alyssa Carrollton. Fortunately for Griffin, in Lady Allysa he's struck gold. Lady Alyssa is a clever and serious-minded young lady who wants nothing to do with husband-hunting; she'd rather garden. But Lady Alyssa's mother has other plans -- she wants Alyssa to make THE MATCH of the Season. So that when Griffin tracks Alyssa down and proposes that they marry each other so that they each may achieve what they desire, Alyssa agrees to his scheme. But neither counted on the passion (and love) that would spring between them during their brief time together. Will these tender emotions survive their inevitable separation when Griffin rides off to join his regiment? Alyssa knows how she feels about Griffin, but she's not so sure about her husband...&quot;Barely a Bride&quot; may not be to everyone's taste. The authour has chosen to tell her story in as straightforward a manner as possible. And while I do like this novel, I have to own that the book could have been a little more evenly paced. More than half the novel is taken up how Griffin manages to win Alyssa's heart and approval, their wedding and their very brief and passionate honeymoon; a healthy segment is also spent on how the pair copes with their separation. The last quarter of the novel deals with how a battle weary and emotionally scarred Griffin returns home, his attempts to cope and his realization of his true feelings for Alyssa. The trouble with &quot;Barely a Bride&quot; was that the last bit had a rather rushed feeling to it -- suddenly all is resolved. Given the somewhat sedate pace at which the novel was unfolding until then, this sudden picking up of pace gave things a rather unbalanced feel.On the plus side however, &quot;Barely a Bride&quot; proved to be a rather intelligent and sweet love story about two likable people (Griffin, unlike most run-of-the-mill romance heroes, was NOT a quick to judge woman-hating jerk; and Alyssa was intelligent, compassionate and really, really nice), who marry for convenience but who discover something rather precious in their union. I'm still at a loss to explain why I liked it so very, very much ... perhaps I was just in the right mood to appreciate this gem of a romance novel."},{"Title":"Barely a Bride","review":"For me this book began a little light hearted, with the main character Griffin Abernathy, a freefellow, swearing at an early age with 2 other childhood friends to put country before any woman's affections, and never to marry. Unless one is forced to marry, which Griffin finds himself forced to marry by his father's demand before he goes off to war. Griffin an only child, to 2 wonderful loving parents, has little over 2 weeks to find a wife. He settles on a beautifuly unique young lady, Alyssa, and fortunately she is very taken with him. Since she believes marriage will give her, her independence from a quirky irritating family she is thrilled with the arrangements Griffin sets forth, and the couple marries 3 days before Griffin goes off to fight Napoleon. I love the advise that Griffin's father gives his son, about romance, and making memories for his bride and also for himself. For me this is where the book really picks up in intensity - Griffin and Alyssa may only had 3 days but I dare say they made the most of them! The really clicked as a couple and by the time Griffin went off he regretted that he had to leave his wife. I don't think he quite knew he was in love, but Alyssa truly knew. For the next 14 months they wrote, and shared their lives but not really their feelings. And when Griffin is finally injured and comes home a broken man, although a hero, the story really becomes quite and emotional one! I think my only criticizm of the book, would be it needed to be about 40 pages longer - this part of the story was heart wrenching and you just know there was so much healing that needed to be done by Alyssa to bring Griffin back from his turmoil of the war. Alyssa was one of my more favorite heroines, she was so honest and true and just went for what she wanted in a loving, kind way. Griffin might never have wanted a wife, but when he chose he found himself a perfect one!!"},{"Title":"Barely a Bride","review":"Griffin and Alyssa are a wonderful couple whom you immediately fall in love with. I've read the entire series by Rebecca Hagan Lee and they are all excellent simple regency romances. There are no convoluted plots, the sensualness is not overblown, and the two characters are simply two charming people that come together to save each other."},{"Title":"Barely a Bride","review":"This was my first book by Rebecca Hagan Lee, but it won't be my last. Barely a Bride is a delightful read, almost impossible to put down.Griff is a wonderful romantic lead--so sweet &amp; charming &amp; thoughtful. Alyssa is a strong, capable woman who knows her own mind. Their journals &amp; letters add insight to their thoughts and their developing relationship. Their brief honeymoon is incredibly romantic. Griff's time at war is heartbreaking, as is his return home (and his emotional scars).My only real gripe about the book is that Griff's war-induced emotional trauma is dealt with too quickly. Up until that point, the book was practically perfect. Thankfully, the next book (Merely a Groom) indicates that he's still dealing with it, though he continually improves.Both Christina Dodd and Teresa Medeiros recommended this book; they were right. It's utterly delightful."},{"Title":"Barely a Bride","review":"A wonderful, happy story (at least most of it was happy) with characters you fell in love with.

By 1810 Viscount Griffin is a card-carrying member over the ire of his father who demands marriage or else. Griffin needs a spouse quickly while Lady Alyssa Carollton shares his sentiment on marriage, but needs a husband to keep her mother off his back. Griffin and Alyssa wed with each vowing to not love though the honeymoon is bliss.Griffin goes off to war, but upon his return feels the guilt of a survivor when so many died. He wants to continue his vow to the shattered by the war Free Fellows League, but also needs Alyssa to help him cope with his nightmarish demons. Soon he realizes the foolishness of his pledge as he falls in love with his wife, but she refuses to believe him and hides her own deep feelings.Though Griffins' obstinacy becomes irritating, readers will appreciate this deep regency romance due to a strong cast (including the lead male). The story line combines sexual tension with deep angst especially with Griffin suffering from post battle syndrome. Alyssa is a delightful courageous person who as the tale's anchor ensures fans receive a superb novel.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Barely a Bride","review":"Setting - England 1810 --- The opening in this first installment of the 'Free Fellows League' introduces us to three young titled adolescent boys who while away at school formed a secret brotherhood to become England's hero against the impending war with France. Furthermore, they would swear off the leg-shackling institution of marriage at least until the age of 30 or, unless it became absolutely necessary and never, ever, under any condition, fall in love. Years later, Viscount 'Griffin' Abernathy, follows his dream and buys a commission in the cavalry to go and fight the French. His father found out just in time before he left and more or less blackmailed him to find, marry, and beget an heir before leaving for the continent. Luckily, while attending Almacks, he did notice a young woman whom he thought just might suit him and gained an introduction. Unfortunately, she was one of the season's incomparables and her ambitious mother felt that no less than a duke would do for her youngest daughter.Lady Alyssa Carrollton, had formulated her own plans for her life and becoming a duchess just wasn't one of them. Finding herself eavesdropping on a private conversation between three young men discussing something called the 'free fellows league' she was curious to discover just who they were. Later as she realized that the handsomest of the lot was one of the gentlemen she had eavesdropped upon, she was more than interested in finding out who he was. Later introduced, and allowed a waltz then a private conversation she realized that Griffin would be more than an acceptable husband, especially when he offered her the one thing she 'thought' she wanted most - her very own garden to design. I say 'thought' because once she had been kissed by the very handsome young viscount, her thoughts on marriage to the young man became decidedly different. Now the biggest obstacle would be in gaining her fathers approval.I have to say that I loved everything about this book and smiled almost, from the first to the last page! Alyssa was the sweetest and most darling of heroines, Griffin who approached the whole marriage concept as a means to an end turned into a surprisingly wonderful hero! He was so sweet and caring, that you really wanted to hug and squeeze them both for being so perfectly matched up together! I laughed out loud over Griffins interview with Alyssa's father as he bargained for her hand in marriage - her father - what a hoot he was! With splendid secondary characters, wonderfully witty dialogs, hot and sensual seduction scenes, and with the heart wrenching emotions that had me sobbing - this was for me a most perfect read!

Not so. The illustrations are magnificently assembled and well presented, but they accompany masterful information content. The social, political, and technological backgrounds in which the galley and galleon (and their contemporaries, the carrack, caravel, nau, etc., and successor, the ship of the line) arose and drove their evolution are set out. Examination of naval gun technology, a driving force in this progression, is here. History outside of the famous Mediterranean and English Channel scenes are here: the incursion of the Portuguese into the Indian Ocean, and the campaigns of Korea's great Yi Sun-shin. The brief episode of the Chinese navigations is mentioned, but only briefly, probably because the Chinese fought no serious naval battles and established no lasting maritime empire before their politics stifled and suppressed their fleet. For a view of naval power up to the coming of age of the northern European nation-states, this is a choice work."},{"Title":"Galleons and Galleys","review":"The turn of the sixteenth century witnessed the beginning of a revolution in warfare at sea, a revolution caused by the marriage of artillery to ships capable of true oceanic navigation.

At the time, I thought I was looking at something that would have archaeologists jumping to for joy, but it was later dismissed as an old iron demi-culverin of no importance. The following year, however, I was asked to help recover the front 2 feet of a bronze weapon discovered off Gibraltar. It later turned out that an incoming cannonball had hit this cannon at a time when it was hot from repeated use - thus causing it to break. Only last year I was visiting St. Paul Island in Nova Scotia where we came across several remnants from early vessels - including cannon and a large pile of cannonballs.It is, therefore, with a little experience (and I do mean \\"little.\\") but plenty of interest in such matters that I took delivery of \\"Galleons and Galleys\\" by John F. Guilmartin - published by Cassell & Co - to be released for general sale on 18 February 2002.Professor John Guilmartin is a leading authority on military and maritime history specialising on the 16th and 17th Centuries. Whilst many would describe the turn of the 20th Century as a time of revolution in terms of warfare at sea, historians like Guilmartin know how such radical changes happened in an earlier age - albeit on a different scale, at the turn of the 16th Century.Galleons and Galleys is a hardback book measuring 10in x 8in and packed with over 220 pages of fascinating historical detail essential to anyone with an interest in this period of maritime history. Beginning with an introduction which explains the age of the Galleon and Galley, Guilmartin then takes the reader on a journey which incorporates Warfare at Sea 1300-1453, Weapons of War 1300-1650, the evolution of European sailing ships - such as the Caravel and Carrack, to the development of the War Galley right through to the heyday of the supreme Galleon.In a thorough and very professional piece of work, the author includes all the peripheral information such as; Warfare at sea before Gunpowder, World Trade and the emergence of major maritime powers, the gunpowder revolution and the development of naval ordnance, the rise of Swedish sea power, strategies and tactics of the day, Anglo-French confrontations and Anglo-Spanish rivalry - thus giving as complete a portrayal of the subject as one could hope to find.With numerous famous paintings and portraits reproduced alongside line drawings of everything from the various types of ship to a description of the mould used for making cannon, this is indeed a scholarly work made all the more important because it is so easy to read and follow.NM"},{"Title":"Galleons and Galleys","review":"For more than 250 years the Spanish galleons connected Manila and Acapulco whilst the Atlantic Fleets connected Veracruz with Seville, in all that time only four Manilla galleons were captured by British or Dutch pirates and only one Atlantic Fleet was destroyed in open battle.

The authors of these essays, however, do just that. Uninterested in cliched talking points or partisan claptrap, they engage in a serious consideration of marriage's meaning and importance. The resulting product is a careful analysis of the significance of marriage for the individual, for the family and for political society.Roger Scruton reminds us in the book's first essay that institutions, including marriage, may be viewed externally or internally, from third-person or first-person perspectives. Skillfully weaving together literature, history and the phenomenology of personal experience, Scruton argues that marriage's full importance can only be comprehended through considerations from both perspectives. This essay is an appropriate choice to precede what follows, because in subsequent essays, the authors approach the topic mindful of the differences inherent in these two perspectives and determined to examine marriage from every angle imaginable. Furthermore, they are remarkably capable of engaging in this challenging task, experts as they are in a variety of fields ranging from law and public policy, philosophy, sociology, economics, history and political science. Though the authors are among today's leading academics and scholars - from Princeton, Amherst, U Chicago, Stanford, UVA, and so on - this book is quite accessible to the lay reader. In the end, the readers will be left more greatly aware of the breadth of issues implicated in contemporary marriage debates and more capable of participating in civil discourse through evaluating common arguments and advancing his or her own arguments as well.But this is not to say that the average reader will find each essay in this book extremely rewarding. The essays are all very well written, but unavoidably a reader's own interests will dictate that he or she will find some of these essays more approachable or interesting than others. This is simply the downside of the fact that this book seeks to leave no facet of marriage's significance out of the discussion. Yet the upshot of this same fact is that there is a great deal in this book that will be of value and appeal to everyone with any interest in considering the meaning of marriage.The Essays:Foreward by Jean Bethke Elshtain, Laura Spellman Rockefeller Professor of Social and Political Ethics at the University of Chicago and the Thomas and Dorothy Leavy Chair in the Foundations of American Freedom at Georgetown University1 - \\"Sacrilege and Sacrament,\\" by Roger Scruton, professor of philosophy at the University of Buckingham2 - \\"What About the Children?

Alarmed over this possibility, eleven states have overwhelmingly approved defense of marriage initiatives. In this context The Meaning of Marriage is making its debut.In the form of eleven scholarly essays The Meaning of Marriage is an anthology of variations on the theme that marriage is foundational for civilization and as marriage goes, so goes the family, and so goes society. Marriage, it is argued, has been severely destabilized by fifty years of disastrous experiments including: legal sanction for unilateral divorce; legal sanction for unrestricted access to contraception; and, legalization of unrestricted abortion. This produced among other problems a divorce rate of fifty percent, an out of wedlock birthrate equal to one third of all children (two thirds of all black children), and a dramatic rise in poverty among women and children. Nevertheless, our public policy blithely promotes these remedies for the good of society. Promoters and defenders of these policies are taken to task in the essays with reasoned arguments and impeccable research. Yet, the concern of the essays as a whole is not just to stop the bleeding, but also to sound a clarion call to a threat more destructive to marriage than all previous experiments combined, - the unintended consequences of legalized same sex marriage. Unlike predecessor experiments, advocates of same sex marriage seek a redefinition of marriage. This, it is argued, effectively abolishes marriage, and along with it, the possibility of any coherent alternative social standard for sexual behavior.Roger Scruton and Robbie George offer two philosophical analyses of marriage. Dan Browning and Elizabeth Marquardt elaborate on \`kin altruism' as a family benefit to society. Economic historian Harold James highlights how harmonious continuity of economic activity across generations and time spans is ensured by family businesses. Jennifer Roback Morse and Siena Segrue in separate essays contend with social libertarians who contradict themselves by supporting unilateral divorce and same sex marriage respectively. Both require government meddling with the family, which violates libertarian principles. David F. Forte argues that the Founding Fathers understood the family, as a school of virtue, to be indispensable to republican government. Hadley Arkes and Katherine Shaw Spaht in separate essays unpack the legal philosophy and the recent legal history contributing to the unraveling of marriage and family law. Maggie Gallagher debunks much of the phony social science under girding our contemporary social engineering projects. Last but not least, W. Bradford Wilcox, shows how contraception and abortion have undermined the common good and visited disproportionate harm to the poor by trifling with traditional concepts of marriage.The Meaning of Marriage is an excellent primer on our contemporary culture crisis. It provides philosophical, legal, psychological, political, and economic perspectives and includes a helpful topical index. I highly recommend this outstanding and timely study for serious, and particularly for complacent, Americans."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Marriage: Family, State, Market, And Morals","review":"Dr. George has assmebled an excellent group of contributors to the eponymous subject of the book. The authors answer the question, \\"how does the marriage of two people of the same sex affect me?\\" (the \\"me\\" being a heterosexual married person) by detailing the major principles on which marriage is based - permanence, fidelity, child-rearing, personal growth - and how same-sex marriage cannot meet them. Apparently the public feels the same way in its overwhelming support of defining marriage to be the union of a man and a woman. The challenge of same-sex marriage has one benefit - that is the stimulation of thoughtful and informed persons to speak out as they do in this collection of essays and bring clarity of answers to questions not previously asked. It should be in the library of every thoughtful citizen."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Marriage: Family, State, Market, And Morals","review":"Our argument about marriage goes much deeper than a simple argument over fairness, or equality.\\"In the modern mind, marriage has become a proxy for happiness and fulfillment, an adult centric rite (and right) in which children play little (or no) part. Marriage has changed primarily because of the intrusion of the idea that it is about the search for happiness. ... In its extreme version, the modern view treats marriage as simply an extension of a search for consumer satisfaction. If I buy a good at a store, I am party to a contract, which I participate in because it enhances my satisfaction at that moment. There is no obligation to treat it in a particular way. If I get pleasure from buying an expensive watch and then smashing it on the ground, the worst that I can be accused of is eccentricity or perhaps tastelessness. And we perfectly well expect that over the course of time, a watch will wear out and need to be replaced. This view of marriage as a search for satisfaction is now more or less prevalent. ... The result as far as the family is concerned is that children are seen as a nuisance, because the key relationship is that of the married partners. Recently, for instance, the National Marriage Project at Rutgers University concluded that \\"Children seem to be a growing impediment for the happiness of marriages.\\" -The Meaning of Marriage\\"This argument over marriage is the surface of a much larger argument, a clash of worldviews that shapes and shakes the very foundations of civilization itself. This book argues that if marriage fails, society itself fails. The case is strong from every perspective the authors of the essays here choose to engage --and the variety of directions from which they take the issue on is astounding. The reader might expect to see a religous treatment of the topic, and they will find that here in Sacrilege and Sacrement. What you might not expect is a hsitorical treatment (Changing Dynamics of the Family), or a liberal treatment of the problem (What About the Children?), or even a look at the problem from libertarian point of view (Soft Despotism and Same-Sex Marriage). Each essay is well written, deserving a full treatment on their own, but there isn't enough space here to manage a feat of this magnitude. The most interesting essays in the collection, simply because they are from unusual points of view, or provide interesting arguments against same-sex marriage, are the chapters addressing the issue from an economic and societal point of view. Specifically, Why Unilateral Divorce Has No Place in a Free Society, Soft Depotism, and What's Sex Got to Do with It? Three crucial points are made in these essays that need to be broadcast far and wide. First, moving marriage out of the realm of one woman, one man, leaves society with no other basis on which to actually define the institution. The underlying logic in redefining marriage either in terms of sexual or \\"loving\\" relationships is to destroy marriage itself --and that appears to be the point of those who want same-sex marriage. If you define marriage as a \\"loving\\" relationship, then parents should be able to marry their children (a point indicated by the divorce of parents and children already available in some areas of the world), sisters should be able to marry sisters, etc. If you try and add sex into the mix, the problem actually worsens rather than abates. If the argument that marriage isn't about producing children holds, then there are no bounds or limits. An institution without bounds is simply not an institution at all --all things must be defined by what they exclude as well as what they include. Second, if marriage is loosed from its relationship to children, then the job of rearing children must be taken over by someone --and the only \\"someone\\" remaining is the state. But once you cede raising children to the state in the name of freeing marriage for more selfish fulfilment, you inevitably slide into despotism. There is simply no way to turn children over to the care of the state without turning all privacy, freedom, and culture over to the state as well. Turly, same-sex marriage is a case of giving up freedom for pleasure --and giving up freedom for pleasure simply reduces humans to the animal state where there is no freedom or pleasure.This is a must read group of essays for anyone serious about understanding the debate over marriage, refreshingly tying same-sex marriage with no-fault divorce, and presenting very strong arguments from almost every angle."},{"Title":"The Meaning of Marriage: Family, State, Market, And Morals","review":"i work in the social science field so this is good information to know. i like how it contains writings by several different scholars. some are easier reads than others. the reader learns how redefining marriage opens the door for more issues. it will be watered down to convenient living arrangents and people will not hold the institution of marriage in high regard. it discusses a whole lot more. definitely recommend it"},{"Title":"The Meaning of Marriage: Family, State, Market, And Morals","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this work.

Considered the father of the Afrobeat style, Fela Anikulapo Kuti is as famous for his music as his personal life. These essays investigate his life, his art and his legacy, including the controversial issues.Knox Robinson explores the cult of Fela as it exists today, Mabinuori Idowu recounts the key events in the life of the legend and Joseph Patel discusses Fela's influence on hip hop and dance music. In her first of two essays, Vivien Goldman looks at his spiritual life and in the second she writes about the visual aspects of his world, like fashion, dance etc.There are also interviews with Fela's son Femi (by Jerome Sandlarz) and an interview with Fela from 1983 by Barney Hoskins. A 1977 diary of John Collins that he kept while acting in the film Black President is included. Other contributors include Delede Jegede who writes about cultural aspects of Lagos and Ghariokwu Lemi, the artist who designed Fela's album covers.The book concludes with an index and a Fela Timeline from his birth in 1938 to the latest related events in 2003 after his death in the late 1990s. There are 11 color photographs and about 30 black and white ones. The many illustrations include cartoons and a map of Nigeria.This is a great book that illumines the life and work of this fascinating Nigerian musician and counterculture hero. His lyrics are quoted extensively but there is no systematic rating or reviews section for his albums. The inclusion of a discography would certainly have enhanced the book, especially as a reference source."},{"Title":"Fela: From West Africa to West Broadway","review":"This book is a collection of essays about Fela's history in music and politics. It also contains information about his lifestyle, which was unique, to say the least. The perspectives are so varying that one can't help but conclude that he was enigmatic, sometimes brilliant and other times misleading or delusional.Fela's music was introduced to me 20 years ago by a roommate from Ghana. I was lucky enough to see Fela in concert. He was incredibly charismatic and his music took over the unsuspecting audience at The Greek Theater in L.A. I didn't know he'd been tortured when I saw that concert, but it makes sense to me now, after seeing the fierceness with which he carried himself. The man had a Muhammed Ali type confidence that he backed up with an incredible show.My goal in buying this book was to learn more about the man. After reading these essays, I was delightfully puzzled and realized that nobody really understood him--I wonder if he understood himself. Regardless, his music was groundbreaking and remains unique. It's still fresh."},{"Title":"Fela: From West Africa to West Broadway","review":"I looked forward to this book. I have several Fela recordings and know somewhat about his never less then interesting life. I could not get pass the 1/2 way point in this book. The author is such a fan that his judgement was clouded by nothing but praise and affection. There is absolutely no balance what so ever in this bio. Having read what I did you would think that Fela invented everything in music and is the second coming of Christ. I regret buying this and don't say I did not warn you. Maybe Hollywood's bio pic may bring notice to Fela for his real accomplishments. Bot perhaps that will be another botched attempt like this book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The best use of sarcasm and humor to highlight the pains of life, and especially of growing up, that I've ever seen. I never thought I'd write a review but this book put me over the edge. You're missing a lot if you don't read it."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Don't ask, don't tell should be the subtitle. Don't ask what it's about (everything? nothing?) and don't tell him, Sedaris, that he's a genius because I have the sneaking suspicion that his wit comes from a place rooted in childhood insecurity. The more confused, lost, and misunderstood he is, the funnier the essay. This is the best collection of essays I have ever read. Period. Laugh out loud, kick my partner at 3:00AM to read aloud a passage, call all my friends funny."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I'd heard his name spoken on NPR and, for several years, after hearing people speak about him, I began to wonder \\"Who is this David Sedaris guy and why are people talking about him?\\". So finally, last week, I bought \\"Naked\\", and the evening I finished it, because it was so much fun to read and desiring more but lacking an immediate source for fresh material, I turned back to page one and began to read it again. Like riding a great roller coaster, or eating chocolate cake, it was just as great a thrill the second time around.\\"Naked\\" is one of the most charmingly wicked collections of stories. Well-traveled and broadly experienced, Sedaris is a seemingly casual, but actually keen, observer who possesses a rare ability to find humor in the behavior of the most annoying person and in the circumstances of the most aggravating situation, and to pass it along to his reader.I had to laugh with delight at the author's description of his mother, obviously his mentor (and perhaps, muse), and how her sardonically wry and biting wit permeated every facet of his family's life, and how, her resolve to not kill her offspring buttressed with a bottle of booze and pack of smokes, she fought to maintain a bit of sanity in an insane world populated by six unsympathetic kids and one very peculiar husband. Sedaris is a Greek name, and his first generation Greek-American father and his family was a treasure chest of gem-quality quirks waiting to be plundered. Sedaris' recollections of his ludicrously redneck brother and their flamboyantly off-kilter sisters, Amy and Lisa, are like items of priceless value, filling the book's cavernous vault of humor. His family, and also complete strangers, form a deep and seemingly endless vein of fabulously funny material which the author successfully mines to the great benefit of the reader.Sedaris doesn't only make fun of others. With honest ease, he reveals his own vulnerability and foibles. Occasionally tenative, but fearless, he takes a very funny look at the role his sexual orientation plays in his life, just as he examines the manner in which others relate to him. With a refreshing irreverence for traditional comedic literary convention, and with great gusto, he stripmines the strata of his accumulated experiences and gives the reader privileged insight into his life, all the while unabashedly poking fun at himself to wonderously funny effect. By doing so, Sedaris enables readers how to lighten up and find humor in the mundane experiences of their own lives.If you love absurd and irreverant humor, you will relish every minute spent reading this book. Finishing it, you will feel as if your best friend has just moved away - a bit sad but craving an immediate reunion. Like squeezing the juice out of a spent grapefruit half to ensure you don't miss a drop of pleasure, you will try to milk the book for every laugh, and turning back, read your favorite parts again. I rarely laugh out loud when reading, and I don't know if it was just my new medication, but reading Sedaris' work caused me to laugh out loud and made me want to share my experience with whomever is nearby.After finishing \\"Naked\\" I hurried to buy \\"Me Talk Pretty...\\", I just ordered everything that Sedaris has written or on which he has collaborated, and impatiently await publication of his next book, because now I know who this David Sedaris guy is."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"NakedBy David SedarisAs I was walking through my public library looking under the autobiography section the book Naked caught my eye. I scanned through the description on the back and it looked fascinating. People say you can't judge a book by its cover, but with this book I had a pretty good idea this would be the right choice. The first night I read it I was up late, already hooked on the story.Naked is a very compelling book that keeps you wrapped up in the interesting anecdote from beginning to end. David Sedaris is not afraid to be outrageous. This book gives new light to autobiographies. Each chapter is a short story. This collection of sidesplitting tales is written with wit and character. In this book Dave tells the story from when he was a young boy fighting his way through the public school system to when he grows to be a man The author takes us through his experience of realizing that he is much different from most every one else. If you like Naked, you might also enjoy reading some of his other books such as: Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, and Barrel Fever.Naked, was on the New York Times top ten best seller list, and was recommended by Entertainment Weekly. As you step into this book you will get lost in Dave's creative, strange, and unique world. Every character in this book has its own personality, and soul. Each chapter brings new light into the zany mind of Dave Sedaris. I would recommend this book for the people who enjoy a good laugh every now and then, and who like to be completely entangled in a great story for hours on end. People who know how it feels like to be left out or picked on will relate to David Sedaris's adventures as well as his descriptive and personal style.By Luke Rodgers"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"When I first set out on this project to review an established writer's work, it was difficult deciding which author's work I was going to dissect. After skimming through several novels' introductions, I chose to review Naked written by the overly dramatic and hilarious David Sedaris. Since I had already read some of David's literature, I knew that I would enjoy this eclectic autobiography. The first thing that attracted me to this book was the name itself; Naked. Was David an established nudist whose life, he thought, in itself a good story? Was he revealing how society was impacted by the human body? In this review, I am going to try to decipher why David titled this book Naked. After reading through the collection of essays, I'm first going to break down what Naked initially meant to me.Naked is a collection of essays that describe memorable bits and pieces of the author, David's, life. Although some readers may not enjoy his attention to detail, I found that it was his detail that allowed us, the reader a glimpse into whom David Sedaris was and is. He revealed his inner thoughts in various situations. When he was a child, David had many nervous habits that he would have to carry out to make himself feel comfortable. In the 2nd chapter, A Plague of Tics, David, in great detail, goes through a day in his life including the walk home from school where he finds it necessary, not only to count his foot steps, but to lick, jump over, kick and read various objects on his way home. The way in which he describes these events it is as though there is absolutely nothing wrong with his behavior and that it is completely normal.His abnormal, deranged family is brought into the novel in the first chapter but we don't really get to know them until the end of the collection of essays. With each \\"episode\\" or essay that I read, I got to know David better. While reading through the novel I was waiting for a deciding moment in which the title would clearly have relevance to the sum of the essays. In the final chapter, David decides to go on vacation to a nudist camp. I had thought for sure since this essay was titled Naked that it would have tied all the essays together to make sense of the books title. On a planned vacation from New York City, David rents the front room from a trailer, yes a trailer, and travels by bus, since he can't drive, to a nudist camp. From the moment he arrives, he is unsure of his willingness to be there. Although this chapter was significant, there were many other chapters that I believed held more significance to the collection.So why was the book titled Naked? Throughout the beginning of the collection of essays, I was very curious of his sexual orientation. As a child, through his descriptions of daily activities, I knew that he was different. He hinted that he was homosexual but it wasn't until the end of the essays that he openly stated that he was attracted to men. As well as David having a gut-wrenching satirical humor, he also possesses a realistic view of the world that he doesn't hold back. Through dialogue with dozens of insignificant figures in the book, I got a real sense of how David viewed the world. It wasn't necessarily the words that he spoke, but it was the thoughts that he had when he spoke to these characters. Allowing the reader in on very memorable thoughts meant revealing himself. I came to the conclusion that this was why the book was titled Naked. It wasn't the fact that David was, for a short week, a nudist. It also wasn't titled Naked because of his views of how the world viewed the human body. It was because of David's revelations. Throughout all his adventures, he had allowed the reader to know his deepest thoughts. When his mother died, when he discovered God, when he traveled across the country and when he realized he was different, he had revealed his true self in his literature. This collection of essays was a release of all his inner thoughts and dialogue. After revealing so much, David truly, must have felt Naked."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is my first audiobook and thus my first experience with the effect live narration has on text. I will say that every other David Sedaris essay I have read has been uproariously funny. I read both Holidays on Ice and Me Talk Pretty One Day.This book wasn't as funny. I enjoyed the honest and heartfelt coming out story of &quot;I Like Guys&quot;. However, many of the essays were sad or even boring. I felt myself wishing the segment would be over so I could see if the next one would be funnier. I had no idea David's childhood had been so painful. I guess this just wasn't what I expected from the author of Holidays On Ice.I cannot gauge if I may have found it more entertaining to read than to listen to."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"In an uneven series of stories Sedaris displays the same irony and sarcasm that make his bits on NPR so good. These are confessional stories about his childhood and early adulthood, and mostly are stuff you'd never want anyone to ever know about you or your family. Some of the stories really are outrageously funny. As a collection, it drags a bit. These stories suffer from the lack of the particular lilt of the voice which makes him so terrific on the radio. Without having heard it I suspect the audio version of this would be quite a bit more entertaining."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read Naked after I heard David Sedaris on NPR one morning reading one of his works. This book was easy to read and very engaging. I couldn't put it down. It was extremely funny."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read Naked on the recommendation of a great many people, and it may be because it was so highly recommended that I was somewhat let down. After being told time and again how clever and funny David Sedaris' writing was, I found it amusing at best, but never particularly enlightening or knee-slappingly funny.Naked is, simply, a collection of autobiographical essays relating to various events in Sedaris' life -- the years he lived with his grandmother, a youthful trip to Greece, adventures in hitchhiking and, as the capper, a visit to a nudist resort. Some of the stories are quite funny, others less so. A few are downright maudlin. There's nothing wrong with any of them, but I was never particularly engaged either -- chalk it up to personal taste. I don't really get into nonfiction unless I find the author or the subject matter particularly engaging. In the case of Naked, the author and subject matter are the same thing, and it's just not something I got excited about."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I guess I'm the odd man out where this book is concerned. I laughed exactly one time from the beginning of the book to the end. For the most part I found the humor a veneer--the deeper story is sad, dysfunctional, un-self-regarding, and more than a little sordid. Mind you, I have nothing at all against a gay perspective--that's not it. But the situations the narrator puts himself in, his unaffectionate, foulmouthed family, the pitiful, forgotten characters he encounters, his superficial, smarmy reading of others, and (hence) his lonliness...this book struck me as more like a milder version of Dave Pelzer's \\"A Child Called It\\" with jokes and much better writing. All I can say is that it's a good thing that the author has a sense of humor, because if he didn't, God knows how screwed up he could have been.I'm not panning it--it's very well written and intermittently entertaining, and not a difficult read. I just didn't find it very funny. But then, I didn't much care for the Harry Potter books, either."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is truly \\"Hilarious\\". The first part of this book had tears flowing from my eyes. In the latter part of the book, David does indeed stand \\"Naked\\"..!!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is a compilation of short, non-fiction bibliographic stories (though I doubt the full veracity of some of them, but that's poetic license I guess). Being that it was a lot of short stories, it was easier to like the whole book because even if you got to a story where you had no interest, it didn't last long.I did enjoy reading this book but it was a different experience than many reads, largely due to the fact that I have heard both Sedaris and some of these exact stories on This American Life. That gave me the authors voice already. I do not know if that was better or worse, but I had to stop and read some passages again. Not as much as I have had to do with other books I have read recently (Sleepwalk with me, which I just finished).I will definitely seek out some more Sedaris for the future."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I loved everything about this book! Flipping through the pages begs me to question the authenticity of his 'stories'.

Lots of laugh-out-loud moments. I like other books of his better. This one seems a little slower, but still quite funny."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"After reading Me Talk Pretty Someday, I was expecting more laughing-till-I-was-crying stories. Most of these are much heavier and longer. Still has its moments, but this one won't make you look ridiculous laughing out loud on public transportation."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"For the first part of \\"Naked,\\" I found myself analyzing every sentence to guess what was true and what was embellished or made up. This book is more \\"based on a true story\\" than actually a memoir. But once you let go of having to believe every word, the outrageous exaggeration is just hilarious. It drags on a little in the middle, but it's hilarious most of the time."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I already owned the print version of \\"Naked\\" when I purchased the e-version (my husband noticed it was on sale). Some of the essays are laugh-out-loud funny, and some are more dramatic, such as when David Sedaris talks about his experiences hitchhiking or caring for a quadriplegic friend. He doesn't pull any punches. I wish parts of \\"Naked\\" could be combined with some of the essays in \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\". His observations in both books cover emotions about family and acquaintances that everyone can relate to in some way. He also discusses his homosexuality and the attitudes of others about gay people, which are both funny and perplexing. My favorites in \\"Naked\\" are Chipped Beef, Next of Kin, The Drama Bug, Dinah The Christmas Whore, and Ashes. I thoroughly enjoy his writing style, even in the essays that are not my favorites."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This was the first book I've read by David Sedaris. It does not disappoint. His stories range from laugh-out-loud to cringeworthy, and are nothing if not original. I really enjoyed reading his various tales, told with just enough sarcasm and self-deprecation. I look forward to reading his other books.His writing reminded me of another gay humorist/memoirist Wade Rouse. His bookAt Least in the City Someone Would Hear Me Scream: Misadventures in Search of the Simple Lifeis absolutely hilarious. Made me spit out my milk one morning. I also recommend Chuck Klosterman's books likeFargo Rock City : A Heavy Metal Odyssey in Rural North Dakota. All of these are perfect to read on a long plane flight! It's just the person sitting next to you might think you're strange as you break out laughing."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I was a little disappointed with \\"Naked\\" after reading \\"Me Talk Pretty\\". Sedaris' trademark style is there, but as the book takes us through his days of boozing and drugging, all the way over to the punchline (the nudist camp) - the entire experience has an aimless voyeur feel to it. Some stories don't really go anywhere and in general the book is not as laugh-out funny as \\"Pretty\\". However, the essay about Sedaris' mother's death is bittersweet; for a man who usually doesn't dwell on the emotionalism of his *characters*, the emotional impact of that essay came through in a very strong way for me."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Another great collection of hilarious, heartfelt, sometimes jaw-dropping stories from one of my favorite authors. The piece in which he writes about his childhood \\"nervous tics\\" is absolutely side-splitting.

Sometimes I would start howling with laughter in the most inappropriate places (restaurants during lunch, etc.) and people would want to know what I was reading about. My answer was always, &quot;you have to read it for yourself.&quot; No words can adequately describe it because I think that everyone will get something different from it despite the fact the the humor is universal. Mr. Sadaris' biting wit cut to the core of my being. The man has a natural talent. I can't wait to read his future works, but Naked will always be one of my all-time favorite pleasurable experiences. You GO, Boy!!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I haven't read a book as side-splittingly hilarious as Sedaris' in many years. I saw so much of my own self in him (although I never licked light switches), with his wry observations of family life, growing up, and reaching adulthood, that I could not put the book down. David has an amazing gift to meld the idiosyncracies and poignant realities of ourselves and people we know, love, or meet in everyday life, and his essays provided me with refreshing reminders that maybe I'm not as weird as I thought I was :) I've never heard him on NPR, but I do look forward to his other stuff with enthusiasm."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I like his witty approach to this memoir, especially in the last essay Naked.

After finishing the whole thing in an afternoon, I was amazed at the quality of writng (honesty, humour, and vigilance) that David possesses. Please, write more.

Phew!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I started the book at a bus stop just a few blocks from a major hospital. At the bottom of the first page, tears streaming down my cheeks, a little old lady asked me how long before our bus would arrive- she figured I must be on the way to the hospital because I looked like I was in pain.Although I completely enjoyed the book I did have a few problem areas. I think the difficulty all stems from having heard those sections on 'This American Life' on NPR and they were all still well worth the reading. Having been an outsider visiting a nudist camp I can identify with EVERY one of his observations right down to racial and body piercing attitudes. I can't wait for more!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is, without a doubt, the funniest book I have ever read. I had a constant smile on my face while reading it and was constantly being stopped (on the street, on the subway, at work, in class) and asked what I was reading because of my sudden outbursts of hysterical laughter. I re-read it as soon as I was finished and have added the hardcover to my library. My personal favorite story: Dinah, the Christmas Whore!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"a book this funny has to be listed as humor, but it's much more profound than what you usually find in the category. Sedaris has managed to reveal a great deal about our weaknesses, our petty hatreds, and self-interestedness and yet all of his stories are blisteringly funny. i've heard him read in person and his voice adds to the experience. for those that haven't had the chance, i recommend buying both the book and the tape."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read Naked on a flight between D.C. and California. While downing Diet Coke and &quot;snacks&quot; I laughed aloud while most other passengers were watching reruns on overhead TV. I saw my mother in his mother, I saw my father in his father, I saw me in Lisa and I saw humanity, original and wacky, sweet and surviving in David. More, oh please ... I want more."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"A warning about not reading NAKED while eating, operating machinery, or travelling in large groups should appear on the book's back. It is impossible to get through a single page, let alone the entire book, with out laughing out loud. And I don't mean the kind of laughter that accompanies something funny; I mean the kind of laughter that accompanies something that is undeniable truth. David Sedaris is a master satirist, a comedic magician whose spells are always slightly off-kilter, and irresistably warped. Always irreverent, and always dead on-target, NAKED manages to capture everything that constitutes perilous modern living and turns it into pure, often deliciously nasty, cathartic gold. I for one, read on with delight as Mr. Sedaris managed to put the &quot;fun&quot; back in dysfunctional. Pure brilliance. I bow before this twisted witty genius."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I received my copy of &quot;Naked&quot; from my sister as a birthday gift in December, and because of a particularly stressful semester, have not had a chance to read it until now, mid-May. What a pleasant surprise it was to read this book and be entertained, appalled, energized, and at times left on the edge of my seat. David Sedaris has a knack for catching the reader off guard, which is where a great deal of his humor originates. This tome is nothing short of brilliant!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I can't remember when I've been so bummed out to finish a book - I wish I could just continue reading it until the end of time!

But they loved it because they laughed hysterically. I found many parts of this book to be humorous, indeed. Bot not hilarious. No, these stories hit too close to home to be that funny. I, like so many people, gay or straight, was (and, to some extent, still am) as insecure as the youngster Sedaris describes. Obsessive, fantasizing about a better (more wealthy, prominent) life. This book is fantastic, more so because it is cathartic (though it's awfully funny as well)."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"If you like to laugh this is the book to read. I couldn't help but chuckle to myself while reading &quot;Naked&quot;. It was definitly a roller coaster ride of funny experiences and stories.

If they don't like, I want nothing to do with them."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris writes this autobiographical account of his childhood and his travel experiences with a sardonic wit that is remniscent of John Waters. His account of a hellish Greyhound bus ride is especially funny. His portrayal of his mother is an interesting combination of sarcasm and sympathy. You get the impression that he inherited her way of looking at the world."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This collection was a gift to readers with the peculiar experience of growing up in an ethnic family, of growing up a gay man and even of losing a parent. Sedaris is nothing short of brilliant and I find myself quoting the book to friends daily. This was a real treat. Thanks David!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"As someone who would otherwise never be caught dead cracking a smile on the subway, I laughed out loud every morning on my way to work as I read this book. Sedaris' wit is just the right combination of dry and real, his precision is unmatched by any writer that comes to mind."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is deliciously depraved. His writing is both outrageously believable and believably outrageous. Every oddball character and freakish situation has an element of truth that makes the writing hilariously real. I laughed so hard I drooled."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Summary:The book is a collection of short stories, most of which I believe are based on the author's actual experiences. Most of the stories are about his family and growing up, but the final story, Naked, is about his experience going to a nudist colony/resort.My Comments:All of the stories are well-written, engaging, and entertaining. As is the case with 'Holidays On Ice', the author never reveals when a story is fictitious or not, but I was inclined to believe most of these were non-fiction (though there might be an embellishment here or there).I was impressed by the author's candorabout his personal life. To be willing to reveal one's quirks and even poke fun at them takes either a lot of money or a lot of self-security. I'm not sure which is Sedaris's motivation, but whatever it is, it's nice to hear someone being frank about life.Though the stories jump all over the place and don't really seem to have a common thread, I don't think anyone can argue that Sedaris has a gift for telling poignant and humorous short stories. The stories are a bit outlandish and the author is blunt, meaning they probably aren't for everyone, but I would definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked tells such funny stories about David Saderis' life it's hard to believe! Starting from childhood when his neurotic mind forces him to lick light switches, to when he visists a nudist camp, this book is OUTRAGEOUS!!!Naked held some of the most ridiculous,original things I have ever read. Few books have held my attention like this. I kept finding myself lyling on the coutch reading instead of watching TV. For a while there, Naked was my TV.Joey-one false mover"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I contemplated purchasing this book for quite a while but coulnd pull the trigger. Finally after reading &quot;A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius&quot; by David Eggers, I was recommended this book. I didn't find any of the stories funny.

I would suggest Eggers' book if you want a truely entertaining memoir."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"\\"Shaved VAGINA?\\" (When writing about a woman at a nudist camp). I believe you mean vulva.

I have also been disturbed by the descriptions of animal suffering in a couple of his books recently. Not funny.

Not as funny as Me Talk Pretty One Day, but all of his books are excellent. I'm onto my 3rd David Sedaris Book in a month!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I ordered this book from Amazon specifically off of the great reviews. It was said to be hilarious and side-splitting. I did find some parts amusing, but for the most part I found my self skimming to just finish the book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked is a great book. It kept me interested the whole way through and I always enjoy David Sedaris. I have already read \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" and I preferred that to this one. There was something lighter about that book. Naked was written earlier in his career, and he describes some disturbing situations with humor that I can only assume is to prevent us from pitying him for what sounds like a depressing childhood/early life. He describes situations that I would categorize as just plain scary/strange-narrowly escaping a redneck man who wanted to rape him, his mothers alchoholism, having a prostitute friend of his sisters come for dinner on Christmas after she had been beaten by her husband/lover. Obviously, as someone whose life has not been this tumultuous, I was very absorbed. He makes a joke of his mothers alchoholism, and his own OCD, but it is, underneath it all, very sad. And, it also leads the reader to wonder why nothing was ever done about these things. I know, it is supposed to be funny, but when an entire book is dedicated to making a joke out of severe dysfunction, one begins to wonder.Keep in mind that I am not some sensitive person who cannot handle unpleasant things. I am not easily offended bad bawdy humor, bad language or sexual situations. I know there is an ounce of truth to this, and parts of it were just very hard to read as funny."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I got to read excerpts from this book in my english class Sr. year of highschool, I enjoyed it so much I bought the book. I read it, gave it to my mother, and then passed it along to my college roommate freshman year who kept me up at night with histerical fits of laughter! Needless to say it is funny. The chapter \\"Plague of Ticks\\", is a personal favorite, funny yet a true story. Overall the book is a must read, and I also recommend his other books including \\"Me Talk Pretty\\", though the Christmas one I think you can skip.(combinging accounts, I originally wrote this May 20, 2002)"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I love to laugh, but I never expected to laugh this hard.

Normally, to keep up appearances, I would never engage in such behavior. This book forced me to do so. And I am happily ashamed."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read Naked in one day and enjoyed the book. I did not think it was as funny as I had expected, however I did enjoy the transitions throughout the book seemingly giving a poingnant picture of his &quot;life&quot;, I recommended it to my mother. Nevertheless I was left wondering about the Christianity aspect of Naked. Is Sedaris attempting to make a joke out of religion, or is he trying to redeem himself as a homosexual male that seems to possess some form of Cathoic guilt? He never lets the reader forget that he is gay and this is &quot;unhealthy&quot;. This is further illustrated by Curly, the epitiome of American trailer park trash, and his extensive 'collection' in his mother's trailer. As I pawed through the many reviews of this book, I noticed two concepts frequently repeated; dysfunction and stress. Whenever I hear the word &quot;stress&quot; all I can think of America. I have made a conscious decision to cut this word out of my vocabulary because it is a mere invention. Where else can a person lazily describe every bit of daily minutia and annoyance in one word? In my opinion generalizations are &quot;unhealthy&quot;, causing dullness- of- the- brain. Isn't it better to say 'my job is making me feel anxious', than 'I'm so stressed at work'? The same goes for &quot;dysfunction&quot;, a disease that every American family seems to prescribe to. What makes Sedaris so special? Certainly not that he can laugh in the face of misery, don't we all do that anyways? Sedaris, however, has the patience to write it down and perhaps invent some new stuff to fill in the serious-adult-gaps. Overall this book was an enjoyable read, even though I had to eat an entire box of Altoids to remove the taste of cliche from my mouth."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"BUY THIS BOOK! It's a great easy read, one that will have you laughing at Sedaris' upbringing and cause you to reflect humorously on your own - no matter if it was disfunctional or &quot;Leave It To Beaver&quot;esque....."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book is a hoot. It manages to be funny no matter what. Sedaris sees the humor in everything."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I think that this is a great book for travel. It is a quick read with a lot of amusing moments in it. Sedaris' style is self-depricating and quick witted, and I believe he as a gift for hyperbole. I didn't find this book to be as hilarious as everyone else, apparently. There were passages which caused me to laugh, but overall, I thought that the book had a lot of what would be outright depressing subjects; it is only because of the author's tongue-in-cheeck style that these topics were manageably wrangled into fodder for amusement."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"A Gem"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris has a way with words that I only wish I had. The stories of his childhood and his family were so interesting and hysterically funny all at the same time. I was laughing so hard that I had to put the book down and go get a kleenex to wipe the tears from my eyes. The man is a comedic genius."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This was my first time reading David Sedaris and I found it quite funny! I enjoyed the fact that each chapter is not exactly in chronological order, but instead centers around certain parts of his life. As memoirs go, this is one that I'll never forget and is akin to \\"Running With Scissors\\", though Sedaris tends to focus much more on the humor of his childhood. The vast amounts of positive reviews for this book speaks for itself and I look forward to reading more Sedaris in the future."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I guess because I had read so many raving reviews of this book I had expected more. I did have a giggle every once-in-a-while, but not enough to have LOVED this book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"'Naked' by David Sedaris is a collection of several autobiographical stories of his youth. We get to meet his unusual parents, Greek grandmother, and a wide assortment of decidedly strange people and the author struggles to grow up. Most of these stories are humorous but there is some pathos thrown in. None of the stories are especially memorable, and title story 'Naked', about the author's visit to a nudist camp, is surprisingly dull. But David Sedaris is a talented writer; the book reads very well. And although he doesn't have the wit of Augusten Burroughs, an equally famous gay writer who has penned his memoir, his work is every bit as entertaining.Bottom line: a voyeuristic look and someone's misspent youth. Fun stuff."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"A couple of gems in here though it's not nearly as stellar as Me Talk Pretty One Day. Still, I keep this one handy for those nights between novels.In a way, I would describe this as Sedaris' most cynical work. Example: the take-home message of the short story that shares the collection's title. We find out something about ourselves when we bear all, eh? But we'll just as soon retreat to the comfort of our coverings. And those that don't be damned; you don't want to associate yourself with those shameless folks anyway."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is a very funny writer and this is one of his better collections. I highly recommend it. Though my favorite among his books is still the gut-splitting \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\", this collection comes fairly close to matching it. Prepare to laugh hysterically throughout.Archived episodes of the radio program, This American Life, contain portions where Sedaris reads some of the stories in these collections, and they are really well worth tracking down and listening to."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is Serdaris's best work. His stories are laugh out loud, roll on the floor funny! I have read this book several times and listened to the audio version several times, and every time it is as funny as the first time."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"In typical Seadaris voice, this book won't let you down. I also have the audio version which is better than the book since it's read by Sedaris himself."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The book, naked, throws the reader into the life of David Sedaris. The stories he discusses in this memoir range from his life altering realization of his homosexuality, to the time his family took a prostitute into there house for Christmas. Sedaris effectively presents his stories by artfully putting his own morbidly humorous spin on many situations that would make any normal person shudder. In the hospital where he volunteers, after observing the patients who was in the mental ward he writes, \\"I wanted to slam heads against the wall and scream, \\"Stop acting like and idiot and get better goddamnit!\\" Then I'd notice the bruises covering their bodies and realized that someone had already tried that approach. (79)\\"The most redeeming and interesting characteristic of this entire novel is the organization. Each chapter is a separate story. Sedaris opens each chapter with a completely new subject yet manages to cunningly tie up all the stories and conclude the story at the end of each chapter. He may have done this in order to parallel this memoir to life, which he feels is made up of millions of little stories. However completely absurd these stories are he still manages to make the reader believe them by incorporating excellent detail and authentic characters.I really enjoyed this book because of it's the author's humorous voice and his ability to keep the reader entertained throughout the entire book. It was one of the best novels I have ever read and would recommend it to anyone who wants to know how lucky they are to live with the family they do.-Mike L."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris does it again with this hillarious compilation of short essays. His storytelling ability is unparrelled in today's world. A great bedtime, beachtime or anytime read!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"One of my favorite humor writers, Sedaris has created a classic memoir that's bound to win readers' laughter decades from now.Sedaris manages to capture pieces of his life and that of the people around him in a series of vignettes, which are somehow both humorous and touching simultaneously. He's also unabashed about things like his chaotic homelife and OCD traits as a child, voicing them with an earnestness that simply tells it like it is.This book is quickly engrossing! You'll be laughing out loud for days afterward, and be sure to give your favorite parts a re-reading..."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This was the first Sedaris book I read, and probably still my favorite. It's hilarious! I don't believe I've ever seen anybody who can poke fun at themselves (without being slapstick) more effectively than David Sedaris. But the reader is often blindsided by insight in Sedaris's sketches, and that's sometimes even better than the comedy. I mean, seriously, who'd have expected that there could be poignant moments at a nudist camp?"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read this book an a flight and drew unwanted attention. I laughed so hard tears ran down my legs, I had to put it down. I was sobbing with laughter. Never happens to you? Read it, you'll laugh ( and cringe)."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book is great for taking you out of your everyday boredom. You will laugh and love his unique perspective on life. It made my day of waiting at Jury Duty most pleasureable. I was laughing out loud and people were staring at me. His family life just cracks me up."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I first caught David Sedaris while watching the Late Show with David Letterman. I thought it odd Letterman would have on a guess to read essays; but about 30 seconds into the essay I didn't question Dave's logic. Sedaris' gift for hiding the set-up for his jokes makes Naked particularly funny. This was the first of my David Sedaris reads and I have since purchased his other works. All of which are as funny as this one."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I got to meet David Sedaris and see him speak live a few years ago in college, and became a fan of his after hearing him on NPR and reading 'Me Talk Pretty...', so I decided to pick this book up and give it a whirl. After hearing him in person, it's quite easy to picture him telling these stories, yet imagining, 'how in the world did he survive his childhood?' As others have said, the book isn't filled with hilarity, but it makes up for the lack with wit and sarcasm. It was a nice change of pace from some other more serious books I've gone through lately. Yet another welcome addition to my bookshelf :-)"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I love Dave Sedaris! His stories are great for people with short attention spans (like myself) who cannot sit through a whole book. There is a chapter on his childhood OCD which almost made me pee on myself. This book is great!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"absolutely hillarious. sedaris is the funniest and best storyteller i have ever read."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Sedaris' &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day,&quot; and I needed a book to help me kill some time while waiting on a friend to take his lunch break, so I bought &quot;Naked.&quot;It's the same idea as &quot;Me Talk Pretty&quot;--a bunch of loosely connected or unconnected humorous essays--but for whatever reason (and I won't pretend it's not due to some mental block of my own), I found this book disturbingly sad.I'm not just talking about the &quot;Ashes&quot; segment, which is obviously supposed to break your heart as it makes you laugh. But Sedaris--and, indeed, his entire family--is so incredibly self-absorbed throughout this book, so pleased with himself, that it hurts me.Now, granted, the &quot;grown-up&quot; Sedaris who is writing the book realizes the depth of his former self-absorption, and so maybe the sadness I'm feeling is just the sadness of growing up and putting childish things aside.The book is very engrossing, though, sad as it is. &quot;I couldn't put it down&quot; or whatever other cliche you want me to use.3.5 stars."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I loved this book from the first page to the last. I read it every second I could and found myself reading parts out loud to my husband. David Sedaris is an incredible storyteller and even makes sad things funny. I can't wait to read his other books."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Ever heard the clich&eacute; stark naked? This phrase does a good job of summing up this book. David Sedaris' Naked exhibits Sedaris' renowned stark humor. This humorous writing style plays a large role in Sedaris' recognition as an author. He has every right to complain in this book, but he doesn't. He takes all of his emotions and ideas and wraps them up into what are possibly the most hilariously written stories of childhood, adolescence, growing up, life, culture, et cetera. Thus Naked is very entertaining, not depressing, and it still gets its points across well.Other than briefly hearing him on NPR, Naked was my introduction to Dave Sedaris. I have had many people recommend the book, but could not find the time to read it. I was pretty intimidated by the Sedaris cult following. When I finally got around to it and the book was over in no time. People who I talked to about this book referring to it as a book suited for teenage reading or some type of \`coming of age' novel. I am a teenager, so I kept this preconceived idea in my head while I read. I found that this classification was quite valid. Who else can appreciate his writing more than people who are right in the middle of many of his well-illustrated situations than those who are living much of it?I think Naked is one of the most American books I've seen in a long time, not that Sedaris writes like a classic American or something of that nature, but what he depicts is profoundly American. Naked brings all of the things society doesn't want to talk about (i.e. nudity, parenthood, obsessive compulsive disorder, premenstrual syndrome, etc.) to the surface in this book. Even when I wasn't laughing out loud at the book at times when I suspect others would, I found the content and writing style was lovely even when I didn't find it comical. I, like many, would recommend this book because I think it lives up to its burlesque title. -(Alvin, Grade 12, Contemporary Fiction/ Creative Writing)"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked was compelling. Naked was readable and hard to put down. Naked was witty and clever. Yet, I had trouble liking Sedaris' character throughout the book. If you enjoy reading about a man who is, at each turn in his life, unable to make a sensible decision about himself; who throws himself into harm's way; who displays a veneer of genial stupidity while (like a grown-up Harriet the Spy) taking copious mental notes of those around him only to ridicule them when he sets pen to paper, then this is the book for you. In all fairness, Sedaris is self-critical as well and has a solidly self-depricating sense of humor in Naked. There is, however, a very thin line between self-deprication and conceitedness. I just got tired of it towards the end of the book. Aren't there enough books written about a middle-aged guy coming to terms with his sexuality and confronting his dysfunctional family while going on a meandering cross-country trip where a cast of misfit characters awaits?"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"There was no issue with the book - BUT - the envelope was too small so the corners ended up folded.

Loved this book.Tumbleweed Logic"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I kept hoping and hoping that the second half of the book would have me rolling as well as the first, but it didn't. I kept wondering why, and I guess it was because the author became a little more wilder than I could take. I could kind of relate to the first half of the book \\"mother-in-laws\\" \\"wierd kids\\", but since I never hitch-hiked (or wanted to) I just could not relate. Also, I was never into the \\"drug-scene\\", so I could not relate to some of those stories also. I never picked apples, so I couldn't get into that either. I am not sure I will read anymore of his books. I like his style, but I don't think that his later life really interest me. I am a lover of potty-humor, but the last part of the book didn't even have that. It was kind of depressing. If anyone knows of any good \\"coming of age\\" humor books, please throw in some suggestions. I really do read the \\"favorite lists\\". So I hope whoever writes them, still keeps going. I personally love the Jean Shepherd books, they are dated (no potty humor-depression era), but they are still funny. I also love Malcolm in the Middle (TV show) for dysfunctional family humor. I also think Margaret Cho is a funny comedian...some of her stuff is on DVD...I love her Mom."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Listening to this just made me wish that David and Amy had done more works togother.

David Sedaris is perfectly capable of humorous writing, but in this book he fails to deliver laughs. Sedaris does, however, manage to analyze all aspects of American culture expertly, from the old tradition of hitchiking (which never turns out well) to off beat nudist colonies.In Naked, Sedaris tells of different events in his life in chronological segments, from a teenager to a college drop-out to an adult. He talks about how his mother would laugh about his nervous tics behind his back, hitching a ride from a profane Christian who makes Oregon-shaped clocks, to attending his sister's wedding while his mother's cancer stays in his mind. None of these stories are particularly serious, but none of them actually made me laugh that much. Of course, I speed-read this book in two or three days, so I probably did not let the material sink into my brain enough.The stories vary in length from about five pages to about fifty pages, but the best story is \\"Naked\\", which chronicles Sedaris' week-long stay at a nudist colony in semi-diary form. He starts out self-concious, as any first-time nudist would, and walks around partially clothed. As the week progresses, he gradually becomes accustomed to the nakedness of himself and those around him. When he goes to a nudist couple's trailer, he finds them sitting on the floor naked playing Super Nintendo, just like you and I would, only with no clothes. When he leaves the colony and returns to \\"civilization\\", he feels strange wearing clothes, which proves that no culture is as weird as we think it is.The stories in Naked are full of good messages and well-told stories, but the belly-laughs stayed inside me. As I looked at the review excerpts, commending Sedaris for his hilarious book, I must say I was surprised. This book is not as funny as The New York Times says it is, which is a rare case indeed. If you are new to David Sedaris' writing, read Holidays on Ice, which is an easier read and contains the classic \\"Santaland Diaries\\", or Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, which is hilarious while being touching at the same time, a very fine medium."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"After the first two chapters of this book, I thought, wow, this is hilarious! Unfortunately, after that the humor died down, in my opinion.I appreciated the unique stories that Sedaris had to share, they made this book worthwhile. However, a lot of his humor just plain fell short on me. I also struggled to understand his reasoning for writing this book, for piecing these stories together as he did, and what exactly was his \\"point\\"?I can see from the other reviews I'm in the minority here. Even my sister who recommended this book, is a huge fan. But for me, while it was an average read, I don't think Sedaris is an author for me. I am not in the least bit interested in picking up another book of his."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I don't often laugh out loud while reading, but I did so many times while completing this memoir. Sedaris makes his characters seem as if they are in the next room, ready to go and visit, as if he has just seen them yesterday. His cutting wit allows him to adapt without unraveling. Highly humerous, very personal, a treat for the whole family.BTW, Einstein, what is the Latin word for &quot;blowhard&quot;?"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read most of this book on a Sunday morning lying in bed. Idrank coffee and laughed hysterically. I looked at the clock and itwas well into the afternoon, and I felt pathetic for being in bed so long. I took the book to a cafe and read there, but I was laughing so loudly, I felt self-conscious. It is easily the funniest book I have ever read. The beginning is better than the end, and sometimes you wonder if it is all true, but nevertheless, it is well-crafted, bitter, bizarre, and some of the most fun you can have. The standouts are the graphically missplelled &quot;Next of Kin&quot; about his siblings finding porn and the paranoia it induces, and the gory &quot;Cyclops&quot; about all of his father's warnings against the use of table saws and lawn mowers. If you get the chance, go see him read because he's even better in person."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris has to be one of the wittiest people living today. I find remarkable the way nothing is safe from his razor-sharp observations, least of all himself."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Like many others, I found myself laughing out loud (the fudge-colored towels got me big time)...but if he spent the first part of the book drawing me in, he spent the later half pushing me away.The stories of his family are intimate, yet coy. He flashes peeks at his nakedness, but then closes the coat pretty quickly. Simple things began to annoy me: what are the names of his 3 other sisters? I haven't forgotten the names of any of my siblings...and they'd all play a big part any any memior. After revealing his homosexuality and then poignantly relating some early &quot;discovery&quot; experiences, where is his first important relationship? Or is that TOO naked? Why throw in the visit to the nudist colony when it is merely a vaguely amusing story that reveals very little? That end piece might have worked as a column but it doesn't work as a part of this book.Still, I enjoyed the book heartily, and was disappointed merely because I wanted more of the type of writing that started the book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Those who found this entertaining or humorous must be warped or disturbed individuals. The events are obviously exaggerated and intentionally absurd, bordering on psychotic. I also found several inconsistencies that made me think I had misplaced my page and was re-reading the same chapter by mistake. Definately not the light laugh I was expecting."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I used to love Sedaris. I loved 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' and loved the articles he wrote for the 'New Yorker.' Unfortunately, over time, I would argue he has traded in his natural penchant to make insightful and witty comments about everything for the type of shock value writing that has been gaining popularity in the memoir genre (much like Borroughs and Eggers). In 'Naked,' Sedaris seems to have abandoned the type of subtle commentary that causes us as readers to laugh out loud and turned to using only the outrageousness of the given situation or anecdote to win us over. His treks through the United States and stories of his father's useless advice just don't sparkle the way his previous writing does. The only strong essay is the last one, 'Naked' where he delves into his one week at a nudist colony. I long for the days when memoir writing was humorous in a subtle manner, instead of using absurdist plots and life stories to get me interested. Pass on this and read his older work."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"No matter how many times you return to this book, it's still a riot. Recommended always."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Some of the stories in this book are so funny I was crying in my seat on the plane. This is David at his best."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I bought this audio book because I recently read Me Talk Pretty One Day and absolutely loved it. I definitely enjoyed Naked and it kept me entertained on a long car trip, but I probably wouldn't buy another audio book by David Sedaris just because his voice is kind of irritating and hard to get used to. I think his books are hilarious but would prefer to read them on paper. Great writer though!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"If the following quote doesn't make you want to read this book, then you're a little crazy.\\"Test eye shadow on all the rabbits you want.

I had high hopes considering the rave reviews everywhere, but was very disappointed to find out that this book was far from funny. This book is sad and depressing! There is nothing funny about a child with OCD, or losing your mother to cancer, or having a dysfunctional family. I laughed once through this entire book, and I couldn't wait for it to end."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This to me is idiot's fare. What's funny is that I bought Barrel Fever a few years ago and wound up returning it. But I thought perhaps I was too swift to dismiss it, so I gave Naked a chance. Inspired by a reader who had it recently while I was vacationing. I was being optimistic that this would not be a bunch of dumb, pointless essays. But I could not get past the first two! Come on, who goes around licking doorknobs, anyway? This is elementary fare. I did not find this amusing at all, just idiotic, as I said. So I have returned this Sedaris pulp too. I think I'll pass on &quot;Me Talk Pretty...&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"My book club read this book for our August '98 meeting. We had read the reviews in Amazon.com and were expecting a laugh a minute. However, we were all disappointed in the book. For most of us, the book elicited a chuckle or two, and generally not until the middle of the book. One Amazon.com reviewer commented on Sedaris' dysfuntional family, but it is Sedaris himself who is dysfunctional. One of our members has heard Sedaris on NPR, and she enjoyed the book more than the rest of us because she said it explained a lot of the background of his radio stories. The consensus was that Sedaris is a loser who is writing to elicit our sympathy for his poor pathetic excuse of a life."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"First, let me say that, if pressed, I would give this book 3 1/2 stars (but definitely not 4) because it is well written and, at times, interesting. However, while I enjoyed Sedaris' writing style and did, in fact, laugh out loud once or twice (the &quot;towel mystery&quot; cracked me up), I found the bookjacket comments that I would not be able to stop laughing, etc. to be more than a tad bit exaggerated (like these &quot;true&quot; stories themselves).I bought this book based on the fact that I had heard good things about &quot;Me Talk Pretty Some Day&quot; and wanted to read it. However, I couldn't find it in the store, so I bought &quot;Naked&quot; instead. Having read it, I have some questions. Number one, who is this David Sedaris guy and what makes him so important that he would think he should publish his life story? Two, why should we want to read his life story? Three, how can anyone be expected to believe that these stories are &quot;actual events&quot;? I find that extremely hard to swallow. It would seem that Mr. Sedaris survived several attempted kidnapping/murders/rapes, etc. (without once learning the dangers of hitchhicking or relying too heavily on the &quot;kindness&quot; of strangers) by the time he was 20 years old or so, not to mention a myriad of other adventures. Okay, I can believe it once, even... if I stretch my mind... twice; but after the THIRD attempt at his safety/virtue/peace of mind, it got a little hard to buy. And, while I'm on the subject of completely unrealistic, I found it absolutely impossible to belive that - in the 1960s/early 70s, Mr. Sedaris a) not only lived in a co-ed dorm but actually shared a room with a female; b) that said female was a quadriplegic; and c) that the school actually expected him, a young man, to be responsible for the daily grooming/toilet activities, etc. of said young woman (since such institutions usually err on the side of caution I would imagine that the concept of a young paralyzed woman being bathed, etc. by a young healthy man [they wouldn't know whether he was gay or not] would be a bit suspect). This, supposedly, is a &quot;true&quot; event. However, even now, you would never encounter this scenario (even if it would happen, I find it hard to believe that the parents of a quadriplegic female would consent to it).Also, I found nothing particulary endearing about his family and was hard pressed to figure out why I should be interested in their goings on. I did enjoy the &quot;tic&quot; sequence and his mother's interactions with the teachers; I found the &quot;Ya-Ya&quot; sequence appalling. Quite frankly, his entire family came off as self-important blowhards (and, yes, I ALSO &quot;believe&quot; his sister beat up a man who was beating a prostitute... completely realistic as well). Sedaris focuses mainly on his sister, Lisa -to whom the book is dedicated; however, the reader never really learns anything about her. All characters are painted one-dimensionally, something you wouldn't expect from a person who had grown up with them.Perhaps I would have enjoyed this book more had it not been so prominently advertised with an &quot;all events are true&quot; disclaimer. Quite frankly, I found it to be 99% exaggerated (that's the most polite way to phrase it) truth stretching.Incidentally, as a matter of geography and fact, Sedaris mentions his yearly childhood trips to &quot;Western New York&quot; (Binghamton/Corning, according to him). As a sidebar, I wanted to point out that Binghamton, New York is not &quot;Western New York&quot;. The Buffalo area is Western New York (and there are hundreds of miles between the two). Just wanted to clarify that because I can't stand when &quot;facts&quot; are wrongly stated in &quot;true&quot; books... regardless of how petty they are.Anyway, I might venture a perusal of a borrowed copy of &quot;Me Talk Pretty Someday&quot; but think its more likely that my next &quot;autobiographical&quot; book will come from someone who actually has something to say or a point to make. Sedaris comes off as a Lewis Grizzard (who always had something to say and a point to make) &quot;wanna-be&quot; and fails miserably in his attempt."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"naked is a guide book to average writing. there is rarely any sub-text besides the typical boringly obvious allusions made by amatuer writers. in his effort to make this book the &quot;riot&quot; it is, sedaris employs every other sentence to act as a cheap punchline to an obvious set up. his character just wasn't that interesting or that different from everybody i've ever met, neither were his exploits. i do feel bad saying this because sedaris seems like a really nice guy judging from the photo in the back of the book. sedaris himself, i mean the sedaris in the book, also seems like an alright fellow; he just doesn't have many keen, funny, or interesting observations on the wacky ride we call life.the saving grace of this book was that in certain spots it reminded me of the extremely enjoyable author, richard russo, who like sedaris fills his books with humor but is often much more dead-on. if you like sedaris, try russo, blah blah blah...i truly am astounded at the raves this book guide."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The first 30 pages of this book are funny, entertaining and well written. As for the other 261, just tell me when they are over. Sedaris tries to keep you reading with odd dysfunctional family stories and adolescent troubles. But, it is not enough to keep this book afloat. Even with a title like Naked (which only makes sense during the last 20 pages), I don't think this book could even entice it's self."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I enjoyed Mr Sedaris on NPR once in a while. So I thought I would enjoy a full length audio book. But it was just more and more of the same shallow monotonic delivery of haphazard and hardly interesting stories. All related in the same almost lifeless oratory. Maybe if you grew up in the same island you'll find him compelling. Maybe not. I feel like I wasted my money. Used copy anyone?"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris uses unusual humor and a bizarre series of events to create his slightly unorthodox memoir: Naked. Though his choice of events and literary techniques certainly keep the reader involved, the structure of the memoir itself is confusing and his depiction of certain events questions his true credibility. Right off the bat Sedaris illustrates several \\"nervous tics\\" he had as a child. \\"Running home was not an option. This was a long and complicated process that demanded an oppressive attention to detail. It wasn't that I enjoyed pressing my nose against the scalding hood of a parked car...A person had to do these things\\" (Sedaris, 9). He later goes into detail describing his mothers mockery of these tics, then onto his sexual self discovery, his leaving home to hitch-hike across the country, and finally ending in a nudist colony, sorry, a nudist trailer park because the word \\"colony\\" is \\"too spooky\\" (Sedaris, 255).This book is without a doubt funny, however, the timing of Sedaris's jokes combined with his slightly dark humor cause the reader to initially laugh, double take, and ultimately realize that Sedaris is trying a bit too hard. \\"I wanted to slam heads against the wall and scream, \\"Stop acting like and idiot and get better goddamnit!\\" Then I'd notice the bruises covering their bodies and realized that someone had already tried that approach\\" (Sedaris, 79). His humor is so closely related to humor we use in daily life, that seeing it in black and white is slightly chilling.Though reading about a compulsive boy's self discovery through working in a mental facility, to discovering that he is gay, to finally accepting himself for who he is, is entertaining, through out the course of this book, the reader can't help but wonder, \\"is Sedaris making this stuff up?\\" His depiction of the mental patients actions, his grandmother's craziness, and his family connections just seem too far-fetched to be real.Content of the book aside, Sedaris's presentation is also a little confusing. A good idea at the time, Sedaris presents every chapter as its own story, and compiles all of these \\"shorter stories\\" into the overall memoir. The lack of chronology, however, makes this book rather difficult to follow. Sedaris describes his mother's death in the sixth chapter, yet for the rest of the book, he continues to choose moments in which she was still alive.Overall, Naked is an entertaining book. Sedaris combines numerous amounts of events into a small amount of space, however, because the events are so random, and have little correlation with each other, this book is not as successful as I think it could have been. Nonetheless, Sedaris makes himself lovable in this book. He presents himself for the person that he is, strange humor and all, and ultimately the reader will enjoy this book. Sedaris set out to create a memoir, a book of events based on personal memory, and that goal, whether the reader believes it or not, was accomplished. That, makes this book successful, and that, makes this book a good read."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Perhaps because I had only ever heard David Sedaris on the radio, and had never seen him in print, I considered him a comedian and didn't attach much if any significance to him as a writer. Then I stumbled upon a few of his short stories on-line. When reading these stories I became impressed with his wit and honesty, and the way he writes the personal essay.I was initially attracted to Naked because of the title. The title is taken from Sedaris's experience at a nudist colony. But the theme of Naked continues throughout his tales of events in his life. Essentially, the title is a metaphor for the way in which he exposes himself to his readers and invites them into the intimate space of his family, his struggles, and his view of the world.His writing is at once hilarious and heart achingly sad without the affliction of sentimentality. Sedaris starts out from a broad discussion of situations common to us all. His work defines accessibility. We can all identify with second grade teachers and the commonality of their belittlement of oddly behaved children. We can all remember the fear behind the note home to our parents, the bad report card, the neighbor who reports our unsocial behavior or the wild parties we gave in their absence.Sedaris suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder throughout childhood and into early adulthood. His stories relating to the disorder are laugh out loud funny, and extremely painful. My heart ached for the suffering of this child. Sedaris uses humor and in particular self deprecation to great effect. Reading some of his stories makes me feel like a fly on the wall in a therapy session. But he is modest and unassuming and speaks to his reader with an air of confidentiality.In Naked, Sedaris speaks to his readers about family traditions and hard held beliefs. He exposes social class as it applies to him and his family, and explores the expectations and demands to surrender to whom one's family thinks one should be. He has a wonderful way of showing his reader what it is like to come from a family of mixed traditions and nationalities. He paints vibrant pictures of his Greek paternal grandmother and the battles between her and his own New Yorker mother.Belinda Shoemaker obtained a MFA Creative Writing from Antioch University Los Angeles."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked is a laugh out loud collection of autobiographical short-stories, and happens to be my favorite of all his books. Naked is most enjoyable in audiobook form due to the narration by the author. Sedaris gained national attention after reading his essays on NPR. His understatedly dramatic readings compelled him to fame, and hearing the author read his own writing is a true treat. Sedaris' inflections and voice imitations further amplify his cast of already quirky characters.His eccentric family and sardonic outlook on life will keep you laughing from start to finish. Nothing escapes Sedaris' sarcastic eye as he shreds apart his banal existence in the Southern suburbs of Charlotte. Highlights of the book include the title story on visiting a rural nudist colony, and \\"plague of ticks\\" which shows how he coped, or rather hit himself repeatedly in the head with his own shoes and obsessively licked light switches, as a child with OCD.My only criticism would be the inclusion of Amy Sedaris (comedian, actress, and the author's sister) in the book's narration. In many of the stories she narrates the voices of the female characters, and her voice seems pasted in and awkwardly breaks the narrative flow. She also sounds exactly the same for most of the multiple characters she portrays and one gets tired of her forced and overly youthful Southern accent.-J. Teel"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I had at least 3 different people recommend this book to me. I just kept being told how unbelievably funny David Sedaris was. So I finally picked up this book and checked it out. Honestly, it really wasn't that funny. Each chapter is a separate story unto itself, each from a different time period in his life. They were fairly interesting stories, and really not bad, but \\"hilarious\\"? No way. Not even close. I can't think of any time where I even more than just chuckled. I don't know, maybe it's not my type of humor. I just don't get what all the fuss is about. Most likely won't be reading another of his novels, there's more important things out there, and honestly, these random stories don't say much of anything really important."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked by David SedarisIn Barrel Fever, David Sedaris had not yet decided if he wanted to write essays or stories. In Naked, he recognizes his talent for semi-autobiographical pseudo-memoirs and dumps the stories.Sedaris also matures here in that he slowly moves outside of himself and gives center stage to other people and their concerns. \\"A Plague of Tics\\" and \\"Ashes,\\" for example, are powerful reflections on Sedaris' mother.The reader should still expect to read a lot about Sedaris. Yet he surrounds himself with odd situations, characters, and plots, and you get a more complete feeling (than in Barrel Fever) of the world in which Sedaris' idiosyncrasies have been forged.Not all of the essays are perfect, but there are enough to keep you intellectually, comically, and mournfully engaged to make the entire text worth reading."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is the second book by David Sedaris that I've read. After reading Me Talk Pretty One Day, I had to go out and buy this book. It is a funny and quick read. You'll want to take it everywhere and read it until you finish."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I've reviewed his writing before. He may very well be my favorite living author. If not, he's certainly one of the top five, and I can't think of four better right now. I love this man. So humorous, so witty, so observant, so true. David Sedaris, quite honestly, is not someone who I want to recommend to you book by book. I want to recommend that you visit your favorite bookstore or website and buy every single title they've got by this guy. I have a couple on my bookshelf that I haven't read yet, and you have no idea how much joy that gives me. He's awesome, and I have unread David Sedaris books right here in my very own home. It's a special thrill. You really need to get his books. All of them. Do it now. They're far better than mine."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"It doesn't happen often that a book makes me laugh out loud, but this had me masking my face repeatedly in public because I kept laughing so hard. He has a way of putting things that makes them ridiculous yet true. I don't know how anyone can give this a negative review, it's just crazy and hilarious."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"When we come to memoir, though, comedy seems to be the most fruitful mode. Comedy allows the proper self-deprecation that the narrator/author sympathetic. David Sedaris is happy to make fun of himself and all of those around him without recourse; as if we are all comic actors, somehow not living up to our potential. What Sedaris understands completely is that we are incredibly fallible and he is so willing to let us see him as foolish that one might think that he has no shame. Except that we know he's too sensitive for that.Allowing characters to be vulnerable and with flaws is not only necessary for comedy, but it is critical to all writing. Readers are flawed and so they expect characters to be as well. Sedaris teaches us well that our characters can be at times ridiculous and still be likable. We need not be embarrassed for them. We should understand them and cherish them for what makes them like us."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I love David Sedaris. He has the kind of funny sense of humour that I relate to. Caution: if you hate the show Seinfeld, you'll probably hate David Sedaris stories. ;)While a thoroughly enjoyed this read, I have to admit that I like 'Dress your Family\\" better.However, the story about him and the nudist colony is weird and laugh out loud--one of my favourites stories of his."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book is classified as a memoir, and it's the funniest one I've read to date. Growing up Greek in North Carolina couldn't have been easy, but adding to the mix a crazy grandmother and a sibling with a penchant for using towels as toilet paper makes it that much harder (and funnier, to us).David was struck with enthusiastic OCD as a child, only to find ways to &quot;cure&quot; his tics in college. His stories of life after schooling include apple-picking and packing, working with jade (not to mention a crazy, hypocritical Christian), and refinishing woodwork with a Jew-hating Lithuanian and a somewhat confused black guy. He hitchhikes with all levels of human decapitation until a rowdy truck driver combs thicket by the roadside looking for him.Not all of the fifteen stories are side-splitting funny. &quot;I Like Guys&quot; highlights accepting his homosexual feelings, and an undercurrent of seriousness lines the story. &quot;Ashes&quot; tells of his mother's cancer, and a sense of tragedy seems to sober his usually razor-sharp satirical style.The last (and title) story, &quot;Naked&quot;, tells of his experience with a nudist colony. It's written in more a journal form (the others are written in a 'flashback' form) and by the end, you feel strange in your own clothing.I definitely plan on recommending this book to my friends. I don't see how you could live your life without picking up a Sedaris book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"NAKED is--by far--the funniest book I have ever read. Several people suggested that I read it, and I ignored them for a long time: I had a lot of other books I wanted to get to first. I finally read it this weekend. The next thing I knew, I was ordering HOLIDAYS ON ICE and BARREL FEVER.NAKED is a collection of true stories from David Sedaris's life. I only wish my life was half as funny.&quot;Chipped Beef,&quot; &quot;Get Your Ya-Ya's Out&quot; and &quot;I Like Guys&quot; are highlights of this collection, but the funniest story is &quot;A Plague of Tics.&quot; In it, Sedaris discusses his strange behaviors as a child: licking lightswitches, hitting himself with his shoe. I laughed so hard reading this story that my roommate told me I was going to have to shut up.Give NAKED a shot. If you like it, pick up BARREL FEVER. It isn't as funny, but it's close."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I would love to give this books five stars but I can't. There were three stories (&quot;Chipped Beef,&quot; &quot;Dinah, the Christmas Whore,&quot; and &quot;The Drama Bug&quot;) that just didn't grab me, so I can't in good conscience give &quot;Naked&quot; a perfect rating. But it's a very strong 4....like a 4.7.David Sedaris is one of the funniest authors I've ever read. His storytelling is superb and absolutely hilarious! This is a must-read for anyone out there who wants to temporarily escape their own dull lives and live vicariously through someone else. Underneath Sedaris's humorous adventures lies a sadness and fear, but that's what makes the stories so beautiful and genuine. Living with OCD, his mother's death, and realizing and accepting his homosexuality are amongst life's trying situations, to say the least. But Sedaris recounts those experiences with tenderness and dignity. I dreaded getting to the last page, and when I closed the book and put it back on the shelf it felt like I was losing a new friend. So...the solution to that was simple....I just pre-ordered his next book.NOTE: If you loved &quot;Naked&quot; you'll love &quot;Barrell Fever.&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The days when David Sedaris was on Morning Edition on NPR (National Public Radio), I was always late for work. His commentaries on being a single gay man working odd-jobs or cleaning apartments in New York City were some of the fall-down funniest things I've ever heard. In print, he is no less skillful at making me weep with laughter. Sedaris, in a raw, honest manner, describes the events of his childhood and young adulthood - as perceived by his incredibly humorous and rich imagination. This collection of essays cover everything from his mother's sharp, accurate portrayal of his tics, his job as a mental health institution assistant, his sister's wedding/his mother's death, to dealing with (while in high school) being gay, and many of the funny little stories that make up being a member of a family, any family. His wit is dry, sharp, poignant, and philosophical all the same time. And after listening to his voice on those cold mornings on the radio, I can &quot;hear&quot; him tell these tales. What a riot! I have read some of the other reviewers who gave this book a one and all I can say is that I pity the person who does not have a sense of humor because they miss out on the absolute joy of reading anything by Sedaris - or even better, listening to him. wow."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"My boss gave me David Sedaris' book, &quot;Naked,&quot; as a christmas present. In hindsight, I wonder what he was trying to tell me? Because David is one sick puppy! He's sick in a &quot;good&quot; way, though. The things Sedaris writes about are the kinds of things we all feel yet are often afraid to express less the &quot;PC Gestapo&quot; nab us, or people think we are truly demented. We can all live vicariously through Sedaris. The variety of the essays is outstanding. From joy, to self-loathing, to frivolous, to scary, to downright touching...each chapter has something different in store for the reader. The common thread is the self-effacing humor. I found myself alone, laughing out loud as grandmother Ya-Ya embarassed David and his siblings by crawling up the aisle during mass at his Greek Orthodox church. When David's father traumatizes him forever when it comes to using power tools in &quot;Cyclops,&quot; I made my girlfriend read the chapter before continuing o! n. I wanted everyone around me to enjoy the book as much as I did. Sedaris is honest - brutally honest - about his dysfunctional family, but that's what makes the humor and the essays all the more appealing; we can all relate to them."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I don't like admitting this to myself (and frankly, I don't like admitting this to all of you out there), but I identified deeply with the main character in David Sedaris' book. And before you start screaming at your computer screen, I know that the main character is David himself, and it's not really a novel, but a collection of humour essays. I see him as a character, because I just can't believe that all of these fantastic stories are true. Is there some truth there? I'm sure. But embellishment seems obvious.Anyway, back to my first thought. The David in the book is an intellectual snob, verbose and thoughtful, unsure of himself in most ways except his sexuality, but extremely sure that he knows what's best for the world and all its inhabitants. And he's damn funny, too. I can relate to most of that (I'll let you choose what I mean), so getting inside the head of such a witty and conflicted man was a real treat.The first fifteen 'stories' in the book are well put together pieces on modern life as David sees it. The best of that lot includes &quot;A Plague of Tics&quot; in which David is attacked by a hyperactive form of O.C.D., and &quot;C.O.G.&quot;, a wonderful riff on the whole Kerouacian lifestyle gone completely wrong. These first fifteen pieces, however, only form a prelude to some of the best writing I've read in years.The second last piece, &quot;Ashes&quot;, about David's mother's battle with cancer is what good writing should be: humourous and poignant, without ever being melodramatic. He wrings literature from real life, and makes the most of a heartbreaking situation. I can imagine what kind of catharsis it must have been for him.The last piece (I want to call it the title track), &quot;Naked&quot;, is about a trip to a nudist colony. I found myself busting a gut in the middle of a crowded subway car. It is sparkling comedy."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I first heard of Sedaris through his reading of &quot;True Detective&quot; on NPR (fudge-colored towels). I actually sat in my parked car at the grocery store to hear the whole thing. I didn't realise the reading was from an entire collection so I was delighted to stumble across Naked a few months later. I am eagerly awaiting the audio version from the library. Until then, I am half-way through the book. Last night my husband and I were reduced to tears and painful belly laughs as I read aloud from &quot;Cyclops&quot;. This morning as we were on our way to his work, I read aloud from &quot;I Like Guys&quot;. I am two-thirds of the way through the book and thus far I prefer the earlier entries involving Sedaris' childhood over the latter entries involving his travels and odd-jobs. Yet even those are engrossing and entertaining. Had I been Sedaris' editor I would have left out &quot;Dix Hill&quot; and &quot;Incomplete Quad&quot; neither of which has added anything to the collection. Rather, I found myself skimming quickly, impatient for the next entry. For those who think Sedaris' tales are implausable just think of the last time you rode public transportation. I recently had a Girl Friday sort of job that was fraught with just the sort of experiences that would make an unbelievable story had I the inclination or the talent to record them. The kid who I pawned the job off on took notes. For any of you have ever had the inward thought, &quot;What are all these incompetents doing on the set of MY movie?&quot; this book is for you."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I bought this book for my wife for Christmas and then had to sit there in jealousy as she chuckled, giggled, snorted and roared her way through this book. When she finished the book and let me read it, I now knew what she was laughing about.Sedaris' antics with his dysfunctional, Greek-American family are guaranteed to make you laugh out loud. I made the mistake of reading this book on the train, and I could not contain my laughter at points. The chapters on &quot;Ya-Ya,&quot; hitchhiking back home from college with his parapeligic &quot;wife,&quot; speaking Elizabethan English at the family dinner table, riding a Greyhound bus on the floor, etc., will have you, literally, rolling on the floor. I enjoyed Sedaris' catchy one-liners and deadpan humor in describing people he encounters even more than his wacky antics.What also makes this book attractive is that Sedaris is not just poking fun at people or deliberately being funny for humor's sake. In the middle of a chapter, he would say something profound or make you realize that the guy is much deeper than a humor writer. That provided a welcome relief to the hours of side-splitting laughter that you'll be enduring when picking up this book. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I was about to go on a long plane trip. A good friend gave me Naked, saying &quot;I hear this guy on NPR and for some reason I think of you.&quot; I never did read the book on the plane ride (lucky for my fellow frequent flyers since my laughter would have annoyed them no end). When I finally got around to reading it I laughed from start to finish.In one chapter (I can't use the book for a reference since it is in circulation to all my good friends who have a demented sense of humor) he talks about his mother's discovery that she has terminal cancer. The idea that this can be side-splittingly funny without being mean spirited is amazing and indicitive of how brilliant Sedaris is.If life is getting you down and you need someone to make you laugh precisely because life can suck sometimes, find a place where you won't annoy people with your laughter and read Naked."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked is my first book by David Sedaris and I was pleasantly surprised at how funny he is. His wit and humor provide many laugh out loud moments. In this series of essays, we learn about some of the author's trials from childhood through adulthood. He handles some pretty deep issues with a sense of humor, keeping them light and entertaining. In the end I found I enjoyed the first half of the book much more than the latter half. His interaction with his mother and other members of the family, while somewhat dysfunctional, also manages to be touching and funny. As he moves into his teen years and becomes adventurous, we learn of his exploits in the art of hitchhiking and vacationing at a nudist colony. This book does have a lot of &quot;bathroom&quot; humor, so I wouldn't reccommend it for the easily offended reader. I have heard that Me Talk Pretty One Day is his finest yet, so will definitely read that one."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I purchased this on the recommendation of my best friend, a Sedaris zealot.As other reviewers have noted, this is a collection of witty and gripping first-person, narrative stories about the early life of David Sedaris. The stories run the gamut from laugh-out-loud funny to eerie and touching. The ability to affect his readership on a variety of levels makes Sedaris an excellent storyteller.I had a tough time rating this book. The quality of writing deserves a &quot;5.&quot; However, I usually give &quot;5&quot;s to dazzlers I will pick off my bookshelf time and time again on lazy Sunday afternoons. I tend to give &quot;4&quot;s to books I would recommend readily to mom, grandma, the postman, and my best friend. _Naked_ didn't fit into either one of those categories.I suppose upon reading it, I was not prepared for the very dark undercurrent to the stories. Many of the characters were downright sinister. This made me keep asking myself, &quot;Are these stories true? Did the author actually live through *all* of these experiences?&quot; My heart went out to him. I wanted to give him a nice bowl of chicken soup and the number of a psychologist. This being the case, I suppose I got somewhat distracted by the questionable autobiographical nature of the stories and separated from the subject matter. This being the case, the &quot;3&quot; rating reflects my personal taste and experience with the book rather than the quality of the writing.If you are a fan of quality prose or short stories, you must add this to your collection. Additionally, if you are part of a book club, I would strongly suggest adding this to your reading list as it will spark excellent conversation! (You may even start rehashing *your* childhood woes over a cup of coffee or two.)"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris is a satirist with a tongue-in-cheek approach to just about all life's experiences. In this collection of seventeen autobiographical essays, the author takes us through a wild ride of unbelievable escapades and events in his life. From his compulsive disorders through a series of jobs, hitchhiking ventures, friendship with a prostitute, to a jaunt in a nudist camp, Sadaris tells it all.If you prefer a dry, refined literary experience, this book is going to shock the socks off you! It is a unique educational experience, but definitely not in any academic sense. This book is pure light-hearted reading, with a unique style of humour and wit that makes for straight forward, insanely hilarious reading. &quot;Naked&quot; is bound to produce a chuckle or two from even the most serious, staunch, intellectual reader. Read it, just for the fun of it.... because life is short and laughing is good for you!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris' Naked is the funniest book I've ever read!I had the pleasure of reading this book on my subway commute and I'm sure everyone else in the train thought I was nuts because I kept laughing out loud. I'm sure if I was drinking something while reading ANY of Sedaris' work that it would come flying out of my nose.I am a huge fan - Naked was the first book I've read and I now have all of his other books."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked had been sitting on my shelf for at least a year before I decided to read it. I have a bad habit of not reading books after I buy them, so this should come as no surprise.As a memoir, Naked is an unbelievably good collection of autobiographical essays. As you make your way through Naked, you just find yourself in disbelief at Sedaris' dysfunctional family. Everyone out there claims to have some sort of dysfunctional family, but Sedaris' truly takes the cake. From the authors childhood filled with his nervous tics and OCD habits to his teachers visiting his home while being offered alcoholic beverages while watching his mother make mock impersonations of her son. It makes you really feel for the author. The best part of Naked by far is the Ya-Ya, Sedaris' grandmother. It makes me wish I had at least one grandmother just like her growing up. If you don't find yourself laughing out loud at least once, you don't have a sense of humor :). Then the authors tales as a long-time hitchhiker while doing a wide variety of manual labor jobs give readers like myself hope that haven't quite figured out who they are or what they want to do in life. On a personal level, these tales were really what I liked the most about Sedaris. The fact that he's come out of all of the hell and many years of uncertainty/wandering to become a successful author and playwright is truly inspiring. It just goes to show you anything is possible, even if it takes until much later in life to figure it out.My gripe with Naked comes as a \\"side-splitting\\" and \\"hilariously entertaining\\" memoir. For me, the humor started to die around the time Sedaris goes away to camp for a month. From that point on, the novel's comedic aspect drops off significantly. Granted, the novel definitely takes on a darker tone up until the last few chapters, but it was my expectation that it'd be funny for more than just half the book. In that regard, the reviews and descriptions of the book disappointed me.Overall, it's definitely a worthwhile read for anyone who wants to be genuinely captivated by another persons trials and tribulations as well as how they overcame them. Just don't expect to be a comedy from start to finish. I wouldn't quite give it 4 stars, but more along the lines of 3.5 stars. As it's been out for about 14 years now, Naked is certainly a bargain for the price. So if you end up not liking it as much as you thought, it won't have burned a large hole in your wallet. :)-Travis S."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I pulled this book out while getting ready to board a plane. I was sipping on a Starbuck's drink while I read. It was not long before I laughed so hard that I almost shot my latte out of my nose! I continued laughing until I cried. By the time I got to 30,000 feet I had no eye makeup left! I love David Sedaris. He is gritty and real. His stories remind me of the families I grew up around back East. I can't wait to read more of his books. Quirky stories and expertly delivered."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Certainly one of the most amusing and entertaining books I've read in quite some time, Naked is a collection of David Sedaris' narratives about his life adventures and his looney family. I laughed out loud numerous times while reading this book, and when I wasn't chuckling out loud, I had a knowing grin on my face. Sedaris is a master of diction--he knows precisely which words and metaphors to use in order to evoke maximum comic value from his musings. I did notice, however, that the lengthier pieces in this collection (especially \\"C.O.G.\\" and the title story) were not quite as amusing or entertaining as the shorter pieces (most notably \\"Get Your Ya-Ya's Out,\\" \\"I Like Guys,\\" \\"The Drama Bug,\\" and the hilarious \\"\\"Cyclops\\"). Perhaps Sedaris is more of a comic sprinter than a long-distance runner. No matter--he's a funny guy, and I look forward to reading his other books."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I went on a little David Sedaris book reading marathon and really enjoyed this book the most. I just loved the title story Naked; it's very easy to relate to how the author tells his story. It's like he's talking to you; your buddy, telling you a hilarious tale. Mahalo to David Sedaris for keeping me laughing during the holidays (when I really need a little levity to realize his family and life is just as insane as mine)."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book had me desperately trying to stifle laughs on my bus commute. David Sedaris is a true genius. The amazing thing is that he writes in a very simple style, but his observations are so keen and so wry--and his perspective so interesting--that the simplest everyday event becomes comic genius in his hands. The chapters True Detective, Drama Bug (especially), and I Like Guys were highlights. I LOVED this book! Don't miss out!!!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris makes me laugh out loud with stories you have to share with anyone who will listen. I've read all of his books (except Hercules) and this one and Me Talk Pretty are hilarious!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"this was my first introduction to this guy and i love him! i wish i could be that prosaic about my own family! listen to the audio, laugh out loud, scare your co-workers, FUNNY!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I love listening to David Sedaris on \\"This American Life\\" and think he's very funny, smart and clever. This is the first book of his I've read, and I was not disappointed. Most of the stories are side-splittingly funny, but there are a few that are almost too emotional or raw for my taste. Not too crude or unpleasant, just too personal, I think. I don't think I've ever read a book that was more aptly titled. Some of the stories (and all of them are great and well-written) just made me feel like he was baring himself (emotionally or psychologically) in a way I had not anticipated, and it was just a bit more than I bargained for. It won't stop me from reading some of his other books, though."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Read this book as soon as I received it. Love this writers witt in his writings....very good book"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Anyone who has read David Sedaris' work or listened to him on NPR knows he has a style all his own. The book Naked brings the reader along on a journey through short essays that describe, in detail, aspects of his life that the common man may never experience. The final essay, which shares the title of the book, describes his experience at a nudist colony. He embraces the awkwardness of the situation and bravely details his insecurities. A tool he skillfully uses through his entire collection of essays is humor. If the humor aspect were stripped away from his writing, his work most certainly would take a darker and more depressing tone. I believe this is what makes his writing unique: his honesty, his bravery, and not to mention his phenomenal skill as a writer and a storyteller. The topics he deals with are very real which give the reader a strong sense of connection to him and his experiences. I can't help but admire him for his ability to rise above difficult situations, particularly in his childhood.Sedaris' work can almost be described as having layers like an onion. On one level he is funny, on another he is honest and open, on yet another he is sarcastic, and at the core is a message about life. He tells a story without dominating the reader's experience; to get the core message one must look a little deeper, one must think! Any level of reader can appreciate his essays because no matter how deep one chooses to explore, he or she will find something to connect with, even if it's just for a laugh. I read his books when I'm having a bad day and need a little pick-me-up. I read his books when I want to be challenged as a reader. I read his books when I need inspiration. I recommend this book to anyone who wishes to be entertained and learn something new through another's life stories.Just to add, Me Talk Pretty One Day is another excellent book by David!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked is a light-hearted collection of wit and satire, a collection of short lyrical stories from his life. Nearly every reader will enjoy the wit and humor. But thoughtful readers can also appreciate how Sedaris succeeds in easing us closer to difficult material, such as the death of his mother and living with OCD. Naked, however, is not completely naked. The title misleads. Sedaris, in fact, keeps readers at a distance that I ultimately found disappointing."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked is a collection of short stories and essays about David Sedaris' own life. He is so funny, and clever. You can really identify with his writing and it is the kind of funny that makes you seriously laugh out loud and have people turn to look at you weird. If you enjoy gay men, quirkiness, feel uncomfortable in crowds, ever felt your family was infested with aliens, had siblings, went to camp, went to college, didn't go to college. This is the book for you. It will also interest people above current trends and trival things like fashion."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book on audio download is wonderful because the stories are hilarious and insightful, and so very honest. It's amazing how David looks at the most serious of subjects through a lens of humor and it works!The audio book is read by David Sedaris and that makes it much more personal and effective. I couldn't stop listening!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This was my first Sedaris book and I loved it. Laugh-out-loud funny and a down to earth style. I'm not on my 3rd book from this author. Love him!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"About 3 hours in length, hilarious recounting of the author's childhood, self-deprecation at its best. Recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is the God of Essays. He is the most observant writer on the planet. His work is smart AND funny. I can't get enough of his dry wit."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Good book,i liked Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim better but this one is funny too, if you like these kinds of books."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I began reading David Sedaris a while ago after hearing him on NPR and I gave this book to a friend after reading it. Sedaris is undoubtedly a humourist...but what bothers me about his fans who rant and rave about how \\"funny\\" he is, is that they never mention his profound sentimentalism, the touching undercurrents of melancholy in his books: he will make you laugh, but he will also make you cry. I found myself underlining certain phrases in this book because some of them are simply beautiful pieces of writing...some of them are valuable / prophetic insights about life. Sedaris is a masterful observer who is a cynic but he also has tremendous heart."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"After laughing out loud during his first book, I was ready for another. Then I overheard my friend chuckling non-stop over a book. It was Sedaris with Naked. Even if you are short on humor, you'll enjoy this book. Laughing out loud is good for the soul!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked starts off so strong that I thought it would end up being Sedaris' funniest book to date. Unfortunately, the last two stories ended up being a bit long winded and somewhat dullish sort of drving on the autobahn and coming to a sputtering start. Still, that should not detract you from the odd Sedaris' tales of him and his family. His youthful fantasy pretesiousness, his wisecracking mother who imitates him to his teachers, his crackpot father and whacky siblings which included four sisters and a loose cannon of a brother nicknamed \\"the rooster.\\""},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is on his way to becoming a national treasure. His essay-style books use the premise of his life and growing up in a dysfunctional family to look at life in general and living in America specifically. Putting political correctness aside, Sedaris succeeds in a form of national soul-searching, touching on everything from tension between the races and religions, to our desperate need find a connection to something higher, more meaningful than ourselves.Using hyperboles and wickedly funny humor, Sedaris hits on very essential things that we might think from time-to-time, but would either not have the insight to make the global connection as he does, or wouldn't have the nerve to speak aloud. Reading and thinking about this book, could save you 5 years on an analyst's couch!It makes you want to read everything the guy has ever written, or will write in the future. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is a very funny book, so funny that I shed tears of fun throughout the time that I read it. The title \\"Naked\\" is itself enticing, and reading the book offers no regrets for making the choice.The stories are excellently written with characters that are intuitively observed. The stories are laced with humorous lines and the flow is so smooth that it makes reading effortless.The plots are equally plot that is breath taking. Overall, the style reminds me of other works like The usurper and other stories, House of the Dead, White Fang. I found the stories hilarious and witty. They are also pager turners."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book is uneven. Everybody seems to have different favorite stories. I myself loved \\"A Plague of Tics,\\" but if you don't, there's probably something in here that you will like. This is for you if you like David Sedaris, NPR, or if you just think people with obsessive compulsive disorder are funny."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is an odd, odd man. That being said, his sense of humor will pull you into his wacky stories. I had tried several months ago to read this book and just couldn't get past the first couple of stories. They just didn't grab me or live up to the \\"sidesplitting\\" review on the back of the book. Around Christmas time, I heard him on NPR reading some of his stories I believe from \\"Holidays on Ice,\\" and they were hilarious. This month, \\"Naked\\" was selected for my book club. I decided to borrow the book on tape from the library and, boy, was that the right decision! Sedaris, in my opinion, is meant to be heard not read. Unfortunately, not all the stories are included in the abridged CD. I listened to the stories that were, and read the ones that were not. By far, my favorites are the ones I could listen to. My recommendation would be for others to buy the audio and listen to it as they drive around time. It almost feels like picking up a quirky hitchhiker or a friend-of-a-friend-of-a-friend who keeps you entertained while you mill about town, and even though he makes you a little bit uncomfortable at times, you still are not looking forward to arriving at your destination and having the conversation end..."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is one of the most entertaining non-fiction books out there; David Sedaris knows how to make us laugh and cry. Well, okay, he knows how to make us laugh _until_ we cry, and who would want it any other way?This series of fragmented memoirs is at its most entertaining when Sedaris relates his childhood memories of growing up in a typically dysfunctional family. He never fails to show himself as self-serving, and this brutal honesty makes us love him all the more. And he doesn't spare his family any either; in one memorable scene, his mother and sister are emulating the methods of a fictional detective they enjoy as they read the crime reports in the daily news.\\"We know that the girl was held at knifepoint on the second floor of her house,\\" Lisa said, tapping a pencil against her forehead. So the person who robbed her was...not in a...wheelchair.\\"Moments later, the mother reveals her own brilliant deduction, that a professional thief would have used a gun while this person could only afford a knife, meaning that the culprit was clearly a drug addict.This is just hilarious material, and while it does become slightly less enjoyable as young David's world expands and grows more complicated, the writing remains top notch throughout. Sedaris joins only a handful of other authors who have written their memoirs with the reader's enjoyment as the first priority.If you are leery of autobiographical writing because of the self-inflating nature of the genre, please make Naked the only memoir you every buy.You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris gives us a very revealing look at his flawed dysfunctional life in a way that has you laughing.Never having a \\"Woe is me\\" attitude, Sedaris arm chair quaterbacks a lot of his decisions with hilarious observations. He comes across as a likeable but flawed guy, not really sure of where or if he fits in. He never takes himself, or anything else too seriously.It makes you realize that life is never as bad as you think, or as good.I will definately buy the other books by him."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"These essays give an account of David Sedaris' childhood and early adulthood - the stories seem brutally honest, but he can always imbue what seems terrible and insurmountable with humour. I love the way he writes, and I laughed out loud many times. Although there were a couple of stories where the events were just plain horrible and unfair, and in the last essay \\"Naked\\" Mr. Sedaris repeatedly shows his complete lack of understanding of the names for female body parts, overall this is a worthwhile, entertaining read."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The autobiographical sketches in this book are nose-snottingly funny. I was afraid to take this book to the gym because of the unattractive physical manifestations the hilarity might provoke. But what makes these stories (or essays) so enduring is the underlying tragedy of it all. There are moments of incredible pathos, moments that would bleed the tears out of us in real life, and Sedaris has us laughing. I think, in a way, that Sedaris's work is so pitch perfect that by reading it, you are immersed in the same mechanisms that the wacky Sedaris family uses to deal with a weird a tragic world."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"If you've heard David Sedaris read excerpts from the Santaland Diaries on NPR, you know what I mean. I remember being half asleep, and hearing through my 6 a.m. haze this odd, little man talking about working as an elf at Macy's: an angry customer threatens that she's going to have him fired, to which he replies in his quiet, malevolent voice, &quot;I'm going to have you killed.&quot;If you only read the Santaland Diaries (one of the longer essays), this book is worth the price. You must have an appreciation, however, for bitchy, misanthropic humor. Otherwise skip it."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"i thought this book was awesome. the best ever by David Sedaris!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I think David Sedaris is a gem. This was the first book of his I came upon. I am now reading it again. I'm sure my own dysfunctional family matters make it sweeter for me. Some may be offended by his style, but no one does it better."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"You can't help but think about your own memoirs while reading &quot;Naked&quot;. The stories are painfully personal. You laugh, whince, fear, with David as he tells you the many facets of his own life experiences. Of course by the time you finish the book, he has brought many of your own life experiences back to the surface. Closing the back cover of the book, I couldn't help but feel like I was saying good-bye to a new found friend. I have not only read his &quot;secrets&quot; but have also relived some of my own. Not to worry though, I will order &quot;Me talk pretty some day&quot; and continue my own life revealing journey."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Growing up with nothing to protect himself but his wit,David reminds me of all those quiet &quot;unpopular&quot; kids you barely notice or dismiss as geeks, but when they finally speak your view is utterly changed. The only reason I didn't give this book a full five star is he hasn't translated that quirky speaking voice to the page."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I had to stop from time to time and contemplate the world in which Sedaris lives/has lived as a talented, gay, Greek man living in Raleigh with his dysfunctional family and twisted worldview. I had to take said breaks, becase this book is too funny and meaty to read in big doses without some measure of physical or mental harm. BUY THIS NAUGHTILY FUNNY BOOK!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"A long time ago someone lent me Barrel Fever, the one with The Santaland Diaries in it. I really liked that. This one's better. In the intervening years, I've heard him on NPR a couple times, and now I read his stories and hear his voice reading them, and that makes them funnier. And get this, from the blurbs, a quote from James Thurber: &quot;Let me be the first to say that the naked truth about me is to the naked truth about Salvador Dali as an old ukelele in the attic is to a piano in a tree, and I mean a piano with breasts.&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I don't often read books twice - even my favorite authors. I found this book lying in some boxes and picked it up to read, thinking I hadn't read it before. About 1/4 of the way through, I realized I had read it before (obviously a long time ago), but was so thoroughly enjoying it again, I read on, even though I knew how it all ended. A wonderful book. I can't wait to read more David Sedaris!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The author's view of life is definitly unique. More than once, I found myself cocking my head to one side and saying &quot;hmmmm, I never thought of it that way before.&quot; The book is well written and is hilarious. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I don't know how this book made it to the NY Times Bestseller. It was the worst piece of writing I have ever read. Even twenty year olds in my previous fiction workshops could write a more substantial, insightful story than Sedaris. It's pathetic that all it takes to sell thousands of copies of a novel is a person inventing the most outrageous stories about his 'supposed' real life. This should have been classified under fiction, since there is hardly a shred of truth to these short memoir essays. My advice : don't waste your money &amp; time for this garbage; it comes a dime a dozen."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I have yet to laugh. The humor is the sick and annoying type that I cannot stand from human beings much less from a book. Half the time I am waiting for the climax, but instead hit the plateau that the book has been riding on since page 1. I bought this book with all of its overwhelming reviews, but it is entirely disapointing. Plan to sell it off as soon as I can....buyers?"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I only listened to 10 minutes of David Sedaris' book &quot;Naked&quot; on tape before shutting it off. I don't find obsessive/compulsive behavior comical, which is what the main character of the first &quot;humorous&quot; essay clearly displayed. Sorry, but mental illness isn't funny to me. Treatable, yes; funny, no. Thankfully, I rented this tape from the library, so I didn't waste money on it. I couldn't give &quot;0 stars&quot; in this review, or I would have done so."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Wouldn't ya like to be??"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book was absolutely disgusting. I could NOTHING redeeming about his family. He is a much too tortured soul to enjoy hearing his inner most thoughts! I love to read to escape reality and this book smears my nose in it over and over again!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"An annoying disjointed book. I didn't enjoy reading it. The author jumps from one bad anecdote to another. How this is humor beats me!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"After having enjoyed \\"Take the Canoli\\" (Sarah Vowell), I thought I would stick with the NPR storytelling genre, and bought this book as it was on the Amazon's \\"also bought\\" list.Written auto-biographically, Sedaris describes the nightmare of his childhood, as well as the nighmare of a child he must have been to his parents. He describes in detail his childhood obsessive compulsive behaviors, like screaming unexplicably in class, compulsive rocking, listening the same pop tunes hundreds of times, the need to smash his nose up agaisnt window glass when he was in a car, and how he had to count each step on the way home from school (with assorted rituals along the way, like opening doors with his elbows. This was a messed up kid. (or the fiction of a deranged person). I did not find it funny at all -- it was distrubing.He also talks about his family including a father so obsessed with getting his kids to take up golf, that he finds it more important to keep the author and his sister at a professional golf event, than to deal with his daughter's first menstruation. Sick parent. Sick kid.I put down the book about 1/3 of the way through, when he reveals his alternate sexual preference. For those of us who want to believe that such is a choice/preference of otherwise normal healthy people, this book disturbs that notion. I will share this book with no one -- I think I will throw it away."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author, and was hoping to find a light sense of humor; instead, I found his sense of humor to be irreverent and sometimes bordering on sick."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"NAKED by David Sedaris comprises seventeen chapters of ostensibly amusing autobiographical reminiscences spanning his North Carolina childhood through teenage years to young adulthood.Finishing NAKED didn't leave me feeling good. There's a tinge of unhealthiness about the author's humor that reminds me of the faint odor of sickness perceptible while walking down an otherwise spotless hospital corridor. Perhaps it's because David's wit is based on the shortcomings of others and/or his own poor self image. Quite often, his target is other family members.About a sister: \\"Lisa couldn't be trained to scoot the food scraps off her soiled sheets, much less shake out the blanket and actually make the bed.\\"About his father: \\"My mother had stopped listening to him years ago, but it was almost a comfort that my father insisted on business as usual, despite the circumstances (of his wife's cancer) ... He had made a commitment to make her life miserable, and no amount of sickness or bad fortune would sway him from that task.\\"About himself: \\"The moment I realized I would be a homosexual for the rest of my life, I forced my brother and sisters to sign a contract swearing they'd never get married. ...My fear was that ... one by one they would abandon us until it was just me and my parents ...\\"Sedaris characterizes his mother as a chain-smoker and an alcoholic; his father as one that ignores a daughter's terror when her first menstrual period begins even as they're attending a pro golf tournament. And family togetherness is the time they confront the mystery of which one in the group - parents, six children and grandmother - is substituting the bath linens for toilet paper. However, it's not always about dysfunction. I did find it droll when one of David's sisters, a waitress, brings home on Christmas Eve a co-worker who's also a part-time prostitute. Ho, ho, ho!There's more to NAKED than remembering warm familial fuzziness, as when Sedaris was off at college, on a cross-country bus ride, picking apples in Oregon, or visiting a nudist camp. Yet, the humor during these interludes follows much the same tenor - occasionally amusing, more often pitiable and sad, always joyless, and ultimately tiresome.Is Sedaris a gifted writer? Yes, he is. And I'm giving NAKED three stars instead of two for his different perspective on life. But I don't think I'll buy any more of his books."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"i'm glad snoop diggity-d has decided to come out of the closet with his film talents!i mean i was really getting mad because there isn't a wide distribution of his earlier work...or david sedaris' for that matter. i have to go to the little specialty/foreign shop off broad st. to get them both. but when i came out yesterday with snoop's last skin flick and dave's Naked i immediately read Naked before watching Snoop. i must say that the cat story is a stroke of cheese-wiz like genius.LONG LIVE SOUP! uh..i mean snoop."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"No offense, it's just his voice is kinda annoying. Sort of like the first story in this collection, it grates on me somethin fierce. But i am happy to report things picked up after that. Maybe it's something baout the style of writers like Sedaris, and his contemporaries who always get lumped with him, that the work is not easily relatable to people of a different generation than the author. I can't say if it's true, since my age falls under the same epochal regions as Sedaris. Having said that, I think that most people can glean some enjoyment from this book, which I feel is his best collection (Me Talk Pretty got a little tiresome to me). What ties most of these stories together is the feeling that they are being related by a man who knows something funny (both &quot;ha ha&quot; and &quot;hmmm&quot; varieties) is going on, but doesn't know quite what it is or how to feel about it. I cite the scene in which his god-serving patron throws him out of the car, ostensibly for selling more trinkets than his mentor at a flea market, and Sedaris mutely exits, then heaves a big rock at the back of the car, making satisfying contact. He gives no explanation, nor could he, I'd wager, if pressed. Alternately fascinating and hilarious (excepting that first story of course)."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Browsing through the book section of the store at the student union building of the college I am going to (State University of New York at Oneonta), the title of this book grabbed my eye. I am so glad that after flipping through the book I decided to buy it, because once I began reading it, I could not stop thinking about it. While that may not have been the best to be mulling over during my classes, every moment not divided to school I was rushing to finish &quot;Naked.&quot; I loved it, quite simply."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"he's a real nutbar is David. he goofs around and is a bit phony but thats okay. his mother died. he wears pink ladies jackets sometimes. not sure about the Christian bit mind. stash box for anyone?"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The first book I read by David Sedaris was Me Talk Pretty One Day and I loved that. LMAO funny! Then I bought this book... I hated it so much stopped reading and THREW IT IN THE TRASH! It was painfully tedious, not funny or interesting in any way. Barrel Fever was Terrible too. Ive read all of his other books and I love them."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"After the hilarious &quot;Me talk pretty some day&quot;, I was looking forward to this volume. It was a big letdown. For one thing, the author comes across as a very unpleasant person, one who lacks any sympathy for others. Everything is &quot;me, me, me&quot;, &quot;I am so great and everyone else deserves to be poor and to suffer&quot;. He takes advantage of other people's kindness (something he could use a bit of) and then mistakes it for stupidity and mocks them even when they are good enough to keep him from starvation. I left the book feeling toward the author as if he were someone I would never want to deal with. An unsavory revelation of a man who I once thought of as a clever comic talent but now see as a creep. If anyone finds his essays here about quadraplegics and very poor working people (and their homes, which he loves to make fun of) funny, you are welcome to join the creepy human society of which Sedaris is now an honorary member. Too bad Sedaris is too shallow to be able to mix his humour with a bit of pity and warmth. He might rise above the merely vulgar and predictable misanthropy which he wallows in and become a first class humourist. An adolescent attempt at humour that goes nowhere and isn't funny. Stick with &quot;Me talk pretty some day&quot; and &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; if you are looking for laughs."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I ordered this item on August 11, 2010 and it was shipped within the first 36 hours!

It's especially good when sister Amy Sedaris is riding in the back seat. Just wish is wasn't abridged."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is was my first \\"exposure\\" to David Sedaris and remains a favorite of mine. Listening to him read his own work is a much richer experience than reading it from a book. His humor is magnified, his stories even more humanized. These stories of his childhood are at once heartbreaking and hysterical."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is the third Sedaris book I've read. It's also the funniest and the darkest. It's clear he used up all his good material in this one. The stories in his later books are definitely not as inspired.I did feel a little guilty laughing at his poor Greek grandmother and the amputee guy with the jade clocks. \\"My mother was pregnant with her sixth child when we learned that Ya-Ya had been hit by a truck.\\" Oh man, I had tears streaming down my face at that point.Some of the stories are less successful--I didn't see how the \\"Dinah the Christmas Whore\\" story was supposed to be funny, and the quadriplegic girl was just sad.He is a snob, but I think that's part of the humor: he's a snob that has no right to be one."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Not hilarious as suggested by other readers, but amusing in every way. Written in a frank, straight forward way, you can almost imagine you are sitting next to David as he goes about his crazy life.

I'll read more of his books for sure!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Excellent read; stories are put into great context and Sedaris is a fantastic storyteller..."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I have never laughed out loud as much as I did with \\"Naked\\".

This is the 1st book I read by Sedaris, but it definitely won't be the last. I am picking up his more recent novels straight away."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I loved this book. Each individual story was entertaining and hilarious! The entire book kept me laughing. Going through his day to day routines, coming to find that nothing was as it seemed.

Here are some highlights that make Naked a must-read:1. Get Your Ya-Ya's Out--a merciless profile of his crabby grandmother and the power she held over the household when infirmity required she move in with Sedaris' immediate family. The acrimonious conflict between the grandmother and Sedaris' mother is juicy and hilarious.2. Planet of the Apes--chronicles Sedaris' hitchhiking escapades, some of which are so dramatic and dangerous that a film could be adapted to these adventures.3. The Incomplete Quad--to get a room and board discount from the university, Sedaris agrees to room and care for a roommate, a college girl who suffers from quadriplegia. Her physical limitations and life of rejection cause her to be Sedaris' cynical hitchhiking soulmate. The two travel together throughout the country, as \\"husband and wife,\\" Sedaris the upstanding husband standing by his lady's side as he languishes in her wheelchair. They use this ruse to pique the sympathy of strangers and become inflated with pride and arrogance as they dupe the public.4. C.O.G. (Child of God)--at fifty pages and comprised of three parts, this is perhaps Sedaris' strongest essay in the collection. He describes mifits who ride the bus across the country, a strange middle-aged man who lives with his mother whom Sedaris meets while working at an apple processing plant in Oregon, and the C.O.G. a born-again amputee (right of a Flannery O'Conner short story) who suffers from alcoholism, flatulence, and a dream, contrary to his self-proclaimed piety, of making materialistic riches."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"NAKED, by David Sedaris, is a compilation of seventeen autobiographical short stories. Essays, if you will. What's imparted here are sagas of a life less- ordinary in the most self deprecating prose I've encountered since the heydays of Mr. -I can't get no respect- Rodney Dangerfield. Some stories, like my favorite \\"C.O.G.\\", are imbued with slapstick humor and wit to boot. \\"The incomplete QUAD\\" is a lovely, albeit bittersweet tale of quadriplegic life that manages to be funny only by Sedaris' paragonless penmanship. Not all the stories are compelling, however. Despite its promising title, \\"The women's open\\" is a moribund account of the author sister's graduation to womanhood. The whole tale is pointless at best, and fails to make PAR with Sedaris father's maniacal penchant for the sport of Golf. Arguably no point is intended in these stories, but some like \\"The women's open\\" are simply not worthy of print.In all, I wasn't afflicted by a case of \\"I can't put the book down\\", nor was I rolling on the floor laughing, but I did enjoy reading this book. I placed it preciously on my nightstand at the end of each essay, as I blissfully longed to perusing the next tale, much to the bemused stares of my paramour.Four Stars for entertainment value and readability. To be sure, the book is a recommended levity inducing alternative to today's gray matter sacking TV programming."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I love David Sedaris. I wish I was as good a writer as David Sedaris. His work should be taught in college-level writing classes. All hail King David. That being said, Naked was a little harsh for me. I loved it and I laughed out loud, but there was plenty to make me squirm, too. Not that the underbelly of society shouldn't be funny, mind you. I'm just a little too sensitive for some of the \\"naked\\" reality of Sedaris' life. It's not a criticism of the book - I'd gladly hand over another $14.95 directly to the author as a reward for being so entertaining. It's just a comment that I haven't noticed as I scrolled through some of the reviews."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David's Greek. I'm Greek. And we both grew up in strange worlds as Naked's opening essays prove.Still, you don't have to be part of the Greek club. What's not funny about an old grandmother picking through the neighbors bird-feeder? How can we not be sympathetic and sickened by Sedaris' childhood ticks and compulsions? I won't give away any more, except that this is better than &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day.&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The best part of this collection of essays is the first half, the ones covering his childhood. They're funny in an offbeat and skewed way, and are easy to breeze through. Once Mr. Sedaris starts talking about his hitchhiking travels, the comedy subsides quite a bit. His last essay, Naked, was hard to get through; he tries to end with a triumphant message, but it falls flat. If you've heard him on PBS or seen The Santaland Diaries, you'll like this."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"my goodness. this novel will definitely make other people question your sanity. while i was sitting in class one day, i remembered some funny parts of the book and i just busted out laughing. it was hard to explain to my teacher and classmates how the hell i could be quiet one moment and laughing insanely the next. the book is just so hilarious, you can't help but laugh out loud. i was a bit disappointed, though, that i didn't find the latter part of the book as funny. but it's a good read. i recommend it, but not if you can't stand people looking at you strangely. ;)"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I have to say David Sedaris is one of my favorite authors. No one can write more funny stories about everyday life than he can. I read his latest book \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" first and had missed his first book \\"Naked\\" so decided to go back and read that, after enjoying \\"Talk Pretty\\" so much. Naked is another collection of his funny stories about everyday living and truly a funny book. I really enjoyed it, maybe not as much as \\"Talk Pretty\\" but it was almost equal. If you want a good laugh, and need cheering up, make sure you read these 13 stories."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is a genius. The only problem with his books is that there aren't enough of them. Naked was a pleasure to read (as were Barrel Fever and Holidays on Ice). His writing style is easy and comfortable and the stories are better than good. Witty, funny, and entertaining... I can't begin to say enough good things about Naked."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris is a master of the short story. This and &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; are the funniest books I have ever read. I used to read this book while riding the bus to work in San Francisco. I would be in tears with laughter and everybody else on the bus would look at me like I was crazy, I wasn't, this is a beautiful thing! If you ever have the chance to hear Sedaris read his stories don't pass it up, his voice characterizations and inflections make these stories even better, if that were possible. Read this book you will not forget or regret it!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"My roommate would love David Sedaris's particular brand of humor. I won't know this for sure-at least not anytime soon-because he won't read what others would like him to read (book clubs are anathema). Actually, everyone I know likes Sedaris's brand of humor. I've enjoyed my share of NPR Morning Edition and This American Life spots myself. But I can't say that I entirely enjoyed Naked.Why? The first story, \\"Chipped Beef\\" pulled me in immediately, delighted with the power of the young David's imagination, entranced by the unique difficulties he faced as a child, and I laughed a lot. Again, I ask myself, Why did I laugh so much? Well, Sedaris seems to have a knack for describing people who are incredibly familiar and in so doing bring to the forefront their fears and weaknesses and personal oddities. So there are, scattered across the pages, a whole bunch of ordinary people with strange ideas or habits or prejudices exposed.I think the title for the book is a good one. Not just because it describes what I see as the best story in the book, but because there's a whole lot of exposure going on in the stories. We see people being guided by all sorts of crazy ideas, and as David tells the story in the contexts he sets up, he shows just how crazy their ideas may be. By crazy I think I mean anti-productive, self destructive behavior. Like the man who created jade clocks in the shape of Oregon, fervently worshipping God while being a real ass to David, who was essentially providing free labor for the guy.But by about the time I got to \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore,\\" I realized I wasn't enjoying the book anymore. I found it depressing because everyone just seemed so ridiculous. That's why I think my roommate would like the book. (though we'll never know) He's an existentialist (though he resists labels) who frequently assumes a Camusian posture saying things like \\"because the universe has no inherent meaning other than what we bring to it, it in its naked state is essentially meaningless.\\" \\"everything is absurd because nothing is innately meaningful. therefore, it's all worthy of being poked fun at.\\"The Platonist in me searches for meaning, for edification in this book-any book really. Why should I read this? What can I learn from this? I was reading the book while standing in line at La Mancha Blanca, when a woman, who I later learned was named Kim, told me it was a wonderful book. So funny! She said. Yes, I said, but it's getting difficult for me. Depressing, really. She said, yes-the bit about losing his mother and all, but he comes at it all from such a higher place.That was shocking to me really. She was sucked back into another conversation before I got to explore what she meant (or maybe I just didn't want to), but I did think about it later. It then occurred to me what the rest of the planet probably knows by the time they learn to tie their shoes-humor does come from a higher place. David Sedaris suffered a lot in his life. And he continues to suffer. And yet he puts it all into a context in which he and his cohorts are absurd. And so we can laugh. And from the laughter we draw strength. That is higher thinking. Do I want to be like David Sedaris? Is he my hero? Mid-way through the book I would've said no way. He's getting pushed around by life-he's essentially a weak character, not a strong one. He is pushed around by life; he simply reports it in a way that makes people laugh. He gets a charge out of diminishing others.But now I think maybe he is a hero of mine. He's my hero for not rising above human folly-which is everywhere. He rises above it to laugh and to inspire others to laugh. He exposes us for all our absurdities and we laugh. We laugh even when it's all too real and we'd just as soon cry. Why? Because it's really all coming from the same place. But there is tremendous strength in laughter. David Sedaris's breed of laughter sponsors love for humankind, and it sponsors strength. Maybe somehow David Sedaris has joined forces between Plato and Camus.Will I read other works by David Sedaris? Yes, I believe I will. I believe I will read his stories to remember the strength of laughter. But perhaps more importantly I think I would like to develop a bit of a Sedaris eye-a way of looking at people and situations with a very honest sense of their absurdity, and then love what I find instead of judging it. I'd like to learn how to embrace the absurd. I think Sedaris is my hero in that.\\"For the first time in what felt like years, I saw stockings and handbags. Bodies, fat and thin, were packed into slacks and pleated skirts. Every outfit resembled a costume designed to reveal the aspirations of the wearer. The young man on the curb would like to make the first Olympic skateboarding team. The girl in the plastic skirt longs to live in a larger town. I found myself looking at these people and thinking, I know what you look like naked. I can tell by your ankles and the tightness of your belt. The flush of your face, the hair sprouting from your collar; the way your shirts hang off those bony hips: you can't hide it from me.\\"Naked, p. 291And it's true-it doesn't seem like anyone can hide much of anything from David Sedaris. Everyone, every situation is exposed. He has the gift, or has exercised the patience to acquire the talent, of really seeing people. Another great mark of a higher state-awareness. But perhaps another reason the book began to wear on me was because of the down side of having that gift:\\"The glasses, when worn, gave me the look of someone both enthused and exhausted by what he saw. They suggested the manic weariness inherent in their promise, capturing the moment when the sheen wears off and your newfound gift becomes something more closely resembling a burden.\\"Naked, p. 291He offers his vision and bears his burden with marvelously good humor. No, he may not have the wisdom to uplift endless generations of humanity, but he does provide a model for seeing and a tool for aquiring strength.Yes, David Sedaris, today you are my hero."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"When I bought this book I was apprehensive at first, as I went along reading this book it got better and better. I found myself laughing out loud all of the time. This book is my favorite of all the books I have ever read and is better than any other of his books.

Sedaris finds humor in his faults, his family, and the strange situations that he encounters. Unlike some other popular memoirs, \\"Naked\\" is very well written and easy to enjoy. Each essay (as his chapters are called) is short, humorous, and enjoyable, and gives you an idea of what Sedaris's life has been like.I highly recommend \\"Naked\\" by David Sedaris.

We were in Paraguay, where he was in the Peace Corps, and read this book out loud to each other. It was so funny that I bought everything I could find by him when I came home to Seattle. I love everything he's written - and seeing him in person is a special treat - but this book holds a special place in my heart and there's one story in there that still makes me laugh just thinking about it. When you get to the part where he's trolling for his 'real parents' and his mother finds him...you'll know what I mean. This book is a treasured part of my library."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is my second David Sedaris collection of essays. The first one (When You Are Engulfed in Flameswas okay, but I was told he was much better in person, reading from this stories, and that this was the better of the two. I don't know if I would agree with this.Now I enjoyed reading the essays, but I really felt that the \\"poor me\\" tone of the book was overplayed. Sedaris is not for the masses. And I doubt if you will ever find a copy of his books in the living room of theDeer Hunting with Jesuscrowd. Still, there were those comments that were oh so observant or witty. Here are three examples:- How to respond to those bizarre comments from drivers who picked you up as a hitchhiker so that you don't alienate them: \\"If they believed in, say, the enforced sterilization of redheads, it was best just to say, 'Hmm, I never thought about it, but maybe you're onto something'\\" (p. 126). I think I can use this line in a number of situations.- \\"The bus from North Carolina to Oregon takes four days, which breaks down to roughly seventy-five thousand hours if one is traveling without the aid of a strong animal tranquilizer. It was my fate that any AWOL marines, tear-stained runaways, or drunken parolees would sit so close that on the off chance they might pass out, I was guaranteed to collect their bubbling saliva on the collar of my shirt\\" (p. 153).- \\"Test eye shadow on all the rabbits you want. Strap electrodes to the skulls of rhesus monkeys and shock them into a stupor, but it is inhumane to place a nudist on horseback the day after a chili cook-off. ('Was he ALWAYS an Appaloosa?')\\" (p. 253).Subtle, funny, sophisticated."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I picked up the book Naked by David Sedaris at a thrift store and it's been collecting dust on my computer cabinet at home ever since. Not because I didn't want to read it but because my floor-to-ceiling bookcases are crammed full and I just hadn't gotten around to it yet. The reason for my sudden interest is due, in full, to a Facebook note that circulated yesterday instructing the reader to grab the first book nearest you and post the fifth sentence from page 56 as your Facebook status. \\"Pimps and circus clowns have been dressing that way for years.\\" jumped off the page at me and after going through several pages on my train commute to work this morning, I was hooked.Perhaps because I can (painfully) relate, the section entitled \\"A Plague of Tics\\" where the author recounts his earliest memories of OCD, was hysterically funny to me. I tried to read it during my lunch break but was seriously afraid I was going to choke, I was laughing so hard - I had to put my fork down. I imagine even non-sufferers of this wretched and embarrassing absurdity of a disorder will find humour in his comical narrative.I owe it to my Facebook friends for inspiring me to finally dust the cover and crack this one open. I haven't laughed this much in one setting since watching Kevin James perform his onstage act Sweat the Small Stuff.I've barely gotten through the first few chapters, but I am completely enamored. More later . . ."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book was hillarious! I wouldn't say it's \\"laugh out loud\\" funny, but its witty. David Sedaris writes in a very sarcastic tone.

It is a quick read, but one that is well worth it!!!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Unbelievably, pant-wettingly funny. His take on apple-picking is one of the most beautifully structured comic essays in history, and his experiences in a nudist colony are brilliant. Sedaris is a god. A god!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book caught me quite off guard. My sister had been telling me about this author David Sedaris for a while and she got me a copy of Naked for Christmas one year. It took me some time to read it and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. I trust my sister's taste in books but I had never really read a humorous book before so I didn't know what to expect. Sedaris's quirky and self indulgent humor caught me completely off guard and I actually found myself laughing out loud, something I rarely do when reading. The thing that I love about his writing style too is that I find he has a good blend of mixing humor and very moving little portraits of people (mostly his beloved dysfunctional family) without becoming sappy or cliched. My only gripe with this book was that a few of the stories pace dragged a bit, so I couldn't give it a five star rating. But on the whole, it is a great title that should be picked up by those who want a good laugh."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read this book on an overnight train from Florence to Paris and thought I was going to roll out of the bed because I was laughing so hard.

I am looking forward to Me Talk Pretty - and more laughs!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I far preferred Naked to his previous Barrel Fever, which I found to be mean spirited. Naked is brilliant, funny and touching. Luckily I read Cyclops on a loud plane because I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe for 20 minutes. Also memorable were his articulate characterizations of his parents which vary from vivid to exquisite and kind (Ashes)."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris has the kind of sense of humor we all wish we had. He looks at the world through twisted glasses and the result is hilarious. Sedaris writes simple stories with amazing uniqueness. I have to say, his story &quot;A Plague of Tics&quot; got an A+ for uncanny humor and for provoking side-splitting laughter. Other stories like &quot;I Like Guys&quot; and &quot;Dix Hill&quot; may not have been extremely funny, but they were very satisfying. Read this book, everyone, because we all need a good laugh and no one does it better than Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The worst thing about this book was trying to wrench it from the hands of other members of my household.....we were fighting over it! Never, never, never set this book down until you have finished reading it!I laughed until I cried over the detective story.....and I WILL be replacing my brown bath towels!Buy this book for a friend who needs a pick-me-up!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I don't know how I stumbled onto this book (I must get me some new friends), but I'm sure glad I did. Of course, his writing is laugh- out- loud funny; a kind of tonic for the spirits. I loved reading about his family life; these chapters were suffused with a compassion and kind of gentleness towards himself and his family members. As a mom, myself, I tire of reading about all these idealized mothers, or conversely, the mothers from hell. Most of us are somewhere in between, trying to do the best we can, though rarely with the wit of Mr. Sedaris' mother. But I plan to try harder.Looking forward to more!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"These stories are hilarious. Sedaris is naturally funny and is quick with a witty one-liner. And the way he describes people, you feel you know them. Probably my favorite story is the first one on how he dealt with his childhood tics: as he walks home, Sedaris had to go through the most bizarre set of obsessive-compulsive actions you ever heard. If you wanna laugh, buy this one."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read the fudge colored towels part on an airplane. I laughed hysterically and was sure that security was going to be waiting for me when I exited the plane. When I finished the book, I felt that I had been invited in to meet someone with no holds barred. I was left with the sense that I could pick up the phone and call David Sedaris and it would be like calling a friend. A must read."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Don't lend this book to your friends. Invite them over and drink lemonade and vodka out of those big plastic glasses from McDonalds and read it out loud (if you can).

The first time I read Naked, I laughed until my sides ached. Lighten up, naysayers- comedy ain't pretty."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Found the book NAKED unbelieveable.

If they had cut maybe 30 pages, it would have been perfect."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is one of the modern writers with a skill for comedy. The stories in this collection are funny enough to give you laughs even after the first reading.\\"Chipped Beef\\" is one of the great early stories, demonstrating the use of understatement and overstatement to make a story of childhood one that is memorable with quite a few belly laughs.\\"A Plague of Tics\\" gives the reader a look into physical comedy on the page. The thought of the young man shaking and licking his way to school and back, every day is so hilarious that it is quite marvelous.\\"The Drama Bug\\" demonstrates the childhood fascination with drama but also the inflation of one's own talent with something that actually resembles talent. And that happens all the time. Well done."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This was my second Sedaris read after Me Talk Pretty One Day. He is eccentric and funny and a good writer. But no one lives a life like this, do they? Is it possible that many crazy things happened to one person who isn't even 60 yet? I dunno. It did get several out loud guffaws out of me, though.

Truly the best wittest writer. I could understand completely through his emotions..I said&quot; Wait a minute is this my life?...Hold on is this my family? I would love to met you Mr. Sedaris as well as seeing your plays. The level of humor is what I've been waiting for a long time..NO MORE Dramitica(meaning dramatic) stories in my life.

Noone tells the story of being a human with random life experiences better than Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe. David Sedaris has really hit the mark with this book. You can't help but feel happy for his success."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I got this book for my birthday, and I was less than pleased at first: Autobiographical stories of death and other rather somber topics, sprinkled with humour - this was what I was promised at Dave Egger's \\"Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius\\" - and even though that book WAS quite funny until the real book started, I didn't really connect to the humour.This is quite different here. Sedaris partly writes about stuff that could be rather tedious and boring, but which becomes interesting quickly even in the less outrageous stories pretty soon. I caught a few quizzical glances while laughing out loud in the subway twice - something that happens rarely to me (really !).I also liked Sedaris approach to autobiographical writing. He doesn't work in chronological order, and that is quite interesting, especially when certain angles appear in different stories again. I was particularly impressed by the story Ashes, which handles death absolutely non-sappy and yet heartbreaking.I'll be sure to check out Sedaris' other books - you should too."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Don't read this book in the company of other people. The first few times you burst into laughter, they may smile up at you with an inquisitive look, hoping to hear a short excerpt that gives them cause to do a bit of giggling themselves. The fiftieth time you do so is more likely to result in their carving out your tongue with the nearest sharp object. Fortunately, I was reading this at an airport, where every sharp object larger than a thumbtack had been scrupulously removed by the security personnel on the way in. If you enjoy humor that is as darkly twisted as it is sharp-witted, your sides are guaranteed to be hurting after the first chapter."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read this book, desparate to read something fun. This was exactly what I was looking for. There were parts of this book that were so funny, I couldn't help but wake my husband up with my laughter. Excellent book, very funny in parts, poignant in others. Read it."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The best thing about David Sedaris is that he is NOT a gay writer... he just happens to be gay. When he mentions something about his sexuality, it's very matter of fact- and really has nothing to do with the story he's trying to tell. I found so many things that I could relate to in this book... and things that made me think that my own family really isn't all that strange (when compared to his family!) Everyone I have ever let borrow this book has wound up buying it for themselves (or received it as a gift!). If you hate this book there is something really, really wrong with you!! Make sure you check out all of David's other books- they are all completely wonderful, and all have a permanent place in my book shelf! Check out his audio tapes too... you have not lived until you've heard David's Billie Holiday impression!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The kind of book you want to recommend to everyone everywhere except your parents. Loved it-this guys a winner!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read this book by accident - I thought it was another book someone told me about. It was the best mistake I ever made. I've since passed the book onto at least ten other people and all have said the same. First, &quot;thank you, thank you, thank you&quot; and then how they literally laughed out loud. Next they begin regaling me with excerpts from the book which I told them to read."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"If I laughed any harder my gums would bleed. David - thanks."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked is one of the best books I have read in a long time. Sedaris has a gift for portraying rich characters--although this book is based on his life, I'm willing to bet that he's prone to hyperbole in some of the situations he describes--he'd *have* to be. :) Some other people have said say in their postings that they think this book is sad--I disagree. Sedaris chronicles his experiences without self-pity and states his choices without apology. The book is broken into individual vignettes of situations that seem to perfectly come together at the end. An excellent book--I look forward to more."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"In Naked, David Sedaris takes to heart that most trite of writing advice, he is honest. This brings forward the entertaining quirks of his characters as well as the evolution of their development in crisp relief. Naked is a hilarious and brave account of growing up gay in America. While his characterizations and situations will strike you as surreal, they simultaniously ring true. At first the author's style may seem a bit of a challenge, but as the stories progress you will warm to it. I was grateful he had taken the extra effort to deliver such startlingly familiar situations in such a disarming and intimate way. Whether you are reading for the writing or for the story, Naked delivers in sensitive, tight prose that paint a startlingly clear portrait of life you will keep with you long after turning the last page."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I literally had to put this book down on a number of occasions because I was laughing so hard. I will never look at a bath towel in the same light after reading this brilliantly funny novel of dysfunctional family relations -- although the more I read, the more I realised that dysfunctionality is more the norm in ALL families."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"sedaris is easily the funniest person writing in america today. I did not want this book to end, and stretched its reading out as long as possible. His writing is polished, tight and to the point, but every line is hysterical; every portrait of the people around him, destined to bring nods of empathy from his readers. After i finished this one, i ran out and bought his other two: you cannot have too much Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Although the book was well written and did contain many witticisms, I found the book to be sad and depressing. The stories of a lonely grandmother, psychiatric wards, and a father consumed with golf, left me feeling mournful for this family, and turned my thoughts to the darker side of life. Unfortunately, I was expecting a light-hearted look at an adolescent's growing pains that might have made me laugh at some of my own background and given me a connection to the author and other readers."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Beware! Naked is not for the easily embarrassed. This outrageously funny book tickled me to the point where I could not read it in public. There were too many times that I cracked the book on the subway home and had folks staring me up and down. At home...it was worse. Late at night with my better half sleeping soundly next to me I would bust out laughing and wake the dead. Sedaris weaves an acid humor with a blend of pathos. Just when you catch your breath and wipe your tears he wacks you again...I can't wait for more from this talented story teller."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"We see in the final, title essay that it takes a lot of courage to get naked on your first trip to a nudist camp; it's a while before the author can do it. But in every preceding essay of this agonizingly funny collection he has already embraced a far more courageous brand of exhibitionism: he has bared his soul, in all its scarred and pockmarked ignominy. It is risky enough for a novelist to give us an ugly protagonist; the essayist cannot quite so easily say, &quot;It's a character! It's not me! I see the character's faults just as you do.&quot;Sedaris's saving grace is that he does see his protagonist's faults as clearly as we do--probably much more clearly, having lived with them for so long. He knows that when he describes the pathetic little lives of the ignorant, unsophisticated people it is his misfortune to come in contact with, we filter his assessments through the awareness that the existence he describes is at least as pathetic. And when we realize that those despised secondary characters are far more like the protagonist than he would ever admit, when we sense that they merit more tolerance than he can give them, we begin to tolerate the intolerant protagonist as well. Nakedness suddenly becomes him."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I bought this book because I knew it'd make me laugh. I had no idea it would also make me worry, feel sad, and feel moved. David Sedaris is a terrific humorist, and a true child of late 20th century America. The stories he tells are at once appalling and a scream. I've read several passages out loud to people and they end up laughing (a lot!) and asking, &quot;WHAT book is that?&quot; We read it in my bookclub last month (my suggestion), and everyone loved it, even the ones who started out by saying, &quot;I thought I wouldn't like this, but...&quot; I can't wait for David's next book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Most people, at some point or another, think that their own lives would provide great material for a book. Usually this turns out not to be the case, but David Sedaris proves to be the exception with this highly entertaining, often hilarious book. Some essays were definitely more entertaining than others, but all are worth reading. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked, Barrel Fever,and Holidays on Ice are 3 wonderfully woven books. I love them and reccomend them to anyone and everyone. One might think it is straight comedy, but he uses events in his life that would sometimes be considered troubling or sad and says them in such monotone, you realize that &quot;don't sweat the small stuff&quot; is evident in every sentence. I love these books and the David Sedaris is an amazing person, i can't wait for his next book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris goes where no-one should go in literature, but it works. I do have a guess as to who was shitting on the bathroom towels, though. It is a book you can read over &amp; over."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked was the best book I ever read. It made me laugh out loud. If you like funny books you should deffinetly read Naked. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris has several things going for him. For starters, his life has been filled with unique adventures that make great launching pads for his essays on the American experience. He also brings a -- oh, forget it. It's very, very, very, funny stuff, and he can turn a phrase like nobody's business. Buy it. If you have a sense of humor, you'll eat it up."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Wildly amusing, sarcastic to a fault, Sedaris allows us to wander around inside the head of the oddest one the bunch. Not for the faint of heart or the less than cynical."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Each little story is another slice of a life in a ugly, bitter, funny cynical world. They are seperate stories about the same guy, addressed to the reader as if you were inside his quirky little head. He only occasionaly falls into cliche. The narratives are short enough to keep one moving swiftly, eager for another taste of Sedaris's screwy mouthfuls of monologue."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Be warned: read this book and you will get laugh-lines. Deep, permanent laugh lines.The L.A. plastic surgeons generally have lower prices for a face lift than the N.Y doctors. But you really need to explore, because cosmetic surgery in L.A. is like sushi; it's everywhere. So it might be worth the cash to go to a N.Y doctor.Although, I understand that there are some great doctors in Atlanta. My point is: research your physician before undergoing surgery.Basically, expect to pay around nine grand. But again, this depends on what you have done and where.If you really don't like the idea of going under the knife, simply don't buy any book from Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"When I read a book like this one, I often wonder if anyone could write such a book, simply by accounting the oddest moments of their life, and adding a bit of exaggeration and humor. But Sedaris does more than that, he strips himself and the characters naked, showing the very best and worst in them. Autobiographical material is at its best when the author reveals his flaws and quirks, and Sedaris doesn't disappoint, branding himself a coward, hipocrite, thief, and ultimately human. More than anything, he delights in showing us the oddities that exist behind the common American facade.He has a special genius for taking events that must have been very sad and embarrassing at the time, and, by laughing at them himself, allowing us to laugh along.Not everyone is going to like every essay, and one of them fell flat for me, but I found it overall to be wonderfully twisted fun."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I am jealous of Sedaris' gift of writing--he is witty and brilliant. 'Naked' is ridiculous, sharp, and energetic. If you need a good laugh, you're in for a real treat."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris is a cult classic. Although this book is not \`Me Talk Pretty One Day' it has its own merit. Sedaris' whit and humor are refreshing and have made a huge impact on the idea of the memoir. It should not go without notice that many memoirs, including Burroughs, have been compared to Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris has lived a crazy life, and apparently, he is not afraid to share every detail of it. Naked is a collection of seventeen essays recounting Sedaris' life from his childhood to his adulthood. The book covers everything from his struggles with OCD as a child to his days of hitchhiking, to his vacation in a nudist colony. Sedaris focuses many of his essays on hardships he and his family have endured, but manages to cast a humorous light on some heavy issues. While some essays were funnier than others, Sedaris' dry wit made each story worth reading.I enjoyed the essays in the beginning of the book more than the ones at the end. The first essays were shorter and lighters, while the later essays were longer and tackled some heavier subjects. My favorite essay by far was \\"A Plague of Tics,\\" Sedaris' account of his childhood OCD. It is absolutely hilarious to hear Sedaris recount the ways he justified his habits when he was younger, using his wit to point out just how ridiculous his justifications were. His sarcasm comes through wonderfully when he wonders why it bothers others so much that he needs to lick a light switch or touch his nose to a neighbor's mailbox every day on his way home from school. Another highlight of the book is his next essay, \\"Get Your Ya-ya's Out.\\" In this essay, he describes his very Greek grandmother (on his father's side), her outrageous habits, and her relationships with various members of his family. She doesn't understand why Sedaris' mother doesn't want her to knead her bread dough on the kitchen floor or place a large wooden cross in the baby's crib. While Ya Ya loves Sedaris and his father, she is nothing but critical of his sisters and mother. However, while Sedaris bluntly describes all of his grandmother's flaws, he also develops her into an endearing character that the reader does not necessarily hold responsible for her crazy actions.While I did not enjoy the later essays as much as the first ones, that is not to say that they were not very entertaining. I believe that part of the reason I did not like them as much was because the first ones were so incredibly funny. It would be extremely difficult to make the later essays as good or better. One aspect of the later essays that I did not like was that many of them seemed very similar. Multiple essays (\\"Planet of the Apes\\", \\"C.O.G.\\", \\"The Incomplete Quad\\") recounted the strange people Sedaris met while he was hitchhiking. While each of these stories was humorous, they became somewhat repetitive.Overall, I enjoyed this book very much, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh. Even Sedaris' weaker essays are high-quality, and every essay will have the reader laughing out loud in at least one part."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read this book while on vacation in St. Maarten. It is hilarious! I love the author's witty and dry sense of humor. His is cynical but writes all the things most of us are thinking! I have bought many of this author's books and loved them all!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"You know a book is good when you are reading it at 3 am and you're laughing out loud. This is definitely the funniest book I've ever read. Looking forward to reading his others."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book marked a departure from Sedaris' previous works in that it was mostly a memoir and there was very little fiction in it. David Sedaris' adventure (and misadventures) in college, hitch hiking, plus candid moments in his family history and as an apple picker/processor is both entertaining and piognant. Many think of Sedaris as a humorist, but there a many keen observations about life in his writing. I especially liked his account of his visit to a straight nudist camp."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I agree with another reviewer. This book is one that you want to share yet you want to keep it to yourself.Being from the same area the Mr. Sedaris grew up I enjoyed this book even more so because of the landmarks that he described.You will laugh out loud when reading this book. He keeps you interested the entire time!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"\\"Naked\\" is a bizzare, yet humorous, glimpse into the life and times of David Sedaris, made even more bizzare when the fact sinks in that it's a memoir. Through his essays, Sedaris treats us to an insider's look at his warped childhood, and subsequent warped adulthood, touching upon subjects such as his golf-obsessed father, the relationship between his old-world-stalwart grandmother and his end-of-her-rope mother, and hichhiking days accompanied by a parapalegic. The essays are superbly written, perfect for reading out loud, enthralling, and endowed with a usually-hitting, self-depracating humor. Some jokes are hit or miss, but it averages out to a definitely amusing read. For anyone with a strange family, or a skewed view of the world, there's something in \\"Naked\\" to relate to."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris' Naked is a quick, enjoyable read. The honesty and incisiveness he uses to portray his family members is excellent, although the accompanying cruelness from such honesty can be off-putting. Some of his essays, such as c.o.g., about his experiences as an apple-picker and then an Oregon-shaped clock maker's assistant who declares Sedaris to be a 'child of god' are both hilarious and incisive. However, other essays, while humorous, are largely forgettable. Looking back through the book I found essays that I barely remembered even though I had read them only days before. Sure, they were funny at the time, but a lot of them lack impact. However, when Sedaris is on, he is on, and some of his stories, such as his description of his grandmother, Ya-Ya, his attempt at being a childhood detective to clear his name, and his visit to a nudist colony, are both funny and memorable. It's these kind of essays that make the book really worth reading."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Brilliantly hilarious, carefully crafted, beautifully expressive! Thumbs up for David Sedaris' Naked.From the very first pages, Sedaris launches into a very individual style which he maintains throughout the book. Recounting personal stories and memories, Sedaris takes stabs at every member of his family, and anyone else he's had the fortune (or misfortune) to come in contact with. Addressing topics many wouldn't dare with a witty note and a laughable slant.Sedaris stabs unabashedly at the American economy, issues of race, sexuality, gender, immigration, education, parenting, holidays, religion, and anything else he can possibly get his hands on. And he does it in a way that has you laughing from cover to cover. Sedaris' is a very real humor: To the point, and unrestricted.The book itself seems to have very little linear motion. Each story contained within its own moment in time, wrapped up nicely into a complete, ever humerous chapter. Once started, it's nearly impossible to put down before finishing. A great read for anyone!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Along with _Me_Talk_Pretty_One_Day_, this is the best of Sedaris's work. All the stories were great, and only one is repeated in another book (Dinah the Christmas [] also appears in Holidays on Ice).The title of the book comes from the final story, about a week spent at a nudist colony."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I have read this book several times and it never fails to make me laugh out loud. You must buy this book if you are a fan of laughing!! You'll laugh all the way to the bank!! Its True!!!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"If I could, I would give this book ten or twenty stars. In fact I would give it every star in the sky. I won't waste your time by writing a long review, because you should be reading this book instead! You will laugh until you pee your pants or die, whichever comes first. Great fun, even if the pee is a mess."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I first heard David Sedaris on WBEZ's \\"This American Life.\\" He read an exerpt from his book Naked and I was curious to read more of his novel. Naked is one of the funniest books I've ever read! The essays in the book deal with Sedaris's passage into adulthood. Although, the book loses it's luster in the middle, it does pick up near the end."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"it's the funniest book I've ever read-- LOVE THIS author"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"All of David Sedaris' work is great! If you get the chance, listen to the pieces he has read on This American Life for NPR. They are sooo funny! The thing about his writing is that the stories are so off-the-wall and told with such honesty and cleverness that you can't help but identify/sympathize with him. He's like a post-modern Dave Barry, maybe..."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris (along with his sister, Amy) is one of the funniest writers out there and NAKED is one of his best. It's a true classic that will get in the most stone-faced reader to head to the hospital for a busted gut. Also check out ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY and, if you get a chance, to see David's play THE SANTALAND DIARIES (a hysterical one-man play about working as an elf at the mall's Santa stand)."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Very quickly, this book has become one of my favorites. All at once poignant, touching and screamingly funny, David Sedaris has done a wonderful job of creating a memoir that's worth reading. Sedaris is perhaps one of the greatest American humorists living today, and his stories here are not only funny, but also touching and endearing, as well. Sedaris has won a special place in the upper echelon of my favorite writers."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is one of the two writers who has EVER made me fall on the floor with laughter! David Sedaris is pure genius - in a clearly insane way. I have never read such well-crafted hilariously laugh-out-loud books as Sedaris'. Even thinking about certain chapters months later can throw me into a fit of laughter. If you've never read a book/essay by David Sedaris - YOU ARE SORELY MISSING OUT on one of the greatest writers I have ever had the chance to read. One part of you knows that he has gone mad, but another part of you can't stop reading - it is pure entertainment!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This man is brilliantly funny. I have never enjoyed a book the way I have this one. I was flying on a plane returning home and finishing this book. I was laughing so much that I was crying and next thing you know I was reading excerpts of the book to other travelers. Buy it, read it and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The first two essays in this book are awful - skip 'em! - but after that the book made me laugh out loud several times. Sedaris' personality - jagged around the edges, unabashedly self-centered, and intellectually snobby yet winning in its intelligence - pervades the collection.Some of the highlights: In \\"The Incomplete Quad,\\" Sedaris recalls how he thought his first college, a state school in North Carolina, was a government experiment to monitor the effects of loud Pink Floyd songs on a group of students who think they can drive to Europe. He transferred to Kent State despite the shootings; \\"at least they weren't dying of boredom,\\" he says. At Kent State, the state would pay your tuition if you lived with a quadriplegic, so he set his quadriplegic roommate on the toilet, clipped his toenails, etc. He also forged a friendship with an \\"incomplete quad\\" named Peg, and the ending of this essay is unexpectedly poignant.In \\"C.O.G.,\\" he is also hilarious when recounting his experiences at low-level jobs: apple picking, making jade clocks and boxes, and paint stripping for a bigoted woman and a crafty African-American man.The last story in the collection, \\"Naked,\\" discusses his stint in a nudist colony: the insistence that you bring your own towels, the fact that most nudists are the last people you'd want to see naked, etc.One chilling essay is about hitchhiking and the insane people who picked him up. One of them made Sedaris wash his car so he could see what it was like to be a \\"giver.\\"One of the essays touches upon his Greek grandmother, who called Sedaris' mother \\"the girl\\" and how she ended up in a nursing home with a surly roommate all the children loved.Funny as the essays are, they have dark or serious undertones. It's as if Sedaris is adept at seeing the humorous surfaces of life, but also the depth below."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book made me laugh out loud several times. The highlight of the book is Sedaris' description of his visit to a low-rent, white-trash nudist colony. The whole book is written in a memoir style, little snapshots of his hilarious and sometimes painful life. Sedaris writes in a clever and concise style. It's not over-written, you just feel like you're a witness to his life.I disagree with other reviewers that say: \\"If you like this, order 'Barrel Fever'.\\" \\"Barrel Fever\\" is very different, more satire than memoir. If you like satire, by all means order it. If you like Sedaris' memoir style, check out \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" and \\"Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim.\\"\\"Naked\\" is a joy to read."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris writes scathingly about a wide range of outrageous characters and incidents, e.g., the nudist colony experience which is the subject of the eponymous final chapter. Coupled with being gay, that is, with the stereotypical connotations of La Cage Aux Folles-style flamboyance, the lurid title &quot;Naked&quot; might come across at first blush as embodying the book's scandalously funny contents. To me, however, the book's title seems to be referring more to the state of Sedaris's soul while writing these pieces. While I did find myself laughing giddily in many places at Sedaris's humorous observations and turns of phrase, the overall impression I had was of a brooding heart, painfully aware of life's absurdity and its own failings. Sedaris seems to have been born too conscious, in every sense.So along with appreciating the comedy, I would suggest peering through the humorous haze of absurd scenarios and make out the subtle background hues, to see the real man struggling to find himself.Read as a book of funny tales, the book gets 4 stars, because the biting humor and silliness wore a bit thin toward the middle. Read as a straightforward memoir, the book gets 4 stars, because I got the sense that even in baring himself, Sedaris is still hiding some essential self-stuff. He admits himself that he can't help being tongue-in-cheek about everything; the coating of goofy absurdity pasted on most things in the book is even a little too polished and slick. While admiring its sheen I felt I kept sliding upon it, away from the 'real' Sedaris.But maybe that's exactly the point. Read as an impressionist sketch of the author's philosophy and state of mind, it is probably all the more real for its masks and self-consciousness and diversions.In any case, whether you are by nature attracted to the grinning or frowning mask, you'll find something here for you."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I'll admit that I tucked into Mr. Sedaris' work with no small amount of anticipation. I assume many of his readers -- like myself -- first made his acquaintance by hearing him on public radio's \`This American Life.' Since he is an uncommonly witty storyteller, so it should follow he would be a fine writer, yes?Or perhaps not. Judging from \`Naked' -- his latest and highest praised work -- I have to withhold praise, or at least judgment. Unlike so many other books of poignant, self-revealing essays, \`Naked' did not have me laughing out loud (much); rather, I was often wincing, and waiting for conflicts and resolutions that seemed deliberately withheld. The author is a fine storyteller; this talent shines on radio and occasionally in these pieces. But he is an uneven writer at best. For my money his main faults are a celebration of victimhood (self-admitted, from his recent interviews) and a near complete lack of empathy for most of his subjects.Since every story here is written in first person and Sedaris freely admits they're largely based on fact, we get a very clear look at his life, his family, his feelings toward the world, and what experiences have shaped his worldview. It's not a pretty sight. In almost every account, Sedaris is being attacked, abused, set up, abandoned, or generally treated as an outcast. He almost seems to revel in this negativity, even seeks it out by telling stories of returning to effective slave labor at a nightmarish apple farm, helping a deranged Christian sell jade clocks in the shape of the state of Oregon, or visiting a nudist colony. He is rightly praised for being unsentimental; trouble is, drained of sentiment -- most of this material would make great horror stories -- we're left with little but an unappealing man being battered by the world.By his subject matter, Sedaris plainly has a sense for what **should** be funny; the setups are great. But the stories are lifeless. In each he fumbles through, telling us in lurid detail all the abuse he suffers. Of course, pratfalls and even tragedy can be wildly comic (wits from any age betray this -- John Irving and Steven Bochco are two recent purveyors), but they need more than a simple retelling. Alas, that's all we get from this storyteller.Voyeurism that might sustain the stories, just so, except there's very little to cheer for in his characters. When not showing how the world is brutalizing him, Sedaris paints a pretty bleak picture of the rest of humanity. I can recall one or two minor characters through these seventeen stories that come across neutral; the rest are thieves, psychotics, and rapists. His family is lovingly portrayed: a disinterested, mommas-boy father, a razor-tongued alcoholic mother and five hazily drawn siblings (excepting his sister Lisa) who seem in perennial competition with their brother.If tragedy and pain without empathy, poignancy, or even much comic edge are your cup of meat, I heartily recommend \`Naked.' The popular press recommends it highly, judging from their thunderous accolades; many compare Sedaris to Thurber, Parker, and even Twain. Given his self-deprecating nature, I'm sure Mr. Sedaris would be horrified at these comparisons. I know I am."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The first part of Naked I found hilarious, especially the the Sedaris mother with her frosty hair, Dinah the Chirstmas whore, and the mystery of who is using the household towels as toilet tissue. But as soon as the book went into the hitchhiking it got really creepy and never got back its offbeat humor for me, just disturbed me. I recommended tuning into the author's sister Amy on Comedy Network's &quot;Strangers With Candy Instead&quot;."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The fiendish prose of David Sedaris, once I got past the disorienting first chapter, held me hostage. Never once did I want to be part of this family, but by gosh, I kept wanting to extend my visit. By the time I reached &quot;next of kin&quot;, I had surrendered all my critical objectivity, and simply gloried in the family's reaction to the dreadfully proofread pornographic novel that gives the chapter its title. Part of the tremendous humor lies in *naked*'s truths: all children know where their parents keep the porno -- if there is any. (My mother's copy of *Fanny Hill* was hidden behind the fourth shelf above her bed).On the other hand, the faint aura of loneliness that hovers over the text keeps this book from being a quick joke. The conclusion of &quot;the incomplete quad&quot; -- the unsentimental tale of travels with a quadriplegic -- does not spare the reader. And throughout *naked*, as I laughed, I was also haunted by a son who knows his mother is lying for him (&quot;the drama bug&quot;), and whose father tells deliciously gruesome tales and wonders why his children have no gumption (&quot;Cyclops&quot;). I confess that all those tics (&quot;a plague of tics&quot;) also worried me. That may come of being a mother.Three major points: *naked* made me laugh hard. Really hard. I even sent a copy of *naked* to my nephew for his birthday. And, finally, and not least, I am delighted that at last I understand the importance of a towel at a nudist colony."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Having read three of Sedaris' books, I am beginning to think I get it. Many of the reviews of Barrel Fever, Naked, and Me Talk Pretty One Day, the sum total of my reading experience with David Sedaris, refer to sidesplitting humor. While that component exists in all of his writing, to a greater or lesser degree, I don't think that is what he has set out to create in any of these books. . .least of all Naked. Naked is funny and poignant, as many of the reviews have indicated, but more than that, when coupled with readings of his other books, and listening to his commentaries on NPR, one realizes that ultimately David Sedaris is exposing the feelings, resentments, and ultimate independent victories of a true outsider growing up in America. Some people will read the chapter on his idiosynchrasies in Naked, and find it hilarious. . .which it is. More important, it portrays a mother who figured out pretty early on that she had a very odd kid to get through what would be childhood characterized by a surrounding society not known for acceptance of the unusual.I liked this book a lot. I think that while it may lack some of the out and out screaming humor of barrel fever, and doesn't feature the hysterically funny chapter on the big turd from Me Talk Pretty. . .it offers the best insight into the soul of this obsessively autobiographical writer."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I am the type of person who is very picky when it comes to books. I can't get into a book or even finish it unless it's very good..But this is the book that got me hooked on David Sedris. I've read all of Sedaris's books, this one is by far the funniest. I remember this book being the first one I have ever read in one sitting, and actually laughed out loud to! The man is just hilarious. Plain and simple..His stories are so different, so bizzare, and just delivered with great wit. This is the kind of humor I wish was more apparent in TV and movies, not that horrible teen movie \\"look at my gentials\\" kind of garbage. Get this book!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. David Sedaris has an eye for the absurd details of real life. He's not afraid to make fun of himself or other people, turning sad situations into intensely comic ones. Some of the stories in here are better than others and some of them should have been edited better, but overall, this is book is fantastic. My favorite part is where he's picking apples and his boss, in an attempt to show off his Spanish, yells at one of the workers, &quot;Buenos Dios, Miguel!&quot; The worker jumps and the boss says, &quot;They spook easy, you know.&quot; Yes well, that's what happens when you go up behind someone and shout &quot;Good God!&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I haven't read any of David Sedaris' other books, but I recently saw him read selections from his older books and from unpublished material. Like a lot of people, I was introduced to him by his appearances on NPR. I loved his voice immediately and in reading Naked found that when I made myself hear his voice in my head while reading his prose, that this made the material a lot funnier. His timing and intonation are a significant part of his humor.I felt that his book started off a little slowly. Perhaps I didn't figure out the trick of hearing his voice until about a third of the way into the book. In any case, midway through I found that I couldn't put the book down. I suppose that I had entered his world by then. His world is that of a nouveau riche suburban family from upstate New York transplanted to Raleigh, North Carolina. He grew up without material want, but not completely spoiled, as his father forced his kids to go out and work at menial jobs. The story \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" is his crassly honest telling of rescuing a co-worker of his sister Lisa's from an abusive incident and bringing her home to their suburban ranch house. By the time you get to this story you have gotten to know his mother and it is completely believeable that her first reaction to Dinah's appearance is to start mixing the drinks. Sedaris ends the story by telling us how cool it felt to be the only one on his block entertaining a whore that evening....The story of his hitch hike from Ohio to North Carolina with his parapelegic friend at first relates how Sedaris and his friend lied to and took advantage of all of their rides. While he is telling the tale he calls these people 'stupid', but by the end of the story when he is looking back on the trip after receiving a letter from his now born-again friend he confesses that she had already figured out that all those people were simply kind and generous, but that it would take him years to understand that.Sedaris is now in his early 40s. All of these stories are set in his childhood through his mid 20s. He is confessing that he was a snotty, confused, erratic young person. A lot of us were, but choose to remember it less honestly. And hardly any of us are as funny as David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"My worst regret about reading this book is the guilt I feel for not having written down every person I have ever encountered, detail by detail.Because that is exactly what David Sedaris does in Naked, a collection of short stories that exposes the underbelly of his childhood, youth and college years with a lot of family in between. The title of the book is an apt description of the workings of each story; while some details are salty and shocking, Sedaris' honest voice remains soothing and comic. The reader explores Sedaris' struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder, his mother's biting wit and his father's paranoia.Sedaris should consider himself lucky as a writer to have the ethnic backdrop of his life. The anecdotes are endless, as Sedaris recounts his misery at a summer camp in Greece and his strange Greek grandmother with a suicidal goldfish and a penchant for steamed greens and ironed dollar bills. Sedaris also chronicles his family's adventures at the neighborhood Greek Orthodox Church.Sedaris also brings to light his homosexuality through various short stories about his childhood. He recalls having feelings for a bunkmate at summer camp in Greece, aptly titled, \\"I like guys.\\" He hilariously describes his teachers' open racism and homophobia, and the confusion he felt during high school as his classmates excelled at sports and courted girlfriends.Sedaris' parents are truly the highlight of the book. His mother, an alcoholic, chain-smoking woman with little patience and a lot of sass adds priceless dialogue and humor. Sedaris' father, a paranoid, Greek golfer who cannot seem to connect to his children also adds depth to the long list of characters.Sedaris is a master of words, and the language of the book is rich in wit and description. Sedaris describes to perfection what few can only hope to explain, and he does it for everyday people. When describing the racist comments of his Spanish teacher, Sedaris says, \\"She paused, positioning herself on the edge of the desk as though she were posing for a portrait the federal government might use on a stamp commemorating gallantry\\" (82).Some of Sedaris' stories are edgy, such as \\"Next of kin,\\" in which Sedaris tells about when he found a book of literary pornography in the woods. His sisters end up reading it, and by the end of the story the whole family has read it and Sedaris has recounted an extremely odd part of humanity.I am jealous of Sedaris because he remembers. He remembers details, movements, smells about people that just pass most of us by without a thought. And he creates a story, his story. Through his pain he laughs, and his book is a near perfect tribute to family and growing up."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I don't like short stories or essays, and therefore I avoided all of David Sedaris's books. What a mistake. One day, with nothing to read, I bought one of his books and I am so so glad I did. I am loving his writing. I finished Me Talk Pretty One Day and am now reading Naked. I laugh out so much I cry. My husband says he has never seen me laugh so hard or enjoy a book so much. If you are stressed out at work or at home or with life in general, pick up one of his works. What a great discovery. He is both an excellent writer technically, and a very funny guy. A gem. If you like Augustin Burroughs, you will like David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris' essays in this collection all read like dark comedies. They're perfect; brilliant. I savor each one, trying my best to read them slowly. Read his stuff! Read it now and put more money in this man's pocket! He deserves it."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Wow there is some harsh criticism here for this book. I think these people are analyzing it too much. I don't think that Sedaris set out to write the great American novel here. It's just some funny stories from his life. Who knows if they are exaggerated; but does that matter? I heard Sedaris read from Naked on NPR's &quot;This American Life&quot;. He read the essay about spying on his mom. Very funny stuff! Yes, some chapters are better than others, but that's to be expected. If you want a great funny read that includes some eccentric characters and crazy situations, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I love David Sedaris. His observations on the human race are stingingly accurate, and on top of that, funny. If you haven't yet experienced his autobiographical essays, this is as good a place to start as any. Buy the book and read it; you'll be glad that you did."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I know it sounds cliche but it is true. You cannot read this book without laughing hysterically. Don't try and read this book while your spouse is trying to sleep next to you. Sedaris' essays are funny and thought-provoking as he takes you through his early life.If you liked Running With Scissors, this book will appeal to you. And in the essay format you can read snipets and still enjoy without feeling the need to get it all read one blast."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I just purchased the audio version of Naked, and while I'm not finished with it (I've been listening to it on my commutes to work) I wonder to myself, &quot;What took me so long?&quot; Friends and co-workers have been telling me about Sedaris for 4 years. I listen to This American Life on NPR from time to time, but always miss any Sedaris readings. I can find little time to read anymore, and finally, FINALLY, I decided to purchase the audio version.And now I am bitter because I have denied myself for the last 4 years! The stories are priceless, particularly when they involve David's mother. Her sharp wit is the highlight of the book. I know that David loses her to illness in this book, and I miss her already! What a wonderful tribute! If only we were all able to so skillfully preserve the essence of someone we love!If you want to laugh out loud, to the point where you have tears in your eyes, listen to Naked! Not only will it endlessly amuse you with the most intimate details of life in the Sedaris household, it will bring you a greater appreciation of your own family's little quirks!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris's witty and relentless observations make for an entertaining book that will keep readers laughing. I found the bathroom humor tiresome at times, but that pervades even some of the best books and movies today. Still, Sedaris stands above most writers of humor with his honesty and his keen, cruel sense of observation, especially in scenes like his excursion into nudism."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Now that Woody Allen has more or less quit writing comedy for print, I wonder if David Sedaris isn't the finest writer of pure comedy that we have today. He is certainly the most widely read. I read most of this on the El commuting into downtown Chicago, and I was amazed while reading it how many other people were reading it as well, as well as Sedaris's other books.On one level, Sedaris employs an exceedingly simple formula: he take events and people in his own life, and in makes us laugh at the people he has known, but even more at himself. I can imagine that Sedaris did indeed suffer from an obsessive-compulsive disorder, but I very much doubt that it was as extreme as it portrays it to be in &quot;A Plague of Tics.&quot; But that imaginative exaggeration is what makes him an artist instead of a mere autobiographer. He also succeeds because he writes with enormous wit. I like the fact that he is hard to anticipate. Where a story starts off is not where it will end up. You imagine you know what a particular story is about, only to find it galloping off in another direction.I went on from this one to read (well, listen--my friend lent me a CD copy of it) ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY. I actually prefer the stories in NAKED, which are set in Sedaris's childhood and youth, to the more recent book, which mainly features stories from his adulthood and residence in France. But I can strongly recommend both."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book is so funny, the first four chapters are just priceless. The last book I read where I laughed out loud, was &quot;Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot&quot;. And that was years ago. I never thought I'd laugh so hard again, and now this book comes along. What a treasure. This book would be best for someone open minded, with a great sense of humor and positive outlook on life. There are definitely a few people I know who I would never recommend this book to. Which says something about them."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Mean-spirited and depressing. Didn't find the book funny and felt ill when reading it."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Worst book I've ever read. Sedaris happily describes a sad and pathetic life as if it is either enviable or humorous - and it is neither!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Boston below. I was very enthused about reading this book when I purchased it; it looked great. I took it on a flight from Chicago to Tokyo. It didn't last past Minnesota. In fact, I considered leaving it on the plane. The incidents were not amusing nor interesting. It was a big disappointment."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Initially, I expected more from a book with the quote &quot;Sidesplitting&quot; prominently displayed on the back cover. After the initial few pages, I found myself wondering why I had spent good money to read about Sedaris' youthful obsessive-compulsive behavior ,and set the book aside.I picked it back up a few days later, and tried again. Apparently, that first exposure served as an innoculation of some sort, because I was able to finish the book and enjoyed much of it. However, I found only one true belly laugh in the whole thing and precious few grins.Instead, I found some very good storytelling, and was at times reminded of the writings of another NPR staple, Garrison Keillor, whose &quot;Lake Woebegone&quot; people (the town itself may be fictional, but the events seem to come from Keillor's personal memory) are also more or less disfunctional, but described with a similar combination of disdain and affection.So, _Naked_ didn't live up to the cover blurbs, but I still found it an interesting read. I haven't finished _Me Talk Pretty Some Day_, however. Perhaps the innoculation has worn off."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I bought this book based upon the reviews I read on Amazon, and was greatly disappointed upon reading it. I expected a side-splitting reading experience, but instead was 'treated' to the life experiences of a drifting whiner. The funniest part of the book was the beginning 'fantasy' sequence. Once he got out of that mode, it was all downhill. If you're a responsible adult that doesn't find humor in the young and un-(or under)employed, don't buy this book for laughs."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I just plain didn't like this book. I thought that both the humor and the writing style were very weak. I read the first two chapters, skimmed through the rest, then pitched it in the trashcan. If there was a rating lower than one star I would have selected it."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"One reviewer rated this as \`side splitting'. I totally disagree. Don't get me wrong ... I, too, am a fan of David Sedaris, but not of this particular piece of work. In fact, I'm now feeling pissed at myself for spending $11.95 for this boring story; especially since I'm unemployed. Even without any outside distractions, I could not stayed focused on Naked. Take my advice and save your hard earned money."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is one of the funniest writers alive. But this book was just plain dull.

Sedaris is talented--but I got the idea this book had been shunted through the process, brought out too early in its life. Too many missteps, in the end. The final story, for example, the one about the nudist colony, cannot keep its tenses straight, and ends up shifting in awkward and strange ways from the present to the past tense. A better editor?

What emerges from these softly-woven narratives is an endearing and hilarious portrait of a smart-ass coming of age. Whether he's describing the handicapped, nudists, gays, or religious extremists, Sedaris exposes in paragraphs the irony and hypocrisy that others would need volumes to describe.

If I had the opportunity, I'd do a little snooping around and find out where the nudist park is that Sedaris visits, then go just for the sheer pleasure of following in his bare footsteps. I can hardly wait to breeze through the other chapters to see what else he's been up to since his days as an elf during one Christmas at Macy's.

If the book were any longer, my wife would have thrown me out of bed due to the excessive shaking resulting from held-in laughter. In \\"Naked\\", Mr. Sedaris' youth in North Carolina is explored through the tongue-in-cheek examination mode that he first displayed in \\"Barrel Fever\\". His style would not be termed Southern charm, unless you are talking about Terry Southern. Mr. Sedaris is Woody Allen with a definite attitude. His survival in a Greek patriarchal home watched over by a Greek grandmother, resembling Circe, is detailed from a cockeyed angle. Most of the short stories are cooly observed by his wise-cracking mother, a woman you would want to date, if she wasn't your mom. Details of the stories are better left unsaid. This is a book not to be read in public. You will be stared at as you laugh uncontrollably; the last such book that caused a public spectacle for me was Kennedy Toole's \\"A Confederacy of Dunces\\""},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Hmmm...Yes!Sedaris' first book &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; left me aching for more of his self-deprecating sense of humor. Aching for over a year, in fact. His new book, although a bit more serious in tone, still is jam packed with the humor so twisted that we are sometimes afraid to laugh and enjoy it. Sedaris is a master at developing characters psychological foibles( In Naked we are led to believe they are his foibles) in such a way that even the characters don't reallize that they are slightly demented. &quot; A Plague of Tics&quot; is the best and most memorable of the seventeen stories partly because we can identify with the small boy's compulsive behaviour, which he deems totally acceptable and has even driven his complacent mother to do the same. Most every person can find an awkward moment looking back through their childhood years and Sedaris seems to find the most painful ones and make themplainly and unabashedly comical."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Wanting and expecting to enjoy \\"Naked\\" may have been an explanation as to why I did not enjoy this book. My naivet&eacute;.\\"Naked\\" reads like P.J. O'Rourke's adaptation of Brett Easton Ellis' \\"American Psycho\\". While O'Rourke is intelligent and insightful with his biting sarcasm and wit, Sedaris was simply dark and at times, cruel and mean, without the insight. His first chapter, \\"Chipped beef,\\" showed some promise. But by the second, \\"A plague of tics,\\" about a young boy with obsessive-compulsive disorder of a serious magnitude, I was nervously squirming, hoping that these were but rough spots. But then he moved to dumping on his grandmother, Ya-Ya (\\"Get your Ya-Ya's out\\"), and it became much more difficult to continue. Poor grandmothers. As if age alone was not cruel. Why have an ungrateful grandson to add to the trouble? His fourth chapter, \\"Next of kin\\" did not revive my hopes for some humor. Perhaps it was funny but it was more perverted than humorous. His next chapter, \\"Cyclops,\\" opens with, \\"When he was young my father shot out his best friend's eye with a BB gun.\\" Pretty grim. Within a page, it becomes internecine, as \\"my sister Tiffany stabbed me in the eye with a freshly sharpened pencil.\\" Then the father gives the story an even more perverted twist. The next chapter, \\"The Women's Open\\" was an improvement.For better, funny dark humor, I recommend Martin Amis, Joseph Heller or the aforementioned O'Rourke."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Okay, so everyone has mixed feelings about David Sedaris' work. True. I don't consider every essay &quot;humorous&quot;. They can be alarming, even distressing. His stories contain characters that don't act in a manner you would think. And that's the humor. Portraits of his mother as a sarcastic one-liner comedienne (see &quot;A Plague of Tics&quot;, &quot;Dinah, the Christmas Whore&quot;) are very funny.Painting a strange canvass of bizarre &quot;americana&quot; throughout, I do find that I tend to like essays I have heard him read through NPR's &quot;This American Life&quot;. Reading &quot;I Like Guys&quot; and &quot;Drama Bug&quot; just doesn't do the work justice. Listening to Sedaris' nervous, femmy-intellectual voice puts that humor in it that makes me just laugh out loud.I've read all the David Sedaris books --- from &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; to &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;, and I must say that &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; could possibly be the most palatable book yet for those of you who disdain &quot;Naked&quot;, or are weirded-out by &quot;Barrel Fever.&quot;And, as a current employee of Macy's (albeit the western division), I find that &quot;The SantaLand Diaries&quot; (from either &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; or &quot;Holidays on Ice&quot;) is by far the most humorous, either reading it or hearing him recite it.For Sedars' spoken essay, &quot;Drama Bug&quot; and other essays by similarly hilarious writers, a good compilation to try is &quot;This American Life&quot; CD, also available here at Amazon!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book is not strictly an autobiography, but rather a compilation of life stories that are not necessarily funny.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book, but I am surprised that it is marketed and reviewed as some kind of humorous gay memoir. Although some stories were very entertaining, I finished the book with a sense of sadness. It is hard to take it as a comedic book when you are basically presented with a life of a loser (at least that what it seemed to me) who does not only have OCD, but takes drugs, almost gets raped, and lacks total general direction in life.Having said that, it is a very well written book which reminded me in style Salinger's works."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The publisher touts this book with quotes of &quot;side-splitting&quot; and &quot;laughed so hard I dropped the book.&quot; This leads me to believe that the typical book reviewer suffers from some degenerative bone disorder. Or maybe I have stronger, split resistant sides and a better grip than most.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. David is an honest and funny writer. But, unlike the apparent high altitude, chain smoker who reviewed &quot;Naked,&quot; I didn't have to &quot;stop reading to catch my breath.&quot;A fun book, and also check out &quot;Barrel Fever&quot; by Sedaris - another great read."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"But man, I couldn't help it! Yes, it is horribly disturbing, but just when your breath catches and you wonder, &quot;Where is he going with this?&quot; he turns it, makes it humorous and ridiculous. Reminds me of the scene in Pulp Fiction where they hit a bump and John Travolta accidentally shoots the victim they kidnapped in the head . . . you hate to laugh but you find yourself doing it anyway. As hard as the essays were to digest at times, I appreciated him dealing with race and sexuality issues as he did; daring to say a lot of things that others never do, and making the reader deal with it. Sedaris is masterful at knowing exactly how far to stretch the line, before letting it bounce back the other direction. To those that wonder if all these stories are true, I believe they are. Anyone who REALLY pays attention to their lives, especially looking at it as a detached observer with an evil streak of humor . . . could find a novel of equal absurdity inside themselves. My life is as boring as they come and my parents were fairly normal, but they did know a seven foot hare krishna named &quot;Big Ed&quot;. David-keep writing . . . few have your gifts."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I loved this book!!! I have to admit I was drawn to the book by its cover. However, it was David Sedaris's writing that made it impossible to put it down. This histerical look into David Sedaris's funny, yet bizare childhood made me both laugh and want to call my parents and tell them I love them. The one thing that stood out through &quot;Naked&quot; was that, no matter how weird things got, his heart was always in the right place (well...for the most part). I can't wait to read Mr. Sedaris's other novels."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"True, I did laugh out loud at some of the stories, but I didn't think it was &quot;Sidesplitting&quot; as the cover said. An OK read if you want to read the details of someone growing up in a dysfunctional family and wandering around during early adult hood (didn't we all!). Challenge to the author: Tell us about your MEANINGFUL relationships..."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"My friends and I have sat reading this book aloud to each other. I have also been caught laughing out loud in public places while reading this book. Mr. Sedaris is the Bennet Serf of the '90s. He would surely see the humor in that. I know that there are 10 of us waiting for his next work."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I loved this book..and his other ones, too. I finished &quot;Naked&quot; and started all over again, with the same pleasure obtained. David Sedaris is a comic genius, and develops a sympathy for his characters and family that is phenomenol. I look forward to a long career from this author"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I bought this book to read on a quiet day alone at the beach. After 15 pages, the other beachgoers must have thought me mad, for I was sitting by myself guffawing at Sedaris' wacky characters and situations. If you don't laugh out loud at the 7-page essay &quot;Cyclops,&quot; check your pulse: you may be dead."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I just finished Naked by David Sedaris, and it is one of the funniest books I have read in a long time. I liked the autobiography stories and his clever infiltration of a nudist camp at the end. I would like to say a word of caution about the audio book version though. Due to the convienent 1-click order system, I inadvertantly ordered both the paper back and the audio book at the same time. Compared to the paperback, the audio book has half the stories missing."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Started reading this book on vacation and was the object of many sideways glances at the hotel pool as I began to laugh out loud. I thought that Sedaris was funny on NPR, but this collection of essays gave me so much enjoyment that my eyes were tearing. Fans of irreverant humor will truly enjoy this book"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"It has been years since I've picked up a book and laughed my heart out as I did with &quot;Naked&quot;. Is the humor sick at times? YES!! I especially loved the essay about the Greek Mother-In-Law (David Sedaris' grandmother) moving into the house. The sarcasm is truly side splitting. We can all relate. The honesty in this book is so refreshing -- the author states all that of which we think and are afraid to say. I literally had tears flowing from my eyes with many of the essays. If you have a cheap father who will only stay at EconoLodges, this book is too for you!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I bought this book earlier today and I'm already half way through. I was gifted a Kindle this week so I wanted to spend the day reading, preferably something funny. After one dud, my friend recommended Naked to me. So far I am enjoying it. It did take me a couple of chapters to get into the swing of things fully but the humor has me now. Quite clearly Mr Sedaris is a very good writer (even if some of the stories are clearly exaggerated, perhaps fully fabricated?). I do like his view of things, he has made me laugh numerous times. Overall - even if I am only halfway through - I would recommend this book, maybe not to everyone, but definitely most. Hope the rest is as good. I will be reporting back. If anybody has a recommendation for more humorous books, I'd love to hear them!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"After tearing through Bill Bryson's \\"Neither Here Nor There,\\" it definitely took a little more effort to adjust to Sedaris' sense of humor. He's funny, no doubt about it, but Bryson had just made things so digestable...I guess I was being a little spoiled/lazy.Sedaris offers glimpses into his childhood and adolescent years, sharing unapologetically and with great detail. This is not American nostalgia (thank god) but I suppose there is a nuclear quality about his family...in the explosive, chaotic sense. A very good read."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"OK, his stories are generally a treat, but David Sedaris reading his work can be laugh out loud funny....as well as heart breaking. Loved most of these stories...as told by him personally."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I love to try to figure out where a title comes from before the answer is presented to me. I was quite certain that Naked was about how open and vulnerable David Sedaris is in this work. That is certainly true, however I fell far short of guessing what the title was ALL about. I'll share that I had great fun discovering the reasoning for this title in it's entirety."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Wow, what a great read. I had medium expectations going in, as everyone has raved about \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" but this was the first David Sedaris book for me. I absolutely loved it and laughed out loud in several spots. It even prompted me to stop and ask my husband how people managed to remember points in their life enough to write about them. Simply a great book and now I can't wait to read everything else."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"naked was my first David Sedaris experience. A friend recommended it and I am so glad he did. Sedaris is a brilliant writer and can turn any mundane situation into a hilarious event. There is a chapter devoted to his \\"ticks\\" ... meaning his impulsive desire to lick a light switch or touch certain things. I was reading that chapter while sipping coffee at the Pancake House and I started laughing out loud! He has a lifelong fan in me."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris proves that the spazziest of kids can grow up and produce great writing. He is so smart, but it took him many years of effing up to finally figure out what he was good at. Once he figured it out, he has produced a number of very funny, very human, very wonderful books. He makes me laugh and cry and remember my own childhood. I am so glad to see a writer get recognized who isn't some snarky blogging gen x'er. This may not be his funniest book, but it is a great one."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I laughed until I cried, unfortunately I like to read late at night in bed and my husband didn't get much sleep. Warning........ fabulously talented artist at work in this book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I join in the numerous positive reviews for David Sedaris' collection of essays entitled \\"Naked.\\" And while I too found these essays funny, it is not their humor alone (or even mostly) which compels me to give this book my highest rating--its their humanity, their unflinching look into Mr. Sedaris's soul and mind. Mr. Sedaris' ability to make us laugh through the pain and tears of our human foibles is what makes this book so very special.In that regard, I would particularly recommend the story entitled \\"A Plague of Tics,\\" in which Mr. Sedaris describes his childhood of obsessively and repeatedly licking light switches, counting steps, touching telephone poles, jabbing mailboxes, and rocking back and forth, not because he wanted to but \\"because nothing was worse than the anguish of not doing them.\\" Mr. Sedaris description of his experience with this condition (and his inability to control the behavior) is so revealing in its intimacy, clarity, and pain, that it should be required reading for every psychiatrist, psychologist and special ed teacher, who pretends to know what is going on in the mind of another person. It is one of those literary touchstones that I am certain will stay with me forever.Of the 17 essays in the book, I found three or four others that contained this spark of genius. Those stories dealt with death, the author's homosexuality, and the title piece of the collection dealing with nakedness. While these four stories alone (and \\"Tics\\" in particular) more than justify a five star rating, I also found balance of the collection uniformly funny and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This was the first David Sedaris book that I ever read, and it still makes me laugh every time I read it. This one includes a lot about his childhood and family, which I think make up his best stories. This one also has a more serious side than some of his others. I really enjoyed it and I am anxious for a new book to be released! I know he is working on one, so I hope the wait isn't too much longer!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked is hands down one of my favorite books! Its a collection of memoirs told of certain parts of his life out of order. The hilarity and wit in which he recalls these experiences is uncanny. You can't help but laugh out loud!I picked it up almost by mistake, you know that saying \\"never judge a book by its cover\\"...I did just that. For some reason those white boxer shorts caught my eye, by page 14 I was in stitches. Once I finished reading that book, I immediately looked up his other works. I am a true fan.Naked has been passed down to friends then to parents of friends and all of them have enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"oh I loved this book, I read it in Chicago when I was on the train to work. Bad idea, it was so hard not too laugh, I was red in the face. Several people gave me this nod, like they knew why I was laughing.Very funny."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I've been debating: 4 or 5 stars? Had this been my first Sedaris experience, it would have been 5 without question. I read DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM first and that's very tough competition. Like it, NAKED is a collection of stories Sedaris shapes out of personal experience, exploring what at first seems to be the dysfunction of his large family when he was growing up but which by contrast with the real world he finds as an adult seems almost Rockwellian pretty.As is his tradition, he finds great humor among the pathos and the gross, and among his own challenges as a child dealing with obsessive-compulsive issues and his emerging homosexuality. His work rises above most baby boomer memoir and contemporary humor on two accounts, one of them being his command of language and structure, the other the way he and the reader usually end up learning something, and not the usual lessons from experiencing encounters with \\"otherness.\\" The monsters, the ridiculous and the downright weird who share our planet do not become more sympathetic under the Sedaris lens, but they are less opaque and thus more survivable-which is good, because they seem to be lurking everywhere.For those looking for specific stories, this collection includes, among others, Greek Camp, the Christmas whore, the author's hitchhiking career, apple picking and packing with scary rednecks in Oregon during his college years, his father's golf obsession, his immigrant grandmother, and the last which gives the book its title, the years-long week in a nudist colony."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I'm giving this book 4 stars because it wasn't as good or as funny as I expected it to be. I found a lot of parts where I was smiling but not much laughing out loud. To me, Augusten Burroughs does a better job of getting me to laugh hysterically but I suppose it all depends on the type of humor one enjoys. Next up for me is \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" so I obviously enjoyed it enough to check out his other books but at the same time I was a little disappointed (I thought I would enjoy it more). The stories about his family were the best (there should have been more!), his mom was my favorite character.All in all it was certainly worth my time but I prefer Augusten Burroughs' messed up childhood to Sedaris'."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Story telling is an art, and it seems like David Sedaris has mastered it in his book \\"Naked\\". A very amusing book that delivers the most interesting experiences in a very exciting and honest way.It is a wonderful book to read, one of those that you would enjoy on a holiday and have a hard time putting down. It is simple, entertaining, and has in it a lot of charm.I am very encouraged by David Sedaris writing, I am totally on for getting another book of his."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is my favorite Sedaris memoir. I love everything he's written practically across the board, and I know I sound like a suck-up, but it's true. He amazes me with his ability to have me screaming with laughter (no, I am not nuts) one minute and the next chapter have me choking up."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I was reading \\"True Detective\\" when I had to put the book down for a full ten minutes because I was laughing so hard. For whatever reason his poop references get me everytime. It is all the more enjoyable if you have heard him read from his works on NPR. Imagining it in his voice is part of the humor."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is a collection of seventeen autobiographical stories by David Sedaris. The book recounts his earlier life, his interactions with his family, and his time in places like a nudist camp, a factory and a few hitchiking trips.To say his accounts are simply amusing is far to weak an assertion. The situations, though usually extreme, are not utterly unrelatable to. I worked in a factory and could easily relate to his descriptions of the droning machines and the job with no end in sight. But his descriptions are so apt and clever that I could easily place myself with his paraplegic roommate or in the car when the person who picked him up stopped for a few drinks at a local bar.But my favorite parts are when he looks back at his childhood. His analysis of his parents when they delt with his nervous ticks. The way he makes his obsessive compultion to lick things seem the most natural thing in the world and the way he describes the way simply rocking in his bed almost made me want to try it out.I read Me Talk Pretty One Day before this and I was a little dissapointed that there weren't any other stories about france in here but that is probably the only thing that irked me."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris takes you on a journey through part of his life in a series of autobiographical essays - each one better than the last. If you're in the mood for a comical autobiography then this is for you!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This guy truly has a gift. What a twisted, wacky, hysterical piece of writing. If you don't laugh at one chapter, you'll crack up at the next. A quick read, an enjoyable one."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Ok. The string of raves from Amazon customers and the press alike convinced me to get, um, Naked. And I swear unto you, I am a funny guy. I like to laugh. I like humor. Really. Just plain didn't find this book funny, or even readable for that matter. Well, just found it kinda tedious, overwrought, whatever, anything but funny.So I don't get it, and it must be my own defect. What's so funny about this yawner? The same things people describe here as evoking of various rolling and emitting, well, I read the same thing and found it all boring. Controversy makes the world go round...decide for yourself I guess..."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I thought I'd enjoy this more, a little disappointing, mostly because I find him so entertaining on This American Life on NPR. This is the first Sedaris book I've read, I did enjoy most of the essays, but I got a little tired of the drug references and the \\"woe is me\\" stuff. I guess it's akin to why I never liked Al Bundy - always the loser, never a redemption. It didn't stop my from getting two more of his books, hopefully I will enjoy those more!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The seventeen short stories in this book are entertaining and make for a fun read, but they mostly revolve around the humiliation and embarassment of the author. On more than one occasion the author ends up hiding in a ditch while others are searching to beat him up. It pains me to think that these tales actually occurred.Most of these stories do not have plots nor any closure, since they're simply the retelling of past events, and as a result I was bored with many of them. My favourite, by far, was \\"Something For Everyone,\\" which had well-developed characters, revealed the author's deepest impression of himself, and (unfortunately) ended in a humiliating tragedy.In summary, this book is recommended but requires a fair amount of wincing."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"So I was driving from my grandparents' house in southern Florida back to my home in Georgia, having just learned that the tumor in my grandmother's now-mastectomized breast had metastasized to her lymph nodes. I thought I was holding up okay, until out of nowhere I started sobbing. Which, when you're going 70mph while surrounding by 18-wheelers, is both embarrassing and dangerous, what with the road blurring and contact lenses threatening to pop out.Desperately, I grabbed my old audiotapes of Naked from the floor of the passenger seat and flung them into my cassette deck (yes, I'm that loser with the factory model stereo). Within five minutes, I was laughing enough to stop crying, and for the next few hours, I was driving along just fine. I started crying again when Sedaris read about coming to grips with his mother's cancer: the phrase, \\"How do you prepare for famine when you've never known hunger?\\" summed up what I was feeling perfectly, because I wasn't just crying for my grandmother, but for my mom as well, who's getting on in years and is now considered high risk for breast cancer herself. Thankfully, \\"Naked\\" came on next, and by the time Sedaris read about his brother's fume-induced on-the-job nudity (nothing beats him imitating the Rooster), I was laughing again and made it home safely.All of Sedaris's books are freaking hysterical (Holidays on Ice a little less so, excepting \\"the Santaland Diaries\\"). Buy them all, both in print and audio; you'll never get tired of them."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"From the way I spell humour, one can tell I am not American.Sedaris transcends the bounds of race and culture, whilst being typically American. He paints a portrait of \\"la condition humaine\\" in such a funny and poignant way that leaves you spellbound and applauding. What talent! What genius! Bravo!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris is a complete freak. (Not that that's a bad thing.) The stories he tells in \\"Naked\\" are so outlandish that you'll wonder how a guy can make this stuff up. Of course, it's only partially made up. Sedaris's essays are autobiographical and the characters he describes are surely based on real people. It's all pretty funny. And if a story or two falls flat, don't worry -- the next one will probably be a winner. I enjoyed reading the book, and zipped through it in no time. My only quibbles are that the salty language is sometimes overdone (e.g., see pp. 154-5) and that the humor can get a little old. Too much Sedaris is exhausting. But \\"Naked\\" in small doses is ideal."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The seventeen essays collected here proceed in a chronological order that appears to validate their autobiographical appearances-all of which leads one to wonder if this is a memoir, a series of short fiction, or some conglomeration of the two. The truth (in as much as anyone other than Sedaris himself will ever know), is likely to reside somewhere on the more autobiographical end of the spectrum. Indeed, the title is emblematic of the entire book-both a clever nod to the last story (which paradoxically revelas the least about his mental being), as well as a clear signal that the contents are meant to display Sedaris, psychological warts and all. However, readers must be warned that the first essay is very different stylistically from almost eveything else, it's a riffing fantasy which is best skipped lest it provde too distracting.In the first part of the book, the essays tend to be bref and mostly unmemorable. Sedaris's early childhood is marked by an afflication of nervous tics (resembling in many ways the compulsions suffered by those with Tourette's syndrome), which never fully disappear until he takes up smoking in college. The second essay, \\"A Plague of Tics\\" sets the tone for the whole book, which carries throughout its frequently amusing pages, an element of whining self-pity. In this essay seems to be saying, \\"Look at me, I'm so messed up, no one understands or cares. But I can make a joke out of it and mock myself at the same time.\\" And in the third story, \\"Get Your Ya-Ya's Out,\\" the pattern is established that Sedaris will never fail to go for the one-liner or easy joke-even milking the idiosyncracies of his ancient Greek grandmother (who one suspects deserves better) for all they're worth. Granted, nothing should be sacred or off-limits to humor, and the chuckles are pretty good, but one can't help but feel a little sorry for Sedaris that the only way he can write about his grandmohter is by mocking her. Indeed, some readers are likely to find Sedaris a thourougly unpleasant character.Many of these early stories also concern his childhood and teen fantasies, which he captures quite well. \\"The Drama Bug,\\" in particular, is an excellent example of momentary teenage obsession (in this case with acting), and the disillusionment that follows close behind. A large number of the stories revolve around wierd work or life experiences he choses, including volunteering in a mental hospital, picking apples, carving jade clocks (\\"C.O.G.\\"), living with a quadraplegic (\\"Incomplete Quad\\"), hitchhiking, paint stripping (\\"Something For Everyone\\"), and vacationing at a nudist colony (\\"Naked\\"). This last essay is among the most disapointing, as it is the one expedition which he seems to have embarked upon soley to gather material for his next book and is not rooted in anything within him.Throughout the book Sedaris treads the line between mocking people and being self-deprecating because he mocks people. He's snobbish when it comes to the poor working class and devoutly religious, and seems to think that as long as he acknowledges he's snobbish, it's OK to gp ahead and make fun people. It's an odd kind of snarkiness that can be very off putting-that is, if you stop laughing long enough to recognize what he's doing. In the end, the book is a bit wearying, it's probably best consumed in small chunks. And ultimately, even though Sedaris is letting the reader peek into his head, there's a lot he's not putting out there. Probably the closest he comes to honesty is in \\"Ashes,\\" about his mother's death from cancer."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"He's no Garrison Keillor, but my mother back in Fargo, ND heard him on NPR reading his now infamous &quot;Santaland Diaries&quot; and immediately purchased this book for both herself and me noting for my benefit &quot;and he's gay&quot;. Well, at least I'm accepted, right? Anyway, my mother was right - both the fact that he's gay and the fact that this is absolutely one of the finest collections of short stories ever assembled. He has a clever observational style and darkly caustic sense of the humorous and the absurd. You may be taken aback at first, but as you read one short after another you begin to understand the forces that shaped him into the man who wrote these occasionally disturbing but frequently laugh out loud auto-biographical novellas. Trust me, you WILL laugh out loud more than a few times - be careful reading this in public!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris' memior, Naked, is easily one of the funniest books currently in print. I had purchased it about a year ago and it sat on my shelf until last week. Walking to lunch, I ran into a coworker who was laughing hysterically while noshing on a sandwhich and chips at our office deli. It turns out that she was reading Naked. I must say her laughter was infectious as she read me a passage and it was decided - Naked would be my next read.The book is a collection of essays chronicling Sedaris' upbringing with 5 other siblings and his wild and sometimes crazy parents. Sedaris covers his adolesence and early adulthood with wit, sarcasm and a few poignant moments. But mostly, it's a rip-roaring good read. Pick it up and grab a box of kleenex - you'll be laughing that hard."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"&quot;Naked&quot; is a delightful introduction to David Sedaris for those of you who enjoy &quot;real-life&quot; humor and have never read Sedaris. I had not read his books, but heard him on occasion on National Public Radio, so this really primed my palate for his histerical, &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day.&quot;&quot;Naked&quot; reels you through what it's like, or perhaps, reminds one what it's like to grow up misunderstood, confused, and desperate to belong, maybe...What makes him funny is his cadence of language and quick segues to keep you interested, laughing and flipping pages"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Reading this book in public was a bad idea. Mr. Sedaris has such a way of putting things that makes them seem almost too hysterical to be believed -- but they are indeed true. I would recommend the book highly to those looking for a read which is humorous, yet not without substance."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I really needed to read a great, bitter, funny, honest, super book like this. This is my new favorite author"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Naked is David Sedaris' bravest work yet. It's very funny but Mr. Sedaris is so open in his assessments of his family and, most especially, of himself that I wondered if I would have the guts to expose myself like that (no pun intended). I found his chapters about his quadripelegic friend and the death of his mother very moving and insightful. It's definitely my choice for my next book club's selection"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris' Naked is a work of non-fiction. It's a memoir, an autobiography of sorts, consisting of short essays that chronicle the writers experiences of his contentious, wacky, yet all too familiar family, his job and &quot;on the road&quot; experiences. Sedaris broadcasts a bright and burning spotlight on the human condition, ready or not.Sedaris finds his most moving and painfully humorous material within his home life and his relationship with his mother. She seems to appear as Sedaris' alter-ego, foil, confidant, and the source of Sedaris' sense of humor. The moving piece &quot;Ashes&quot; tells unflinchingly and without a trace sugary sentimentality of her death from cancer: &quot;I love you, I said at the end of one of our late-night phone calls. I am going to pretend I didn't hear that, she said. I heard a match strike in the background, the tinkling of ice cubes in a raised glass. And then she hung up. I had never said such a thing to my mother, and if I had to do it over again, I would probably take it back. Nobody ever spoke that way except Lisa. It was queer to say such a thing to someone unless you were trying to talk them out of money or into bed, our mother had taught that when we were no taller than pony kegs. I had known people who said such things to their parents, I love you, but it always translated to mean I'd love to get off the phone with you.&quot;Sedaris leaves no emotional stone unturned or dark territory unexplored concerning his family's eccentricities, to say the least, but this is not an attempt to be shocking or sensationalistic for it's own sake. Sedaris is bringing the secrets of his strange, neurotic, family into the light, and in these, his personal stories, we realize that he is not so different from us, his family, not unlike our own.It's in these seemly, simply funny and entertaining pieces that we see that Sedaras, for all his satire and cutting wit, deep down is a big hearted humanitarian with serious affection for this life, and through his gift of language and personal storytelling he is celebrating the best and the worst in all of us."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Clever,incisive, acerbic, poignant, touching, hilarious. All these words describe this wonderful book, yet all seem too trite. No review could properly prepare you for the sheer joy that awaits you; I did not want it to end, and immediately ran out to get BARREL FEVER. Just pick up the book and read a few pages; you will be immediately hooked. (If not, maybe this isn't your kind of humor)"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The first half of Naked is hilarious; so much so that you tell your friends that they must read the book when you're done. However, by the time you're done with the book, you'll want to provide the second half to your enemies. So, I rate the first half a &quot;10&quot; and the second half a &quot;3&quot;, giving a combined average of &quot;7&quot;. Don't be afraid to put this book down when the pace begins to falter. The author never regains his stride and, in the figurative sense, collapses a good 50 pages before the finish line. It teaches us the lesson we would never believe as adolescents: even naked won't sustain our interest forever"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"On many occasions, I had to put NAKED down, gasp for air and wipe my eyes as mascara dripped onto my shirt. One of the funniest books I have ever read. I was calling friends to read snippets of prose to them over the phone; the trouble was, I couldn't stop laughing long enough to complete the sentences. Sedaris has hit, no, SMASHED the nail on the head with his assorted musings about everyday life in end-of-the-road towns with whacked-out inhabitants. Nothing is sacred. It's delicious"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is a great book worthy of such greats such as Jack Kerouack (pardon my spelling). I couldn't put this book down. You'll be sure to laugh at many of the characters, including the author himself (if you don't at his quirky OCD habits, then something is wrong). Then, after you put the book down, you wonder if you should have been laughing at all; there's something deep in each chapter, it's the light writing that makes it a smooth read, though. A perfect combination"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris, the author of NAKED, employs a voice so natural, so believable, that the reader feels like a brother or sister in the Sedaris family, listening to David retell war stories before Thanksgiving Dinner. Several elements work wonderfully together to acheive this. First is the casual writing style. While others have expressed concern with the lack of editing, it seems apparent that a more formal style would sacrifice some of the warmth that is so vital to this book. Second is the sadness that tinges even the most giggly stories. Sedaris never fails to remind us that there is a real person narrating, and thus avoids much of the detachment prevalent in many other &quot;hot&quot; young authors. Finally, it is refreshing to read a novel with a gay protaganist where the sexuality is not a primary issue. Because the narrator's sexuality is a given, the issue is allowed to slip smoothly into the stream of the text - this novel could do more to quash negative gay stereotypes than many more strident novels. Add to this delightful mix a natural gift for self-deprecating humor, and the reader is left with a real sense of warmth and attachment for both book and author. Excellent job"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sad and funny. Great insight into OCD and American families"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris' style is somewhat self-loathing, hilariously irreverent and dry, and often a tad dark. I had gobbled up his previous collection of stories, &quot;Barrel Fever,&quot; and particularly enjoyed his section of essays attached, so when &quot;Naked&quot; appeared to offer more of the same: I was damn excited. And for good reason: this is a fantastic book. Truthfully, it struck me as very sad, though. Sedaris' autobiographical account of his obsessive-compulsive disorder is almost more upsetting than it is funny...but only almost. Each account is bouyed by Sedaris' irrepressible ability to chuckle in the face of hardship (whether it be lack of identity, psychological disorders, seriously frightening people, and bare-boned grief). I really like this man, and I really like that he shared this with us."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I was not sure if this was actually autobiographical. How could anyone's life be so macabre -- unusual -- simply difficult to believe. The author with his talent for describing his family, makes mine sound boring. My daughter heard Sedaris on NPR and had to pull her car over to get off of the road because she was laughing so much. That's when she decided to purchase Mom (Me!) a copy of the book for Xmas. I, in turn, shall send it on to my twin, a NYC dweller, who I am sure will find the book as captivating as I did. I would like to meet Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read Barrel Fever four years ago and that was one of the few books that kept me laughing out loud. Therefore my expectations of Naked were very high. In his shorter stories, especially &quot;Plague of Ticks&quot;,&quot;Cyclops&quot; and &quot;The Drama Bug&quot;, Sedaris' hilarious voice and knack for extending a joke past its initial impact through to an inevitably outrageous conclusion very much keeps to the style successfully employed in Barrel Fever.What surprised and delighted me about Naked were Sedaris' more serious and honestly introspective stories, such as &quot;I Like Guys,&quot; &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; and &quot;C.O.G.&quot; There is no denying that Sedaris' humourous, barb-tinged writing is more airtight and solid than his serious stuff, but each of these stories proved in some way that he has something to say even when restrained and overtly searching for meaning. Particularly evocative was the penultimate story &quot;Ashes,&quot; the last sentence of which expressed as much sublime tragedy as a million mock-psychology paperbacks could ever hope to communicate.Ironically, the title story, &quot;Naked,&quot; was by far the weakest, and I believe that it is because the story is too clearly an autobiographical sketch, and thus the details and experiences are too believable to be interesting. Sedaris is undoubtedly trying to show us how grotesque a snapshot of life can be without a satirical retouching, but the reason we read great humourists and absurdists is precisely for the retouching: life's grotesqueness has become too commonplace. We need writers like Sedaris to remind us of the implications."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book, but since I've read it, no other book I've read has even come close in comparison. Sedaris is naturally funny and does not have to work at drawing laughs from his readers. I read this while riding the commuter rail and subway and found myself shrieking in laughter! Do yourself a favor, and go right out to purchase this and his other books... I just purchased his others and plan to purchase &quot;Naked&quot; on cassette tape because others have told me that they've run their cars off the road while listening to this when they were driving!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read this book on a flight from LA to the East Coast. The woman seated next to me asked to be reassigned another seat. Several others wrote down the title of the book that made me laugh until I was close to using the airsickness bag."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Loved, Loved Loved this book...I am like a missionary with it, I've purchased 4 copies so far and am handing them out sharing the 'good word'. What was wonderful about it was that everyone on earth has experienced these insecurities, family members with a resume of antics, and the other various coming of age experiences Sedaris shares with us. I am just not sure we'd confess them in such a &quot;naked&quot; way that Sedaris does. We laugh and cry and spit out our food (don't eat while reading this book!) as he shares it with us. I am looking for him on NPR all the time now. Thanks David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read this book after a friend finished it and he was laughing at loud the whole time. I laughed out loud a few times in the beginning, but afterward to wasn't nearly as funny. In fact, I found some of the stories a bit sad and tragic even. Written as sort of a memoir of the author, the author relates various incidences in his life. The stories don't really follow a clear time frame and jump between different time periods in the author's life, although generally from childhood to present. You don't learn much about the what makes the author tick, other than the fact that he seems to want the recognition from the world that he feels he fails to receive. As far a Gay Studies, other than the fact that the author is gay, very little is related and being gay seems to play a minor role in most of his vignettes. You do learn quite a bit about some of the seemingly psychotic characters he meets, but after a while, these people all begin to seem alike. Overall, an enjoyable and quick read, but nothing truly fantastic."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"i just now finished the last chapter of Naked. and i simply had to spout to the world my new love of David Sedaris. this was the only book that had me laughing out loud whenever i picked it up. on the subway, at work, alone at my house....i couldnt stop laughing. i identified so much with mr. sedaris' image of his own family. and i saw myself in him so often. and it made me laugh at myself and see the humor in otherwise horrid situations. the story &quot;ashes&quot; in which mr. sedaris talks about his mothers teminal illness almost brought me to tears and as soon as i launched into the next story i was laughing out loud alone in public again. read this book. perfect for any cynic."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris' control of prose is dumbfounding. &quot;Naked&quot; is a collection of essays and stories based upon Sedaris' childhood and life, which are at times, not wholly believable. He embellishes just enough to turn the saddest stories of a dysfunctional family into a farcical and enjoyable romp of satire. Sedaris is upfront and honest with his readers, at times saying the things we wish we all had the courage to say. He celebrates both the good and the bad of everyone, making us realize that in some way, all of life is enjoyable; but sometimes you have to be callous to find the humor."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The only thing I can say to express how much I love this book is: Buy two. Mine has been passed around to at least seven of my friends. It is so funny, clever and at times, tender that you'll want everyone you care about to experience it as well. Buy this book -- No, buy two."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book made me laugh out loud in public places when I was commuting to work. Sedaris has a way of writing that makes you feel as if you were going through the experience with him. I have never laughed so hard when reading a book as I did with this one!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris has got to be one of the funniest writers on the scene. I have tapped my head for awhile as to why that is and it came to me: he focus on relatable subjects that are not funny and makes light of them. He allows us as readers, to see his vulnerablity and make fun of it with him. Good stuff, if you like the book I recommend the audio tape, he reads it himself so his humor and sarcasm are very sharp."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"It's true that I read this book in the garden of the San Domenico Palace Hotel on some beautiful March days in Taormina, Sicily. And its true that the Ionian Sea was glistening and the snow on the peak of Mt. Etna was stunningly beautiful. And I did have quite a lot of watered down Sicilian wine on those days...ok, it was a perfect setting. But I have to admit I could have enjoyed this book tremendously back home in Worcester, MA....Sedaris is so witty and weird, so original and so perceptive. This is the work of a rare mind. Laugh out loud at some sections, smile broadly at others, but each chapter is a work of wonder--often strange, always brilliant, a book to be cherished anywhere, and reread often."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"As always, Sedaris is crass, but hysterical. And ya gotta like that kind of stuff to enjoy this book. His take on life absolutely cracks me up. (&quot;Weird Kids&quot; is great!)And for the reviewer from Smallville looking for good, humor books... I suggest you read NO ONE'S EVEN BLEEDING and DELANO."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is the second of Sedaris' books I've read and it did not at all disapppoint. I had difficulty putting this book down and read the essays in record time.Most of the essays will make you laugh out loud, there are parts in each which are tender and even melancholy. Only Sedaris, could put humor into hitchhiking with his handicapped roommate or bring out a humorous side in the wake of his mother's impending death.A unique perspective to social satire."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is the second book I've read by David Sedaris, the first being Me Write Pretty One Day. Both are extremely funny. He's a bit off-the-wall, but that is his charm. Sedaris basically says outloud one's normally silent observations about everything he sees. There is no mercy here. Which brings to mind in one epidode, his graphic thoughts on his fellow nudist campers. Aside from the wacky and entertaining adventures, the writing itself is very good. Very well edited. I look forward to reading his next book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"If you are not chuckling &amp; laughing so hard that tears are falling down your face, you can't be reading this book. Each chapter is a separate, funny short story. &quot;Naked&quot; is funnier than the next book, &quot;Me talk pretty one day&quot;, perhaps because the stories take place in the U.S. (the other revolves around his experiences in France). You will never forget his story of the nudist camp, the Christmas elf, or his mother talking with his grade school teacher about his odd every day behavior. A very charming &amp; offbeat book. You'll want to pass it on."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I read this when it first came out, finding it in my college bookstore. Usually I don't find myself reading something nonstop but I read this until my eyelids felt heavy and then kept on till the end. It was so funny I had to read it a second time as well. It was great reading a book that wasn't required..."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I grew to know and appreciate David Sedaris thanks to his &quot;This American Life&quot; appearances on National Public Radio. While nothing can match actually hearnig Mr. Sedaris reading his essays aloud, this book comes mighty close.I won't bore you any more adjectives (my title was enough), but suffice to say, the book is well worth the money and time. I highly recommend &quot;Naked.&quot;And to everyone who has read the book, a jolly Christmas Ho, ho ho!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I absolutly loved this book as well as his others. If you love to laugh and sit back and make fun of the world around you then this is the book for you. It was very funny and really hit home as I have been to many of the places he described in North Carolina. I saw him speak and decided that his books might be a good investment and I was right!! Thumbs up all the way."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"... but I liked what I got. This is the first Sedaris book I've read, and now I plan to try a few more. It was funny in a twisted way and touching at the same time. It gives some actual &quot;laugh out loud&quot; moments, but for the most part has a wry humor that I suspect many people won't enjoy (which is not a bad thing)."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I finished this book on a subway. As i finished the last word of the last page, i did not pause: i turned immediately to the first page and began re-reading it. It is absolutely hysterical and brilliant. I got a 'book-hangover' from this book - the books i tried to read afterwards just didn't match up, and it was hard to get going again. His sardonic views of life and those people in his life are marvelous. READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I always like hearing Sedaris on NPR; so when some friends gave me this book for XMAS, I was glad to read it! This was a really funny book, well written, and surprisingly full of social commentary (but not so much that you get hit over the head with it....)I would say that I laughed the whole way through, however, there were a few points where I actually was angry at some of the characters in the book, and at times wished he was not as self righteous as he sometimes seemed to be. But overall, I really enjoyed the book, and read through it in a day and a half... a great read...Don't miss the nudist colony chapter... I guess Doug Adams was right... ALWAYS bring a towel..."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"What a riot this book is! Sedaris is so vivid and irrepresibly funny in his descriptions in this autobiographical tale of family craziness, youthful bizareness, and personal excentricity that one cannot help but laugh out loud.Thre hurrays for well written dark self-mockery at its best!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I'd say this book was &quot;O.K.&quot;. I didn't find it particularly funny, but the characters portrayed are rather interesting. If the tales are true, the author has certainly had some strange and sad passages in his life. Many of the paths he travels in this book are paths I've never seen, so it was interesting to read about the odd journey."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"&quot;Barrel Fever,&quot; Sedaris' first book, is original, daring, hysterically funny, and very queer. In &quot;Naked,&quot; Sedaris has succumbed to an ailment common to humorists who've written one good book. Known in some circles as &quot;Woody's Disease,&quot; the writer, having achieved some acclaim, imagines that readers should find windy diary accounts of his very ordinary personal experiences funny. Naked barely rises to amusing, much less funny. The savage queerness that gave the first book it's best lines has evaporated into vapid middle-class air. Don't be a codependent. You'd get more laughs out of a fifth reading of Barrel Fever than the first reading of this nakedly commercial offering."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"About a third of the way through David Sedaris's book, I wondered how I had not heard of this guy before. This guy was funny. No, not just funny, he was really funny. He didn't just make me laugh while reading his book, he made me cry I was laughing so hard. So why, why had I not heard of someone so side-splittingly funny? A couple chapters later, I understood why. A few more chapters after that and Naked went into a dive bomb. While there were some redeeming moments near the end, he never fully recovered and I returned the book from whence it came with a sigh, thinking of what could have been. So what went wrong? Let me tell you first what went right. The moments where David was a kid and shared stories about his experiences growing up, those were the priceless moments, those were the hilarious, tear-inducing scenes that were impossible not to enjoy. His description of his sarcastic mom, his crazy grandma, his golf-obsessed dad with mutilated friends were priceless. They were characters you could like and laugh at, at the same time. Then comes stories from Sedaris's college days and afterwards, and you begin to think, \\"You know, I don't really like this guy.\\" And it is hard to laugh with a guy that you end up not liking. This is a guy who is an unapologetic drug abuser, uses obscenities with graphic language and descriptions, takes advantage of people, looks down on others. Some of these he tempers with a measly sentence at the end of a chapter showing that he has since learned better, but you don't believe it. It doesn't feel sincere, especially in the way he has written it. There are aspects of his childhood self that linger and allow you a view of the Sedaris that you miss, but alas, they are only glimpses. It was with great effort that I finished Naked, and it was with a bitter taste in my mouth. If I could chance to read more from Sedaris's childhood, I might venture back into those waters, but until then I will avoid him and think of what might have been."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The below is a review of the abridged audiobookBased on this listeners previous experiences with David Sedaris' audiobooks (this reviewer has heard quite a few), this book is pretty much epitomizes them. It is quite biting and sarcastic in its humor as well as being quite dark. The book is well read by David and Amy Sedaris and is read in a manner that reflects this well. However, the book just lacks the humor and bite that some of Sedaris' other books, such as Holidays on Ice, had. Hence three stars."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"He has a way with words that pulls the curtain back from fantastic versions of life people seem to hold."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This product arrived on time, was delivered as described, and completely met my expectations. No surprises, just a product that is as you would expect."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"He is one of the funniest writers I have ever read. I truly love his books. Have read almost all of theml LOL all the way through."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I thought my family was insane, and they are- but Sedaris's family makes mine look boring in comparison. He is insightful, his descriptions are always very visual and funny and his cynicism has an unexpected warmth!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I love all of David Sedaris' books, and Naked is my absolute fave. Sedaris is funny and smart without \\"mugging\\" for laughs. His use of language and tempo is spot on. One of my favorite quotes of all time comes from the story, \\"Dinah the Christmas Whore,\\" when Dinah, the Christmas Whore, drunk at the Sedaris family home, lovingly refers to Sedaris and his siblings as \\"A pack of goddman angels.\\"The author is glaringly open about his insecurities, hopes, dreams, downfalls, and it is this is why we can laugh at his criticisms of those around him because he is always most critical of himself.\\"Get Your Yaya's Out,\\" about Sedaris' depressed, unassimilated (though having lived in the US for four decades at least)Greek grandmother with a tendency to gather and eat the neighbor's plants, is both hilarious and sad. I don't want give anything else away because it's a treat to explore this book on your own.I don't believe that this should be labled as a \\"gay memoir.\\" Good writing, humor, the human condition, the universal unconscious: all supercede sexual identity, race, or religion. I adore Naked and I find myself relating to Sedaris more than any other author and that is the stark truth.Audrey Spilker Hagar, author, Our Lives Have Gone to the Dogs"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Crazy, laugh out loud funny, especially if you can relate to the quirky obsessive compulsive behaviors, the mother who has her own FUNNY (nutty) way of dealing with her life, ...and this is just the first few chapters!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"As the author of a humorous novel entitled \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude,\\" I especially appreciate anyone who writes in the comedy genre. Like myself, David Sedaris has created a delightfully zany book that will tickle your funny bone. The wonderful thing about this book is that it is autobiographical and that the author has learned how to embrace the humor connected to his dysfunctional past.I especially related to him for two personal reasons: that he is gay and that he suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder. What is delightful is how he comes to a place of acceptance concerning these life challenges. The author is witty and satirical. The writing is incisive.The book ends up with a madcap romp through a nudist camp. The characters and situations that he encounters there are over-the-top. Trust me, this book will keep you laughing as you keep turning the pages. I enjoyed every minute of it.Davis Aujourd'hui, author of \\"The Misadventures of Sister Mary Olga Fortitude\\""},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I've been told this book was laugh out loud funny. The back cover says \\"sidesplitting\\". While there were a few laugh out loud moments, I thought it fell somewhat short of all the great things I'd heard. Some essays were just downright sad, like the one where his mom gets cancer. My favorite was probably \\"A Plague of Tics\\" where he develops these \\"tics\\" in elementary school. Everytime his teacher would turn her back, he'd get up and lick the light switch. Overall, it was a decent read, but definitely not as funny as I expected it to be."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"You know it's a funny book when you read it in public and laugh out loud. I guess he was raised in a hilarious family or he has a real knack for recalling experiences in such a sharp, witty way.I loved reading about his funny episodes in life and would recommend this to anyone who wants to get their mind off their own mundane lives. He'll make you get a chuckle, plus a lot of looks from people who can't help but notice the title of the book. Everyone should read Naked.The very end was the best."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I just love David Sedaris. If you are not a fan of his yet, I recommend you read this book.This collection of essays is laugh out loud funny. They are also self-deprecative of the author's whacky, eccentric and unique world. He accepts his eccentricities and appears to realize that they are what feed his creativity. He can see a whole world in his bowl of cereal.He has both Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and Tourette's Syndrome. He is gay and grew up in a home with an absolutely looney mother who was also an alcoholic. Most of the stories include his family members and his characterization is sharp, cutting and also filled with love. It must be awkward to be one of his siblings and read this book.The title of the book comes from Sedaris's visit to a nudist colony. He chooses to blend in but then worries where to look. There are regular people and people with deformities. What part of the body do you look at? What part is off limits? Then there is the matter of sitting on benches where other naked bottoms have been. Yuk!!The opening story is about an elementary school teacher who is frustrated with the author's obsessive compulsive behaviors, like licking a light switch in the classroom every day over and over again. The teacher makes a home visit to discuss her concerns. She is met by David's mother who has a glass of booze in her hand. David's mother realizes why the teacher is visiting her and she does a perfect imitation of her son's behaviors for the teacher. They then drink more booze together while David eave-drops on this whacky conversation from the stairway.I don't want to give away the themes of each of the essays but suffice it to say that they are out of the box in terms of theme and hilarity. I don't think you can find a funnier book. The book is also poignant. One can see the author as 'outsider' attempting to draw the visiting reader into his world and provide him some acceptance by enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Some of the essays are entertaining, others sincere, most funny, but several were just plain boring. A whole essay about a kid who walks around, licking lightbulbs and counting his steps? That's a premise that Sedaris could've done somthing more with. I've read other Sedaris books. He gets better with age. If you haven't read Sedaris, don't start with Naked."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book is definitely funny and entertaining. I read it quickly because it is interesting to hear about Sedaris' life and it is an easy read. However, I had heard that this book was absolutely laugh out loud funny. I disagree. I think I may be spoiled because of reading all of Augusten Burrough's books first. I know that Burroughs and Sedaris are often compared and said to have similar styles and humor. \\"Naked\\" is my first Sedaris book, so I can't say I like Burroughs better yet, although I do love him. I did enjoy \\"Naked\\" enough to want to read more books by Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris' is the only Author that makes me laugh out loud while reading. There have been author's before him that have made me laugh internally, but I've never actually had to put a book down and laugh like I did in Sedari's \\"Naked\\".From the opening chapter where Sedaris expresses his desperation to be born rich, to the later chapters where we learn of his wild eccentricities and cysnistic view of the world, Sedaris keeps us rolling on the floor.The thing that impresses me so much about Sedaris is his ability to dive deeper into normal life than others. His observant, meticulous nature shows through in the intricate humorous details he finds in seemingly normal situations. Where we might see a walk home from the bus stop, Sedaris sees an opportunity to lick lawn ornaments and open doors with only his elbows. It doesn't hurt that his family, who play a major role in the book, are almost as insanely brilliant as he is.Overall I think the book succeeds on countless levels. Using dark comedy to play off some of the more uncomfortabl (yet important) aspects of modern American society, Sedaris presents us with a hilarious yet scary understanding of the world we live in. Keep writing David, we will keep reading!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"In Naked, David Sedaris explores and makes humor out of all his semi-dysfunctional life experiences. He pokes fun at his family and describes his college years through a hauntingly funny light which at times makes the reader laugh, and yet groan audibly at his gross bordering-on-vulgar moments. Nonetheless, Sedaris finds a way to connect to his audience by highlighting the familial dysfunction that every reader can relate to. Naked is comprised of a bunch of segments of Sedaris' life and we are able to experience the love, pain, humor and anger as Sedaris recounts his life story to us. I highly recommend this book! Hard to put down, Naked will definitely have a spot on your favorite books list! :O)"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Witty, sarcastic and so unexpected, the book invites you into a world of bizarre people and events that makes you want to explore the peculiarities of your own life. Sad and hilarious, \\"Naked\\" is not only fascinating -- it's addictive."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Nothing's sacred to David Sedaris, as fans of his have come to discover and appreciate. His entire family is a sacrificial lamb to his sometimes scathing sense of humor, and anyone who crosses his path the wrong way is thrown onto the pyre just as quickly. Sedaris dissects people to the point of making them caricatures, and yet they always ring true, no matter how ridiculous. My favorite example is from the essay \\"Planet of the Apes,\\" in which a young David hitchhikes home from the movie theatre, and accepts a ride from a crass old woman who asks him to \\"just tell me where you live, Pinocchio, and save the baloney for lunch.\\" Regardless of whether people actually speak this way, all of us can say we've met some form of this woman, and David nails her in this description.Sedaris is good for leading his readers through his own form of literary slapstick and then hitting them with some sad truth in the end. He does this quite well in \\"The Drama Bug,\\" in an odd moment of admiration (instead of lampoon) of his mother, and \\"Get Your Ya-Ya's Out!\\" with an equally tender look at his often-satirized father.Underneath the jokes and the bearing of dirty little secrets is a genuine love in the Sedaris family, which keeps these essays from sinking into either too-dark humor or a general \\"Mommie Dearest\\"-like look back in anger. Sedaris's family may drive him crazy, but the feeling is mutual, and that levels the playing field a bit."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Sedaris writes an extremely entertaining depiction of his family and personal life, mellowing the disturbing and depressing episodes with his incredible wit and sarcasm. At the end of each essay, however, he returns from the inane charicatures he creates of family and friends with a more serious reflection of the life lessons he gained or wanted to teach us. How do you explain it to people who haven't read it without ruining the story?r3ad t3h b00k!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I thought Naked by David Sedaris was hilarious. I laughed out loud many times while reading his novel. I liked how dark his sense of humor was. His jokes are off color and almost vulgar at times, but yet I couldn't help but laugh. His characters are portrayed perfectly. I could see each one clearly as though I knew them personally. Sedaris is a master of \\"topping the joke\\"; just when you think it can't get any funnier, it does. I don't know that I had a favorite chapter, but there were certainly moments that I loved. His sarcasm comes through in his writing which can be hard to do without sounding mean. Sedaris does a great job of bringing the reader into the story. His familiarity is overwhelming making the reader feel a part of the story almost immediately. Sedaris is great at portraying a dysfunctional family, almost like anyone elses, while the quirks might be his own it is very easy to relate to the Sedaris family."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"So funny that you want to pass it along, but so dark you want to keep it a guilty pleasure, David Sedaris' \\"Naked\\" is a laugh-out-loud take on the memoir. The rawness in which Sedaris looks at his life and family borders on maliciousnes and as a reader, you'll love every joke taken at the expense of Sedaris and his family. My personal favorite chapter is \\"True Detective,\\" which is not only funny but gives you an insight into just how twisted Sedaris' childhood was. Though many of the stories are clearly exagerrated, they are one of a kind. Sedaris' point of view on life isn't shared by most, especially if you're an optimist or even a happy person in general, but that's what makes his humor so good. So good, in fact, this book must be fattening."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris doesn't disappoint. His title story about a week at a nudist retreat was hilarious."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Another set of recollections from funny-man David Sedaris: sharp observations and wit that cuts to the nerve (or funny bone).Having read three of his books now, I feel I've begun to get under the skin of his humor, to get a clearer picture of what actually happened in the events he relates, to understand the nuances as well as the facts. It's like getting to know someone and connecting the dots of what they say to find the truth.All memoir is a mine of exaggeration and personal tincture -- some of it you go with and some of it you ignore. All in all, this book makes you laugh and gives an intimate portrait of someone who may be, for at least two hundred pages, your new best friend."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I think this book is awesome. David Sedaris writes about different chapters of his life: from licking the lightswitchers when he was younger to puttung shoe lack in his hair to change his identity until he goes on vacation to a nudist colony; everything is included. He describes his life with fun and humor - a normal life like mine seems boring compared to his. But especially his way of writing and explaining things make the book so great.'Naked\\" really makes you more open for different people and different life styles. It shows you that it is important to try new things once in a while."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"The first book in ages to make me laugh out loud, even on a crowded subway."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"People will think your crazy as you laugh out loud to the book of short stories by Sedaris . I read the book on vacation at the jersey shore and I couldn't put the book down, whether I was by the pool or at the beach; I had to have it with me at all times.This book would be worth it if it only had 2 stories in it, those being C.O.G and Naked. though funny as hell, this book isn't easy on Sedaris's family or for himself for that matter. he lays all on the line in a book no one should pass up."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"You will never have so much fun laughing at people no matter how many books you read. I hate to say that I laughed at David Sedaris' past, his life, but I couldn't help it. This is the most side splitting memoir I have ever read. The most enduring image I have is when Sedaris says he used to mow the lawn in a football helmet. No one semed to understand why I laughed so hard at it, but you just can't help but laugh. But above all, you can't help but be impressed with how soothing and simple Sedaris' writing is. It's painful and redeeming, but all in all, it's excellent."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Warning, do not read this book in places where you have to be quiet. You will be laughing out loud. I don't care if you are on an airplane, in a public coffee shop, a library or at home alone. You will laugh till it hurts. This book is dirty, funny, funny, and funny. I bought it to read in the airport between flights, and I thought my bag was going to be searched for &quot;happy pills&quot; I have given about 6 of these books away, and everyone likes it! Read all of his books. He might be the funniest man alive."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Gotta love a writer who can describe the smell of grandmas. Buy this and give it to people you love."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris' Barrel Fever was my introduction to his print stylings and, although it was certainly different enough (and daring enough) to get my attention, it struck me as being oddly impersonal. The stories that had the most effect involved his exaggerated autobiographical embarrassment at the foibles of being human and too introspective for your own good.Naked reads like a jumbled life story, where years make little difference but the characters remain the same. Whether he's revealing his painful teen years or the hilarious summers hitchhiking to various parts of this country, every note rings true. Sure, Sedaris' style is still exaggerated and surreal, but that's how life feels a lot of the time, isn't it?A trip to the nudist colony, a stint on an apple orchard that doesn't live up to its glamorous expectations, some backward lessons about the handicapped, and a slew of other selections that are both blasphemous and moving at the same time. It's pure Sedaris. I still haven't seen his perfect work (and some of it, hard as I try, still strikes me as insulting), but it's a terrific read with many great moments."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Hey reader in New York! You're the one coming off as a self-important blowhard! &quot;Naked&quot; is first rate comedy, or perhaps tragi-comedy, and there is nothing you can say to sway my opinion. This is Sedaris' book, not yours, and the events that he describes in this book are from his perspective. He just tells it as he saw it, and he sees things in a very particular way. I see him as a person who can't live any other way than the way he does. So he got famous! Big deal, the poor guy worked as an Elf at the age of thirty or so. Would you do that?"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Story after story of Sedaris' life that just made me laugh out loud. I couldn't put the book down. I could not stop reading or laughing."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book sent me into such uncontrollable fits of laughter, that everyone near me on the plane became quite uncomfortable. What a great collection of stories!!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I first heard David Sedaris on public radio reading &quot;The Santaland Diaries&quot;. I nearly ran off the road laughing so hard, and then went around trying to explain to friends and family exactly how funny it is to hear a grown man imitate Billie Holiday. Everyone gave me a perplexed look and an answer that implied that I had the stupidest sense of humor around. A couple years have passed and now the very same people and grabbing me and saying, &quot;You have to read this book by David Sedaris....&quot; Well, they're right. It's hilarious. And I finally feel like I can participate in the conversations at parties."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"It's rare that I find myself laughing outloud while reading, but this particular book had me laughing from the first chapter on. A funny, poignant glimpse of an untraditional life."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"\\"I'm thinking of asking the servants to wax my change before placing it on the Chinese tank I keep on my dresser.\\" So goes the first sentence of Naked, another quality read by David Sedaris. From the moment I started reading the book, I knew I had chosen well.My favorite of David Sedaris's short stories include: A Plague of Tics, True Detective, The Incomplete Quad and Naked. The story A Plague of Tics is probably one of the funniest short stories I've ever read. Some might call reading about the Obsessive Compulsive life of a young boy cruel; however, David Sedaris puts such a comical spin on the situation, he leaves you wondering whether or not sitting in a dark room rocking back and forth might really help clear one's thoughts.Compared to Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim and Barrel Fever, two of David Sedaris's other books, this was my second favorite, with Dress Your Family coming in an easy first. Although I found Naked highly amusing, and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it (and laughing many times), it didn't have quite the same \\"kick\\" that I felt Dress Your Family did.I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good laugh and a lighter read. Reading this book is well worth it. With lines such as, \\"I spent my high-school years staring at the pine trees outside my classroom window and picturing myself on the campus of an Ivy League university, where my wealthy roommate Colgate would leave me notes reading, \`Meet me on the quad at five.' I wasn't sure what a quad was, but I knew I wanted one desperately\\", it is guaranteed to have you laughing. Naked is well worth the time spent, and when it comes down to it, David Sedaris is just plain FUNNY."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Although not everyone's cup of tea, I thought Naked was excruciatingly funny. I like this book so much that I can read it over and over again. Every story is well crafted and original, which makes some readers nervous. This book isn't your mother's book of memoirs, it's not your father's brand of humor, but that's the beauty of it--it's fresh. Instead of sobbing his way through every traumatic experience of life like many writers do, David Sedaris puts an acid spin on it and makes it funny, from his painful-to-read struggle with obsessive-compulsive disorder that he eventually cures with a cigarette addiction, to his inability to find work after college--a situation that he attempts to solve by &quot;finding things&quot; instead of working for a living and sleeping his time away until the soaps come on in the afternoon. All in all, Sedaris made me realize that the hard parts of life aren't really that bad, and someone always has it worse off than I do (like the young Sedaris who is so distraught by the growing number of children in his family that he tries desperately to get kidnapped by waiting out in front of the grocery store while his mother is inside shopping). It's the fact that these stories are based on his real life that make you want to cry while you're laughing."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is one of the funniest books I've ever read. David Sedaris has an eye for the absurd details of real life. He's not afraid to make fun of himself or other people, turning sad situations into intensely comic ones. Some of the stories in here are better than others and some of them should have been edited better, but overall, this is book is fantastic. My favorite part is where he's picking apples and his boss, in an attempt to show off his Spanish, yells at one of the workers, &quot;Buenos Dios, Miguel!&quot; The worker jumps and the boss says, &quot;They spook easy, you know.&quot; Yes well, that's what happens when you go up behind someone and shout &quot;Good God!&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"If you've ever heard David Sedaris on &quot;This American Life&quot; you know his thought provoking and funny style. The book is no exception. It's part hitch-hiking story, part growing up drama and part employment memoir. The sum of the stories add up to touching and emotional portraits of growing up in America. In short, many of us have had the same experiences.The final chapter on visiting a &quot;Nudist Camp&quot; is truly brilliant. I couldn't stop thinking about it for weeks. If you grew up in America or would like to know what it's like to have done so read this book."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Only David Sedaris can take a mundane activity and turn it inside out so intensely and simply that you can't stop laughing. This collection includes his morbid Greek grandmother who turns the family life upside down until they force her into not one, but two nursing homes where she traumatizes all around her. As a youngster, Sedaris finds an old pornographic novel with horrible typos that speaks of relentless incest. Passing it down to his sisters, they all develop a fear of their &quot;sexual prowling&quot; parents. Senior Sedaris tricks the kids into going golfing only to have sister Lisa have her first period at the fourteenth hole in front of all the Golfing big shots. Does the author stop hitch-hiking after several attempts on his life? No. This he finds exciting, made all the better when he can produce marijuana to calm any fag-hating drivers. The stories are alarmingly fresh and Sedaris' viewpoint is so violently skewed, you wonder how he lives his life at all. This is a hilarious outlook on life."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I haven't read any of David Sedaris' other books, but I recently saw him read selections from his older books and from unpublished material. Like a lot of people, I was introduced to him by his appearances on NPR. I loved his voice immediately and in reading Naked found that when I made myself hear his voice in my head while reading his prose, that this made the material a lot funnier. His timing and intonation are a significant part of his humor.I felt that his book started off a little slowly. Perhaps I didn't figure out the trick of hearing his voice until about a third of the way into the book. In any case, midway through I found that I couldn't put the book down. I suppose that I had entered his world by then. His world is that of a nouveau riche suburban family from upstate New York transplanted to Raleigh, North Carolina. He grew up without material want, but not completely spoiled, as his father forced his kids to go out and work at menial jobs. The story \\"Dinah, the Christmas Whore\\" is his crassly honest telling of rescuing a co-worker of his sister Lisa's from an abusive incident and bringing her home to their suburban ranch house. By the time you get to this story you have gotten to know his mother and it is completely believeable that her first reaction to Dinah's appearance is to start mixing the drinks. Sedaris ends the story by telling us how cool it felt to be the only one on his block entertaining a whore that evening....The story of his hitch hike from Ohio to North Carolina with his parapelegic friend at first relates how Sedaris and his friend lied to and took advantage of all of their rides. While he is telling the tale he calls these people 'stupid', but by the end of the story when he is looking back on the trip after receiving a letter from his now born-again friend he confesses that she had already figured out that all those people were simply kind and generous, but that it would take him years to understand that.Sedaris is now in his early 40s. All of these stories are set in his childhood through his mid 20s. He is confessing that he was a snotty, confused, erratic young person. A lot of us were, but choose to remember it less honestly. And hardly any of us are as funny as David Sedaris."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"One of those rare books that made me burst out laughing. Some pretty gross details, but as long as you aren't eating your dinner..."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Let me be clear; I enjoy David Sedaris and I liked his book. However, &quot;Naked&quot; could and should be about 90 pages shorter than it is. I, like many others, found myself laughing out loud at the beginning of the book. I drove my wife insane with the number of times I said, &quot;Ok, you have to hear this.&quot; But, like a comedian struggling on stage, Sedaris decided to push rather than leave well enough alone. Brilliant pieces like &quot;A Plague of Tics&quot; and &quot;Next of Kin&quot; are followed by weaker stories with forced punchlines. The crisp description and dialogue found early in the book give way to lead balloons like this one from &quot;I Like Guys&quot;:&quot;...but I hoped that the warm Mediterranean waters might melt the icicle she seemed to have mistaken for a rectal thermometer.&quot;&quot;Naked&quot; is certainly entertaining. In fact, Sedaris is likely to become a staple on high school speech circuits around the country. Beyond that, he'll need to become more consistent (a la Garrsion Keillor's &quot;Lake Wobegon Days&quot; or Woody Allen's &quot;Without Feathers&quot;) to separate himself from the huge pack of so-so humorists to the leagues of those whose names define humor."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book is just unabashingly hilariously funny, yet has a very slight, deeply veiled emotional underbelly to it as well. David Sedaris is completely and unapologetically hilarious in his observations about his childhood, adulthood and daily life. He picks up on the most arcane and asinine things and makes them hilarious. For instance, why is it that at a nudist colony, one must provide their own towels?I live in Manhattan, and I would take the subway or the bus while I was reading the book and not be able to help myself and laugh out loud. People may think that I'm crazy but this book is really just that funny. One lady that I met while waiting for the bus actually said something in the same vein to me about his humor. So if you care about what people think, don't read this book anywhere but in the privacy of your own home whilst not eating/drinking/smoking/etc."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This was one of the funniest, wackiest books I've ever picked up. At first I thought it was fiction because the life of David Sedaris seems too implausible to be real. There were times when I laughed so hard, I had to put the book down to catch my breath.I dare anyone with any sort of a sense of humor to pick this one up and NOT laugh."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book was my second adventure into Sedaris's work, my first being &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;. I enjoyed that book, but I have to say that &quot;Naked&quot; was even better. This book had me laughing out loud on such a regular basis, my boyfriend must have thought I was crazy! As with the other book, I feel that the strongest points in the book are toward the beginning, and the story slows down as you reach the end. However, this book starts off at such a fast pace, you won't mind the slowdown. This is a book that any fan of Sedaris MUST read, and everyone else should give it a try as well. Funny, eye opening, and clever...check it out."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I love David Sedaris. Ever since I heard him on NPR one morning several years ago, I was hooked. I am even considering going to him hear him read for his Me Talk Pretty One Day book tour. This book is fantastic. It is hysterical and touching. He is a genius. You must buy this or get it on audio casettes/CDs from the library. David and his sister read the stories which makes you appreciate them all the more. I have a Plague of Tics memorized, I have listened to it so much. I also bought the David Sedaris Box Set as a Christmas present to myself. All his past work and Me Talk Pretty One Day are great. Buy this - you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"After living vicariously through Sedaris while reading this book I feel pretty maxed out in the odd encounters department. This book has strong moments indeed, especially when Sedaris is concocting piercing one-liners which he, of course, is too scared to speak out loud. It sags, too, as I guess too much of all-things wacky can get a little overbearing. As to whether these events are &quot;largely true,&quot; that is to be decided. But I think what makes &quot;Naked&quot; work is that Sedaris uses such a gifted storytelling device. We all have tales to tell---it's just a matter of how we choose to tell them. I'm sure we hear off-the-wall comments and see some strange happenings every day. But the time we take to really pay attention and immerse ourselves in that world is too little to realize a story lurks within. Sedaris seems to rely on these subtle moments, which he then amplifies---and does, in the end, get some laughs."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Make a list of the 10 most boring and/or serious topics you can think of. Your list might include obsessive-compulsive disorder, golf, cancer, and bus travel. Filter the same topics through the twistedly comic mind of David Sedaris and you're laughing like a cartoon character, not just a titter here and there but full throttle guffaws and Mr. Ed-like snorts. NAKED should be sold with the same kind of bib you get with a lobster dinner, so you won't stain whatever you're wearing as you slobber with laughter, chapter after chapter. Maybe you should take a cue from the title and read it naked. Whatever you do, read it.NAKED is David Sedaris' sardonic account of his own life and times. From licking lightbulbs in Raleigh, N.C. to learning the ropes at a nudist colony somewhere in Pennsylvania, he takes us on a journey riddled with characters that make Jim Carrey look restrained. There's the Nazi-sympathizing Uta, and Curly, the lank haired manager with a penchant for kinky sex. There's Jon, the born-again jade clock maker and the whole Sedaris family whose coat of arms would probably feature a kegger and a carton of cigarettes. NAKED is part freak show, part travelogue, and part memoir with an attitude. But it's also a coming of age story, turned on its ear, but still recognizable and as universal as birth itself"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I don't get it. I just don't get it.Mr. Sedaris writes well...mostly. He also tells a hell of a good story...sometimes. He is not, however, either consistently funny, consistently insightful or particularly wise.\\"Naked\\" was the literary equivalent of cotton candy.

As an author of humour, I found the style too self-consciously witty and trying to hard to be hilarious. In short, I found it tedious and barely raised a smile, let alone a chuckle and certainly not a belly laugh through the whole production. I put this down to the cultural differences between USA and Australia. It appears that readers in the USA have to be belted over the head and told when to laugh before they can appreciate humour. I prefer something more subtle. I am sure the author is a nice person, but there you go...."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I cant wait for David's new book to come out in June!

I liked Mr Instability its the same as these books and just ordered Naked!"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"David Sedaris has a rather common gift of quiet observance. He can take these observations and pepper them with funny quips and one-liners. But he is unable to write a story worth coming back to. Once you get past the formula of making every other sentence a sarcastic oberservation, there is really nothing worth mentioning.'Naked' leaves you wondering, &quot;Why was this book written?&quot; It has its funny moments, but none of the stories themselves are funny. There are no meaningful insights, save the occasional &quot;and here's a moment that sums it all up, isn't that clever?&quot; ending. It reads like a list of experiences in one person's life.I had great hopes for this book. The first story intrigued me. After that, there were a few laughs, but nothing else.Save your money, and go out and talk to a perfect stranger over a cup of coffee.

By the middle of the book, the humor was wearing thin and I found myself actually disliking - very much - the main character. By the end of the book, I couldn't stand him, and I wasn't laughing anymore. He struck me as a weak, non-memorable whiner who would rather play the cynic as opposed to trying to make any situation he found himself in better through some initiative of his own. I had no expectations when I bought the book - didn't know what it would be like. But after having read it, I feel as if it was time out of my life wasted. You know how when you finish a good book you feel a real sense of satifaction? Well, with this one I felt only annoyed."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This book is more depressing than funny.

It wasn't just self-deprecating, it was mean-spirited.I definitely do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"can anyone tell me the name of David Sedaris' agent or editor at Little, Brown"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This is a good book: well written, entertaining, interesting, insightful, at times poignant. But it's just not funny. Various other reviewers have described this book as &quot;hilarious,&quot; &quot;side-splitting,&quot; etc. I just didn't find it to be so. Should you buy it? Sure, it's a good read. But if you want funny, read Dave Barry."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I finished NAKED by David Sadaris and have to say that I am neutral about this book. It was amusing but I had a hard time with all the 'craziness' that he has experienced. Can one person really meet that many odd people in one lifetime? I realize that as a writer and a humorist he was able to take some liberties but this was supposed to be a recounting of his life up until now. Also thru the whole book he talked past tense but the last chapter entitled 'naked' talked in the present tense which I found bothered me because it seemed kind of random although I suppose at the time maybe he was writing it right then. One more thing was the way he skipped around and didn't just follow one pattern from age to age but went to his childhood and then to an adult and then back to teenager etc. It made it kind of hard to follow at times. I would have preferred to listen to this book opposed to reading it. It might be better understood in the authors own voice."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"...not only when it comes to being naked but also when it comes to writing a book. Sedaris not only has the capability to observe closely, he moreover succeeds in portraying details in well-crafted and enjoyable prose.

And the mother is simply one of the funniest characters ever."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Because it's been over a year since I read &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot;, I'm not completely sure of this, but I think I liked &quot;Naked&quot; even more. There is a lot of laugh-out-loud stuff here, at least for me, juxtaposed with all kinds of crazy andserious things that happened to David. I think he's lucky to be alive, given several events explained in this book. If you liked &quot;Me Talk Pretty...&quot;, this is definitely another one you should read."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Few books can make me laugh outloud; and the first chapter of this book surely didn't. It took a while, but by the end I was loving every minute---or word---of it. David Sedaris is the older brother of Amy Sedaris, the star of Comedy Central's hilarious &quot;Strangers With Candy.&quot; After reading &quot;Naked&quot; you can understand the full spectrum of their humor: these are people, not unlike you or me, who have lived difficult lives, but instead of moping they just say really sarcastic things about everything. Really funny sarcastic things. And if you're a theater person, or you know theater people, just tell me that this doesn't describe you/them--and that it doesn't make you laugh outloud:&quot;The drama bug seemed to strike hardst with Jews, homosexuals, and portly girls, whose faces were caked with acne medication. These were individuals who, for one reason or another, desperately craved attention. I would later discover it was a bad idea to gather more than two of these people in an enclosed area for any length of time. The stage was not only a physical place but also a state of mind, and the word audience was defined as anyone forced to suffer your company. We young actors were a string of lightbulbs left burning twenty-four hours a day, exhausting ourselves and others with our self-proclaimed brilliance.&quot;"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Within the first 50 pages I fell in love with the short stories which give us a glimpse into Sedaris' crazy life. He turns the tragic into the hysterical. Case in point, the stories that dealt with his obessive compulsive disorder. Although most describe this book as &quot;funny,&quot; not all the stories are as entertaining as the ones based in his child hood. As a whole, the book is an account of Sedaris' life experiences, which is not a total laugh riot. Ultimately, you'll meet some unforgettable people and have a couple of laughs. I would recommend but don't expect to be rolling on the floor laughing the entire time."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"I can't express enough just how much I loved this book. Hilarious yet touching. Buy it now and make Sedaris a rich man."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Being new to David Sedaris I had no idea of his sexual orientation. But I LAUGHED. In fact, I am seldom aware of the orientation of any authors... be they old favorites or new discoveries. It is simply not an issue. All I know is I laughed... uncontrollably. That said, it was with a certain amount of delight that I came to realize Sedaris is gay. Not because this is the crux of his book but, quite the opposite, because it isn't. I was thrown into fits of laughter long before I had any idea that his perspective was, unavoidably, different from mine. Or so I thought. What is so refreshing about his book is the commonality found between people of different lifestyles... without being beaten about the head with it. Whether they be white or black, gay or straight, in possession of all faculties or handicapped, the characters in this book all share one common trait...they are flawed. And through these common flaws come the bust-out-loud, uncontrollable spasms that, hours later, inspire the same response as when they are first read. Sedaris' style is both critical and self-depricating. We are forced to laugh at him as we laugh at ourselves. We are able to see our own lives through his microscopic self-examination. And we laugh at the faults he finds within us all. This book is hilarious and warrants rereading, if only for its poignant insights and jewels of prose. It also functions well as a trap. Lend it to a friend who has difficulty &quot;understanding&quot; gays and, before they know what hit them, they will realize they are communing with the very person that, pages before, had been a complete mystery to them"},{"Title":"Naked","review":"This was my first experience with Sedaris and initially found him to write sarcastic humor extremely well. He is so witty, I tried to commit some of his one-liners to memory. I was intrigued with the first essay and really impressed with the second about his compulsive behaviors. His descriptions of his mother were fantastic! Kinda' Ya-Ya sisterhood, without all the resentment. His self-descriptions were very flat, leaving me with a feeling this is a person I wouldn't want to hang out with ---- which can't be true because he is very funny!Unfortunately, this book fizzled out for me. The hitchihiking stories have been done before. The look at middle America was funny at times, but not insightful. It got slower and slower.

That, for better or for worse, it is the duty of the artist (painter, writer, poet, etc) to portray in their art the condition of their society. More on this later.Naked. In reading Naked I found a window, a portal, that once looked through shed a little light into the world of Mr. Sedaris; his friends, his family, and his quest of understanding of both himself and the society in which he lives. Some of the stories were met with a chuckle and some of the stories were met with more of a 'hmmmm.' It was a good, quick read. One that dutifully passed the few hours in which it took to read. And, once finished, I placed it upon my bookshelf where it quickly, and expectantly faded from memory.Now, in writing this review, I am forced to think back to what I have read and come up with with something to say. But I have nothing. As there is nothing. If am forced, the best I could say is that the book is full of well-written essays on life. And it is. But there is nothing special or outstanding, nothing to learn from them, and certainly nothing to pull from to make us a better person, nothing to give us any insight into the human condition.In reading this book, I realized something. And this goes back to my first paragraph. In writing this book, (and I am to assume this other books are the same), Mr. Sedaris has perfectly reflected the society in which he lives. A dull, self-centered society in which people are more apt to look outward toward the suffering and humiliation of others instead of looking within. Naked perfectly encapsulates the current state of the American condition. A condition in which each night we gather round the television to watch the love life of a perfect stranger, and then, coffee and donuts in hand, we gather round the water cooler the next morning to discuss and second guess that stranger's decisions. Quietly telling ourselves that if we were in that same situation, we would've done things differently...Naked, like so many other semi-fictional memoirs that are being churned out these days, allows us to take our eyes and minds off of ourselves and look at, smile at, and ridicule the lives and the decision of others. And I can think of nothing more telling of current American society than that.Mr. Sedaris is neither genius, nor master essayist has, whether he had planned it or not, succeeded in reflecting the society in which he lives; shallow, self, and presumably sex-obsessed society who takes pleasure in the misfortunes of others. Overall, an admirable, if not disheartening (and marketable) feat.Two Stars."},{"Title":"Naked","review":"Somewhat funny, but not worth nearly the hype these reviews have attributed to this book. If you've read everything else, consider this book. If not, don't waste your time. I won't review the pointless prose of each chapter. It was disjointed and in many cases, it tried to be much funnier than it is. One or two of the stories in this book are worth reading, but it is nothing compared to what some of these reviews claim.When I read, I want one story that will keep me turning the page for 500 pages. This is comprised many stories that make you want to turn the page simply to see if it gets any better. It may be of some interest to light readers who want to read a story in 10-15 minutes.

Its Nature and Justification\\" (a book I strongly recommend). This second small treatise is mostly an abridgement (149 pages only) of the former, but also incorporates some objections that have been moved and new contributions.Reading Gert is a real pleasure for the mind: not just the stringent logic and systematic proceeding you expect from a moral philosopher, but also a limpid style and an always unassuming non rhetorical tone. I'm not praising this book for easiness or for a enjoyable style, the praise goes to the result, that is a totally clear and consistent exposition.In a way, Gert is not the typical moral thinker. As far as I know his work, he focused on a very limited field of enquiry: common morality, that is that \\"ethica minor\\" that deals specifically with moral action and free will.His approach is also unusual.While he claims and demonstrates that moral action can find his justification on the firm foundations of stringent logic, Gert assumes that morality is a totally human convention, not a \\"social contract\\" but an implicit language, with its rules, verbs and declinations, developed by human societies to avoid causing, minimize and relieve pain.Common morality distinguishes between what is morally prohibited/required (moral rules) and what is morally encouraged (moral ideas). To regard a kind of action as morally prohibited/required is to favor making a person liable to punishment for any serious instance of a failure to do/avoid that kind of action.Avoid causing pain is the main goal of morality: breaking the rules connected with causing pain (Do not kill - do not cause pain - do not disable - do not deprive of freedom - do not deprive of pleasure) with no valid justification, is ipso facto considered an immoral action. Then there are \\"social\\" rules (Do not deceive - keep your promises - Do not cheat - Obey the law - Do your duty) that prevent causing pain, affording dependability on the other moral agents. While for the first 5 rules the moral agent is required to follow them strictly with no praise associated, with the second we can begin to talk of virtues in following them, and vices in breaking.Virtues properly are the moral ideas (helping others), concerned with relieving pain: violation of a moral idea is not liable to punishment, but only of censure and disapproval.Gert focuses almost totally on the moral rules, analising them and also the procedures to justify their violation.Compared to his former work, this one is more coherent and simple, and arranged in a consistent and deductive way. In a way this essay could be equated to an Euclidean treatise: we have a system of absolutely general rules and in a deductive way we can easily evaluate every moral/immoral action.This is by far the best book on common morality I had the chance to read. None the less it seems to me there can be problems at least under two different aspects.The first is connected with moral ideas.While for vices we have a degree of judgment (abstension/ justification), here we have nothing but an indistinct praise. To help others is fine, but is a too general rule: is giving charities always good, also when there is no control on how money is employed? Should there be a degree of responsibility in helping others? What is best: giving food to the hungry, or helping him grow food? And what about emergencies?If we do not have a degree of responsibility in helping others, we will create only addiction, in the long term also indifference and pain will just be postponed but not avoided.Possibly I guess Gert did not develop this theme for fear to fall in an utilitarian trap... but some degree of control must be considered not just for praising but also evaluating efficacy.The second is a strange lack. I remember that in the first treatise he observed somewhere that moral action is always concerned with the here and now: it is not concerned with what happened in the past, but only with what could happen if...This is very consistent with the first five rules, but what with the \\"social rules\\"? What should we do with nasty enemies? What with immoral laws? Gert tries to deal with these arguments, but the result is that when tested in a critical environment (say the laws condemning Socrates to death, the Nazi laws, forgiving for concentration camp survivors, conscience objection and its limits) the building trembles visibly.The same limits are also implied - in a less critical manner - in the theory of the nature of morality as implicit language: one of the two steps procedure for justifying violations is \\"estimating the consequences of everyone knowing that a kind of violation is allowed\\"...If morality is a common language, we can believe that in specific environments actions considered immoral could find \\"common\\" justification: racial laws, ethnic cleansing... not to talk of the controversial abortion laws (in which a moral agent can accept, claim for conscience objection if she's a doctor or oppose, sometimes by acting likewise immorally).If you've been so patient and kind to follow me so far, there can be a chance you share some of my interests.You are truly welcome if you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"Common Morality: Deciding What to Do","review":"Common Morality: Deciding What to Do by Bernard Gert (Oxford University Press) Unlike the usual texts on ethics where students are taught to identify types of moral theory with types of moral justifications, Gert's new text rather challenges us to learn what it is to reason morally and impartially. His general rules for an ethical system are especially flexible without allowing any easy sophistry that allows us to hoodwink ourselves or others in behaving badly for supposed good reasons.In many ways Gert is the grand old man of practical ethics and this little book should make his procedures available to all who wish to act and access others actions upon a moral grid. A general account of morality with practical and accessible general rules could have revitalizing effect on public discourse and the holding our leaders and their decisions ethically accountable. However the skills suggested in this text may also help one clarify one's own values as well as assess the common good.Moral problems do not always come in the form of great social controversies. More often, the moral decisions we make are made quietly, constantly, and within the context of everyday activities and quotidian dilemmas. Indeed, these smaller decisions are based on a moral foundation that few of us ever stop to think about but which guides our every action.Here distinguished philosopher Bernard Gert presents a clear and concise introduction to what he calls \\"common morality\\"-the moral system that most thoughtful people implicitly use when making everyday, commonsense moral decisions and judgments. Common Morality is useful in that-while not resolving every disagreement on controversial issues-it is able to distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable answers to moral problems.In the first part of the book Gert lays out the fundamental features of common morality: moral rules, moral ideals, and a two-step procedure for determining when a violation of a moral rule is justified. Written in a nontechnical style, the ten general moral rules include rules on which everyone can agree, such as \\"do not kill,\\" \\"do not deceive,\\" and 'keep your promises.\\" The moral ideals include similarly uncontroversial precepts such as \\"relieve pain and \\"aid the needy.\\" In the second part of the book Gert examines the underlying concepts that justify common morality, such as the notions of rationality and impartiality.The distillation of over 40 years of scholarship, this book is the most accessible version of Gert's influential theory of morality as well as an eye-opening look at the moral foundations of our everyday actions. Throughout the discussion is clear enough for a reader with little or no philosophy background.Excerpt: A complete moral theory should not be taken to be a theory that provides a unique answer to every moral question. Rather, a complete moral theory should explain and justify the overwhelming agreement on most moral matters while at the same time explaining and justifying the limited disagreement on some of the most important moral matters. Moral theories that provide no explanation or justification for unresolvable moral disagreement are incomplete; those that claim there are no unresolvable moral disagreements are false.A complete moral theory must not only provide analyses of the three concepts that are central to any account of morality-that of morality itself, of impartiality, and of rationality-but also show how these concepts are related to each other. A complete theory must also relate morality to human nature, making it clear why any beings having the essential features of human nature such as fallibility, rationality, and vulnerability would develop a system of morality with all of the features of our common morality. Al-though common morality is a system, it does not remove the need for human judgment. It is true that common morality is systematic enough that a computer could be programmed so that, provided with the facts of the case, it always comes up with acceptable moral answers. However, another computer could be programmed differently and still always come up with acceptable answers. There is no computer program that can tell you which of the competing computer programs you should adopt.We often hear the complaint that scientific advances are out-stripping moral advances, as if we need to make new moral discoveries to deal with the new scientific discoveries and technology. We do need to understand how common morality applies to new situations, but there is no need for moral advances. Common morality, together with an understanding of the new situations created by scientific discoveries and technology, is sufficient to deal with any problem with which we are confronted. However, many people would prefer to make morality seem problematic. It is much harder to act immorally if you recognize that what you are doing is clearly immoral. Hobbes claims that if our interests were as affected by geometry as much as they are by morality, we would have no more agreement in geometry than we have in morality. The purpose of this book is to provide such a clear, coherent, and comprehensive description of morality and its justification, so that no one will be able to deceive himself or others about the moral acceptability of his actions. This will not eliminate immoral behavior, but by making it harder to defend immoral policies, it may contribute to the goal of common morality, which is the lessening of the amount of harm suffered."},{"Title":"Common Morality: Deciding What to Do","review":"Here you will find quite a different approach to the subject of a non-religious morality than that of Moral Armor, though respect for the same essentials exists--that of a direct tie to human nature (which I equate not as the psychological aggregate of what most people are inclined to do, but meaning our biological nature).While Moral Armor shows how the pattern of biological life builds into a complete description of a moral individual, then proceeds into his social relationships, artistic bias, and finally the institutional structures designed by either type of man (good versus evil), Common Morality in contrast, indicates an implicit moral language that exists via sentiment and common logic, which reflects the premises most would agree on as moral or immoral. Both emphasize a like cognitive ideal: moral self-responsibility.With a preference for logic resting close to the core of Mr. Gert's contribution, I'd declare Aristotle's Laws of Logic the place to begin from an epistemological perspective (for the layman, this is a math-style method of validation for how any topic gets itself reasoned out). While Aristotle's work lies at the base of mine, I prefer the biological angle for structuring and validating moral actions since we can picture it, we use it every day ALREADY, and as it's SO much easier to convey.In the most important topic facing mankind, it is good to see someone moving toward a clearer understanding of what constitutes rational, ethical behavior. I look forward to matching wits to help the world along, perhaps on TV talk show panels, some day soon."},{"Title":"Common Morality: Deciding What to Do","review":"In any credible profession, you will likely have to study ethics at some stage or another. When you read modern ethics, you're reading Gert's \\"Common Morality.\\" Whether this is the actual book you're reading or not doesn't matter. This is the groundwork from which most modern ethics stems.If you're reading something based on this framework, stop, put that book down, and pick this one up. So many academic texts get criticized for being over-complicated, taking essentially simple topics and turning them into epic diatribes. Another major name in ethical framework, John Stewart Mill, can definitely be accused of this (though to be fair, Mill wrote his work back when over-complication seemed necessary for scholarly work). Gert, however simply cannot be criticized in this way. This book is one of the most straight-forward, to-the-point, academic texts I have ever read. He puts his points out there clearly and makes them easy to grasp.This book lays out a simple, easy to follow method for making an ethically informed decision in any circumstance you could come across. The simple for moral analysis put forth here is simple enough to be remembered well beyond your course of study and versatile enough to be applied to even the most extraordinary of circumstances. The ethical system espoused here is independent of any legal, religious, cultural or professional system and yet easily works within the ethical confines of any of them. That is the beauty of this book. While Utilitarianism as a moral system often gets confused with something almost fascist in nature (the good of the many, despite the fact that this was not at all what Mill meant), there is no chance for such confusion here.As a grad student in Journalism at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg, I actually had the opportunity to speak with Dr. Gert in a class lecture. He was brought in as a guest speaker in the media ethics class I attended. He is as nice and helpful of an individual as his text would make him out to be. He was willing to go out of his way to explain even the tiniest details in his work and engage in healthy conversation analyzing a number of hypothetical scenarios in order to show his work in action. I would not only recommend this book for any professional study of ethics, but would also deem it necessary reading for anyone. Everyone should evaluate their moral code at some point in their lives, just to make sure they are the kind of person they claim to be. This book will give you that answer."},{"Title":"Fannie: The Talent for Success of Writer Fannie Hurst","review":"A gripping tale of a young black girl struggling with her identity - her mother trying to convince her to be herself.

Pearls Before Swine explains the detailed embedded systems of punctuation and word placement Nostradamus used, which other authors have overlooked. Using the sytems of Nostradamus, the author reveals the first part of an epic poem foretelling the same future events as are described by John in Revelations. I especially liked the author's main theme: that prophecy is written so that those who understand can do something to change this future.

Borysenko is a very nice surprise in that it is not a lot of advice about how to meditate, although this is one of her prime suggestions as a daily practice for gaining inner peace, but this 2 - CD set is her private sharing of the demons she has faced throughout her career as first a medical student/mother/poor housewife and through the years through divorce, single parenting, and balancing a demanding career as a doctor. The pain she experienced and the wisdom she gained she shares openly and especially deals with the persistent guilt of the working mother who is told by society that she can have it all, but in reality she is living a juggling act that kills relationships and individuals. She and her children succeeded through it all and have a loving adult relationship, although her marriage did not. She gives sage advice and encouragement to any woman walking this tight rope.

Thanks for the &quot;chat.&quot;In the course of writing this book Joan looks closely at some of the problems that are very particular to women: combining work with child care; working in a man's world; and the problems inherent in the majority of marriages as experienced by women. Once again, when tackling all these issues Joan has her own particular slant. I love the vision of life in the future that she weaves through her analysis of contemporary women's problems, a vision of a public sphere that will include the feminine dimension with its qualities of &quot;intuition, partnership, team-building, compassion, and the dream of a future when all people will have dignity, respect, and the means to live in peace.&quot; But in the end, what makes this book stand out like all of Joan's books are all those sparkling little gems sprinkled liberally throughout the pages of her book, the heartfelt stories of real people that always bring either a smile to your face or a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"Inner Peace for Busy Women","review":"Inner Peace for Busy Women is such an important gem for our well~being that I read it twice through to savor every tidbit.

Reading this book often served as a diffuser of stress that built up on any given day, engaging me with new insights to best handle the dance that is this life.Dr. Joan Z.

In 2001, book number ten was released: &quot;Inner Peace for Busy People.&quot; And now we are blessed with another Borysenko offering.I wondered what she could say that was new. I didn't wonder long. Borysenko had me captivated right from the start, with her discourse on &quot;Champagne Suffering&quot; (Chapter 1), something you don't hear a lot about. But here she was weighing in on both sides: how good women have it these days, AND how tough are their challenges.Chapter after chapter, Borysenko's writing is a treasure trove of insight, wisdom, and humor blessed by plenty of new twists on traditional ways of thinking. With refreshing candor, Borysenko writes with a realistic knowing of what life is like for today's woman, sharing plenty of personal stories from the trenches. Further, she provides innovative and practical strategies for handling whatever lands in your path.Borysenko analyzes issues from all sides, in simple, straightforward fashion. Translating scientific principles of mind-body medicine into heartfelt, commonsense directives for women, she always cuts through the complexities to deliver simple, thoughtful solutions. Her words penetrate to your heart, resonate with inner truth, and move you with their sheer poetry.One by one, Borysenko tackles each of life's challenges for busy women, laying the groundwork for peace no matter the circumstance and offering hope. Her words are passionate and energized. She imparts an excitement about the possibilities available for each woman in their most authentic self.This is Borysenko at her best, brightest and most witty.

It is a vast offering of intuitive guidance for the busy woman to create a balance between &quot;no longer and not yet.&quot; Joan provides a path for keeping our connection to Spirit, following our intuitive inner guidance and being gentle with ourselves even when we are not gentile. This directive keeps bringing us back to our Center/our Now, throughout our busy lives, while facing the demands of work, care-giving, family, relationships and the downsides of divorce, burnout and overload. Busyness, sometimes a form of self-denial, keeps unpleasant emotions at bay, but when we take steps, as offered, toward the stillness of Being, this emotional energy works as an emissary of inner wisdom. Through all these aspects of our very busy lives, Joan brings us to the truism &quot;The present Center is where the Self best shines.&quot;Joan provides us with the Key Element for Center/Now, &quot;When we have sovereignty over ourselves, we are free to follow the guidance from within and create a life that breaks the mold.&quot;"},{"Title":"Inner Peace for Busy Women","review":"&quot;Inner Peace for Busy Women&quot;...Just reading the title of this book makes a person want to read it! Isn't this what we are all searching for in our busy lives?As the Program Coordinator for a large retreat house, I meet many, many women who are looking for exactly that: inner peace. The number of private retreats and women's retreats that we offer here has dramatically increased over the past few years. Everyone is searching for balance, light, a sense of equilibrium -- and most are frustrated in that quest. Joan expresses, through this book, a deep understanding of the &quot;busy-ness&quot; of women's lives in the second millenium. There is a whole new set of challenges associated with being a woman in these times, and it is obvious that Joan has a great respect for, and desire to help, those who are living those challenges.As a single woman, I read the beautiful poem at the beginning of the book and wondered if the rest of the book would have anything to say to me. This book brought home to me that all women -- no matter their place in this world, their social standing, their marital status -- have to deal with finding balance in their lives. Taking care of ourselves has to be a top priority if we want to be able to &quot;nuture and bond with&quot; others in a meaningful way.As one who tends to ignore the &quot;little things,&quot; the chapters in &quot;Part IV -- Getting Real: Necessary Practicalities&quot; were a true gift. Something as simple as &quot;how much sleep do I need&quot; often escapes my attention. Joan brings these things into focus gently, yet asks us to take a good look at our lives and what our priorities are.

But, there it was! How could I resist the title? Inner Peace for Busy Women--this book HAD to be written just for me, I thought!It is not often that I find it necessary to comment on the actual physical components of a book when I sit down to review it. This time, however, I feel I must share my delightful discoveries. First of all, I am naturally drawn to \\"little books\\" as I call them. You know the type. They are slim little volumes that carry messages far deeper than their sleek size could possibly seem to hold. This is one such book. The 179 pages speak not only to me but to many women I know. Now it is my mission to introduce them to this book so that they can have the same delightful experience I had.Paying for my coffee and newfound book, I settled into a quiet little corner of the shop. The quality of the paper is exquisite. Smooth pages of a soft, subtle white color are inviting. But it was hard to ignore the striking difference from most books, even those \\"little books\\" I so enjoy. The delicate shade of green ink is a relaxing and welcoming change from the stark black print we have become accustomed to in most of our reading. I am fairly certain it is no accident that this was the chosen print color. It beckons the reader into a cool, peaceful and calm domain. While inside those pages, I felt as though I had stepped into another world where someone understood what I felt, what I feared, what I needed to hear, and what I already knew. The book and its author made me feel as though I was in the company of good friends once I opened these pages.Joan Borysenko, Ph.D., is the bestselling author of this work as well as many other publications. She is a well-known expert on stress, spirituality, and the mind-body connection. She has ten other publications to her credit and is a nationwide speaker on women's health and spirituality and integrative medicine. She also hosts a website where visitors can browse, sign up for a free newsletter, and get the latest information on seminars, speaking engagements, books etc.The moment I turned the page to the book's preface, \\"I Am Woman Telling the Truth\\", I was hooked. As I read on, I found myself thinking that in some ways, reading this book felt as good as sharing a cup of tea with a dear friend.\\"If there's one thing I know for sure, it's that a busy life is hard. In spite of our best efforts to have successful careers, raise happy families, enjoy a rich spiritual life, and make a difference in the world, many busy women carry an unspoken burden of grief inside themselves,\\"writes Borysenko.I couldn't get enough of this book. Nor could I read it fast enough. Yet, at the same time, I knew that the first read was only to whet my appetite for more. I sipped my coffee and read the volume from cover to cover, then headed home to wait for a bit of peace and quiet to REALLY read the book a second time. Its message was just too rich and too personal to be read once and put aside.\\"Women's wisdom has traditionally been passed down through story. In sharing these stories of our lives with one another, we leave road maps that detail treasures and traps, paving the way for the generation that follows.\\"Has Ms. Borysenko been to Story Circle Network? It would seem so from those powerful and true words! Her philosophy is so in sync with that of our own organization that I couldn't help but notice how closely her words mirrored our beliefs about our writings.This little volume with its five parts contains essays of three types: (1) woman-to-woman stories, (2) essays dealing with research, and (3) spiritual principles on aspects of inner life. With an invitation to join the author, readers are offered a chance to \\"discover some ways to finally find some balance, wholeness, and peace in our lives.\\"Looking for some uplifting and encouraging words about stress, guilt, or the busy-ness of life?

Spend a little time pondering \\"Mindfulness: The Lights Are On, and Somebody's Home.\\"I am fairly certain that once you begin this little treasure, you will find it difficult to put down. When you come to the end, you will feel blessed, renewed, and perhaps a bit sad that the time spent with this new good friend has drawn to a close.In her afterword titled \\"Sisters on a Journey\\", Borysenko bids her readers farewell with these words: \\"I wish that we could sit together and talk about our busy lives over a cup of tea.\\" (I KNEW IT !! I knew that was what this reading experience felt like!!) \\"...Looking deeply into each other's eyes, we'd realize that we've held the wisdom in our hands all along. What is there to search for? The answers are already ours... As women have from the beginning of time, we would recognize oursleves in our respective stories.\\" (Are we SURE Ms. Borysenko isn't part of Story Circle Network?!) \\"...Even though we haven't had the chance to sip tea together, pehaps you will do just that with a friend or a group of friends and talk about your lives...\\"This book resonated with me in a way no book has done in a long, long time.

Elgin offers some hope for understanding the roots of human knowledge by finding a difficult but satisfying middle path between impossible certainty and excessive relativism.Elgin reviews the notion of &quot;foundationalism,&quot; the traditional philosophical search for a certain foundation for human knowledge, and like most modern philosophers finds it to have failed.She then reviews the modern notion of knowledge arising from language games and the notion that it is socially constructed, and finds some redeeming value in that but also finds that we don't actually entirely work that way when we accumulate understanding of a topic, especially in science.Her middle ground is a &quot;reflective equillibrium&quot; that we seem to come to by maximimizing the collective tenability of a set of beliefs. We examine the implications of our own beliefs after ascribing some initially tenable beliefs, and we correct incorrect assumptions in an incremental process. Because of this we don't have to assume foundational beliefs that must be absolutely accurate, and we don't have to assume that beliefs are purely relative to social groups.Perhaps her most important and practical conclusion is that &quot;knowledge&quot; as we intuit the concept in terms of accumulating truths is not what we really gain from our experience as much as we gain &quot;understanding.&quot; Her most interesting sections are where she argues effectively that emotion, metaphor, and other sources of understanding traditionally often excluded as knowledge are actually essential parts of human understanding. They orient us by shifting patterns of attention and revealing what is salient in an example. This potentially makes art and literature a source of understanding by giving epistemic access just as scientific experiments do.The downside of Elgin's argument is that she doesn't tie it into science as well as I would have liked, such as showing why we find some beliefs initially tenable and not others, or how the process of reflective equillibrium can be distinguished by its neurological or psychological faculties from other kinds of process. She also offers little in the way of empirical tests to distinguish her view from others (she addresses a specific critique of her idea by Stephen Stich, but not a test for resolving it).As philosophy that is readable by the non-philosopher, this is very well done and gives me some hope that some sort of common-sense and even useful ideas do arise in academic philosophy from time to time that can have application to daily life.While in retrospect there is little that is really revolutionary here, it is very satisfying to read something about human thinking that represents us as having a potential for rationality and well-founded beliefs as well as giving a possible way for different kinds of understanding to be reconciled. This is a very sane and grounded epistemology as far as it goes, though I would have liked it to have been taken farther scientifically."},{"Title":"Considered Judgment (Princeton Paperbacks)","review":"I won't waste your time with my half-educated babbling, but this book is amazing.Elgin injects knowledge derived from emotion and the arts into philosophy, making the discipline better for it.Although we'd reflexively say that of course we gain knowledge from fiction or a new perspective enabling new knowledge after an emotional experience, she contributed to philosophy by including these sources of knowledge in her epistemology.Essentially, this book is all that I wish psychology offered me presented in a well-written, beautifully articulated form. Very interesting to the layman as well as the devotee"},{"Title":"The Size of Chesterton's Catholicism","review":"This book has enough quotes to be called GK's greatest hits. The author does a great job of giving us the big picture of a big guy and his big faith in our big (that is, universal) Church. If you're a GK reader, you'll love this book. If you're not a GK reader, read this book and you will be. This book also happens to serve as a very fine book on Catholic apologetics in its own right."},{"Title":"The Size of Chesterton's Catholicism","review":"From an essay on Chesterton which he mentions David Fagerberg's fine book, \\"The Size of Chesterton's Catholicism\\":\\"David Fagerberg and I were both Lutherans who later entered into full communion with the Catholic Church. Unlike Fagerberg, I was not conscious of Chesterton being a major influence in that decision, but perhaps he was by my side on the journey more than I realized. Certainly I look forward to good conversation with him in that inn at the end of the road, over a steak, a pint of ale, and a fine cigar.But, for the purposes of this preliminary reflection, let me leave it to Mr. Fagerberg: \\"Chesterton said saints are medicines because they are antidotes, claiming the saint restores the world to sanity by exaggerating what the world neglects. Chesterton was this author's antidote: the one who exaggerated things which had been neglected. . . . He can feel like a walking overstatement to someone who does not need the elixir, but to someone who does, he is an exact dosage. I have not written this for the purpose that it necessarily have the same effect on anyone else, only to repay my own debt by honoring a friend.\\" Chesterton is a very good friend to have in the communion of sinners made saints.David treats insightfully the ways in which those who resist entering into the trysting place of Christ and his Church often seem to be fearful of a closed and confining space. One might say they are claustrophobic. Fagerberg agrees with Chesterton, however, in suggesting that the more common phenomenon is that people resist because they are agoraphobic. They are afraid of the wide-open public spaces that freedom calls home. The Catholic Church does not so much provide a refuge and resting place as it launches one into all the worlds--spiritual, mystical, intellectual, historical--that are engaged by all the truths in the world.Faith as adventure is at the heart of Chesterton's exuberance. Chesterton surely understood that there is a wideness in God's mercy, but his characteristic accent was on the wildness in God's mercy. If you are living in the truth, you can with defiant, almost swashbuckling, confidence take on all comers.James Joyce, not the most orthodox of Catholics, said the Catholic Church is Here Comes Everybody. I don't know if Chesterton ever commented on that way of putting it, but my hunch is that he would have rather liked it. A church that is not marked by paradox, that trims history and the excesses of life and thought to fit its preferences--in short, a church that is not wild--could not be the trysting place of all the truths in the world.\\"[...]I also have some reading selections for The Everlasting Man and Orthodoxy. I've listed them after assigning them titles so it makes for a nice way to flip through a series of Chesterton's thoughts based on the two books. Hope you enjoy."},{"Title":"Mood Indigo: Decorating with Rich, Dark Colors","review":"I had been looking at design books for months now and was bored out of my mind seeing page after page of white-on-white color schemes (most of which were heralded as 'fantastically innovative' -- how innovative can they be when they're filling every single book?!) I knew that wasn't what I wanted, but I needed some ideas to spark my creativity.And then I found this book! It's big, it's beautiful, and as other reviewers have pointed out, it does an excellent job of showing different styles of rooms. (Yes, dark colors don't have to be baroque or ultra-modern! Although those are pictured here too.)"},{"Title":"Mood Indigo: Decorating with Rich, Dark Colors","review":"I passed by this book and just by accident, the word &quot;Indigo&quot; caught my eye. As I love all things purple, I just had to pick it up and flip through it. WOW. Finally, I found a book on home decorating that didn't include lots of *beige*. I absolutely love the pictures in the book, which range from some very interesting country motifs, to Victorian, to post-modern. The book's divided into sections describing the treatments of different shades; a chapter on reds and purples, blue and greens, browns and so forth. Pick your favorite color, find the chapter, and browse.I have to admit I haven't even read the text, and still feel the money I paid for this book was more than made up for in the quality of the full-color, gloss-page plates... It really goes to show that with a little inventive color selection, you can create a really outstanding, comfortable environment.Now I just have to find a house to buy and redecorate. :)"},{"Title":"Mood Indigo: Decorating with Rich, Dark Colors","review":"This is a beautiful interior design coffee table book. It is packed with large photos of exquisite interiors that use strong colors including blues, greens, reds, purples, browns, grays and blacks. The wonderful photos are printed on high-quality glossy paper making them appear even more vivid.In additional to the gorgeous pictures there is also advice on color, texture and light. Color scheme basics are covered with a discussion of tone, shade, balance and the moods each color creates. There are also suggestions for sources of inspiration for each color in nature, history and various cultures.The interiors shown are simply fantastic and filled with rich, dark colors. There are no large rooms of empty white here. I loved a relaxing bathroom with shades of plum and a cabinet decorated with multiple hues of green, blue and yellow. I also enjoyed a Japanese style bedroom with red walls, a wood chest and a huge hanging white kimono. A dark blue living room with nude outlines on the wall and an artistic cozy brown couch is another of my favorites.I really appreciated a great list of suppliers and helpful index included in the back.

This is one of those books which will inspire as the player learns! As important eartraining for players of Early Music, Greek modes (ancient &quot;scales&quot; passed down via the Medieval church) are introduced, and how to construct them intervallically. Ensuing pieces are identified by mode, to further assist eartraining. Unmeasured duets provide the framework for each player to practice rhythmic independence, and to really feel the flow of phrases. Other duets are measured, and all of them artistically deep. Literature varies from haunting Troubadour melodies to Renaissance Christmas carols (selections that are refreshingly new to America, while known in Germany and other parts of Europe; arranged by Charles Fischer for two recorders), to the plaintively beautiful rounds of Henry Purcell, to the snakily percussive Tourdion and Rotta, to many other wonderful pieces!
